You tell anecdotes and try to keep it interesting. Most neuroscience books these days tend to be packed with anecdotes that are weird, but on which there is no scientific consensus. The reader is left to his/her own devices on what to make of all the stories. This book is not much different. It starts with an admission that we know next to nothing about sleep - the activity that occupies 1/3
  rd
 of our lives.The author sets off an a quest to discover more about his own sleep conditions and finds that he has fallen into a strange rabbit hole that exists just on the other side the pillow, and which most of are never aware of.Once I started really thinking about sleep for the first time, the questions came in waves. Do men sleep differently than women? Why do we dream? Why is getting children to fall asleep one of the hardest parts of becoming a new parent, and is it this hard for everyone around the world? How come some people snore and others don’t? And what makes my body start sleepwalking, and why can’t I tell it to stop? Asking friends and family about sleep elicited a long string of “I don’t knows,” followed by looks of consternation, like the expressions you see on students who don’t know the answers to a pop quiz. Sleep, the universal element of our lives, was the great unknown. And frankly, that makes no sense.A few take aways:1. The Need for sleep:Most of us will spend a full third of our lives asleep, and yet we don’t have the faintest idea of what it does for our bodies and our brains. Research labs offer surprisingly few answers. Sleep is one of the dirty little secrets of science. We don’t know about sleep, and the book opens with the most obvious question of all—why we, and every other animal, need to sleep in the first place.Here we hear many horror stories of sleep-deprivation: Within the first twenty-four hours of sleep deprivation, the blood pressure starts to increase. Not long afterward, the metabolism levels go haywire, giving a person an uncontrollable craving for carbohydrates. The body temperature drops and the immune system gets weaker. If this goes on for too long, there is a good chance that the mind will turn against itself, making a person experience visions and hear phantom sounds akin to a bad acid trip. At the same time, the ability to make simple decisions or recall obvious facts drops off severely. It is bound to end in severe consequences - including death. It is a bizarre downward spiral that is all the more peculiar because it can be stopped completely, and all of its effects will vanish, simply by sleeping for a couple of hours.2. The Amount of sleep:Humans need roughly one hour of sleep for every two hours they are awake, and the body innately knows when this ratio becomes out of whack. Each hour of missed sleep one night will result in deeper sleep the next, until the body’s sleep debt is wiped clean.3. The Stages of Sleep:Researchers now say that sleep is made up of five distinct stages that the body cycles through over roughly ninety-minute periods. The first is so light that if you wake up from it, you might not realize that you have been sleeping. The second is marked by the appearance of sleep-specific brain waves that last only a few seconds at a time. If you reach this point in the cycle, you will know you have been sleeping when you wake up. This stage marks the last stop before your brain takes a long ride away from consciousness. Stages three and four are considered deep sleep. In three, the brain sends out long, rhythmic bursts called delta waves. Stage four is known as slow-wave sleep for the speed of its accompanying brain waves. The deepest form of sleep, this is the farthest that your brain travels from conscious thought. If you are woken up while in stage four, you will be disoriented, unable to answer basic questions, and want nothing more than to go back to sleep, a condition that researchers call sleep drunkenness. The final stage is REM sleep, so named because of the rapid movements of your eyes dancing against your eyelids. In this type of sleep, the brain is as active as it is when it is awake. This is when most dreams occur.4. The Ideal Pattern of Sleep (that you are not following):Natural light is the way to go. Artificial light messes up your sleep patterns and the body pays for it in the long run. Post-Edison world has come close to banishing the night, but our bodies still live in a world where sun is the only source of light, and have all sorts of troubles processing artificial light induced sleep patters. More and more health problems are being tied to unnatural sleep patterns and Light Pollution.Example: Electric light at night disrupts your circadian clock, the name given to the natural rhythms that the human body developed over time. When you see enough bright light at night, your brain interprets this as sunlight because it doesn’t know any better. The lux scale, a measure of the brightness of light, illustrates this point. One lux is equal to the light from a candle ten feet away. A standard 100-watt lightbulb shines at 190 lux, while the lighting in an average office building is 300 lux. The body’s clock can be reset by any lights stronger than 180 lux, meaning that the hours you spend in your office directly impact your body’s ability to fall asleep later. That’s because your body reacts to bright light the same way it does to sunshine, sending out signals to try to keep itself awake and delay the nightly maintenance of cleanup and rebuilding of cells that it does while you are asleep. Too much artificial light can stop the body from releasing melatonin, a hormone that helps regulate sleep.Poor sleep is just one symptom of an unwound body clock. Circadian rhythms are thought to control as many as 15 percent of our genes. When those genes don’t function as they should because of the by-products of artificial light, the effects are a rogue’s gallery of health disorders. Studies have linked depression, cardiovascular disease, diabetes, obesity, and even cancer to overexposure to light at night. Researchers know this, in part, from studying nurses who have spent years working the graveyard shift. One study of 120,000 nurses found that those who worked night shifts were the most likely to develop breast cancer. Another found that nurses who worked at least three night shifts a month for fifteen years had a 35 percent greater chance of developing colon cancer. The increased disease rates could not be explained as a by-product of working in a hospital.In one of the most intriguing studies, researchers in Israel used satellite photos to chart the level of electric light at night in 147 communities. Then, they placed the satellite photos over maps that showed the distribution of breast cancer cases. Even after controlling for population density, affluence, and other factors that can influence health, there was a significant correlation between exposure to artificial light at night and the number of women who developed the disease. If a woman lived in a place where it was bright enough outside to read a book at midnight, she had a 73 percent higher risk of developing breast cancer than a peer who lived in a neighborhood that remained dark after the sun went down. Researchers think that the increased risk is a result of lower levels of melatonin, which may affect the body’s production of estrogen.There could be more discoveries on the horizon that show detrimental health effects caused by artificial light. Researchers are interested in how lights have made us less connected to the changing of the seasons. “We’ve deseasonalized ourselves,” Wehr, the sleep researcher, said. “We are living in an experiment that is finding out what happens if you expose humans to constant summer day lengths.”5. What Should Be Your Sleep Schedule?In the Canterbury Tales, one of the characters in “The Squire’s Tale” wakes up in the early morning following her “first sleep” and then goes back to bed. A fifteenth-century medical book, meanwhile, advised readers to spend the “first sleep” on the right side and after that to lie on their left. And a scholar in England wrote that the time between the “first sleep” and the “second sleep” was the best time for serious study. Sleep, it seems, wasn’t always the one long block that we consider it today.This natural mode of sleep sounds weird to the post-Edison world of artificial lights and 6 hour sleep cycles. But it was a fact of life that was once as common as eating breakfast.For most of human history, every night, people fell asleep not long after the sun went down and stayed that way until sometime after midnight. This was the “first sleep” that kept popping up in the old tales. Once a person woke up, he or she would stay that way for an hour or so before going back to sleep until morning—the so-called second sleep. The time between the two bouts of sleep was a natural and expected part of the night and, depending on your needs, was spent praying, reading, contemplating your dreams, urinating, or having sex. The last one was perhaps the most popular.Experiments confirm this tendency: Thomas Wehr, who worked for the National Institute of Mental Health in Bethesda, Maryland, was struck by the idea that the ubiquitous artificial light we see every day could have some unknown effect on our sleep habits. On a whim, he deprived subjects of artificial light for up to fourteen hours a day in hopes of re-creating the lighting conditions common to early humans. Without lightbulbs, televisions, or street lamps, the subjects in his study initially did little more at night than sleep. They spent the first few weeks of the experiment like kids in a candy store, making up for all of the lost sleep that had accumulated from staying out late at night or showing up at work early in the morning. After a few weeks, the subjects were better rested than perhaps at any other time in their lives.That was when the experiment took a strange turn. Soon, the subjects began to stir a little after midnight, lie awake in bed for an hour or so, and then fall back asleep again. It was the same sort of segmented sleep that Ekirch found in the historical records. While sequestered from artificial light, subjects were shedding the sleep habits they had formed over a lifetime. It was as if their bodies were exercising a muscle they never knew they had. The experiment revealed the innate wiring in the brain, unearthed only after the body was sheltered from modern life. Not long after Wehr published a paper about the study, Ekirch contacted him and revealed his own research findings.Numerous other studies have shown that splitting sleep into two roughly equal halves is something that our bodies will do if we give them a chance. In places of the world where there isn’t artificial light—and all the things that go with it, like computers, movies, and bad reality TV shows—people still sleep this way. In the mid-1960s, anthropologists studying the Tiv culture in central Nigeria found that group members not only practiced segmented sleep, but also used roughly the same terms of first sleep and second sleep.6. Sleep & PerformanceThe places where most of the cutting edge research happens and great places to understand the importance of sleep is the Military and Sports fields - areas where human excellence, endurance and performance is pushed to the limits. It stands to reason that these fields notice the effects of sleep problems first. Many sports teams no take great trouble to make sure Light is adjusted to natural cycles, athletes get the full quota of sleep, etc. It s only a matter of time before rest of popular culture catches on - just like many health ides, diets, exercises etc.7. Sleep Timings Change with Age: The three basic stages of adulthood—teenage, middle age, old age—have drastically different sleep structures. Teenagers going through puberty find it impossible to fall asleep early and would naturally sleep past ten in the morning if given the choice. Their grandparents often fall asleep early in the night, but then find that they can’t stay that way for more than three or four hours at a time. Middle-aged adults typically fall between the middle of these two extremes, content to fall asleep early when circumstances allow it, yet able to pull an all-nighter when a work project calls for it. These overlapping shifts could be a way to ensure that someone in the family is always awake and keeping watch, or at least close to it. In this ancient system, it makes sense that older adults who are unable to move as fast as the rest of the family are naturally jumpy, never staying in deep sleep for long, simply because they were the most vulnerable to the unknown.The other stage - babyhood is a time with no sleep structure at all. They sleep and wake up independent of the light/circadian rhythms. To the eternal consternation of all parents!So human society is biologically designed to live in different time zones?!Biology’s cruel joke goes something like this: As a teenage body goes through puberty, its circadian rhythm essentially shifts three hours backward. Suddenly, going to bed at nine or ten o’clock at night isn’t just a drag, but close to a biological impossibility. Studies of teenagers around the globe have found that adolescent brains do not start releasing melatonin until around eleven o’clock at night and keep pumping out the hormone well past sunrise. Adults, meanwhile, have little-to-no melatonin in their bodies when they wake up. With all that melatonin surging through their bloodstream, teenagers who are forced to be awake before eight in the morning are often barely alert and want nothing more than to give in to their body’s demands and fall back asleep. Because of the shift in their circadian rhythm, asking a teenager to perform well in a classroom during the early morning is like asking him or her to fly across the country and instantly adjust to the new time zone—and then do the same thing every night, for four years. If professional football players had to do that, they would be lucky to win one game.8. What Sort of Bed Should You Choose?The biggest question—whether a bed should be hard or soft—has a long and confusing history. In 2008, the medical journal Spine seemed to settle the question of firmness. It found that there was little difference in back pain between those who slept on hard mattresses and those who slept on softer ones. How hard a person likes his or her bed is a personal preference and nothing more.In fact, the bed that you find the most comfortable will most likely be the one that you are already sleeping on.9. Forget The Bed - Sleep Hygiene Is What You NeedWhile a comfortable mattress may have little impact when it comes to sleep quality, there are several other aspects of the bedroom that do. Taken together, they form what specialists call sleep hygiene. Most are common sense.- No coffee before bed / in the evening- Nor is drinking alcohol before bedtime a smart move. Alcohol may help speed the onset of sleep, but it begins to take its toll during the second half of the night. As the body breaks down the liquid, the alcohol in the bloodstream often leads to an increase in the number of times a person briefly wakes up. This continues until the blood alcohol level returns to zero, thereby preventing the body from getting a full, deep, restorative sleep.- Developing a few habits with the circadian rhythm in mind will most likely make sleep easier. Adequate exposure to natural light, for instance, will help keep the body’s clock in sync with the day-night cycle and prime the brain to increase the level of melatonin in the bloodstream, which will then bring on sleepiness around ten o’clock each night.- By the same token, bright lights—including the blue-and-white light that comes from a computer monitor or a television screen—can deceive the brain, which registers it as daylight. Lying in bed watching a movie on an iPad may be relaxing, but the constant bright light from the screen can make it more difficult for some people to fall asleep afterward.- Walk around your house and switch off all bright lights half an hour before you sleep, including the TV, the iPad and the laptop.- Recent studies have shown that body temperature also plays an outsized role in getting decent sleep. Takes steps to have a comfortable temperature: Take a cold shower, etc.- Even a small increase in the amount of exercise a person gets leads to measurable improvements in the time that it takes to fall asleep and stay that way. This is particularly true for older adults.10. The Effort Is Worth Your TimeBut, though its effects were subtle, devoting extra time and attention to this most basic of human needs impacted nearly every minute of my day. Because I was improving my sleep, I was improving my life. And all it took was treating sleep with the same respect that I already gave other aspects of my health. Just as I wouldn’t eat a plate of chili-cheese fries every day and expect to continue to fit into my pants, I structured my life around the idea that I couldn’t get only a few hours of sleep and expect to function properly. If there was one thing that I took away from my talks with experts more than any other, it is that getting a good night’s sleep takes work.And that work is worth it. Health, sex, relationships, creativity, memories—all of these things that make us who we are depend on the hours we spend each night with our heads on the pillow. By ignoring something that every animal requires, we are left turning to pills that we may not need, experiencing health problems that could be tamed, and pushing our children into sleep-deprived lives that make the already tough years of adolescence more difficult. And yet sleep continues to be forgotten, overlooked, and postponed. Any step—whether it comes in the form of exercise, therapy, or simply reading a book like this one—that helps us to realize the importance of sleep inevitably pushes us toward a better, stronger, and more creative life.Sleep, in short, makes us the people we want to be. All you have to do is close your eyes.In addition to all the sleep advice, the best part of the book was the full-fledged dissing of poor Freud: Far from being full of hidden symbols, most dreams were remarkably straightforward and predictable. Dream plots were consistent enough that, just by knowing the cast of characters in a dream, scientists could forecast what would happen with surprising accuracy. - “None of Freud’s claims are true by any of our standards today,” Domhoff said, dipping his spoon into his yogurt. “If you look at dreams—if you really look at them like we have—then you see that it’s all there, out in the open. You don’t need any of these symbols.” He went on. “Freudians got all caught up in the idea that there were hidden meanings to our dreams. But their interpretations only worked because we share a system of figurative language and metaphor.” Too Lengthy for your tastes? Would reading such a big review eat into your sleep quota for today?

I wake up early in the morning, then toss and turn trying to go back under. Not getting enough sleep makes me anxious, which again contributes to my insomnia, thus creating a negative feedback loop. (Maybe my weekend drink also contributes to the problem - but I'll never admit that!)I approached this book with the idea that it will enlighten me about sleep. It did – but not in the way I expected.This is a book written by a journalist: intensely readable, terrifically informative and covering a lot of areas – but it’s not your scholarly tome. It will give you a lot of info on the field of sleep research, all fascinating and new, but largely superficial. It’s a fun-to-read primer on sleep, and will give you pointers for further study.
Fun Facts I Learned
1.People did not sleep for one continuous stretch at night in the past. They went to sleep not long after sunset and woke up in the middle of the night for an hour or two: then again went to sleep and slept till dawn. These were called the “first sleep” and “second sleep”. The time in-between was used for reading, praying or having sex (and from all reports, it was awesome – I should have learned this two decades ago, dash it!).2.Sleeping alone will guarantee a better night’s rest than sleeping with your partner (my wife adds: “especially when your partner sounds like a sawmill in operation”).3.There are two schools of thought whether infants should be given a separate bed or whether they should sleep with on their parents’ bed. There are huge cultural differences involved here. (I don’t know what’s good for the kids, but can say from personal experience that children sleeping alone will do wonders for dad’s sleep).4.Forget Freud and Jung. There is no symbolism in dreams – it’s all rather straightforward. (I don’t fully agree.)5.Sleeping on a problem will clear the mind of clutter and allow you to go to the heart of the matter (old hat, that).6.Lack of sleep is one of the reasons many mistakes committed by the military (could be true). Lack of sleep is one of the reasons for invading soldiers misbehaving with the “natives”, especially American GIs in Iraq (a load of bovine excrement).7.There are cases of murder being committed while a person is sleepwalking, and it has proved a valid defense in many cases of homicide (this was totally new for me – and somewhat frightening).8.Teenagers will perform better by going to sleep late at night and waking up late (hopefully, my son won’t read this review!)9.The best cure for insomnia is relaxation, not pills. Don’t think of sleep at all (easier said than done)."
2,0393345866,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5586131-melora,4,"I enjoyed this. It gets a little repetitive, though it's not all that long, but for the most part it kept my interest. Randall decides to research “sleep” after he walks into a wall, hard, during a sleepwalking incident and, after a night in a sleep lab, is told by his doctor,”'I'm going to be honest with you. There's a lot that we know about sleep, but there's a lot we don't know. If the sleepwalking continues, let's try some sedatives. But I don't want you to start taking drugs that you don't need. Try to cut down on your stress and see what happens.'”Unsatisfied with this, Randall says...”If my doctor couldn't tell me more about sleep, I reasoned, then I would go out and search for the solution myself.... So began my adventures in the strange science of sleep. I set out to discover everything I could about a period of time that we can only conceive of as an abstraction, a bodily state that we know about but never really experience because, well, we are asleep. Once I started really thinking about sleep for the first time, the questions came in waves. Do men sleep differently than women? Why do we dream? Why is getting children to fall asleep one of the hardest parts of becoming a new parent, and is it this hard for everyone around the world? How come some people snore and others don't? And what makes my body start sleepwalking, and why can't I tell it to stop?”Randall explores these topics, and others, such as the interplay between science and the legal system when people claim to have been asleep when they committed crimes, and the efforts of coaches and school administrators to improve athletic and academic performances through manipulation of athletes' and students' circadian rhythms. As with many pop- science books, he relies heavily on anecdotes, and I enjoyed the stories. To illustrate the devastating results of sleep deprivation he talks about various military accidents, he gives the story of Jack Nicklaus's golfclub grip “crisis” to show how the mind can solve problems during sleep, and he tells about Colin Sullivan and his sleep mask machine for the treatment of sleep apnea in a chapter on various sorts of sleeping problems. One issue which makes Randall's topic a challenging one is that his doctor was not kidding when he said that much is still not understood about sleep. We know it's really important for mental and physical health. We know that sometimes the mind manages to solve problems during sleep which it couldn't seem to solve while awake. We know that dreams replay bits of memories and create mash-ups which sometimes reflect our current preoccupations. But there's also much we don't know. Not only details of the “whys” and “hows” of the things we do know, but whole areas, such as why many people wake up around 2 a.m. (and Randall goes into how this was, historically, a time when people would wake after their “first sleep” to read or snuggle or whatever for a while before going on to the “second sleep”), why men and women sleep differently, what causes insomnia, etc. So, for instance, while we know that Randall's sleepwalking problem was probably caused by a brain malfunction where the “paralyzing” hormones were not sent out to his arms and legs before REM sleep began, so that he got up and walked around in response to his dream, we don't know how to fix it, beyond sedatives or physical restraint. As the wife of a calm, gentle man who sometimes gets into loud, angry fights in his dreams, I would have loved for science to have made a bit more progress with this one!Another thing, and this is minor, but it did annoy me, is that the editing of the book was quite sloppy. Most annoying were “lay” vs “lie” issues, which occurred throughout. For instance, “As subjects laid on their back with their eyes closed each night...” (p 259) and “early humans were at their most defenseless when they laid down on the ground for several hours in the middle of the night” p 244. “Lay,” for which “laid” is a past form, requires an object. There were some other sorts of errors, but this one, given the subject, with people lying down to sleep, or to try to sleep, on a regular basis, was particularly unfortunate. W.W. Norton is a big enough publisher to do better.Still, an enjoyable look at a subject in which we all have an interest! Randall is an engaging storyteller, and this is an entertaining book. 4 stars."
3,0393345866,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5647191-orsolya,4,"Sleep. It is something that children fight against seemingly viewing it as a punishment; while adults wish they had more of the sweet reward. Just how much do scientists truly know about sleep? Honestly: not much. However, David K. Randall shares some of the unique data surrounding the world of sleep in “Dreamland: Adventures in the Strange Science of Sleep”.“Dreamland” is an instant thought-provoking work as it presents theories and questions surrounding the act of sleeping (for example: we may think that sleep is the result of the body’s need for rest, yet even if you relaxed on a hammock all day; you would still need sleep when the clock struck the late hours). From this introduction on, “Dreamland” moves onto describing various aspects of sleep such as the effects of artificial lights, impact of fatigue on work environments, sleep walking, etc. These subjects are supplemented with research, experiments, and data which are compelling and leave the reader itching for more. However, for those seeking a deeply scientific work; “Dreamland” will not satisfy. Randall’s writing style is aligned with a journalistic approach and would fit more snugly into the LA Times, Reader’s Digest or even Family Circle than with a science periodical. This makes sense as Randall is a senior reporter for Reuters and is a professor of journalism. Don’t let this deter you, though; Randall clearly procures adamant research from interviews and first-hand participation. Thus, “Dreamland” is accessible for the average reader but quite informative, as well. The thesis and “point” Randall tries to make can some times be lost. Although undeniably interesting, each chapter feels like an overview on the topics. Again, much like an article, Randall cuts the text short and doesn’t seem to lead to a main theory except that sleep is strange and scientists don’t know much about it. This results in a slightly chunky feel. For those readers whom enjoy humor mixed in with science, Randall incorporates comedic relief into the pages and also presents some ideas in a mini-social history format. Although interesting, this method pushes the science further back.With “Dreamland”’s progression comes an increase in scientific and “heavier” content elevating Randall’s work and offering the reader more substance. However, also noticeable are several cases of repetition in both content and wording which can be frustrating and breaks the focus. Plus, Randall has the habit of straying onto tangents, although he always (eventually) explains the connection.The ending/conclusion of “Dreamland” was weaker than expected, as it merely wrapped up Randall’s personal thoughts and experiences with sleep, missing what would be a sum-up on the notes mentioned. Also missing are solid reference notes, although the bibliography is extensive. “Dreamland” is exactly what the title states: an exploration of topics, data, and experiments relating to various facets of sleep (athletic performance, military prowess, sleeping pills, sleep apnea, dreams, etc). Although not 100% scientific, “Dreamland” is creative, gripping, and thought-provoking. One will realize that sleep affects more areas of our daily life than we thought. "
4,0393345866,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2569271-mauoijenn,3,I get insomnia a lot. So this book was interesting and insightful. I learned a bit and know understand different sleep disorders. A good book.
5,0393345866,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3498889-cheryl,3,"Written by a journalist, so it's easy to enjoy, with lots of tidbits of interest, but light on the science. No agenda, just a bunch of essays about the subject. The take-aways are two: 1. Far too many ppl are not getting enough sleep, including toddlers, teens, soldiers (who are, after all, often teens themselves), and athletes, and 2. more research is needed into a variety of aspects of sleep, including dreaming, circadian rhythms, parasomnias, etc.3.5 stars and a positive recommendation if you're interested, with the caveat that it really is a light read and probably won't enrich your life very much. Also, the hardcover I read is printed on cheap paper, has only bibliographic notes, and has pictures only as decoration - ideal for an e-reader."

At times, there was interesting information (like the bit about first and second sleep), but too many of the stories felt like repeats. On and on, the author shows how sleep is important. And I wanted to say: Yes, I understand that, but is there anything else you have to say? "
7,0393345866,http://goodreads.com/user/show/8660033-aaron-thibeault,5,"*A full executive summary of this book is now available here: http://newbooksinbrief.com/2012/08/20...We spend up to a third of our lives sleeping, and yet, unless we are not getting enough of it, and/or are experiencing a sleeping disorder of some kind, most of us hardly ever give our sleep a second thought (other than to rue over how much precious time it takes up). Science too largely neglected sleep for the longest time, treating it mainly as a static condition during which the brain was not doing much of anything interesting. However, ever since rapid eye movement (REM) was discovered in the 1950's the science of sleep has really taken off, and the discoveries that have come out of it go to show that this unconscious period is more interesting than we ever could have imagined. It is these discoveries that writer David K. Randall explores in his new book 'Dreamland: Adventures in the Strange Science of Sleep'.The book is split into 13 chapters, with each chapter (outside of the introduction and conclusion) exploring a separate topic in the world of sleep. In the book we learn about such basics as REM sleep and the 5 stage sleep cycle, as well as the benefits of sleep and the harmful effects of sleep deprivation. It turns out that sleep is instrumental in such things as muscle regeneration, long-term memory formation, skills acquisition, problem-solving, emotional control, and creativity. Dreaming, we find, plays an important role in many of these benefits, thus making it seem far less likely that Freud was correct in thinking that dreams are actually a manifestation of subconscious wish fulfillment.We also learn that our natural sleeping pattern is set by our circadian clock, and that many of our routines in the modern world run somewhat against this natural pattern. As it turns out, these routines not only have a negative effect on our sleep, but on our waking lives as well. Fortunately, many organizations are now beginning to take these lessons to heart, and are modifying their policies and practices to help ensure that their members are better-rested, so as to lessen the negative effects of fatigue. For instance, high schools are starting later; businesses are allowing their employees to take naps, and hiring on fatigue management consultants to help eliminate the effects of under-rested employees; sports teams are hiring trainers to ensure that their players are getting enough sleep, and to manage the difficulties of inter time-zone travel; and the military is allowing its soldiers more rest during peace time, and also monitoring and managing sleep during combat.We also learn about the difficulties of, and the controversy surrounding putting your children to bed, and how the practice of co-sleeping (sleeping in the same bad with your infant) is making a come-back. At the same time, the tradition of sleeping in the same bed as your partner is taking a hit, as more and more couples experiment with sleeping in separate beds—and even in separate bedrooms.Last but not least, we learn about sleeping disorders such as sleep apnea (continual waking up due to blockage of the windpipe), and the billion dollar business of treating and controlling this very distressing (and potentially deadly) disorder; sleepwalking, and the bizarre phenomenon of crimes committed while sleepwalking (including child molestation, rape, and even murder)—as well as how the justice system is dealing with these very troubling cases; and also insomnia, and the sordid history of sleeping pills—as well as the latest techniques in fighting sleeplessness, including cognitive behavioral therapy. Fortunately, we also learn that there are several ways to improve our sleep other than with pills or therapy, such as avoiding coffee, alcohol and bright light before bed; getting some regular exercise; turning down the room temperature before bedtime (and/or taking a cool shower); and practicing some breathing techniques to help us fall asleep (one such exercise has you focus on your breathing by thinking 'in' as you inhale, and 'out' as you breathe out).Virtually every chapter contains a treasure trove of fascinating information about the topic in question, and the author lays it all out in a very clear and interesting way. If you are curious about the world of sleep, and what science has to say about it, then you can't go wrong. A full executive summary of this book is available here: http://newbooksinbrief.com/2012/08/20...A podcast discussion of the book is also available."
8,0393345866,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2610234-caren,3,"This was a moderately interesting look at current research into sleep. There were a few things I hadn't read before, such as that the type of mattress you choose doesn't affect the quality of your sleep; you sleep best on the sort of mattress most familiar to you. I had already known that light affects your Circadian rhythm. While it is helpful to be exposed to natural light in the morning, shun blue screen light (TV, laptop, cell phone) at least an hour before bed. In fact, it is best to have soft light in your home in the evening. After 10 pm, melatonin is released in your body, causing your core body temperature to drop, so it is helpful to sleep in a cool (60-66 degrees Fahrenheit) room. Exercise promotes better sleep, but it doesn't have to be strenuous exercise. In fact, it is more important that your body thinks you have had a good workout than that you have run a marathon. The brain is also tricky when it comes to sleeping pills. They may work largely because they inhibit memory formation of any restless sleep; you may think you have slept better than you actually have, and that matters. The length of sleep gained is apparently not remarkable.The author makes the provocative statement that people actually sleep better in separate beds. It is probably best to have a little canoodle, then toddle off to individual sleeping quarters for the best quality sleep. He also explores the sleep disruptions brought by a baby in the family. Should you let the infant cry it out, or is the family bed the answer? We all know that teens prefer to stay up late and sleep in. The world probably functions to the level of people in their prime. At age forty, REM sleep begins to decline. This become noticeable at fifty and is set at age sixty-five. Anthropologists speculate that this was a survival mechanism left from ancient times. When people slept in groups, it was helpful to have someone sleeping lightly or awake, to guard against danger. Older people tend to fall asleep around 9 pm, waking in the wee hours, with less time spent in REM sleep. It makes sense that, as someone ages and slows down, he should sleep lightly in order to be better able to wake up quickly and escape danger.There is also a sort of afternoon slump, at around 2 pm, conducive to napping. Some cultures have a long (usually two hour) lunch break to accommodate this natural rest cycle.The author also looks at the dangers of sleep deprivation. For some professions, such as for soldiers or airline pilots, the issue of sleep is of life and death importance, but has only recently been recognized as such.The author became interested in this topic as a result of his own sleep walking episode. He delves into examples of bizarre sleep walking behavior, such as murder. Is a person responsible for a murder committed while he was asleep? The responses of juries to that question are uneven.My biggest problems with this book were the lack of an index and the quality of the editing/proofreading. Despite the fact that, in his acknowledgements, he credits two editors and a copyeditor, I found some really glaring errors. For example, on page 111: ""Albert Szent-Gyorgyi, a Hungarian scientist who won a Noble Prize in 1937..."" and on page 64: ""But out of the more than thirty thousand studies he found that looked at human sleep, couples, or marriage, only nine breached the topic of sharing a mattress."" These are shortcomings I attribute to the publisher, not the author. "
9,0393345866,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2340176-emily-mishler,4,"I won a copy of this book in a goodreads giveaway.Randall does an excellent job in keeping his book well grounded in research while also keeping in mind that sleep is still a very new and therefore uncertain science. The book is a summary of much of what is currently known and has been theorized about sleep and how it affects the mind and body. A surprisingly engaging read and very easy to understand as Randall writes in a style that accommodates the layman. While a lot of the information is fairly common sense (if one were to actually spend time thinking about a subject like sleep), Randall does bring to light (pardon the pun) a few interesting studies on things like the correlation between artificial light and cancer. Definitely a worthwhile read if you've ever had problems sleeping or just want to know more about that mysterious eight hours when the world spins on while we are oblivious to all that goes on around us."

Unfortunately, I found most of the information dry or stuff I already knew, and what I was really interested in - the brain and dreams - was a small chunk, squeezed next to soldiers and athletes' sleeping patterns. You know, two areas I didn't really give an origami fish about.For someone looking for the sleep basics, this is a great book. Nice research, covers all the bases with good writing (though oddly enough I wish the author had told more personal anecdotes of his time investigating sleep). I just think I was the wrong person for the book."

12,0393345866,http://goodreads.com/user/show/81329414-kyle,4,"Randall searches for the answers to the many questions we have about sleep, but finds that few are answered and almost none are straight-forward. His explorations into the inner workings of sleep labs to a murder committed in a sleepwalking episode left me more intrigued than I've ever been by the third of my life I spend in my bed."
13,0393345866,http://goodreads.com/user/show/716720-zahir,3,"David Randall takes us into the mysterious and fascinating world of sleep. He takes us through a journey that starts with his personal account of waking up after hitting his leg while sleepwalking, into some of the biology that occurs when we go to sleep, and what effect that sleep and rest has on our ability to function. What Randall does exceptionally well is he writes for the layman, and does not lose a non-scientific reader like myself by including too many scientific details or explanations. Instead, this book is a good combination of the science behind sleep, and commentary on how it affects our lives. The strongest part of this book is that Randall gives us a good background into sleep science, as well as the way society views sleep. Some of the history is fascinating.. up until a little over a century ago, normal human sleep was divided into two phases: first sleep occurred when people went to bed around sundown, woke up around midnight or a little later and stayed up for an hour just thinking or doing whatever, then slept again until sunrise. When human beings are removed from artificial lights, we normally resume this type of divided sleep pattern. Randall then takes us into several different areas, talking about what happens in the brain during sleep, what is sleepwalking and other sleeping disorders, and how lack of sleep very seriously affects our ability to function at peak levels. The discussion on sleepwalking, and how people have done very bizarre things in their sleep (including killing people) is fascinating. The discussion on how the law sees people who allegedly commit crimes in their sleep is the most interesting part of the book. His later analysis and commentary on how the profound effects of sleep deprivation is largely overlooked and ignored by society is excellent. Randall then goes into concept of dreaming, and how Freudian theories on the interpretations of dreams has pretty much been debunked. He goes into modern theories of dreams, and how it's our brain's way of sifting through raw data from our senses, and discarding the useless, but then properly storing away the useful stuff. He includes some very interesting research and discussion. The latter parts of the book get a little slow, as he goes into certain types of sleeping disorders, and how scientists came up with treatments for sleep apnea using CPAP machines. Despite the slowdown at the end, the book is a quick and pretty interesting read. "
14,0393345866,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3462671-anne,3," if this book were a college course, its title would be something like Intro to Sleep Science. The author gives a brief overview of the current state of knowledge about various aspects of sleep with references for those who might want to pursue a given topic more in depth. Dreamland contains lots interesting tidbits about the relationship between sleep and SAT scores, sleep and baseball performance, dreams, and, sadly for mattress manufacturers but good for your wallet, the lack of relationship between a fancy mattress and a good night's sleep. It's a fun quick read, although I would not have missed the unsubtle attempts at humor, which really stuck out in the overall flow of the book."
15,0393345866,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6076891-sergey-shishkin,2,"It's a more journalistic coverage than a scientific survey of current sleep research. The book tells curious stories but practicality doesn't go beyond what is already covered in magazine articles numerous times.UPDATE: After trying a few things from the book myself, I'm even more skeptical of its revelations, and would take it with even larger grain of salt.UPDATE 2: Compared to https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/3... and https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/3..., Dreamland is largely ungrounded and occasionally even incorrect interpretation of actual science."
16,0393345866,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5686119-book,4,"Dreamland: Adventures in the Strange Science of Sleep by David K. Randall“Dreamland"" is a fun journey through the little known world of sleep. Senior reporter and adjunct professor of journalism at New York University, David K. Randall relays a series of stories, and recent research that will help readers gain a better understanding and appreciation for the impact of sleep. This interesting popular-science 291-page book includes the following thirteen chapters: 1. I Know What You Did Last Night, 2. Light My Fire, 3. Between the Sheets, 4. And Baby Makes Three, 5. What Dreams May Come, 6. Sleep on It, 7. The Weapon “Z”, 8. Bumps in the Night, 9. Game Time, 10. Breathe Easy, 11. Counting Sheep, 12. Mr. Sandman, and Good Night.Positives:1.	A well-researched and well-written book. A touch of humor, wit and lively research.2.	The fascinating and often overlooked subject of sleep. “Sleep is so important, yet so poorly understood.”3.	The book flows very well. Randall has done a very good job of combining sound research, lively stories and practical information into one interesting and accessible book. 4.	Goes through the five stages of sleep. “The final stage is REM sleep, so named because of the rapid movements of your eyes dancing against your eyelids. In this type of sleep, the brain is as active as it is when it is awake. This is when most dreams occur.”5.	Ancient beliefs in sleep. “The immortal family tree made this clear: Hypnos, the Greek god of sleep, was the twin brother of Thanatos, the god of death, and their mother was the goddess of night.”6.	Book shares many interesting tidbits on sleep. “Maintaining a healthy sleep schedule is now thought of as one of the best forms of preventative medicine.”7.	Explains the differences between sleep today and of our ancestors, and why that is. “Too much artificial light can stop the body from releasing melatonin, a hormone that helps regulate sleep.”8.	Mind-blowing findings. “If a woman lived in a place where it was bright enough outside to read a book at midnight, she had a 73 percent higher risk of developing breast cancer than a peer who lived in a neighborhood that remained dark after the sun went down.”9.	A look at fatigue management. “Work schedules that recognize the importance of sleep and the constraints of the human body can also save lives.”10.	The changing attitudes of sharing a bed with spouse or loved one explored. 11.	Good advice on how to get children to sleep. Different philosophies explored.12.	Investigations into dreams. “Dement’s discovery that the brain is as active during REM sleep as it is when a person is awake transformed sleep research.”13.	Dreaming and its relation to creative thought, is there something to it? “That sleep—especially REM sleep—could be a time when the mind solves a problem makes intuitive sense.”14.	The impact of sleep. “Success depended on practice, plus a night of sleep.” “Companies such as Google, Nike, Procter & Gamble, and Cisco Systems have installed designated napping areas in their offices. The idea is that naps may allow engineers and designers to arrive at creative solutions more quickly than they would by staying awake all day.”15.	My favorite chapter, The Weapon “Z”. “No drug or procedure has been found to replicate and replace the benefits of sleep. It is unlikely that there ever will be. The Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency—the Pentagon division responsible for the invention of the Internet and the stealth bomber—concluded as much in 2007 after many tries.”16.	The fascinating topic of sleepwalking; a look at court cases. “When someone is sleepwalking, the parts of the brain that control movement and spatial awareness are awake, while the parts of the brain responsible for consciousness are still asleep.”17.	An interesting look at the circadian rhythm. “By picking the West Coast team every time, someone would have beaten the point spread 70 percent of the time. For gamblers in Las Vegas, the matchup was as good as found money.”18.	Sleep disorders, sleep apnea. “A 1992 report by the National Commission on Sleep Disorders estimated that sleep apnea was the cause of thirty-eight thousand fatal heart attacks and strokes in the United States each year.” “It was then given the name apnea, from the Greek word for breathless.19.	The truth behind the sleeping industry; pharmaceuticals and mattresses. “At the same time, the temperature of the feet and hands increases as the body gives off heat through its periphery, which explains why some people like to have their feet sticking out of the covers as they fall asleep.”20.	A formal bibliography included.Negatives:1.	Randall acknowledges that sleep science is in its infancy but the book does lack scientific rigor. 2.	Lack of supplementary material. Charts, diagrams would have complemented the narrative.3.	Lack citations a must for any popular science book.4.	I was expecting to learn a lot more than I did. 5.	Some missed opportunities. I would have added a chapter on how different populations sleep in a chart format.  In summary, this is a solid popular-science book on sleep. It’s amazing how little we know on such an important part of our lives. Randall does a commendable job of sharing what we know about sleep through stories that combine the latest in research and a touch of wit. Two main quibbles: lack of citations and lack of scientific rigor. A recommended read.Further recommendations: “The Twenty-Four Hour Mind” by Rosalind Cartwright, “The Secret World of Sleep” by Penelope A. Lewis, “The Secret Life of Sleep” by Kat Duff, “Sleep: A Very Short Introduction” by Steven W.

It’s most winning aspect is the number of routes the author issues to tackle the subject, as well as his own personal interest, his sleepwalking disorder.I felt at times like I was taking a cool if laid back survey class on sleep at a community college somewhere. Not necessarily a fault since we are still learning things about sleep to this day that we didn’t understand well. Since this book is a few years on, newer research may make some aspects of the book outdated. Still a decent introduction to the subject with many useful tips. Although depending on what you want out of your read, your mileage may vary."
22,0393345866,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1917722-chy,3,"Totally an assignment/research book. I needed a refresher on sleep and dreams, on account of a character who meddles with people's dreams. And this turned out to be just what I needed. Though, to be fair, probably a lot of books on the subject, as well as an internet search, could have been just what I needed. It was just there in the library, and I prefer to have my research in my hands rather than at the click of a mouse.This had a lot of cool facts in it, like the case of the guy who allegedly killed his mother-in-law in his sleep---only also for real, while he was sleepwalking. I remember hearing about that, but this had details of the case in it that I either never knew or forgot.That was all interesting, coupled with information on people who have done experiments with sleep and come up with devices for people to chart the stages of their sleep. And the places in history where lack of sleep really mucked things up. But what was really useful to me were the facts of sleep itself---the stages of it and what defined each state.I needed to know more about REM---I got what I needed. I needed to know about other periods of sleep in which people dreamed---I got just what I needed for my dream-meddling character. Which was probably not nearly-at-all, even-kinda what anyone else would want to know. Because I was adding in my own experiences, the experiences from family and friends, and my own theories to it. Based on this, my experiences, and friends' reports, I have what I need because they all comply with the theory I wanted to run with. Which (to be fair) just needed no one to contradict it.I have very little notion of how someone coming at this from another angle would find this. I'm only coming at it from my angle. So I have this to say: If you are a writer who wants to make dreams or meddling with dreams a part of your plot or character's ability, you ought to read this book or one like it. Or at least do an internet search on the subject. I know you don't have to read this book. I know there are others that would do; I read them many years past. I just couldn't remember them. So this was a good refresher course on how sleep works. And on how the dreaming part of sleep ties into that. And how we need dreams.There are a lot of facts in here about the people who have researched the science of sleep (there's actually very little to do with dreaming, specifically, in this book) that's interesting to anyone who sleeps. Heh.And just let me leave you with this quote from the book: ""The more you know about sleep, the more its strangeness unnerves you.""And that's totally true. I am left half afraid I'll strangle my husband in my sleep. Half afraid I might wake up to him strangling me."
23,0393345866,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7147893-tom,4,"I once saw a sleep specialist because I was having trouble falling asleep at night. At one point during the visit I asked him, ""But why is this happening?"" He looked at me and said, and I quote, ""I don't know. Sleep is weird, man.""In Dreamland, David K. Randall sets out to explore just how little we know about sleep and how very weird it is. We don't, for example, know why we sleep in the first place! But we do know that if you don't get sleep eventually it can in fact kill you. So it is pretty important.Randall takes us on a chapter-by-chapter survey of the different facets of sleep, starting with a personal one, his own struggle with doing things during sleep (the author reports that ""in college, I unknowingly entertained my roommates while I was sleeping by sitting up and yelling things like 'Man the barricades, the bacon is coming!'""). Not all of these incidents were entertaining - the author decided to research the book after he nearly broke his leg when he sleepwalked into a wall. Sleepwalking effects a large proportion of the population, men more than women, and oh by the way it is possible both to commit suicide and murder someone while sleepwalking, so sweet dreams. Of course, that's not the only way sleep can be lethal - lack of sleep impairs judgment and greatly increases both the chance of industrial accidents and friendly fire incidents in the military.Did you know that with the advent of the lightbulb we now sleep differently than we once did? It's true. And did you know that studies show that married couples uniformly sleep better alone than together? So why do they insist on cuddling up? Dreams are of course covered. We don't know why we dream anymore than we know why we sleep, but we are pretty sure that Freud was wrong about everything. Also, the infuriatingly difficult sleep cycles of babies are given due consideration, as is the one sleep-related condition we have a working solution for: sleep apnea.Of course you are probably just wondering how to get a good night's sleep, and the Randall returns to this in due course. The truth is, though, that there is no magic bullet. Studies show that even our most powerful sleeping pills increase the amount of sleep we get by mere minutes. Practicing good 'sleep hygiene' remains the most reliable way to sleep better at night, and the author offers some practical tips for doing just that.In short this is an excellent, highly readable book on a very weird and fascinating topic. It may drive you a little crazy as it did me that we don't actually know more about something as fundamental to our lives as sleep! But what we do know you will likely find somewhere between the covers of Dreamland: Adventures in the Strange Science of Sleep."

That's how I used to think about sleeping, which is not thinking about it at all. Back then I'd sleep early or late, wake up whenever I have to without a thought. Then, (ah.. the unavoidable significant moment) I had my life turned upside down. Then I started to notice that sleep ceased to be an enjoyable activity. I'd be lying dead tired but not only I couldn't fall asleep, I also have a suspicion that deep inside I didn't want to sleep. Then started the period of time where I fuss about my sleeping time, I'm constantly anxious about how many sleep hours I had, the dream I had (or hadn't); which is as written in this book the worst thing you can do to improve your sleep quality. When I found out about this book I was excited, finally a book that can explain & verify all sleep trivias I've accumulated. Having read it, I can't say I'm dissapointed. It had most interestings facts about science of sleeping and all those thing you believed to be the ""natural"" sleep. Some I've known before, some I hadn't thought to be more influential to life. I might've expected to find more tips to improve my sleep, but what I did found should help too. First I'll start not to worry too much about sleeping, I'll start monitoring my sleep through that app thingy again since it might boost up my sleep confidence, I'll try to re-condition myself before sleeping, no more bright tablet/laptop screen an hour before sleep, I'll only use my e-ink for before sleep reading. Let's see how it'll improve my sleep. "
25,0393345866,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6507782-meadow,4,"I read this book while in the midst of a severe sleep deprivation time due to a colicky baby who would not sleep more than 2 hours at a time day or night! I was fascinated by anything scientific that might help me understand sleep, and the consequences of lacking it. This book was a great read, as it introduced me to quite a few studies on sleep I had never heard of. From this book I went on to enjoy the true story movie ""Sleepwalk with Me"", and also a few TED talks about sleep. It's fascinating how little we know about this important subject.One of my favorite take-aways from this book was the simple things anyone can do to improve their nightly sleep. Things like creating a quiet space (good-bye smart phone in bed!) and dimming the lights at least 30 minutes before. The scariest information was the potential consequences of medical sleep aids. I had no idea that the popular sleep medicine, Ambien, actually works on our brain's mechanism of memory rather than sleep. In other words, what makes us feel the most tired is our memory of being awake at night, so Ambien dulls those memories. Not exactly what the peaceful sleep commercials led me to believe!I highly recommend this book to people interested in the science of sleep. It also gives an interesting perspective on the history of sleep and sleep studies. Even if you're not normally a reader of science books, the writing style is clear and easy to follow. Enjoy! "

Sure, that tradeoff may give us more hours for the doing, but it also takes quite the toll on our quality of lives. As the author explains:“Health, sex, relationships, creativity, memories—all of these things that make us who we are depend on the hours we spend each night with our heads on the pillow. By ignoring something that every animal requires, we are left turning to pills that we may not need, experiencing health problems that could be tamed, pushing our children into sleep-deprived lives that make the already tough years of adolescence more difficult. And yet sleep continues to be forgotten, overlooked, and postponed, Any step—whether it comes in the form of exercise, therapy, or simply reading a book like this one—that helps us to realize the importance of sleep inevitably pushes us toward a better, stronger, and more creative life...Sleep, in short, makes us the people we want to be. All you have to do is close your eyes.” (p. 266)This book is quite the wake-up call to the importance of sleep. Filled with fascinating—and often surprising—facts about sleep nicely embedded in a dreamy style of writing, _Dreamland_ will keep you wide awake from the first page to the last. But, once you close its covers, your sleep savvy self will know the way towards nights of more restorative and deep sleep.Sweet read...sweet dreams...sweet life!"
27,0393345866,http://goodreads.com/user/show/59725-virginia,4,"I wish there were footnotes instead of endnotes for this book. (Actually, I wish that about all books. Footnotes are awesome.) I felt like this was a good overview of the current research about sleep medicine, but it did not really get into next steps, or future solutions. The writing style was great, though, very easy to read. I wish more people (and by people I mean corporations) took sleeping more seriously. Especially since it can affect so many areas of health. I really hate the macho American culture of competing to see who can get by on the least sleep. The results from the school districts that changed their schedule were fascinating, I don't understand why more wouldn't make the same change to boost test scores, since it is a relatively low cost solution. Ah well. My own body's personal sleep preference is ideally 8-9 hours, from midnight-2am to 8-10 am. Currently, I have to get up between 5-6am, which falls right in a slow wave NREM sleep cycle, which means I wake up every single morning in a state of sleep inertia. This is the number one thing I would immediately change about my life if I won the lottery or became suddenly wealthy, because it makes every morning terrible. This book did not have many solutions for this kind of problem. But I do know more about why it happens, now."

Thank goodness, it was not! I'm not sure what I could have gotten through nearly 300 pages about sleep. David K. Randall's Dreamland: Adventures in the Strange Science of Sleep is, well, about sleep. Specifically, about the biology of why humans sleep, what the levels of sleep are, sleep disorders, and everything else in between.Randall explains the reason for even undertaking this project in the first place: he's a sporadic sleepwalker. He wanted a reason and explanation for why people sleepwalk to begin with. Thus begins his for foray into all things sleep. I really enjoyed reading Dreamland. There was so much that I didn't know about sleep or dreams. There is still so much to be discovered. I liked learning about dreams and how that sleep is an integral part of our learning and healing process. It was interesting to that when we evolved from Homo Erectus to Homo Sapiens and our jawbone decreased, our risk for sleep apnea increased. Also, that sleeping pills are a sleight of hand. Randall wrote everything in a matter of fact way and was humorous. Dreamland is a fast read."

That little bit of what we know as of 2012 is covered in this book. What really makes this book great is that one two punch of science and history-it's a combination I wish all non-fiction had. It does go a bit autobiographical from time to time, but just enough to keep the book interesting. Now, if only I could find something written more recently so I can know what's been discovered about sleep in the last 5 years."

When we have problems on sleeping, like the author, walking, kicking, doing something during the sleeping, he wanted to find out how to solve the problems and turned out to discovery more about the empire business on the ""sleeping pills"". Some pills is fatal if improper usage, some would remove the memories after taking these pills. Therefore certain crimes are committed due to sleep deprivation, or with misuse of sleeping pills.Another aspect is also what i totally agree on. Most people think it's an act of love if a couple could share a bed, but i actually think both could sleep better if they are not even in the same room. Sleeping on the same bed is not a proof of they love or don't love each other. After all, it's very private and person, we don't really connect to the one next to us, so absolute quietness is actually the best. For baby and mother is the same, some insist to have the baby to sleep with the parents, but scientifically proves that if we can let the baby sleep in another room could help both mother's and baby's sleeping quality. To train their independence is also helpful, mother don't need to dash to check out if baby is crying, because baby gets to learn that not all the crying is lasting long for the need of hunger or changing diapers. Postpone the timing of comforting the baby's crying is actually a good training for their independence. 【内容简介】梦，究竟是睡眠的守护神，还是焦虑的放大镜？本书带你探索占据人生三分之一时间的黑夜帝国，深入了解鲜为人知的睡梦世界。和很多人一样，作者大卫•K.兰德尔也是一个睡梦中的“不安分”分子，他会说梦话、唱歌，会大笑、打呼噜，会跳动、踢腿……但直到他开始梦游，并撞上走廊，才想要去研究占据着我们生命近三分之一的黑暗时间。为此，他访问了睡眠研究者、历史学家、人类学家、运动训练人员、企业家、婚姻咨询专家、心理医生、小儿科医生以及睡眠犯罪研究专家，却发现，睡梦中竟然有着大科学。《梦的真相》告诉我们，睡眠并不像看起来那么简单。男人和女人的睡眠有没有什么不同？我们为什么会做梦？而如果你在梦游的时候，碰巧杀了一个人，这算不算谋杀？更有趣的是，斯坦福大学的研究者整理了“周一橄榄球之夜”25年来的比赛记录，竟然发现处于知觉反应高峰的运动员相较于生物钟处于睡眠时间的运动员来说具有某种看不见的优势，所以赌徒们乐坏了，只要把将赌注压在来自西海岸的队伍身上，赢的概率就高达70%，这简直是就地捡钱。《梦的真相》，为我们打开了光怪陆离的睡梦世界，令人不安又着迷，也许从此之后，即使是你的枕头，都能让你另眼相看。当然，它也不是典型的指导书，没有“完善睡眠的10个简单步骤”这类内容，但是读完这本书，你会对入睡时你的身体里发生了什么，以及如果忽视睡眠太久会发生什么，有一个全新的理解。-----------------【编辑推荐】☆梦，究竟是睡眠的守护神，还是焦虑的放大镜？在《梦的真相》中，你将偶遇历史学家、人类学家、企业家、心理医生、睡眠研究专家……他们将带你科学探索占据人生三分之一时间的黑夜帝国梦境的秘密，深入了解透析鲜为人知的睡梦世界。☆《纽约时报》《华尔街日报》《新科学家》《柯克斯书评》评论图书。☆不论有没有睡眠障碍的人，都应该阅读本书，它会让你对入睡时你的身体里发生了什么，以及如果忽视睡眠太久会发生什么，有一个全新的理解。家长、教育者和领导们也许更应该读一读，从而总结出新的工作方法与时间安排。☆挑战弗洛伊德《梦的解析》之“隐藏欲望”论，提出“梦不过是我们每天考虑的所有可能性的糟糕反应”观点弗洛伊德认为睡梦并不是偶然的，而是包含着各种隐藏含义，这些隐藏含义就是做梦者隐秘期望和欲望的投射。而作者通过采访与整理其他睡梦解析专家的研究，用数据证明，大多数梦境都相当直接，更多是反应现实的焦虑。☆重新定义睡眠以及梦的意义A）爱迪生发明的电灯，或许是造成现代人类睡眠障碍的罪魁祸首。B）科学已经证实“长时间的清醒，会让人的创新性与效率大打折扣”，而哪怕短时间小憩也能让人体恢复的观点却常常得不到认可。C）梦还被看作“一种嵌入式夜晚疗法”。在梦中，大脑在休息的同时，还会将新鲜的或恼人的信息同已知信息混合起来，常常有出人意料的结果。那些常常觉得才思枯竭，而一觉醒来却有了很好想法的人，也许对此深有感触。☆唤醒人们对生物钟的重视无论是战场，还是考场，甚至是赌场，生物钟都发挥着难以想象的作用，而这，却并未得到世人重视。☆这本书满足了你的好奇心男人和女人的睡眠有没有什么不同？我们为什么会做梦？为什么哄孩子入睡是让新生儿父母头疼的任务，世界上所有家庭都是这样的吗？是什么让我的身体开始梦游，为什么不能让其停止？而如果你在梦游的时候，碰巧杀了一个人，这算不算谋杀？看完这本书，你的答案也许不是一长串“不知道”。-----------------【名家推荐】关于睡眠的生动概述。——莫琳·科里根（Maureen Corrigan），华盛顿乔治城大学教授，“新鲜空气”（美国公共国家电台栏目）生活中，我们对这个话题十分熟悉， 但就其原理来说我们又十分外行，作者的概述详尽有趣，可以有效地引导我们明白梦境。——阿比盖尔·楚格（Abigail Zuger），医学博士，《纽约时报》就这个话题来说，这本书有趣，且令人着迷。并且据我们所知，目前找不到其他比《梦的真相》更吸引人的指南了。——劳拉•米勒（Laura Miller），纽约沙龙网对于那些一心研究科学探索的人来说，这本书大概会让他们爱不释手。——苏珊娜·卡哈兰（Susannah Cahalan），《纽约邮报》“轻科学”的典范之作，对我们私人和社会生活中有重大影响的人类生物学和行为科学的方方面面都会有重大启发。——卡罗尔·塔夫里斯（Carol Tavris），《华尔街日报》兰德尔的智慧与好奇心成就了他，使他成为人们在探索梦境方面的一个令人欣慰的“引路人”。——《波士顿环球报》作者对一个如此令人着迷的话题展开深入研究，并以一种通俗易懂的方式启发人们去探索梦的真相。——《新科学家》这本神奇的书很可能帮人们解决在睡眠方面存在的所有问题……书中介绍了很多实用的信息，比如在不依赖药物的情况下如何克服失眠，如何做可以在睡眠中不打鼾，如何说服小孩子按时上床睡觉等。还有一点，可能对一些人来说，也是更有用的一点吧，就是如何在专业足球比赛中成功下注：一般周一晚上，人体的生物周期节律更有利于西海岸队的发挥。总之，这是一本让人爱不释手的书（这是一本让人一旦读起来都不舍得睡觉的书）。——《出版者周刊》兰德尔在书中强调了太容易被人们忽视的常识，也就是——睡眠并非无效。相反，在决定人们能否生活幸福的要素中，睡眠质量很可能占据其中三分之一。作者还指出，睡眠不是一个无差别的连续统一体，看似平静的睡眠分为五个阶段，每个阶段约90分钟。总体来说，该书对生活中那些被遗忘、被忽视以及被推迟元素的研究还是很令人满意的。——《科克斯评论》"
50,0393345866,http://goodreads.com/user/show/273287-mycala,3,"I think I was expecting the book to be more about dreams themselves, but it's about sleep and it's interesting. I had no idea that there used to be such a thing as ""first sleep"" and ""second sleep"" during the night before incandescent light bulbs. What a concept! There was another bit about Ambien and how it doesn't really help much with restorative sleep -- in fact, it can make it worse. I know someone who used to take Ambien and observed the escalating that occurred, starting with sleep talking and then sleep walking and doing some things I know this person would never have done when awake. It was really scary. (So yeah, not only did Ambien keep this person from a good night's sleep, it also kept ME from a good night's sleep as well. Bastards.) I felt validated to see that others have had similar experiences, and worse -- someone actually drove while asleep on it.After sharing some stories about what happens when you don't get enough sleep and why taking drugs is probably not the best idea in the long term and the science behind dreaming, there are some helpful pointers on how to get the best out of your time spent unconscious. "
51,0393345866,http://goodreads.com/user/show/8482935-cm,3,"3 1/2 starsThis pop-sci book is actually covering way more than the science of sleep. The history of sleeping pattern, the law on sleepwalking offenses and how parents treat their crying infants are all here along with  simplistic accounts of stages of sleep and sleep deprivation. I am quite a sucker to this ""looking at the same subject from multiple perspectives"" approach and the style is as accessible and enjoyable as a well-written magazine article. Readers will walk away with many tidbits and stories. Anyway, this is definitely on the lighter and uncritical side of things and some editing might be needed. A good read for everyone, just don't expect much practical advice.Bonus points for including the little effect of sleeping pills (approx. 11 minutes more of sleep a night but they might induce antereograde amnesia so you won't remember your bad night) and the questionable marketing tactics of Thomas A. Edison (he paid reporters with the shares of his company) ."
52,0393345866,http://goodreads.com/user/show/19089556-bruce-perry,4,"We're living during an era when anything can be the subject of a book, no matter how narrow the topic (e.g., books only about olive oil or garlic; I wouldn't be surprised if one came out only about eyebrows). This engaging book goes down the rabbit hole about sleep, from the bizarre parasomnias, where people cook, drive, and worse, all while sleeping; to the prosaic, how to get better sleep. Cool off the body before sleep (a cool walk or shower), don't expose yourself to artificial light from screens beforehand, set your mind at ease with breathing techniques. It's your brain keeping you up more than anything else, not a stiff mattress. We learn that it's normal to double sleep (get up, futz around, but go back asleep), especially after middle age, and that married couples can guiltlessly sleep separately to optimize sleep. Circadian rhythms are extremely important to health; don't deny yourself sleep. That's about the max I got out of this book."

When author David Randall sleepwalks into a wall and ends up in the ER, he goes on a mission to understand why we sleep and how often we are frustrated by our inability to get a good night's sleep. He begins with a walk back in time - before Edison invented the light bulb and gave us the ability to be awake 24/7 - and in that look back, he finds that we rarely slept 8 straight hours. In fact, we had a 1st sleep, followed by a period of awakened activity, followed by a 2nd sleep. Whether you're a perfect sleeper, an insomniac or a sleepwalker - Dreamland offers something for everyone. But, most importantly, what you might learn is that sleep is the best healing remedy around. Highly recommend this well written, informative, and occasionally humorous adventure into the strange science of sleep!! "

That set into motion experimenting with time I go to bed, diet, exercise and how that correlated to the quality of my sleep. It brought into focus how much sleep is important. I did not realize it as I never had a problem with it. But the benefits I got as I incrementally improved my sleep quality made me more curious about the science behind it. This book is a good intro to interesting aspects and research on sleep. It made me want to explore the subject of sleep more. It's not a book to help you sleep better. Rather it opens you to looking into your own sleep patterns and start a journey to understand it more. "

More than just physical rest, our brains need sleep to reboot and refresh our processing and decision-making functions.-Even though sleep deprivation can mess us up a whole lot, we can come back from it with more sleep.-While the invention of (safe) artificial light did a lot of good things, it really messed up our sleep and circadian rhythms as a species.-NOBODY should do anything that could endanger lives (drive, hold a gun, treat patients) while sleep deprived.--Sleep-walking is really weird. So is the invention of the CPAP machine.-We can get better sleep, mostly by making it a priority and devoting the time we need to it."

It was the kind of rare nonfiction book that one cannot put down once it has been started, and it explained sleep and sleep disorders in a way that was understandable. It was split up very well, and all of the research was well-done. Also, it gives a large quantity of information, and is full of interesting stories that pertain to the information given. It did not seem overly formal, but instead one gets to know the author. I would definitely recommend this to anyone interested in sleep, caffeine intake impacting sleep and functioning level, and sleep disorders. Overall, it was one of the best nonfiction books I have read."
57,0393345866,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7566073-cathy,4,"An excellent, broad-ranging book about the science and myths of sleep.

80,0393345866,http://goodreads.com/user/show/273287-mycala,3,"I think I was expecting the book to be more about dreams themselves, but it's about sleep and it's interesting. I had no idea that there used to be such a thing as ""first sleep"" and ""second sleep"" during the night before incandescent light bulbs. What a concept! There was another bit about Ambien and how it doesn't really help much with restorative sleep -- in fact, it can make it worse. I know someone who used to take Ambien and observed the escalating that occurred, starting with sleep talking and then sleep walking and doing some things I know this person would never have done when awake. It was really scary. (So yeah, not only did Ambien keep this person from a good night's sleep, it also kept ME from a good night's sleep as well. Bastards.) I felt validated to see that others have had similar experiences, and worse -- someone actually drove while asleep on it.After sharing some stories about what happens when you don't get enough sleep and why taking drugs is probably not the best idea in the long term and the science behind dreaming, there are some helpful pointers on how to get the best out of your time spent unconscious. "
81,0393345866,http://goodreads.com/user/show/8482935-cm,3,"3 1/2 starsThis pop-sci book is actually covering way more than the science of sleep. The history of sleeping pattern, the law on sleepwalking offenses and how parents treat their crying infants are all here along with  simplistic accounts of stages of sleep and sleep deprivation. I am quite a sucker to this ""looking at the same subject from multiple perspectives"" approach and the style is as accessible and enjoyable as a well-written magazine article. Readers will walk away with many tidbits and stories. Anyway, this is definitely on the lighter and uncritical side of things and some editing might be needed. A good read for everyone, just don't expect much practical advice.Bonus points for including the little effect of sleeping pills (approx. 11 minutes more of sleep a night but they might induce antereograde amnesia so you won't remember your bad night) and the questionable marketing tactics of Thomas A. Edison (he paid reporters with the shares of his company) ."
82,0393345866,http://goodreads.com/user/show/19089556-bruce-perry,4,"We're living during an era when anything can be the subject of a book, no matter how narrow the topic (e.g., books only about olive oil or garlic; I wouldn't be surprised if one came out only about eyebrows). This engaging book goes down the rabbit hole about sleep, from the bizarre parasomnias, where people cook, drive, and worse, all while sleeping; to the prosaic, how to get better sleep. Cool off the body before sleep (a cool walk or shower), don't expose yourself to artificial light from screens beforehand, set your mind at ease with breathing techniques. It's your brain keeping you up more than anything else, not a stiff mattress. We learn that it's normal to double sleep (get up, futz around, but go back asleep), especially after middle age, and that married couples can guiltlessly sleep separately to optimize sleep. Circadian rhythms are extremely important to health; don't deny yourself sleep. That's about the max I got out of this book."
83,0393345866,http://goodreads.com/user/show/38577144-joanna,5,"Elusive sleep - we need it to live, to be creative, to solve problems, to recharge and restore our brains, our bodies and our spirits. When author David Randall sleepwalks into a wall and ends up in the ER, he goes on a mission to understand why we sleep and how often we are frustrated by our inability to get a good night's sleep. He begins with a walk back in time - before Edison invented the light bulb and gave us the ability to be awake 24/7 - and in that look back, he finds that we rarely slept 8 straight hours. In fact, we had a 1st sleep, followed by a period of awakened activity, followed by a 2nd sleep. Whether you're a perfect sleeper, an insomniac or a sleepwalker - Dreamland offers something for everyone. But, most importantly, what you might learn is that sleep is the best healing remedy around. Highly recommend this well written, informative, and occasionally humorous adventure into the strange science of sleep!! "
84,0393345866,http://goodreads.com/user/show/560844-pratik,5,"I started experimenting with measuring my sleep when my alarm clock broke and instead of looking for a replacement I found an app that tracked sleep and rang when the sleep was most shallow. That set into motion experimenting with time I go to bed, diet, exercise and how that correlated to the quality of my sleep. It brought into focus how much sleep is important. I did not realize it as I never had a problem with it. But the benefits I got as I incrementally improved my sleep quality made me more curious about the science behind it. This book is a good intro to interesting aspects and research on sleep. It made me want to explore the subject of sleep more. It's not a book to help you sleep better. Rather it opens you to looking into your own sleep patterns and start a journey to understand it more. "
85,0393345866,http://goodreads.com/user/show/93100-libby,4,"This was a really fascinating book about sleep. Here are the main take-aways I got:-We really do need sleep! More than just physical rest, our brains need sleep to reboot and refresh our processing and decision-making functions.-Even though sleep deprivation can mess us up a whole lot, we can come back from it with more sleep.-While the invention of (safe) artificial light did a lot of good things, it really messed up our sleep and circadian rhythms as a species.-NOBODY should do anything that could endanger lives (drive, hold a gun, treat patients) while sleep deprived.--Sleep-walking is really weird. So is the invention of the CPAP machine.-We can get better sleep, mostly by making it a priority and devoting the time we need to it."
86,0393345866,http://goodreads.com/user/show/119792339-dora-oz,5,"I loved this book! It was the kind of rare nonfiction book that one cannot put down once it has been started, and it explained sleep and sleep disorders in a way that was understandable. It was split up very well, and all of the research was well-done. Also, it gives a large quantity of information, and is full of interesting stories that pertain to the information given. It did not seem overly formal, but instead one gets to know the author. I would definitely recommend this to anyone interested in sleep, caffeine intake impacting sleep and functioning level, and sleep disorders. Overall, it was one of the best nonfiction books I have read."
87,0393345866,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7566073-cathy,4,"An excellent, broad-ranging book about the science and myths of sleep. Lots of interesting research and events that tell us why we shouldn't watch TV before going to sleep, that we CAN solve our problems in our dreams, why the military should start to care about the sleep of the men and women who operate those high tech killing machines, and why West Coast football teams usually win when they play an East Coast team in the east. "
88,0393345866,http://goodreads.com/user/show/132395-anne,3,"This created a cohesive whole, but the way he summarized scientific studies left a lot to be desired - leaving out what felt like key information, drawing his own conclusions when the science was unsure. Worth reading if you're interested in the basics of sleep science but hasn't got much more than that."
89,0393345866,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1030319-coral,3,"Sleep: You don't know how much you need it until you're not getting enough of it. In the vein of Mary Roach or Sam Kean, David Randall takes us through several topics related to sleep. None of the areas were researched deeply (or, at least, not in a way that came through in the final text) but were entertaining to read. "
90,0393345866,http://goodreads.com/user/show/13526042-juliej,3,"This a light read for the layman. There are a few interesting facts, but not really many answers to the issues that may have prompted the reader to pick up this book.I understand that is largely because, as the author says, we don't know a lot about sleep. But he has chosen to write a book about it, so I think he could have found a bit more to say.I myself was interested by the question he raised of culpability for a crime committed while sleep-walking, and I actually think he could have spent more time on that subject, but on the whole I felt there was a lot of unnecessary 'padding' in the book and a lot could have been left out without losing anything significant. The examples given to illustrate a point went on too long, and that page-space could have been used more usefully (in my opinion), which meant that sometime I lost interest in what he was saying.Interesting though to read how almost all the money increasingly spent on sleep (mattresses, pills and potions, etc) is a waste of money, but the cost-free habit of napping is one of the most productive methods to improve health and creativity. Perhaps that is why there is not a lot of research done in this area??"
91,0393345866,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3119697-ann,3,"This non-fiction book meanders through the various aspects of sleep and dreaming. It never gets very technical and the author barely skims the surface of this fascinating subject. We hear about how the marital bed may be bad for a good night’s sleep, how babies around the world sleep, how sleep deprivation is responsible for all sorts of bad things, including deaths of American service personnel by friendly fire, about devices develped to monitor one’s sleep etc. None of it is very detailed. Here and there the author treads perilously close to the “association means causation” fallacy. Are good sleepers happier because they sleep more, or do happy people sleep better? Sometimes his eclectic appraoch is a bit strange. For instance, there are many things one could say about Sigmund Freud anno 1901, so why describe him as “the son of a wool merchant with a small medical practice?”There are no illustrations, graphs of other materials, but as mentioned before, the exploration of the topic is simple and superficial enough that none are needed."
92,0393345866,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5483338-heather-pagano,3,"I wanted Randall to say something beyond: sleep is super important. But the message he wanted to give was just that, nothing more, and he said it fairly well. This book was very basic introduction and intended to do little more than develop an appreciation for the role sleep plays in our lives as individuals and in our society. There were some interesting facts and anecdotes, the tone of the book was very personable. The rigor of some of the studies he mentioned seemed a little dubious to me, and I found it a bit frustrating to always stay on the surface of any topic. "
93,0393345866,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1286919-charles,3,"I would rewrite the subtitle as ""fun historical facts about sleep research."" To be fair, ""adventures in the strange science of sleep"" doesn't promise much and the author acknowledges the infancy of the field, but I had hoped for a better understanding of what happens (or fails to happen) as we lay in bed with the lights out. The penultimate chapter delivers some of the goods, however, and I wouldn't say it was an unpleasant read despite the canned 'lets make this fun' tone that pervades so much contemporary nonfiction."
94,0393345866,http://goodreads.com/user/show/9491740-amy,4,"A terrific read. I am not 'a science person' but I learned something on every page. The best thing about this book is that it has already made it easier for me to sleep better, and longer, every day. I would recommend it to anyone with an interest in general health and/or psychology, sleep and relaxation specifically, and of course anyone with a history of sleep problems. It contains a wealth of information, well-documented and clearly presented."
95,0393345866,http://goodreads.com/user/show/826906-laura,3,"A light and entertaining read with some very interesting bits, but overall not quite as in depth as I'd have liked. The author also does not address the topic of infant sleep which would have been a perfect addition. He only barely touches on sleep in different cultures, which is a pity given how much fascinating material this would have provided."
96,0393345866,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1529237-martha,3,"Not the first book I've read about sleeping, and I find it a pretty fascinating subject. This book was an easy read and included a lot of interesting facts about sleep and the brain. It really could have used a good proofreader, though. More errors than a book published by a major publisher should have. (What's with the hyphen in ""several-thousand""? So wrong.) "
97,0393345866,http://goodreads.com/user/show/39727-ang,5,"Who knew reading about sleep could be so enthralling? Such a quick little read, too. I always say, any book that compels you to blurt out facts to the person you live with is a gem, and Sam now knows all about sleep too. This book probably isn't going to help you sleep better, but it will help you understand why you sleep the way you sleep."
98,0393345866,http://goodreads.com/user/show/8687113-constance,4,"Makes me pay attention to what I can do in my life to get a better quality sleep. Pretty important if you want a better quality life in the realms of mood, memory, and health. Also learned a few interesting things about sleepwalkers. "
99,0393345866,http://goodreads.com/user/show/8151813-lukas-lovas,5,"It looks at sleep from many points of view, it summarizes the knowledge we have so far, it is well written, interesting and to the point. I enjoyed this book a lot, and I made several interesting notes to help myself sleep better and get more aout of it. Definitely worth reading :)"
100,0393345866,http://goodreads.com/user/show/24807763-andr-habet,2,"dug learning about sleep, but the prose in this book is very boring. listen to the radiolab episode on sleep instead, which uses a lot of the more interesting ideas from this book in a much more enjoyable form."

Postpone the timing of comforting the baby's crying is actually a good training for their independence. 【内容简介】梦，究竟是睡眠的守护神，还是焦虑的放大镜？本书带你探索占据人生三分之一时间的黑夜帝国，深入了解鲜为人知的睡梦世界。和很多人一样，作者大卫•K.兰德尔也是一个睡梦中的“不安分”分子，他会说梦话、唱歌，会大笑、打呼噜，会跳动、踢腿……但直到他开始梦游，并撞上走廊，才想要去研究占据着我们生命近三分之一的黑暗时间。为此，他访问了睡眠研究者、历史学家、人类学家、运动训练人员、企业家、婚姻咨询专家、心理医生、小儿科医生以及睡眠犯罪研究专家，却发现，睡梦中竟然有着大科学。《梦的真相》告诉我们，睡眠并不像看起来那么简单。男人和女人的睡眠有没有什么不同？我们为什么会做梦？而如果你在梦游的时候，碰巧杀了一个人，这算不算谋杀？更有趣的是，斯坦福大学的研究者整理了“周一橄榄球之夜”25年来的比赛记录，竟然发现处于知觉反应高峰的运动员相较于生物钟处于睡眠时间的运动员来说具有某种看不见的优势，所以赌徒们乐坏了，只要把将赌注压在来自西海岸的队伍身上，赢的概率就高达70%，这简直是就地捡钱。《梦的真相》，为我们打开了光怪陆离的睡梦世界，令人不安又着迷，也许从此之后，即使是你的枕头，都能让你另眼相看。当然，它也不是典型的指导书，没有“完善睡眠的10个简单步骤”这类内容，但是读完这本书，你会对入睡时你的身体里发生了什么，以及如果忽视睡眠太久会发生什么，有一个全新的理解。-----------------【编辑推荐】☆梦，究竟是睡眠的守护神，还是焦虑的放大镜？在《梦的真相》中，你将偶遇历史学家、人类学家、企业家、心理医生、睡眠研究专家……他们将带你科学探索占据人生三分之一时间的黑夜帝国梦境的秘密，深入了解透析鲜为人知的睡梦世界。☆《纽约时报》《华尔街日报》《新科学家》《柯克斯书评》评论图书。☆不论有没有睡眠障碍的人，都应该阅读本书，它会让你对入睡时你的身体里发生了什么，以及如果忽视睡眠太久会发生什么，有一个全新的理解。家长、教育者和领导们也许更应该读一读，从而总结出新的工作方法与时间安排。☆挑战弗洛伊德《梦的解析》之“隐藏欲望”论，提出“梦不过是我们每天考虑的所有可能性的糟糕反应”观点弗洛伊德认为睡梦并不是偶然的，而是包含着各种隐藏含义，这些隐藏含义就是做梦者隐秘期望和欲望的投射。而作者通过采访与整理其他睡梦解析专家的研究，用数据证明，大多数梦境都相当直接，更多是反应现实的焦虑。☆重新定义睡眠以及梦的意义A）爱迪生发明的电灯，或许是造成现代人类睡眠障碍的罪魁祸首。B）科学已经证实“长时间的清醒，会让人的创新性与效率大打折扣”，而哪怕短时间小憩也能让人体恢复的观点却常常得不到认可。C）梦还被看作“一种嵌入式夜晚疗法”。在梦中，大脑在休息的同时，还会将新鲜的或恼人的信息同已知信息混合起来，常常有出人意料的结果。那些常常觉得才思枯竭，而一觉醒来却有了很好想法的人，也许对此深有感触。☆唤醒人们对生物钟的重视无论是战场，还是考场，甚至是赌场，生物钟都发挥着难以想象的作用，而这，却并未得到世人重视。☆这本书满足了你的好奇心男人和女人的睡眠有没有什么不同？我们为什么会做梦？为什么哄孩子入睡是让新生儿父母头疼的任务，世界上所有家庭都是这样的吗？是什么让我的身体开始梦游，为什么不能让其停止？而如果你在梦游的时候，碰巧杀了一个人，这算不算谋杀？看完这本书，你的答案也许不是一长串“不知道”。-----------------【名家推荐】关于睡眠的生动概述。——莫琳·科里根（Maureen Corrigan），华盛顿乔治城大学教授，“新鲜空气”（美国公共国家电台栏目）生活中，我们对这个话题十分熟悉， 但就其原理来说我们又十分外行，作者的概述详尽有趣，可以有效地引导我们明白梦境。——阿比盖尔·楚格（Abigail Zuger），医学博士，《纽约时报》就这个话题来说，这本书有趣，且令人着迷。并且据我们所知，目前找不到其他比《梦的真相》更吸引人的指南了。——劳拉•米勒（Laura Miller），纽约沙龙网对于那些一心研究科学探索的人来说，这本书大概会让他们爱不释手。——苏珊娜·卡哈兰（Susannah Cahalan），《纽约邮报》“轻科学”的典范之作，对我们私人和社会生活中有重大影响的人类生物学和行为科学的方方面面都会有重大启发。——卡罗尔·塔夫里斯（Carol Tavris），《华尔街日报》兰德尔的智慧与好奇心成就了他，使他成为人们在探索梦境方面的一个令人欣慰的“引路人”。——《波士顿环球报》作者对一个如此令人着迷的话题展开深入研究，并以一种通俗易懂的方式启发人们去探索梦的真相。——《新科学家》这本神奇的书很可能帮人们解决在睡眠方面存在的所有问题……书中介绍了很多实用的信息，比如在不依赖药物的情况下如何克服失眠，如何做可以在睡眠中不打鼾，如何说服小孩子按时上床睡觉等。还有一点，可能对一些人来说，也是更有用的一点吧，就是如何在专业足球比赛中成功下注：一般周一晚上，人体的生物周期节律更有利于西海岸队的发挥。总之，这是一本让人爱不释手的书（这是一本让人一旦读起来都不舍得睡觉的书）。——《出版者周刊》兰德尔在书中强调了太容易被人们忽视的常识，也就是——睡眠并非无效。相反，在决定人们能否生活幸福的要素中，睡眠质量很可能占据其中三分之一。作者还指出，睡眠不是一个无差别的连续统一体，看似平静的睡眠分为五个阶段，每个阶段约90分钟。总体来说，该书对生活中那些被遗忘、被忽视以及被推迟元素的研究还是很令人满意的。——《科克斯评论》"
110,0393345866,http://goodreads.com/user/show/273287-mycala,3,"I think I was expecting the book to be more about dreams themselves, but it's about sleep and it's interesting. I had no idea that there used to be such a thing as ""first sleep"" and ""second sleep"" during the night before incandescent light bulbs. What a concept! There was another bit about Ambien and how it doesn't really help much with restorative sleep -- in fact, it can make it worse. I know someone who used to take Ambien and observed the escalating that occurred, starting with sleep talking and then sleep walking and doing some things I know this person would never have done when awake. It was really scary. (So yeah, not only did Ambien keep this person from a good night's sleep, it also kept ME from a good night's sleep as well. Bastards.) I felt validated to see that others have had similar experiences, and worse -- someone actually drove while asleep on it.After sharing some stories about what happens when you don't get enough sleep and why taking drugs is probably not the best idea in the long term and the science behind dreaming, there are some helpful pointers on how to get the best out of your time spent unconscious. "
111,0393345866,http://goodreads.com/user/show/8482935-cm,3,"3 1/2 starsThis pop-sci book is actually covering way more than the science of sleep. The history of sleeping pattern, the law on sleepwalking offenses and how parents treat their crying infants are all here along with  simplistic accounts of stages of sleep and sleep deprivation. I am quite a sucker to this ""looking at the same subject from multiple perspectives"" approach and the style is as accessible and enjoyable as a well-written magazine article. Readers will walk away with many tidbits and stories. Anyway, this is definitely on the lighter and uncritical side of things and some editing might be needed. A good read for everyone, just don't expect much practical advice.Bonus points for including the little effect of sleeping pills (approx. 11 minutes more of sleep a night but they might induce antereograde amnesia so you won't remember your bad night) and the questionable marketing tactics of Thomas A. Edison (he paid reporters with the shares of his company) ."
112,0393345866,http://goodreads.com/user/show/19089556-bruce-perry,4,"We're living during an era when anything can be the subject of a book, no matter how narrow the topic (e.g., books only about olive oil or garlic; I wouldn't be surprised if one came out only about eyebrows). This engaging book goes down the rabbit hole about sleep, from the bizarre parasomnias, where people cook, drive, and worse, all while sleeping; to the prosaic, how to get better sleep. Cool off the body before sleep (a cool walk or shower), don't expose yourself to artificial light from screens beforehand, set your mind at ease with breathing techniques. It's your brain keeping you up more than anything else, not a stiff mattress. We learn that it's normal to double sleep (get up, futz around, but go back asleep), especially after middle age, and that married couples can guiltlessly sleep separately to optimize sleep. Circadian rhythms are extremely important to health; don't deny yourself sleep. That's about the max I got out of this book."
113,0393345866,http://goodreads.com/user/show/38577144-joanna,5,"Elusive sleep - we need it to live, to be creative, to solve problems, to recharge and restore our brains, our bodies and our spirits. When author David Randall sleepwalks into a wall and ends up in the ER, he goes on a mission to understand why we sleep and how often we are frustrated by our inability to get a good night's sleep. He begins with a walk back in time - before Edison invented the light bulb and gave us the ability to be awake 24/7 - and in that look back, he finds that we rarely slept 8 straight hours. In fact, we had a 1st sleep, followed by a period of awakened activity, followed by a 2nd sleep. Whether you're a perfect sleeper, an insomniac or a sleepwalker - Dreamland offers something for everyone. But, most importantly, what you might learn is that sleep is the best healing remedy around. Highly recommend this well written, informative, and occasionally humorous adventure into the strange science of sleep!! "
114,0393345866,http://goodreads.com/user/show/560844-pratik,5,"I started experimenting with measuring my sleep when my alarm clock broke and instead of looking for a replacement I found an app that tracked sleep and rang when the sleep was most shallow. That set into motion experimenting with time I go to bed, diet, exercise and how that correlated to the quality of my sleep. It brought into focus how much sleep is important. I did not realize it as I never had a problem with it. But the benefits I got as I incrementally improved my sleep quality made me more curious about the science behind it. This book is a good intro to interesting aspects and research on sleep. It made me want to explore the subject of sleep more. It's not a book to help you sleep better. Rather it opens you to looking into your own sleep patterns and start a journey to understand it more. "
115,0393345866,http://goodreads.com/user/show/93100-libby,4,"This was a really fascinating book about sleep. Here are the main take-aways I got:-We really do need sleep! More than just physical rest, our brains need sleep to reboot and refresh our processing and decision-making functions.-Even though sleep deprivation can mess us up a whole lot, we can come back from it with more sleep.-While the invention of (safe) artificial light did a lot of good things, it really messed up our sleep and circadian rhythms as a species.-NOBODY should do anything that could endanger lives (drive, hold a gun, treat patients) while sleep deprived.--Sleep-walking is really weird. So is the invention of the CPAP machine.-We can get better sleep, mostly by making it a priority and devoting the time we need to it."
116,0393345866,http://goodreads.com/user/show/119792339-dora-oz,5,"I loved this book! It was the kind of rare nonfiction book that one cannot put down once it has been started, and it explained sleep and sleep disorders in a way that was understandable. It was split up very well, and all of the research was well-done. Also, it gives a large quantity of information, and is full of interesting stories that pertain to the information given. It did not seem overly formal, but instead one gets to know the author. I would definitely recommend this to anyone interested in sleep, caffeine intake impacting sleep and functioning level, and sleep disorders. Overall, it was one of the best nonfiction books I have read."
117,0393345866,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7566073-cathy,4,"An excellent, broad-ranging book about the science and myths of sleep. Lots of interesting research and events that tell us why we shouldn't watch TV before going to sleep, that we CAN solve our problems in our dreams, why the military should start to care about the sleep of the men and women who operate those high tech killing machines, and why West Coast football teams usually win when they play an East Coast team in the east. "
118,0393345866,http://goodreads.com/user/show/132395-anne,3,"This created a cohesive whole, but the way he summarized scientific studies left a lot to be desired - leaving out what felt like key information, drawing his own conclusions when the science was unsure. Worth reading if you're interested in the basics of sleep science but hasn't got much more than that."
119,0393345866,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1030319-coral,3,"Sleep: You don't know how much you need it until you're not getting enough of it. In the vein of Mary Roach or Sam Kean, David Randall takes us through several topics related to sleep. None of the areas were researched deeply (or, at least, not in a way that came through in the final text) but were entertaining to read. "
120,0393345866,http://goodreads.com/user/show/13526042-juliej,3,"This a light read for the layman. There are a few interesting facts, but not really many answers to the issues that may have prompted the reader to pick up this book.I understand that is largely because, as the author says, we don't know a lot about sleep. But he has chosen to write a book about it, so I think he could have found a bit more to say.I myself was interested by the question he raised of culpability for a crime committed while sleep-walking, and I actually think he could have spent more time on that subject, but on the whole I felt there was a lot of unnecessary 'padding' in the book and a lot could have been left out without losing anything significant. The examples given to illustrate a point went on too long, and that page-space could have been used more usefully (in my opinion), which meant that sometime I lost interest in what he was saying.Interesting though to read how almost all the money increasingly spent on sleep (mattresses, pills and potions, etc) is a waste of money, but the cost-free habit of napping is one of the most productive methods to improve health and creativity. Perhaps that is why there is not a lot of research done in this area??"
121,0393345866,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3119697-ann,3,"This non-fiction book meanders through the various aspects of sleep and dreaming. It never gets very technical and the author barely skims the surface of this fascinating subject. We hear about how the marital bed may be bad for a good night’s sleep, how babies around the world sleep, how sleep deprivation is responsible for all sorts of bad things, including deaths of American service personnel by friendly fire, about devices develped to monitor one’s sleep etc. None of it is very detailed. Here and there the author treads perilously close to the “association means causation” fallacy. Are good sleepers happier because they sleep more, or do happy people sleep better? Sometimes his eclectic appraoch is a bit strange. For instance, there are many things one could say about Sigmund Freud anno 1901, so why describe him as “the son of a wool merchant with a small medical practice?”There are no illustrations, graphs of other materials, but as mentioned before, the exploration of the topic is simple and superficial enough that none are needed."
122,0393345866,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5483338-heather-pagano,3,"I wanted Randall to say something beyond: sleep is super important. But the message he wanted to give was just that, nothing more, and he said it fairly well. This book was very basic introduction and intended to do little more than develop an appreciation for the role sleep plays in our lives as individuals and in our society. There were some interesting facts and anecdotes, the tone of the book was very personable. The rigor of some of the studies he mentioned seemed a little dubious to me, and I found it a bit frustrating to always stay on the surface of any topic. "
123,0393345866,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1286919-charles,3,"I would rewrite the subtitle as ""fun historical facts about sleep research."" To be fair, ""adventures in the strange science of sleep"" doesn't promise much and the author acknowledges the infancy of the field, but I had hoped for a better understanding of what happens (or fails to happen) as we lay in bed with the lights out. The penultimate chapter delivers some of the goods, however, and I wouldn't say it was an unpleasant read despite the canned 'lets make this fun' tone that pervades so much contemporary nonfiction."
124,0393345866,http://goodreads.com/user/show/9491740-amy,4,"A terrific read. I am not 'a science person' but I learned something on every page. The best thing about this book is that it has already made it easier for me to sleep better, and longer, every day. I would recommend it to anyone with an interest in general health and/or psychology, sleep and relaxation specifically, and of course anyone with a history of sleep problems. It contains a wealth of information, well-documented and clearly presented."
125,0393345866,http://goodreads.com/user/show/826906-laura,3,"A light and entertaining read with some very interesting bits, but overall not quite as in depth as I'd have liked. The author also does not address the topic of infant sleep which would have been a perfect addition. He only barely touches on sleep in different cultures, which is a pity given how much fascinating material this would have provided."
126,0393345866,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1529237-martha,3,"Not the first book I've read about sleeping, and I find it a pretty fascinating subject. This book was an easy read and included a lot of interesting facts about sleep and the brain. It really could have used a good proofreader, though. More errors than a book published by a major publisher should have. (What's with the hyphen in ""several-thousand""? So wrong.) "
127,0393345866,http://goodreads.com/user/show/39727-ang,5,"Who knew reading about sleep could be so enthralling? Such a quick little read, too. I always say, any book that compels you to blurt out facts to the person you live with is a gem, and Sam now knows all about sleep too. This book probably isn't going to help you sleep better, but it will help you understand why you sleep the way you sleep."
128,0393345866,http://goodreads.com/user/show/8687113-constance,4,"Makes me pay attention to what I can do in my life to get a better quality sleep. Pretty important if you want a better quality life in the realms of mood, memory, and health. Also learned a few interesting things about sleepwalkers. "
129,0393345866,http://goodreads.com/user/show/8151813-lukas-lovas,5,"It looks at sleep from many points of view, it summarizes the knowledge we have so far, it is well written, interesting and to the point. I enjoyed this book a lot, and I made several interesting notes to help myself sleep better and get more aout of it. Definitely worth reading :)"
130,0393345866,http://goodreads.com/user/show/24807763-andr-habet,2,"dug learning about sleep, but the prose in this book is very boring. listen to the radiolab episode on sleep instead, which uses a lot of the more interesting ideas from this book in a much more enjoyable form."
131,0393345866,http://goodreads.com/user/show/53137557-lady-renee,3,"Randall's journalism background was evident in this piece. I appreciated all the research studies cited as well as the different approaches from a spectrum of careers and ways of life.

When we have problems on sleeping, like the author, walking, kicking, doing something during the sleeping, he wanted to find out how to solve the problems and turned out to discovery more about the empire business on the ""sleeping pills"". Some pills is fatal if improper usage, some would remove the memories after taking these pills. Therefore certain crimes are committed due to sleep deprivation, or with misuse of sleeping pills.Another aspect is also what i totally agree on. Most people think it's an act of love if a couple could share a bed, but i actually think both could sleep better if they are not even in the same room. Sleeping on the same bed is not a proof of they love or don't love each other. After all, it's very private and person, we don't really connect to the one next to us, so absolute quietness is actually the best. For baby and mother is the same, some insist to have the baby to sleep with the parents, but scientifically proves that if we can let the baby sleep in another room could help both mother's and baby's sleeping quality.

There are a few interesting facts, but not really many answers to the issues that may have prompted the reader to pick up this book.I understand that is largely because, as the author says, we don't know a lot about sleep. But he has chosen to write a book about it, so I think he could have found a bit more to say.I myself was interested by the question he raised of culpability for a crime committed while sleep-walking, and I actually think he could have spent more time on that subject, but on the whole I felt there was a lot of unnecessary 'padding' in the book and a lot could have been left out without losing anything significant. The examples given to illustrate a point went on too long, and that page-space could have been used more usefully (in my opinion), which meant that sometime I lost interest in what he was saying.Interesting though to read how almost all the money increasingly spent on sleep (mattresses, pills and potions, etc) is a waste of money, but the cost-free habit of napping is one of the most productive methods to improve health and creativity. Perhaps that is why there is not a lot of research done in this area??"
151,0393345866,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3119697-ann,3,"This non-fiction book meanders through the various aspects of sleep and dreaming. It never gets very technical and the author barely skims the surface of this fascinating subject. We hear about how the marital bed may be bad for a good night’s sleep, how babies around the world sleep, how sleep deprivation is responsible for all sorts of bad things, including deaths of American service personnel by friendly fire, about devices develped to monitor one’s sleep etc. None of it is very detailed. Here and there the author treads perilously close to the “association means causation” fallacy. Are good sleepers happier because they sleep more, or do happy people sleep better? Sometimes his eclectic appraoch is a bit strange. For instance, there are many things one could say about Sigmund Freud anno 1901, so why describe him as “the son of a wool merchant with a small medical practice?”There are no illustrations, graphs of other materials, but as mentioned before, the exploration of the topic is simple and superficial enough that none are needed."

But the message he wanted to give was just that, nothing more, and he said it fairly well. This book was very basic introduction and intended to do little more than develop an appreciation for the role sleep plays in our lives as individuals and in our society. There were some interesting facts and anecdotes, the tone of the book was very personable. The rigor of some of the studies he mentioned seemed a little dubious to me, and I found it a bit frustrating to always stay on the surface of any topic. "
153,0393345866,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1286919-charles,3,"I would rewrite the subtitle as ""fun historical facts about sleep research."" To be fair, ""adventures in the strange science of sleep"" doesn't promise much and the author acknowledges the infancy of the field, but I had hoped for a better understanding of what happens (or fails to happen) as we lay in bed with the lights out. The penultimate chapter delivers some of the goods, however, and I wouldn't say it was an unpleasant read despite the canned 'lets make this fun' tone that pervades so much contemporary nonfiction."

When we have problems on sleeping, like the author, walking, kicking, doing something during the sleeping, he wanted to find out how to solve the problems and turned out to discovery more about the empire business on the ""sleeping pills"". Some pills is fatal if improper usage, some would remove the memories after taking these pills. Therefore certain crimes are committed due to sleep deprivation, or with misuse of sleeping pills.Another aspect is also what i totally agree on. Most people think it's an act of love if a couple could share a bed, but i actually think both could sleep better if they are not even in the same room. Sleeping on the same bed is not a proof of they love or don't love each other. After all, it's very private and person, we don't really connect to the one next to us, so absolute quietness is actually the best. For baby and mother is the same, some insist to have the baby to sleep with the parents, but scientifically proves that if we can let the baby sleep in another room could help both mother's and baby's sleeping quality. To train their independence is also helpful, mother don't need to dash to check out if baby is crying, because baby gets to learn that not all the crying is lasting long for the need of hunger or changing diapers. Postpone the timing of comforting the baby's crying is actually a good training for their independence. 【内容简介】梦，究竟是睡眠的守护神，还是焦虑的放大镜？本书带你探索占据人生三分之一时间的黑夜帝国，深入了解鲜为人知的睡梦世界。和很多人一样，作者大卫•K.兰德尔也是一个睡梦中的“不安分”分子，他会说梦话、唱歌，会大笑、打呼噜，会跳动、踢腿……但直到他开始梦游，并撞上走廊，才想要去研究占据着我们生命近三分之一的黑暗时间。为此，他访问了睡眠研究者、历史学家、人类学家、运动训练人员、企业家、婚姻咨询专家、心理医生、小儿科医生以及睡眠犯罪研究专家，却发现，睡梦中竟然有着大科学。《梦的真相》告诉我们，睡眠并不像看起来那么简单。男人和女人的睡眠有没有什么不同？我们为什么会做梦？而如果你在梦游的时候，碰巧杀了一个人，这算不算谋杀？更有趣的是，斯坦福大学的研究者整理了“周一橄榄球之夜”25年来的比赛记录，竟然发现处于知觉反应高峰的运动员相较于生物钟处于睡眠时间的运动员来说具有某种看不见的优势，所以赌徒们乐坏了，只要把将赌注压在来自西海岸的队伍身上，赢的概率就高达70%，这简直是就地捡钱。《梦的真相》，为我们打开了光怪陆离的睡梦世界，令人不安又着迷，也许从此之后，即使是你的枕头，都能让你另眼相看。当然，它也不是典型的指导书，没有“完善睡眠的10个简单步骤”这类内容，但是读完这本书，你会对入睡时你的身体里发生了什么，以及如果忽视睡眠太久会发生什么，有一个全新的理解。-----------------【编辑推荐】☆梦，究竟是睡眠的守护神，还是焦虑的放大镜？在《梦的真相》中，你将偶遇历史学家、人类学家、企业家、心理医生、睡眠研究专家……他们将带你科学探索占据人生三分之一时间的黑夜帝国梦境的秘密，深入了解透析鲜为人知的睡梦世界。☆《纽约时报》《华尔街日报》《新科学家》《柯克斯书评》评论图书。☆不论有没有睡眠障碍的人，都应该阅读本书，它会让你对入睡时你的身体里发生了什么，以及如果忽视睡眠太久会发生什么，有一个全新的理解。家长、教育者和领导们也许更应该读一读，从而总结出新的工作方法与时间安排。☆挑战弗洛伊德《梦的解析》之“隐藏欲望”论，提出“梦不过是我们每天考虑的所有可能性的糟糕反应”观点弗洛伊德认为睡梦并不是偶然的，而是包含着各种隐藏含义，这些隐藏含义就是做梦者隐秘期望和欲望的投射。而作者通过采访与整理其他睡梦解析专家的研究，用数据证明，大多数梦境都相当直接，更多是反应现实的焦虑。☆重新定义睡眠以及梦的意义A）爱迪生发明的电灯，或许是造成现代人类睡眠障碍的罪魁祸首。B）科学已经证实“长时间的清醒，会让人的创新性与效率大打折扣”，而哪怕短时间小憩也能让人体恢复的观点却常常得不到认可。C）梦还被看作“一种嵌入式夜晚疗法”。在梦中，大脑在休息的同时，还会将新鲜的或恼人的信息同已知信息混合起来，常常有出人意料的结果。那些常常觉得才思枯竭，而一觉醒来却有了很好想法的人，也许对此深有感触。☆唤醒人们对生物钟的重视无论是战场，还是考场，甚至是赌场，生物钟都发挥着难以想象的作用，而这，却并未得到世人重视。☆这本书满足了你的好奇心男人和女人的睡眠有没有什么不同？我们为什么会做梦？为什么哄孩子入睡是让新生儿父母头疼的任务，世界上所有家庭都是这样的吗？是什么让我的身体开始梦游，为什么不能让其停止？而如果你在梦游的时候，碰巧杀了一个人，这算不算谋杀？看完这本书，你的答案也许不是一长串“不知道”。-----------------【名家推荐】关于睡眠的生动概述。——莫琳·科里根（Maureen Corrigan），华盛顿乔治城大学教授，“新鲜空气”（美国公共国家电台栏目）生活中，我们对这个话题十分熟悉， 但就其原理来说我们又十分外行，作者的概述详尽有趣，可以有效地引导我们明白梦境。——阿比盖尔·楚格（Abigail Zuger），医学博士，《纽约时报》就这个话题来说，这本书有趣，且令人着迷。并且据我们所知，目前找不到其他比《梦的真相》更吸引人的指南了。——劳拉•米勒（Laura Miller），纽约沙龙网对于那些一心研究科学探索的人来说，这本书大概会让他们爱不释手。——苏珊娜·卡哈兰（Susannah Cahalan），《纽约邮报》“轻科学”的典范之作，对我们私人和社会生活中有重大影响的人类生物学和行为科学的方方面面都会有重大启发。——卡罗尔·塔夫里斯（Carol Tavris），《华尔街日报》兰德尔的智慧与好奇心成就了他，使他成为人们在探索梦境方面的一个令人欣慰的“引路人”。——《波士顿环球报》作者对一个如此令人着迷的话题展开深入研究，并以一种通俗易懂的方式启发人们去探索梦的真相。——《新科学家》这本神奇的书很可能帮人们解决在睡眠方面存在的所有问题……书中介绍了很多实用的信息，比如在不依赖药物的情况下如何克服失眠，如何做可以在睡眠中不打鼾，如何说服小孩子按时上床睡觉等。还有一点，可能对一些人来说，也是更有用的一点吧，就是如何在专业足球比赛中成功下注：一般周一晚上，人体的生物周期节律更有利于西海岸队的发挥。总之，这是一本让人爱不释手的书（这是一本让人一旦读起来都不舍得睡觉的书）。——《出版者周刊》兰德尔在书中强调了太容易被人们忽视的常识，也就是——睡眠并非无效。相反，在决定人们能否生活幸福的要素中，睡眠质量很可能占据其中三分之一。作者还指出，睡眠不是一个无差别的连续统一体，看似平静的睡眠分为五个阶段，每个阶段约90分钟。总体来说，该书对生活中那些被遗忘、被忽视以及被推迟元素的研究还是很令人满意的。——《科克斯评论》"

I had no idea that there used to be such a thing as ""first sleep"" and ""second sleep"" during the night before incandescent light bulbs. What a concept! There was another bit about Ambien and how it doesn't really help much with restorative sleep -- in fact, it can make it worse. I know someone who used to take Ambien and observed the escalating that occurred, starting with sleep talking and then sleep walking and doing some things I know this person would never have done when awake. It was really scary. (So yeah, not only did Ambien keep this person from a good night's sleep, it also kept ME from a good night's sleep as well. Bastards.) I felt validated to see that others have had similar experiences, and worse -- someone actually drove while asleep on it.After sharing some stories about what happens when you don't get enough sleep and why taking drugs is probably not the best idea in the long term and the science behind dreaming, there are some helpful pointers on how to get the best out of your time spent unconscious.

When we have problems on sleeping, like the author, walking, kicking, doing something during the sleeping, he wanted to find out how to solve the problems and turned out to discovery more about the empire business on the ""sleeping pills"". Some pills is fatal if improper usage, some would remove the memories after taking these pills. Therefore certain crimes are committed due to sleep deprivation, or with misuse of sleeping pills.Another aspect is also what i totally agree on. Most people think it's an act of love if a couple could share a bed, but i actually think both could sleep better if they are not even in the same room. Sleeping on the same bed is not a proof of they love or don't love each other. After all, it's very private and person, we don't really connect to the one next to us, so absolute quietness is actually the best. For baby and mother is the same, some insist to have the baby to sleep with the parents, but scientifically proves that if we can let the baby sleep in another room could help both mother's and baby's sleeping quality. To train their independence is also helpful, mother don't need to dash to check out if baby is crying, because baby gets to learn that not all the crying is lasting long for the need of hunger or changing diapers. Postpone the timing of comforting the baby's crying is actually a good training for their independence. 【内容简介】梦，究竟是睡眠的守护神，还是焦虑的放大镜？本书带你探索占据人生三分之一时间的黑夜帝国，深入了解鲜为人知的睡梦世界。和很多人一样，作者大卫•K.兰德尔也是一个睡梦中的“不安分”分子，他会说梦话、唱歌，会大笑、打呼噜，会跳动、踢腿……但直到他开始梦游，并撞上走廊，才想要去研究占据着我们生命近三分之一的黑暗时间。为此，他访问了睡眠研究者、历史学家、人类学家、运动训练人员、企业家、婚姻咨询专家、心理医生、小儿科医生以及睡眠犯罪研究专家，却发现，睡梦中竟然有着大科学。《梦的真相》告诉我们，睡眠并不像看起来那么简单。男人和女人的睡眠有没有什么不同？我们为什么会做梦？而如果你在梦游的时候，碰巧杀了一个人，这算不算谋杀？更有趣的是，斯坦福大学的研究者整理了“周一橄榄球之夜”25年来的比赛记录，竟然发现处于知觉反应高峰的运动员相较于生物钟处于睡眠时间的运动员来说具有某种看不见的优势，所以赌徒们乐坏了，只要把将赌注压在来自西海岸的队伍身上，赢的概率就高达70%，这简直是就地捡钱。《梦的真相》，为我们打开了光怪陆离的睡梦世界，令人不安又着迷，也许从此之后，即使是你的枕头，都能让你另眼相看。当然，它也不是典型的指导书，没有“完善睡眠的10个简单步骤”这类内容，但是读完这本书，你会对入睡时你的身体里发生了什么，以及如果忽视睡眠太久会发生什么，有一个全新的理解。-----------------【编辑推荐】☆梦，究竟是睡眠的守护神，还是焦虑的放大镜？在《梦的真相》中，你将偶遇历史学家、人类学家、企业家、心理医生、睡眠研究专家……他们将带你科学探索占据人生三分之一时间的黑夜帝国梦境的秘密，深入了解透析鲜为人知的睡梦世界。☆《纽约时报》《华尔街日报》《新科学家》《柯克斯书评》评论图书。☆不论有没有睡眠障碍的人，都应该阅读本书，它会让你对入睡时你的身体里发生了什么，以及如果忽视睡眠太久会发生什么，有一个全新的理解。家长、教育者和领导们也许更应该读一读，从而总结出新的工作方法与时间安排。☆挑战弗洛伊德《梦的解析》之“隐藏欲望”论，提出“梦不过是我们每天考虑的所有可能性的糟糕反应”观点弗洛伊德认为睡梦并不是偶然的，而是包含着各种隐藏含义，这些隐藏含义就是做梦者隐秘期望和欲望的投射。而作者通过采访与整理其他睡梦解析专家的研究，用数据证明，大多数梦境都相当直接，更多是反应现实的焦虑。☆重新定义睡眠以及梦的意义A）爱迪生发明的电灯，或许是造成现代人类睡眠障碍的罪魁祸首。B）科学已经证实“长时间的清醒，会让人的创新性与效率大打折扣”，而哪怕短时间小憩也能让人体恢复的观点却常常得不到认可。C）梦还被看作“一种嵌入式夜晚疗法”。在梦中，大脑在休息的同时，还会将新鲜的或恼人的信息同已知信息混合起来，常常有出人意料的结果。那些常常觉得才思枯竭，而一觉醒来却有了很好想法的人，也许对此深有感触。☆唤醒人们对生物钟的重视无论是战场，还是考场，甚至是赌场，生物钟都发挥着难以想象的作用，而这，却并未得到世人重视。☆这本书满足了你的好奇心男人和女人的睡眠有没有什么不同？我们为什么会做梦？为什么哄孩子入睡是让新生儿父母头疼的任务，世界上所有家庭都是这样的吗？是什么让我的身体开始梦游，为什么不能让其停止？而如果你在梦游的时候，碰巧杀了一个人，这算不算谋杀？看完这本书，你的答案也许不是一长串“不知道”。-----------------【名家推荐】关于睡眠的生动概述。——莫琳·科里根（Maureen Corrigan），华盛顿乔治城大学教授，“新鲜空气”（美国公共国家电台栏目）生活中，我们对这个话题十分熟悉， 但就其原理来说我们又十分外行，作者的概述详尽有趣，可以有效地引导我们明白梦境。——阿比盖尔·楚格（Abigail Zuger），医学博士，《纽约时报》就这个话题来说，这本书有趣，且令人着迷。并且据我们所知，目前找不到其他比《梦的真相》更吸引人的指南了。——劳拉•米勒（Laura Miller），纽约沙龙网对于那些一心研究科学探索的人来说，这本书大概会让他们爱不释手。——苏珊娜·卡哈兰（Susannah Cahalan），《纽约邮报》“轻科学”的典范之作，对我们私人和社会生活中有重大影响的人类生物学和行为科学的方方面面都会有重大启发。——卡罗尔·塔夫里斯（Carol Tavris），《华尔街日报》兰德尔的智慧与好奇心成就了他，使他成为人们在探索梦境方面的一个令人欣慰的“引路人”。——《波士顿环球报》作者对一个如此令人着迷的话题展开深入研究，并以一种通俗易懂的方式启发人们去探索梦的真相。——《新科学家》这本神奇的书很可能帮人们解决在睡眠方面存在的所有问题……书中介绍了很多实用的信息，比如在不依赖药物的情况下如何克服失眠，如何做可以在睡眠中不打鼾，如何说服小孩子按时上床睡觉等。还有一点，可能对一些人来说，也是更有用的一点吧，就是如何在专业足球比赛中成功下注：一般周一晚上，人体的生物周期节律更有利于西海岸队的发挥。总之，这是一本让人爱不释手的书（这是一本让人一旦读起来都不舍得睡觉的书）。——《出版者周刊》兰德尔在书中强调了太容易被人们忽视的常识，也就是——睡眠并非无效。相反，在决定人们能否生活幸福的要素中，睡眠质量很可能占据其中三分之一。作者还指出，睡眠不是一个无差别的连续统一体，看似平静的睡眠分为五个阶段，每个阶段约90分钟。总体来说，该书对生活中那些被遗忘、被忽视以及被推迟元素的研究还是很令人满意的。——《科克斯评论》"
200,0393345866,http://goodreads.com/user/show/273287-mycala,3,"I think I was expecting the book to be more about dreams themselves, but it's about sleep and it's interesting. I had no idea that there used to be such a thing as ""first sleep"" and ""second sleep"" during the night before incandescent light bulbs. What a concept! There was another bit about Ambien and how it doesn't really help much with restorative sleep -- in fact, it can make it worse. I know someone who used to take Ambien and observed the escalating that occurred, starting with sleep talking and then sleep walking and doing some things I know this person would never have done when awake. It was really scary. (So yeah, not only did Ambien keep this person from a good night's sleep, it also kept ME from a good night's sleep as well. Bastards.) I felt validated to see that others have had similar experiences, and worse -- someone actually drove while asleep on it.After sharing some stories about what happens when you don't get enough sleep and why taking drugs is probably not the best idea in the long term and the science behind dreaming, there are some helpful pointers on how to get the best out of your time spent unconscious. "
201,0393345866,http://goodreads.com/user/show/8482935-cm,3,"3 1/2 starsThis pop-sci book is actually covering way more than the science of sleep. The history of sleeping pattern, the law on sleepwalking offenses and how parents treat their crying infants are all here along with  simplistic accounts of stages of sleep and sleep deprivation. I am quite a sucker to this ""looking at the same subject from multiple perspectives"" approach and the style is as accessible and enjoyable as a well-written magazine article. Readers will walk away with many tidbits and stories. Anyway, this is definitely on the lighter and uncritical side of things and some editing might be needed. A good read for everyone, just don't expect much practical advice.Bonus points for including the little effect of sleeping pills (approx. 11 minutes more of sleep a night but they might induce antereograde amnesia so you won't remember your bad night) and the questionable marketing tactics of Thomas A. Edison (he paid reporters with the shares of his company) ."
202,0393345866,http://goodreads.com/user/show/19089556-bruce-perry,4,"We're living during an era when anything can be the subject of a book, no matter how narrow the topic (e.g., books only about olive oil or garlic; I wouldn't be surprised if one came out only about eyebrows). This engaging book goes down the rabbit hole about sleep, from the bizarre parasomnias, where people cook, drive, and worse, all while sleeping; to the prosaic, how to get better sleep. Cool off the body before sleep (a cool walk or shower), don't expose yourself to artificial light from screens beforehand, set your mind at ease with breathing techniques. It's your brain keeping you up more than anything else, not a stiff mattress. We learn that it's normal to double sleep (get up, futz around, but go back asleep), especially after middle age, and that married couples can guiltlessly sleep separately to optimize sleep. Circadian rhythms are extremely important to health; don't deny yourself sleep. That's about the max I got out of this book."

When author David Randall sleepwalks into a wall and ends up in the ER, he goes on a mission to understand why we sleep and how often we are frustrated by our inability to get a good night's sleep. He begins with a walk back in time - before Edison invented the light bulb and gave us the ability to be awake 24/7 - and in that look back, he finds that we rarely slept 8 straight hours. In fact, we had a 1st sleep, followed by a period of awakened activity, followed by a 2nd sleep. Whether you're a perfect sleeper, an insomniac or a sleepwalker - Dreamland offers something for everyone. But, most importantly, what you might learn is that sleep is the best healing remedy around. Highly recommend this well written, informative, and occasionally humorous adventure into the strange science of sleep!! "

That set into motion experimenting with time I go to bed, diet, exercise and how that correlated to the quality of my sleep. It brought into focus how much sleep is important. I did not realize it as I never had a problem with it. But the benefits I got as I incrementally improved my sleep quality made me more curious about the science behind it. This book is a good intro to interesting aspects and research on sleep. It made me want to explore the subject of sleep more. It's not a book to help you sleep better. Rather it opens you to looking into your own sleep patterns and start a journey to understand it more. "

More than just physical rest, our brains need sleep to reboot and refresh our processing and decision-making functions.-Even though sleep deprivation can mess us up a whole lot, we can come back from it with more sleep.-While the invention of (safe) artificial light did a lot of good things, it really messed up our sleep and circadian rhythms as a species.-NOBODY should do anything that could endanger lives (drive, hold a gun, treat patients) while sleep deprived.--Sleep-walking is really weird. So is the invention of the CPAP machine.-We can get better sleep, mostly by making it a priority and devoting the time we need to it."

It was the kind of rare nonfiction book that one cannot put down once it has been started, and it explained sleep and sleep disorders in a way that was understandable. It was split up very well, and all of the research was well-done. Also, it gives a large quantity of information, and is full of interesting stories that pertain to the information given. It did not seem overly formal, but instead one gets to know the author. I would definitely recommend this to anyone interested in sleep, caffeine intake impacting sleep and functioning level, and sleep disorders. Overall, it was one of the best nonfiction books I have read."

230,0393345866,http://goodreads.com/user/show/273287-mycala,3,"I think I was expecting the book to be more about dreams themselves, but it's about sleep and it's interesting. I had no idea that there used to be such a thing as ""first sleep"" and ""second sleep"" during the night before incandescent light bulbs. What a concept! There was another bit about Ambien and how it doesn't really help much with restorative sleep -- in fact, it can make it worse. I know someone who used to take Ambien and observed the escalating that occurred, starting with sleep talking and then sleep walking and doing some things I know this person would never have done when awake. It was really scary. (So yeah, not only did Ambien keep this person from a good night's sleep, it also kept ME from a good night's sleep as well. Bastards.) I felt validated to see that others have had similar experiences, and worse -- someone actually drove while asleep on it.After sharing some stories about what happens when you don't get enough sleep and why taking drugs is probably not the best idea in the long term and the science behind dreaming, there are some helpful pointers on how to get the best out of your time spent unconscious. "
231,0393345866,http://goodreads.com/user/show/8482935-cm,3,"3 1/2 starsThis pop-sci book is actually covering way more than the science of sleep. The history of sleeping pattern, the law on sleepwalking offenses and how parents treat their crying infants are all here along with  simplistic accounts of stages of sleep and sleep deprivation. I am quite a sucker to this ""looking at the same subject from multiple perspectives"" approach and the style is as accessible and enjoyable as a well-written magazine article. Readers will walk away with many tidbits and stories. Anyway, this is definitely on the lighter and uncritical side of things and some editing might be needed. A good read for everyone, just don't expect much practical advice.Bonus points for including the little effect of sleeping pills (approx. 11 minutes more of sleep a night but they might induce antereograde amnesia so you won't remember your bad night) and the questionable marketing tactics of Thomas A. Edison (he paid reporters with the shares of his company) ."
232,0393345866,http://goodreads.com/user/show/19089556-bruce-perry,4,"We're living during an era when anything can be the subject of a book, no matter how narrow the topic (e.g., books only about olive oil or garlic; I wouldn't be surprised if one came out only about eyebrows). This engaging book goes down the rabbit hole about sleep, from the bizarre parasomnias, where people cook, drive, and worse, all while sleeping; to the prosaic, how to get better sleep. Cool off the body before sleep (a cool walk or shower), don't expose yourself to artificial light from screens beforehand, set your mind at ease with breathing techniques. It's your brain keeping you up more than anything else, not a stiff mattress. We learn that it's normal to double sleep (get up, futz around, but go back asleep), especially after middle age, and that married couples can guiltlessly sleep separately to optimize sleep. Circadian rhythms are extremely important to health; don't deny yourself sleep. That's about the max I got out of this book."
233,0393345866,http://goodreads.com/user/show/38577144-joanna,5,"Elusive sleep - we need it to live, to be creative, to solve problems, to recharge and restore our brains, our bodies and our spirits. When author David Randall sleepwalks into a wall and ends up in the ER, he goes on a mission to understand why we sleep and how often we are frustrated by our inability to get a good night's sleep. He begins with a walk back in time - before Edison invented the light bulb and gave us the ability to be awake 24/7 - and in that look back, he finds that we rarely slept 8 straight hours. In fact, we had a 1st sleep, followed by a period of awakened activity, followed by a 2nd sleep. Whether you're a perfect sleeper, an insomniac or a sleepwalker - Dreamland offers something for everyone. But, most importantly, what you might learn is that sleep is the best healing remedy around. Highly recommend this well written, informative, and occasionally humorous adventure into the strange science of sleep!! "
234,0393345866,http://goodreads.com/user/show/560844-pratik,5,"I started experimenting with measuring my sleep when my alarm clock broke and instead of looking for a replacement I found an app that tracked sleep and rang when the sleep was most shallow. That set into motion experimenting with time I go to bed, diet, exercise and how that correlated to the quality of my sleep. It brought into focus how much sleep is important. I did not realize it as I never had a problem with it. But the benefits I got as I incrementally improved my sleep quality made me more curious about the science behind it. This book is a good intro to interesting aspects and research on sleep. It made me want to explore the subject of sleep more. It's not a book to help you sleep better. Rather it opens you to looking into your own sleep patterns and start a journey to understand it more. "
235,0393345866,http://goodreads.com/user/show/93100-libby,4,"This was a really fascinating book about sleep. Here are the main take-aways I got:-We really do need sleep! More than just physical rest, our brains need sleep to reboot and refresh our processing and decision-making functions.-Even though sleep deprivation can mess us up a whole lot, we can come back from it with more sleep.-While the invention of (safe) artificial light did a lot of good things, it really messed up our sleep and circadian rhythms as a species.-NOBODY should do anything that could endanger lives (drive, hold a gun, treat patients) while sleep deprived.--Sleep-walking is really weird. So is the invention of the CPAP machine.-We can get better sleep, mostly by making it a priority and devoting the time we need to it."
236,0393345866,http://goodreads.com/user/show/119792339-dora-oz,5,"I loved this book! It was the kind of rare nonfiction book that one cannot put down once it has been started, and it explained sleep and sleep disorders in a way that was understandable. It was split up very well, and all of the research was well-done. Also, it gives a large quantity of information, and is full of interesting stories that pertain to the information given. It did not seem overly formal, but instead one gets to know the author. I would definitely recommend this to anyone interested in sleep, caffeine intake impacting sleep and functioning level, and sleep disorders. Overall, it was one of the best nonfiction books I have read."
237,0393345866,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7566073-cathy,4,"An excellent, broad-ranging book about the science and myths of sleep. Lots of interesting research and events that tell us why we shouldn't watch TV before going to sleep, that we CAN solve our problems in our dreams, why the military should start to care about the sleep of the men and women who operate those high tech killing machines, and why West Coast football teams usually win when they play an East Coast team in the east. "
238,0393345866,http://goodreads.com/user/show/132395-anne,3,"This created a cohesive whole, but the way he summarized scientific studies left a lot to be desired - leaving out what felt like key information, drawing his own conclusions when the science was unsure. Worth reading if you're interested in the basics of sleep science but hasn't got much more than that."
239,0393345866,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1030319-coral,3,"Sleep: You don't know how much you need it until you're not getting enough of it. In the vein of Mary Roach or Sam Kean, David Randall takes us through several topics related to sleep. None of the areas were researched deeply (or, at least, not in a way that came through in the final text) but were entertaining to read. "
240,0393345866,http://goodreads.com/user/show/13526042-juliej,3,"This a light read for the layman. There are a few interesting facts, but not really many answers to the issues that may have prompted the reader to pick up this book.I understand that is largely because, as the author says, we don't know a lot about sleep. But he has chosen to write a book about it, so I think he could have found a bit more to say.I myself was interested by the question he raised of culpability for a crime committed while sleep-walking, and I actually think he could have spent more time on that subject, but on the whole I felt there was a lot of unnecessary 'padding' in the book and a lot could have been left out without losing anything significant. The examples given to illustrate a point went on too long, and that page-space could have been used more usefully (in my opinion), which meant that sometime I lost interest in what he was saying.Interesting though to read how almost all the money increasingly spent on sleep (mattresses, pills and potions, etc) is a waste of money, but the cost-free habit of napping is one of the most productive methods to improve health and creativity. Perhaps that is why there is not a lot of research done in this area??"
241,0393345866,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3119697-ann,3,"This non-fiction book meanders through the various aspects of sleep and dreaming. It never gets very technical and the author barely skims the surface of this fascinating subject. We hear about how the marital bed may be bad for a good night’s sleep, how babies around the world sleep, how sleep deprivation is responsible for all sorts of bad things, including deaths of American service personnel by friendly fire, about devices develped to monitor one’s sleep etc. None of it is very detailed. Here and there the author treads perilously close to the “association means causation” fallacy. Are good sleepers happier because they sleep more, or do happy people sleep better? Sometimes his eclectic appraoch is a bit strange. For instance, there are many things one could say about Sigmund Freud anno 1901, so why describe him as “the son of a wool merchant with a small medical practice?”There are no illustrations, graphs of other materials, but as mentioned before, the exploration of the topic is simple and superficial enough that none are needed."
242,0393345866,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5483338-heather-pagano,3,"I wanted Randall to say something beyond: sleep is super important. But the message he wanted to give was just that, nothing more, and he said it fairly well. This book was very basic introduction and intended to do little more than develop an appreciation for the role sleep plays in our lives as individuals and in our society. There were some interesting facts and anecdotes, the tone of the book was very personable. The rigor of some of the studies he mentioned seemed a little dubious to me, and I found it a bit frustrating to always stay on the surface of any topic. "
243,0393345866,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1286919-charles,3,"I would rewrite the subtitle as ""fun historical facts about sleep research."" To be fair, ""adventures in the strange science of sleep"" doesn't promise much and the author acknowledges the infancy of the field, but I had hoped for a better understanding of what happens (or fails to happen) as we lay in bed with the lights out. The penultimate chapter delivers some of the goods, however, and I wouldn't say it was an unpleasant read despite the canned 'lets make this fun' tone that pervades so much contemporary nonfiction."
244,0393345866,http://goodreads.com/user/show/9491740-amy,4,"A terrific read. I am not 'a science person' but I learned something on every page. The best thing about this book is that it has already made it easier for me to sleep better, and longer, every day. I would recommend it to anyone with an interest in general health and/or psychology, sleep and relaxation specifically, and of course anyone with a history of sleep problems. It contains a wealth of information, well-documented and clearly presented."
245,0393345866,http://goodreads.com/user/show/826906-laura,3,"A light and entertaining read with some very interesting bits, but overall not quite as in depth as I'd have liked. The author also does not address the topic of infant sleep which would have been a perfect addition. He only barely touches on sleep in different cultures, which is a pity given how much fascinating material this would have provided."
246,0393345866,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1529237-martha,3,"Not the first book I've read about sleeping, and I find it a pretty fascinating subject. This book was an easy read and included a lot of interesting facts about sleep and the brain. It really could have used a good proofreader, though. More errors than a book published by a major publisher should have. (What's with the hyphen in ""several-thousand""? So wrong.) "
247,0393345866,http://goodreads.com/user/show/39727-ang,5,"Who knew reading about sleep could be so enthralling? Such a quick little read, too. I always say, any book that compels you to blurt out facts to the person you live with is a gem, and Sam now knows all about sleep too. This book probably isn't going to help you sleep better, but it will help you understand why you sleep the way you sleep."
248,0393345866,http://goodreads.com/user/show/8687113-constance,4,"Makes me pay attention to what I can do in my life to get a better quality sleep. Pretty important if you want a better quality life in the realms of mood, memory, and health. Also learned a few interesting things about sleepwalkers. "

Postpone the timing of comforting the baby's crying is actually a good training for their independence. 【内容简介】梦，究竟是睡眠的守护神，还是焦虑的放大镜？本书带你探索占据人生三分之一时间的黑夜帝国，深入了解鲜为人知的睡梦世界。和很多人一样，作者大卫•K.兰德尔也是一个睡梦中的“不安分”分子，他会说梦话、唱歌，会大笑、打呼噜，会跳动、踢腿……但直到他开始梦游，并撞上走廊，才想要去研究占据着我们生命近三分之一的黑暗时间。为此，他访问了睡眠研究者、历史学家、人类学家、运动训练人员、企业家、婚姻咨询专家、心理医生、小儿科医生以及睡眠犯罪研究专家，却发现，睡梦中竟然有着大科学。《梦的真相》告诉我们，睡眠并不像看起来那么简单。男人和女人的睡眠有没有什么不同？我们为什么会做梦？而如果你在梦游的时候，碰巧杀了一个人，这算不算谋杀？更有趣的是，斯坦福大学的研究者整理了“周一橄榄球之夜”25年来的比赛记录，竟然发现处于知觉反应高峰的运动员相较于生物钟处于睡眠时间的运动员来说具有某种看不见的优势，所以赌徒们乐坏了，只要把将赌注压在来自西海岸的队伍身上，赢的概率就高达70%，这简直是就地捡钱。《梦的真相》，为我们打开了光怪陆离的睡梦世界，令人不安又着迷，也许从此之后，即使是你的枕头，都能让你另眼相看。当然，它也不是典型的指导书，没有“完善睡眠的10个简单步骤”这类内容，但是读完这本书，你会对入睡时你的身体里发生了什么，以及如果忽视睡眠太久会发生什么，有一个全新的理解。-----------------【编辑推荐】☆梦，究竟是睡眠的守护神，还是焦虑的放大镜？在《梦的真相》中，你将偶遇历史学家、人类学家、企业家、心理医生、睡眠研究专家……他们将带你科学探索占据人生三分之一时间的黑夜帝国梦境的秘密，深入了解透析鲜为人知的睡梦世界。☆《纽约时报》《华尔街日报》《新科学家》《柯克斯书评》评论图书。☆不论有没有睡眠障碍的人，都应该阅读本书，它会让你对入睡时你的身体里发生了什么，以及如果忽视睡眠太久会发生什么，有一个全新的理解。家长、教育者和领导们也许更应该读一读，从而总结出新的工作方法与时间安排。☆挑战弗洛伊德《梦的解析》之“隐藏欲望”论，提出“梦不过是我们每天考虑的所有可能性的糟糕反应”观点弗洛伊德认为睡梦并不是偶然的，而是包含着各种隐藏含义，这些隐藏含义就是做梦者隐秘期望和欲望的投射。而作者通过采访与整理其他睡梦解析专家的研究，用数据证明，大多数梦境都相当直接，更多是反应现实的焦虑。☆重新定义睡眠以及梦的意义A）爱迪生发明的电灯，或许是造成现代人类睡眠障碍的罪魁祸首。B）科学已经证实“长时间的清醒，会让人的创新性与效率大打折扣”，而哪怕短时间小憩也能让人体恢复的观点却常常得不到认可。C）梦还被看作“一种嵌入式夜晚疗法”。在梦中，大脑在休息的同时，还会将新鲜的或恼人的信息同已知信息混合起来，常常有出人意料的结果。那些常常觉得才思枯竭，而一觉醒来却有了很好想法的人，也许对此深有感触。☆唤醒人们对生物钟的重视无论是战场，还是考场，甚至是赌场，生物钟都发挥着难以想象的作用，而这，却并未得到世人重视。☆这本书满足了你的好奇心男人和女人的睡眠有没有什么不同？我们为什么会做梦？为什么哄孩子入睡是让新生儿父母头疼的任务，世界上所有家庭都是这样的吗？是什么让我的身体开始梦游，为什么不能让其停止？而如果你在梦游的时候，碰巧杀了一个人，这算不算谋杀？看完这本书，你的答案也许不是一长串“不知道”。-----------------【名家推荐】关于睡眠的生动概述。——莫琳·科里根（Maureen Corrigan），华盛顿乔治城大学教授，“新鲜空气”（美国公共国家电台栏目）生活中，我们对这个话题十分熟悉， 但就其原理来说我们又十分外行，作者的概述详尽有趣，可以有效地引导我们明白梦境。——阿比盖尔·楚格（Abigail Zuger），医学博士，《纽约时报》就这个话题来说，这本书有趣，且令人着迷。并且据我们所知，目前找不到其他比《梦的真相》更吸引人的指南了。——劳拉•米勒（Laura Miller），纽约沙龙网对于那些一心研究科学探索的人来说，这本书大概会让他们爱不释手。——苏珊娜·卡哈兰（Susannah Cahalan），《纽约邮报》“轻科学”的典范之作，对我们私人和社会生活中有重大影响的人类生物学和行为科学的方方面面都会有重大启发。——卡罗尔·塔夫里斯（Carol Tavris），《华尔街日报》兰德尔的智慧与好奇心成就了他，使他成为人们在探索梦境方面的一个令人欣慰的“引路人”。——《波士顿环球报》作者对一个如此令人着迷的话题展开深入研究，并以一种通俗易懂的方式启发人们去探索梦的真相。——《新科学家》这本神奇的书很可能帮人们解决在睡眠方面存在的所有问题……书中介绍了很多实用的信息，比如在不依赖药物的情况下如何克服失眠，如何做可以在睡眠中不打鼾，如何说服小孩子按时上床睡觉等。还有一点，可能对一些人来说，也是更有用的一点吧，就是如何在专业足球比赛中成功下注：一般周一晚上，人体的生物周期节律更有利于西海岸队的发挥。总之，这是一本让人爱不释手的书（这是一本让人一旦读起来都不舍得睡觉的书）。——《出版者周刊》兰德尔在书中强调了太容易被人们忽视的常识，也就是——睡眠并非无效。相反，在决定人们能否生活幸福的要素中，睡眠质量很可能占据其中三分之一。作者还指出，睡眠不是一个无差别的连续统一体，看似平静的睡眠分为五个阶段，每个阶段约90分钟。总体来说，该书对生活中那些被遗忘、被忽视以及被推迟元素的研究还是很令人满意的。——《科克斯评论》"
260,0393345866,http://goodreads.com/user/show/273287-mycala,3,"I think I was expecting the book to be more about dreams themselves, but it's about sleep and it's interesting. I had no idea that there used to be such a thing as ""first sleep"" and ""second sleep"" during the night before incandescent light bulbs. What a concept! There was another bit about Ambien and how it doesn't really help much with restorative sleep -- in fact, it can make it worse. I know someone who used to take Ambien and observed the escalating that occurred, starting with sleep talking and then sleep walking and doing some things I know this person would never have done when awake. It was really scary. (So yeah, not only did Ambien keep this person from a good night's sleep, it also kept ME from a good night's sleep as well. Bastards.) I felt validated to see that others have had similar experiences, and worse -- someone actually drove while asleep on it.After sharing some stories about what happens when you don't get enough sleep and why taking drugs is probably not the best idea in the long term and the science behind dreaming, there are some helpful pointers on how to get the best out of your time spent unconscious. "
261,0393345866,http://goodreads.com/user/show/8482935-cm,3,"3 1/2 starsThis pop-sci book is actually covering way more than the science of sleep. The history of sleeping pattern, the law on sleepwalking offenses and how parents treat their crying infants are all here along with  simplistic accounts of stages of sleep and sleep deprivation. I am quite a sucker to this ""looking at the same subject from multiple perspectives"" approach and the style is as accessible and enjoyable as a well-written magazine article. Readers will walk away with many tidbits and stories. Anyway, this is definitely on the lighter and uncritical side of things and some editing might be needed. A good read for everyone, just don't expect much practical advice.Bonus points for including the little effect of sleeping pills (approx. 11 minutes more of sleep a night but they might induce antereograde amnesia so you won't remember your bad night) and the questionable marketing tactics of Thomas A. Edison (he paid reporters with the shares of his company) ."
262,0393345866,http://goodreads.com/user/show/19089556-bruce-perry,4,"We're living during an era when anything can be the subject of a book, no matter how narrow the topic (e.g., books only about olive oil or garlic; I wouldn't be surprised if one came out only about eyebrows). This engaging book goes down the rabbit hole about sleep, from the bizarre parasomnias, where people cook, drive, and worse, all while sleeping; to the prosaic, how to get better sleep. Cool off the body before sleep (a cool walk or shower), don't expose yourself to artificial light from screens beforehand, set your mind at ease with breathing techniques. It's your brain keeping you up more than anything else, not a stiff mattress. We learn that it's normal to double sleep (get up, futz around, but go back asleep), especially after middle age, and that married couples can guiltlessly sleep separately to optimize sleep. Circadian rhythms are extremely important to health; don't deny yourself sleep. That's about the max I got out of this book."
263,0393345866,http://goodreads.com/user/show/38577144-joanna,5,"Elusive sleep - we need it to live, to be creative, to solve problems, to recharge and restore our brains, our bodies and our spirits. When author David Randall sleepwalks into a wall and ends up in the ER, he goes on a mission to understand why we sleep and how often we are frustrated by our inability to get a good night's sleep. He begins with a walk back in time - before Edison invented the light bulb and gave us the ability to be awake 24/7 - and in that look back, he finds that we rarely slept 8 straight hours. In fact, we had a 1st sleep, followed by a period of awakened activity, followed by a 2nd sleep. Whether you're a perfect sleeper, an insomniac or a sleepwalker - Dreamland offers something for everyone. But, most importantly, what you might learn is that sleep is the best healing remedy around. Highly recommend this well written, informative, and occasionally humorous adventure into the strange science of sleep!! "
264,0393345866,http://goodreads.com/user/show/560844-pratik,5,"I started experimenting with measuring my sleep when my alarm clock broke and instead of looking for a replacement I found an app that tracked sleep and rang when the sleep was most shallow. That set into motion experimenting with time I go to bed, diet, exercise and how that correlated to the quality of my sleep. It brought into focus how much sleep is important. I did not realize it as I never had a problem with it. But the benefits I got as I incrementally improved my sleep quality made me more curious about the science behind it. This book is a good intro to interesting aspects and research on sleep. It made me want to explore the subject of sleep more. It's not a book to help you sleep better. Rather it opens you to looking into your own sleep patterns and start a journey to understand it more. "
265,0393345866,http://goodreads.com/user/show/93100-libby,4,"This was a really fascinating book about sleep. Here are the main take-aways I got:-We really do need sleep! More than just physical rest, our brains need sleep to reboot and refresh our processing and decision-making functions.-Even though sleep deprivation can mess us up a whole lot, we can come back from it with more sleep.-While the invention of (safe) artificial light did a lot of good things, it really messed up our sleep and circadian rhythms as a species.-NOBODY should do anything that could endanger lives (drive, hold a gun, treat patients) while sleep deprived.--Sleep-walking is really weird. So is the invention of the CPAP machine.-We can get better sleep, mostly by making it a priority and devoting the time we need to it."
266,0393345866,http://goodreads.com/user/show/119792339-dora-oz,5,"I loved this book! It was the kind of rare nonfiction book that one cannot put down once it has been started, and it explained sleep and sleep disorders in a way that was understandable. It was split up very well, and all of the research was well-done. Also, it gives a large quantity of information, and is full of interesting stories that pertain to the information given. It did not seem overly formal, but instead one gets to know the author. I would definitely recommend this to anyone interested in sleep, caffeine intake impacting sleep and functioning level, and sleep disorders. Overall, it was one of the best nonfiction books I have read."
267,0393345866,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7566073-cathy,4,"An excellent, broad-ranging book about the science and myths of sleep. Lots of interesting research and events that tell us why we shouldn't watch TV before going to sleep, that we CAN solve our problems in our dreams, why the military should start to care about the sleep of the men and women who operate those high tech killing machines, and why West Coast football teams usually win when they play an East Coast team in the east. "
268,0393345866,http://goodreads.com/user/show/132395-anne,3,"This created a cohesive whole, but the way he summarized scientific studies left a lot to be desired - leaving out what felt like key information, drawing his own conclusions when the science was unsure. Worth reading if you're interested in the basics of sleep science but hasn't got much more than that."
269,0393345866,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1030319-coral,3,"Sleep: You don't know how much you need it until you're not getting enough of it. In the vein of Mary Roach or Sam Kean, David Randall takes us through several topics related to sleep. None of the areas were researched deeply (or, at least, not in a way that came through in the final text) but were entertaining to read. "
270,0393345866,http://goodreads.com/user/show/13526042-juliej,3,"This a light read for the layman. There are a few interesting facts, but not really many answers to the issues that may have prompted the reader to pick up this book.I understand that is largely because, as the author says, we don't know a lot about sleep. But he has chosen to write a book about it, so I think he could have found a bit more to say.I myself was interested by the question he raised of culpability for a crime committed while sleep-walking, and I actually think he could have spent more time on that subject, but on the whole I felt there was a lot of unnecessary 'padding' in the book and a lot could have been left out without losing anything significant. The examples given to illustrate a point went on too long, and that page-space could have been used more usefully (in my opinion), which meant that sometime I lost interest in what he was saying.Interesting though to read how almost all the money increasingly spent on sleep (mattresses, pills and potions, etc) is a waste of money, but the cost-free habit of napping is one of the most productive methods to improve health and creativity. Perhaps that is why there is not a lot of research done in this area??"
271,0393345866,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3119697-ann,3,"This non-fiction book meanders through the various aspects of sleep and dreaming. It never gets very technical and the author barely skims the surface of this fascinating subject. We hear about how the marital bed may be bad for a good night’s sleep, how babies around the world sleep, how sleep deprivation is responsible for all sorts of bad things, including deaths of American service personnel by friendly fire, about devices develped to monitor one’s sleep etc. None of it is very detailed. Here and there the author treads perilously close to the “association means causation” fallacy. Are good sleepers happier because they sleep more, or do happy people sleep better? Sometimes his eclectic appraoch is a bit strange. For instance, there are many things one could say about Sigmund Freud anno 1901, so why describe him as “the son of a wool merchant with a small medical practice?”There are no illustrations, graphs of other materials, but as mentioned before, the exploration of the topic is simple and superficial enough that none are needed."
272,0393345866,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5483338-heather-pagano,3,"I wanted Randall to say something beyond: sleep is super important. But the message he wanted to give was just that, nothing more, and he said it fairly well. This book was very basic introduction and intended to do little more than develop an appreciation for the role sleep plays in our lives as individuals and in our society. There were some interesting facts and anecdotes, the tone of the book was very personable. The rigor of some of the studies he mentioned seemed a little dubious to me, and I found it a bit frustrating to always stay on the surface of any topic. "
273,0393345866,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1286919-charles,3,"I would rewrite the subtitle as ""fun historical facts about sleep research."" To be fair, ""adventures in the strange science of sleep"" doesn't promise much and the author acknowledges the infancy of the field, but I had hoped for a better understanding of what happens (or fails to happen) as we lay in bed with the lights out. The penultimate chapter delivers some of the goods, however, and I wouldn't say it was an unpleasant read despite the canned 'lets make this fun' tone that pervades so much contemporary nonfiction."
274,0393345866,http://goodreads.com/user/show/9491740-amy,4,"A terrific read. I am not 'a science person' but I learned something on every page. The best thing about this book is that it has already made it easier for me to sleep better, and longer, every day. I would recommend it to anyone with an interest in general health and/or psychology, sleep and relaxation specifically, and of course anyone with a history of sleep problems. It contains a wealth of information, well-documented and clearly presented."
275,0393345866,http://goodreads.com/user/show/826906-laura,3,"A light and entertaining read with some very interesting bits, but overall not quite as in depth as I'd have liked. The author also does not address the topic of infant sleep which would have been a perfect addition. He only barely touches on sleep in different cultures, which is a pity given how much fascinating material this would have provided."
276,0393345866,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1529237-martha,3,"Not the first book I've read about sleeping, and I find it a pretty fascinating subject. This book was an easy read and included a lot of interesting facts about sleep and the brain. It really could have used a good proofreader, though. More errors than a book published by a major publisher should have. (What's with the hyphen in ""several-thousand""? So wrong.) "
277,0393345866,http://goodreads.com/user/show/39727-ang,5,"Who knew reading about sleep could be so enthralling? Such a quick little read, too. I always say, any book that compels you to blurt out facts to the person you live with is a gem, and Sam now knows all about sleep too. This book probably isn't going to help you sleep better, but it will help you understand why you sleep the way you sleep."
278,0393345866,http://goodreads.com/user/show/8687113-constance,4,"Makes me pay attention to what I can do in my life to get a better quality sleep. Pretty important if you want a better quality life in the realms of mood, memory, and health. Also learned a few interesting things about sleepwalkers. "
279,0393345866,http://goodreads.com/user/show/8151813-lukas-lovas,5,"It looks at sleep from many points of view, it summarizes the knowledge we have so far, it is well written, interesting and to the point. I enjoyed this book a lot, and I made several interesting notes to help myself sleep better and get more aout of it. Definitely worth reading :)"
280,0393345866,http://goodreads.com/user/show/24807763-andr-habet,2,"dug learning about sleep, but the prose in this book is very boring. listen to the radiolab episode on sleep instead, which uses a lot of the more interesting ideas from this book in a much more enjoyable form."
281,0393345866,http://goodreads.com/user/show/53137557-lady-renee,3,"Randall's journalism background was evident in this piece. I appreciated all the research studies cited as well as the different approaches from a spectrum of careers and ways of life.

When we have problems on sleeping, like the author, walking, kicking, doing something during the sleeping, he wanted to find out how to solve the problems and turned out to discovery more about the empire business on the ""sleeping pills"". Some pills is fatal if improper usage, some would remove the memories after taking these pills. Therefore certain crimes are committed due to sleep deprivation, or with misuse of sleeping pills.Another aspect is also what i totally agree on. Most people think it's an act of love if a couple could share a bed, but i actually think both could sleep better if they are not even in the same room. Sleeping on the same bed is not a proof of they love or don't love each other. After all, it's very private and person, we don't really connect to the one next to us, so absolute quietness is actually the best. For baby and mother is the same, some insist to have the baby to sleep with the parents, but scientifically proves that if we can let the baby sleep in another room could help both mother's and baby's sleeping quality.

I am quite a sucker to this ""looking at the same subject from multiple perspectives"" approach and the style is as accessible and enjoyable as a well-written magazine article. Readers will walk away with many tidbits and stories. Anyway, this is definitely on the lighter and uncritical side of things and some editing might be needed. A good read for everyone, just don't expect much practical advice.Bonus points for including the little effect of sleeping pills (approx. 11 minutes more of sleep a night but they might induce antereograde amnesia so you won't remember your bad night) and the questionable marketing tactics of Thomas A. Edison (he paid reporters with the shares of his company) ."

This engaging book goes down the rabbit hole about sleep, from the bizarre parasomnias, where people cook, drive, and worse, all while sleeping; to the prosaic, how to get better sleep. Cool off the body before sleep (a cool walk or shower), don't expose yourself to artificial light from screens beforehand, set your mind at ease with breathing techniques. It's your brain keeping you up more than anything else, not a stiff mattress. We learn that it's normal to double sleep (get up, futz around, but go back asleep), especially after middle age, and that married couples can guiltlessly sleep separately to optimize sleep. Circadian rhythms are extremely important to health; don't deny yourself sleep. That's about the max I got out of this book."

When author David Randall sleepwalks into a wall and ends up in the ER, he goes on a mission to understand why we sleep and how often we are frustrated by our inability to get a good night's sleep. He begins with a walk back in time - before Edison invented the light bulb and gave us the ability to be awake 24/7 - and in that look back, he finds that we rarely slept 8 straight hours. In fact, we had a 1st sleep, followed by a period of awakened activity, followed by a 2nd sleep. Whether you're a perfect sleeper, an insomniac or a sleepwalker - Dreamland offers something for everyone. But, most importantly, what you might learn is that sleep is the best healing remedy around. Highly recommend this well written, informative, and occasionally humorous adventure into the strange science of sleep!! "
294,0393345866,http://goodreads.com/user/show/560844-pratik,5,"I started experimenting with measuring my sleep when my alarm clock broke and instead of looking for a replacement I found an app that tracked sleep and rang when the sleep was most shallow. That set into motion experimenting with time I go to bed, diet, exercise and how that correlated to the quality of my sleep. It brought into focus how much sleep is important. I did not realize it as I never had a problem with it. But the benefits I got as I incrementally improved my sleep quality made me more curious about the science behind it. This book is a good intro to interesting aspects and research on sleep. It made me want to explore the subject of sleep more. It's not a book to help you sleep better. Rather it opens you to looking into your own sleep patterns and start a journey to understand it more. "
295,0393345866,http://goodreads.com/user/show/93100-libby,4,"This was a really fascinating book about sleep. Here are the main take-aways I got:-We really do need sleep! More than just physical rest, our brains need sleep to reboot and refresh our processing and decision-making functions.-Even though sleep deprivation can mess us up a whole lot, we can come back from it with more sleep.-While the invention of (safe) artificial light did a lot of good things, it really messed up our sleep and circadian rhythms as a species.-NOBODY should do anything that could endanger lives (drive, hold a gun, treat patients) while sleep deprived.--Sleep-walking is really weird. So is the invention of the CPAP machine.-We can get better sleep, mostly by making it a priority and devoting the time we need to it."
296,0393345866,http://goodreads.com/user/show/119792339-dora-oz,5,"I loved this book! It was the kind of rare nonfiction book that one cannot put down once it has been started, and it explained sleep and sleep disorders in a way that was understandable. It was split up very well, and all of the research was well-done. Also, it gives a large quantity of information, and is full of interesting stories that pertain to the information given. It did not seem overly formal, but instead one gets to know the author. I would definitely recommend this to anyone interested in sleep, caffeine intake impacting sleep and functioning level, and sleep disorders. Overall, it was one of the best nonfiction books I have read."
297,0393345866,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7566073-cathy,4,"An excellent, broad-ranging book about the science and myths of sleep. Lots of interesting research and events that tell us why we shouldn't watch TV before going to sleep, that we CAN solve our problems in our dreams, why the military should start to care about the sleep of the men and women who operate those high tech killing machines, and why West Coast football teams usually win when they play an East Coast team in the east.

Worth reading if you're interested in the basics of sleep science but hasn't got much more than that."
299,0393345866,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1030319-coral,3,"Sleep: You don't know how much you need it until you're not getting enough of it. In the vein of Mary Roach or Sam Kean, David Randall takes us through several topics related to sleep. None of the areas were researched deeply (or, at least, not in a way that came through in the final text) but were entertaining to read. "
