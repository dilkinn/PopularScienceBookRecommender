0,0609809989,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1984278-andrew-skretvedt,4,"Writing having read this a while ago...so don't read this too closely, as I'm really just free-form riffing off vague recollections of the book. (I just want to get it in my list here, for future reference.)If you enjoy history and economic ideas, as well as basic science, then this book is worth a check-out. If you've enjoyed books like ""Freakonomics"", then you'll probably find fun nuggets of value in this book as well. The book's main theme is something best to take away and carry with you in the back of your mind as you analyze and filter life's events unfolding around you. It may affect how you approach certain situations, or inspire a new angle for attacking a problem you might be faced with.The notion of self-organized criticality perfuses the whole book, and lends a unique and captivating perspective on the situations and problems presented. I think this could be very useful for understanding why some problems we face are hard and seem to defy solution.However, with this comes the realization that many more things which we try to manage and predict may in fact be more like the weather, where predictability is strictly limited to expressions of probability that are reliable only on relatively short timescales.I'm skeptical about some of the specifics which the author applies to some of the situations he describes. I couldn't shake the feeling that there was some basis left lacking or insufficiently substantiated. That may mean that his own understanding of critical state theory may be incomplete or misapplied.Still, with a wary eye I can provisionally accept his ideas at the very least as a perspective worthy of investigation. It may be that he's right, or correct enough to warrant really changing our attitudes toward managing and governing certain aspects of life.If anyone's experience of events and situations sets itself up like a pile of sand grains, growing more unstable with each additional grain, then perhaps the best way to govern is not to focus so much on inflexible rules and structures, but to aim for light-touch policies that reduce the ""friction"" of life...so that the sand has less chance to pile up to a dangerous height, and tends to flow out more readily like a fluid."

People tend to take extreme viewpoints - either everything happens for a reason or things happen completely randomly. The author takes a measured, scientific approach and does an admirable job of avoiding bias and jumping to conclusions. Interesting concepts and brilliantly written. I feel he could've gone a little deeper into a part of history instead of general statements about wars, but the book serves as a great introduction and a gentle reminder that the answer is usually somewhere in the middle."
2,0609809989,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2699963-mikedariano,5,"A great introduction to complexity and dynamic systems. Enjoyed much more, and was more accessible than Chaos or Complexity. "
3,0609809989,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2436371-dennis-littrell,3,"The real ubiquity is complexity itself Let's begin with a counter-thesis, namely that the ""ubiquity"" found in simplistic computer models (""games"") which are then related to real world systems such as earthquakes, sandpiles, the stock market, political and social history, etc., may be an artificiality and a whole lot less significant than Buchanan supposes.The fact that the games are, as Buchanan reports, tinkered with so that they yield a ""power law"" similar to that found in natural phenomena reveals the artificiality. What this ""power law"" really amounts to is something like ""the frequency of a big change is at least two times and maybe four times (or more) less than the frequency of a small change."" The ""power"" in the ""power law"" is nothing more than an exponent, as in something-squared, or something-cubed, etc. It's simply a power of a number as a measure of difference. Now, if the differences fell exactly on two times or four times, etc., then perhaps there would be some great significance. But when something is 2.14 times less likely (as it is when the avalanche is doubled in the sandpile game [p. 45, p. 57]) or 1.19 times less likely (as it is for magnets pointing in the same direction in the Onsager and Kaufman experiment [p. 129]) then calling the differences an example of a ""power law"" at work seems a bit forced and, at any rate, trivial.Incidentally, the word ""history"" as used in this book refers to a past that is different than now in a way that cannot be exhaustively unraveled. This idea comes from complexity theory and owes something to information theory. Buchanan attempts to apply it to a wide variety of phenomenon with varying degrees of success.But what is really being asserted here is the mundane fact that a big change is less likely than a small change in a complex system near the edge of chaos. Such systems: forests, the geological earth, the stock market, the international political arena, etc., are seen as having ""self-organized criticality,"" and it is this sort of complexity that they have in common, and this is what is significant, not some artificially derived ""power law.""Another key idea in the book is that the immediate ""cause"" of a big event in such systems is no different (or so it seems to our discernment) than the cause of a small event. This is an idea from complexity theory, and an exciting one. What it means is that such systems are in principle impossible to predict. In the sandpile game, for example, we don't know when we drop the latest grain whether it will trigger a big avalanche or a small one or none at all. This is similar to the ""butterfly effect"" in complexity theory in which it is thought possible that the flap of a butterfly's wings in the Sahara Desert, for example, may affect the amount of rain that falls on Cuba.Where I think Buchanan goes astray here is in making unwarranted connections between systems by using superficial and forced similarities. For example, one of the ideas from the study of earthquakes is that there is no typical size for an earthquake. In his desire to generalize Buchanan tries to find the same sort of phenomena in the interesting study Sidney Redner did on the fate of scientific research papers. Buchanan writes on page 200 that there was ""no typical number of citations for a paper, and, by extension, no typical magnitude for the reshaping in the network of ideas that any paper ultimately entails."" However on the previous page Buchanan has already reported that there was indeed ""a typical size."" That size was zero. Of the 783,339 papers published, 368,110 had no citations at all.Buchanan also asserts on page 169 ""...there is no  size for a city in the United States or elsewhere, and no reason to see special historical or geographical situations behind the emergence of the very biggest."" I agree there is no typical size for a city, but to ignore the effect of rivers, lakes and protected harbors as well as other factors such as nearby mineral and other resources in the growth of cities is silly. Chicago, for example, is a big city not by happenstance but because of its location on a great lake and because of its proximity to the middle of a great, growing country. Similar arguments can be made about other great cities in the US and around the world. The historical and geographical circumstances are special and they really are crucial.Buchanan further extends the thesis to include social and political revolutions. This makes for lively reading and there is no doubt that there are similarities between the critical state of a nation before a revolution and that of a sandpile before an avalanche or a forest before a fire, but the stresses are of an entirely different sort. He sees the readjustments of governments as a way to prevent the maladjustments that lead to revolutions as similar to the small forest fires that forest managers start to prevent a large forest fire as similar. (p. 209) Whether these similarities are more than conceptional analogies is another matter. Buchanan himself notes, still on page 209, ""None of this is meant to be fully convincing."" And on page 230, when seeing similarities between the ""behaviors of the mass of humanity"" and the ""wild fluctuations of the magnet poised between its...phases,"" Buchanan adds, ""It goes without saying that nothing I have mentioned in the past few chapters proves this. The  message is simply that this is a real possibility."" I agree, and I think these statements really could apply to the entire book.In conclusion, I disagree with the notion that the world is simpler than we think. I believe the opposite is manifestly true, and I found nothing in Buchanan's very interesting arguments to prove otherwise.--Dennis Littrell, author of “The World Is Not as We Think It Is”"
4,0609809989,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5917740-nilesh,5,"So much better than Black Swan. The topic is similar to a degree although without personal hubris or any obsession to limit the discussion to financial markets or any vendetta against another equally useful Gaussian function as was the case with the other much more popular book. The implications of otherwise simple power law are well laid out. The book lucidly shows how pervasive power law distributions are in natural life and human interactions. More importantly, the book wonderfully succeeds in showing the real meaning behind this statistical distribution - not just its utter randomness but also the deeper meaning of the scale-invariance. It rather scarily portrays how so many events that are absolutely great in terms of their consequences rarely have anything more than a normal cause.That said, the implications of all these statistical functions are always scary - they almost imply that free will does not exist, people do not matter and everything is just a statistical jumble where one can debate the operative function but can do little to alter it or use it for any good purpose.Overall, a great book although not for those looking for emotive outbursts or explosive conclusions or badly described success formulas."
5,0609809989,http://goodreads.com/user/show/72479728-bryan-alkire,2,"Dated and not particularly excited. The idea of complexity has become a bit cliched as a hot topic. This book was at the beginning and it’s nearly 20 years old. The book does move along with chapters on various topics of randomness in data. The writing is not exciting or novel…in fact, it’s repetitive repeating the same mantra in every chapter…everything is random, nothing can be predicted except mathematical relationships which don’t help with causal prediction. The analysis seems sound, though it confuses history as science instead of the art it is. On the whole, this book failed my expectations…it’s boring and I learned nothing new. So, I give this one a 2. The idea was sound in its day, but it’s been passed by. It’s not the best written and it irked me by making history out to be a predictive science wannabe rather than art, which history properly is. "
6,0609809989,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4514884-sam-bennett,3,"An interesting book along the lines of Blink, Tipping Point. Using several global examples, Buchanan tries to show there is no way to predict future events, earthquakes, market crashes, etc. When we imply we know how major events like these happened, it is always in hindsight. In particular I liked his example using economists predictions. There was NO case where any economist predicted any of the events we have been through. Economics is a particularly good example of his methodology since there is generations of accumulated data to pour over. Finally he discusses system equilibrium and the idea systems always tend towards a stable state. In fact he says most events are because many of these systems are in fact always on the edge of criticality and we have no way of knowing how, why, or what will cause the turning point that will push complicated systems over the edge and cause upheavals.I will probably read this again. It's a short book and some of the mathematical models didn't make it into my brain clearly. I would recommend this book."
7,0609809989,http://goodreads.com/user/show/34578450-anil,4,"If the author had included a chapter with one example, with exact step by step procedures about how these power laws were calculated, the book would've been perfect. Nevertheless, amazing book. Methods are interesting and can be googled. While I have always used the Petri dish as an analogy for human societies, I was pleased to find out that the spread and scaling of human settlements followed the same patterns as forms of bacterial growth. The message that we should not try to learn lessons from conventional narrative history is useful advice."
8,0609809989,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6182695-james-morrison,4,"I liked it very much. It made me skeptical about some of the science I learned when I was young. Mostly, not everything is normally distributed like you might think. Science class, at least in the past, studied things we understand and when the relationship is not linear, or we don't understand the pattern it tends to be ignored. So this is a nice science lesson from a different perspective than you may have considered. "
9,0609809989,http://goodreads.com/user/show/80906387-john-prest,1,"Obvious!The title should be ""Things happen because a lot of other things happened in the past"". Several examples of ultimately the same effect. Could have written it in 60 pages. Nothing actionable. "
10,0609809989,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6316757-rohit,2,Things I learnt - hammer and nail symptoms - understood bits and pieces of critical states- know when to fold a book
11,0609809989,http://goodreads.com/user/show/74555970-dan-drake,5,"One of those books that makes you look at the world in an entirely new way.Everything from earthquakes to the stock market to the current protests about the killing of George Floyd. Why do you sometimes get a ""big"" event -- a catastrophic earthquake, fire, worldwide protest movement, and sometimes such things are no big deal? Amazingly, it all can be explained and understood with very simple physical models. And the difference? There is no difference; all of these systems, from the earth's crust to forests to society, naturally settle into a ""critical state"" in which a tiny disruption will trigger an event, and that may or may not trigger further events. It's essentially impossible to figure out what will happen because of a given trigger, and conversely, looking back at some event, the particular character of whatever trigger started it generally isn't so important. This pairs nicely with books such as Scale: The Universal Laws of Growth, Innovation, Sustainability, and the Pace of Life in Organisms, Cities, Economies, and Companies and The Physics of Wall Street: A Brief History of Predicting the Unpredictable."
12,0609809989,http://goodreads.com/user/show/63605129-vinny,4,"This is a phenomenal book for students of history to understand how the concept of universality in physics relates to the field. Universality simply states that under very broad conditions, interacting objects display universal features of their behavior. Furthermore, it appears that systems generally tend to move into a self-organized critical state on their own, which could result in a catastrophic event.Through a series of examples, Buchanan guides the reader through the history of the concept of the critical state and connects it to the study of history. Buchanan’s style of writing is engaging and approachable and the book tries to tackle a very complex idea in order to cause a paradigm shift.The final thought that I left with was that human history is fundamentally unpredictable because we operate in a semi-independent state. Generally speaking, our civilizations, societies and cultures appear to follow basic power laws and remain stable, yet individually we display dramatic differences in variability which in turn change many other variables. So we are able to evolve and create new tools and types of societies to attempt to bring about new levels of stability to our systems, yet we still reflect the basic characteristics at the atomic level, as defined by universality and self-organized criticality."
13,0609809989,http://goodreads.com/user/show/17723741-steve,5,"A fascinating and, I think, very important book. As part of an unofficial trilogy with Evolution of Everything and Deep Simplicity, prepare for a consciousness-expanding experience.To brutally over-simplify, the thesis seems to be that in a networked, far-from-equilibrium, non-linear world (such as ours), many interesting and important phenomena from earthquakes to consciousness are described by chaos and a power law. Thus, you can expect but never predict large events (Fukushima, Great Recession, K-T extinction). I'm not knowledgeable enough to know what the implications of this are for real people, but it's an interesting insight."
14,0609809989,http://goodreads.com/user/show/22532968-justin-mundt,4,This is a great overview of complexity theory from the vantage point of physics.The idea I can't shake is that wars follow a power distribution and we are likely to have infrequent but inevitable large scale wars. These wars will continue until one is so large that it wipes humanity out. Maybe we really do need to colonize other planets for the survival of our species. It would explain why we haven't seen any type 2 or type 3 civilizations. Perhaps they always wipe themselves out before they can become that advanced.
15,0609809989,http://goodreads.com/user/show/53586138-bill,4,"Fascinating book. One of my takeaways is that critical states are a useful alternative way to view and evaluate the world and our place in it. The ""sand pile game"" is a super helpful model to apply to different aspects of the world. Importantly, it de-emphasizes our natural tendency to try and explain every cause to an event after the fact. "

26,0609809989,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2540960-ron-christiansen,4,"Physics all around--also watching the three part Nova series with youngest son about the fabric of the cosmos. I'm most intrigued by Buchanan's discussion of instability, that many systems build up pressure of some sort and exist on what he calls the knife of instability. This critical state lends itself to occasional upheavals (an earthquake, massive extinctions, a war) with one small shift in the system. That is big events do not have big causes--how marvelously counterintuitive. His overriding metaphor is a sand pile which, surprisingly, physicists have spent much time playing in. And even more surprisingly, they have found that there is no ""typical"" size of an avalanche in a sand pile--sometimes only a few grains of sand, sometimes hundreds, sometimes thousands. The avalanches appear to be completely random. Yet if this is the case then it is nearly impossible, then, to predict these upheavals. Of course this is akin to chaos theory but he moves beyond early chaos theory to describe power laws which describe the ""patterns"" of upheavability. These power laws do not allow us to predict one particular event; instead they demonstrate that across many systems both geological and biological there is a correlation between the number of small events (e.g. small earthquakes) and the number of large upheavals (e.g. massive earthquakes). So while these power laws do not have much practical value at this point, they do, as physics often does, point to an underlying system which is not random yet is also not predictable. Finally he uses these theories to (which will undoubtedly disturb some) history where he argues against the great person or genius theories of history. Of course, as he admits, many historians have already questioned this analysis of history. What Buchanan adds is that nonequalibrium physics is the proper field to describe what will happen--not just in sand piles and earthquakes but in the most complex of human systems. "
27,0609809989,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1192458-collin-clark,4,"Interesting book on historical science and how one seemingly small event can lay the ground work for future events. Think of the hypothetical situation where a butterfly flaps its wings in Africa leads to a hurricane in the US. The book discusses how complex things ranging from earthquakes, to financial markets, to political revolutions lie precariously in a ""critical state"" where at any moment one small event can lead to a major catastrophe without a way for us to predict it with certainty. Scientist and historians continue to attempt to explain these event, and try predict future events to no avail. The bottom line is that many things can't be predicted because they are not deterministic and don't adhere to laws of nature. Some of the ideas are a bit elusive but overall its an easy book to follow (not technical) and well written. Good read if you are interested in science and on gaining a new perspective on how to look at the world we live in."
28,0609809989,http://goodreads.com/user/show/38209911-sean-smith,4,"I read this book because several economists whom I respect have used lessons and illustrations in it over recent years to help explain how global economic conditions lead to global economic crisis (like the Great Recession). There are some really profound implications to understanding human revolutions, be it social or intellectual, and why they happen. I had a harder time with the first half of the book as he set up the science behind what he was talking about, but I found from Chapter 10 on truly fascinating. I also felt he did a good job explaining scientific concepts to the non-scientists (like me) and also addressing the doubts/questions about the real-world application of these things. I often found myself marking up a chapter full of questions and critiques only to find him attempt to address those very questions or concerns in the next chapter. "
29,0609809989,http://goodreads.com/user/show/973993-dp,0,"Honestly, maybe I wasn't into this so much. I understood the concept of Critical State after reading the first few chapters and I guess I just wasn't into following all of the examples. It's gets a three because it's an interesting concept but it also stands as a DNF (Did not finish). It was a library book; the first I have borrowed from this library and I can't renew books yet. It just wasn't worth me not moving on to something else. I wouldn't recommend it for vacation, it wasn't bad for sitting through breaks at work, but all together, I wouldn't recommend it unless you like to think a lot. "

Buchanan has the same technical chops as Ormerod but his writing style is much more accessible and his jokes are funnier. Examples of power law distribution highlighted in this include avalanches, earthquakes, and the distribution of academic papers.

It is interesting how a wide variety of different occurrences and phenomenon can be described in an abstract manner. I remember that I started the book fairly quickly, but got caught in the middle and plodded along for awhile, before quickly reading the remaining chapters. This book is dated in parts, as it was written and discusses issues in the early 2000's. This doesn't detract much from the overall message of the book though. "

Forget the bell curve for these phenomena, power laws are more appropriate and this has a significant impact on the rarity of these ""outliers"".This book does make me want to reread Taleb's work now that I think I have a better understanding of it all, thanks to M.
