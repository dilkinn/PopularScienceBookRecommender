0,0393355500,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2531665-charlene,2,"Every time I read Dennett, I wonder why I have put myself through such an ordeal. Aside from wanting to yell at Dennett, who isn't even in the room, I get the urge to throw things and yell, ""No, no, and just NO!"". Skillfully, Dennett gives the impression that he is a deep and critical thinker. He does this by filling his many books and many long, long articles with some of the best arguments against his own work, and then addressing the criticisms. That gives the reader the false impression that he has a deep understanding of those counter arguments. At the end of the day, he does not. I took 4 pages of notes on this book, with the intention of including it all in this review. Instead of including the many (so, so many!) examples I collected of why his arguments are bad, I will try to give just one example that will hopefully illustrate how his thinking in general is limited and lacks an essential critical component. My example will focus on Dennett's assertion that while some living things know why they do what they do (they have purpose), other living things do not (they are less complex and act without knowing, and thus humans have an agency and purpose that other animals, plants, and microbes lack. While I love discussions about how local rules (do what your neighbor is doing, even if you don't know why) can give rise to global patterns (e.g. the termite following local rules but building global structure of complex termite mound), I found Dennett's discussions on the topic to be lacking. Early on Dennett described the non-agency of termites. (For an author who always uses far more words than needed to deliver his every argument, he did a shockingly brief and poor job of providing the mind-blowing details about termites and their mounds). Dennett makes it clear that termites have no conscious purpose. They don't know why they carry out the actions they do. Yet, they build a termite mound that is the equivalent of a breathing lung! Super complex structure from the agency-lacking termites. Much later in the book, Dennett discussed how some humans hadn't a clue what they were building when they took actions to build the atomic bomb. However, other humans did know what actions they were taking and served as master intelligent designers. There are so many things wrong with his understanding of termites and humans, it's hard to know where to start when making a counter argument. First, we could consider the queen termite as the master intelligent designer, since she orchestrates a pheromone-driven symphony of building complex mounds in her colony. Termites follow local rules (they don't know why they put a bit of dirt in a particular spot; they just follow what their neighbors are doing) but create global patterns (like a mound that is air conditioned, thanks to its lung like capabilities). Dennett failed to explain any of this to his reader. Second, even if we want to suggest the queen termite is not the same as the top clearance leader who worked on the atomic bomb, Dennett still fails to understand the lack of human agency. So what if some individuals knew why they built *that* bomb? So what if a human architect knows why s/he built a *particular* house or building? Dennett should be asking why human build in the first place, why they fight with bombs and other weapons, and why they do the many things that all humans do. Thirdly, and I think most important, Dennett seems to understand the argument that unless we are microbes, we can't actually understand what microbes know or don't know. Yet, he demonstrates that he actually doesn't understand that vital counter argument. Dennett is really sticking to his humans are special stance. For example: Humans know why they do what they do (or at least a subset of them know); AI will never be as smart as humans because human brains are too special for top-down evolution; plants are *obviously* not intelligent, it's just a matter of where we draw the line; non-human animals are less intelligent than humans, and so on). However, microbes built us. When we can make a huge entity that we can ride around inside and control (by making a brain, organs, skin, gut microbe communication systems, etc), then I might agree that we are as smart as microbes. Dennett doesn't know what microbes know. Yet, his confidence about their lack or agency and our possession of agency are steadfast. Every time humans have thought they were special, every time Dennett, *every* time, it turned out they were wrong. Another bothersome thing about this book is that Dennett is extremely aware of what outdated Dawkins has to say on the topic but he doesn't seem to be aware of the work of better scientists like Jeremy England or anyone working in the field of thermodynamics. When Dennett was spouting about how complex humans are, I kept thinking, ""Are you going to mention that complexity is the natural consequence of thermodynamics and illustrate for your reader what that means?"" Sure enough, a few sentences later, he actually did mention thermodynamics but it had nothing to do with thermodynamics and the emergence of complexity. So frustrating. He needs to start reading new people. My main motivation for reading this book was because Sean Carroll (physicist) plugged it on FB. I thought that maybe Dennett had really gone through some sort of change and really came to understand the Big Picture. While he is sometimes good about updating his thinking (unlike Dawkins), he continues to hold on to too many old ideas. So, while I appreciate that Dennett is able to point out the problems with Dawkins' arguments (arguments that end up hurting atheist arguments and not helping them), and while I appreciate that he is trying to update our concept of intelligent design (I think we do indeed need to update our understanding) he is just too old-school to do an effective job. "
1,0393355500,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4569933-stamatios,2,"With every respect to Dennett's considerable intellect, this was a mess of a book. I guess it was partly my fault for thinking that I was about to read a scientific textbook on the origin and evolution of intelligence. Instead, it felt like I was trapped in a dull cocktail party with a group of warring philosophers arguing on abstract issues such as the sense of one's self, cultural memetics, the nature of competence etc. Note that it's not these topics per se that I find dull, but the fact that, without any scientific means to test and measure their theories, philosophers have to resort to endless refutation and rhetorics - which is what Bennet spends a lot of his time doing in this book. While I enjoy reading philosophical texts on life and morality, and like to debate the various stances myself, I don't appreciate philosophy getting in the way of studying actual phenomena and tangible objects such as language and the brain.The book is also unnecessarily long, mostly for the reason I gave above. Rather than getting straight to the point, Dennet does a disservice to his readers by doing the rounds and debunking past theories or conflicting opinions, before returning to his own and trying to convince us through very lengthy and meandering examples why it's the right one. Ironically, if he hadn't taken the time to examine those different viewpoints, not only I would have enjoyed this book more, but I would also have found him more persuasive. Now however, I feel like I've heard only one, very biased, side of the argument and will reserve my judgement for when I've heard more on these topics.Despite all these glaring problems with this book, I can't honestly say that I hated it. Dennett has a knack for coining catchy expressions (I guess his study of memetics came in handy here) and I found many of his thought experiments genuinely ingenious. And even though his arguments were too long, and he uses too many words to say one simple thing, I admit that I enjoyed his prose - especially in the audio book format that I listened to. Does all that make up for the downsides however? Sadly no. I can't recommend this book to anyone but perhaps loyal fans of Dennett's, who may have a greater interest in his subject and have developed a tolerance to his style."
2,0393355500,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7258380-dan-graser,5,"Surveying Dennett's huge output, this is perhaps his most ambitious and accessible work. The criticisms below that there isn't much in the way of new thinking on several areas is valid and I don't think that proposing many grand new ideas was his intention for this work. As he states toward the beginning of the book:""Undaunted, I am trying once again and going for the whole story this time. I think we have made tremendous scientific progress in the last 20 years; many of the impressionistic hunches of yore can now be replaced with well-researched details. And second, I think I now have a better sense of the various undercurrents of resistance that shackle our imaginations, and I plan to expose and disarm them as we go, so that, for the first time, the doubters can take seriously the prospect of a scientific, materialist theory of their own minds.""On this level I certainly think he succeeds and this book is much more accessible than the at times impenetrable, ""Consciousness Explained,"" and, ""Freedom Evolves,"" both of which were quite interesting and provocative but at times maddeningly convoluted. This is a sweeping work and a unique one in the field of philosophy as Dennett's approach is a purely Darwinian, memeticist take on the development and functioning of the mind. Particularly interesting sections are his staunch disagreements with Noam Chomsky and his subtly different take on the mind with Steven Pinker. A very rewarding read, particularly if you haven't read much of Dennett's previous work. "
3,0393355500,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5469227-d-l-morrese,3,"The title of this book implies a journey, and that's what it feels like...a long, twisty one with diversions to view the scenery, most of which, frankly, is rather dull. Along the way we're supposed to have learned something about 'the evolution of minds', and perhaps we do, a bit, but not much, honestly, and after reading this, I'm not sure what it was. There is a long diversion to look at words as memes, and a lengthy stopover to take a few kicks at the dead horse of Descartes' mind/body dualism, but I'm not sure either of these required the number of pages devoted to them. My issues aren't so much that I disagree strongly with the things Dennett is saying, they're more to do with how long he takes to say them. There seems to be a lot of belaboring the obvious going on. I suppose I was hoping for a succinct presentation of Dennett's views on the nature of consciousness, and although it is frequently mentioned, we never get a clear, unobstructed look at it. Maybe it's here and I simply missed it. I may have allowed my attention to be diverted by the diversions. "
4,0393355500,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6243880-gary-beauregard-bottomley,3,"There is intelligent design. It's just not what the creationist think it is. Nature gives us competencies without comprehension. Comprehension means full understanding. Dennett gives the example of how the computer can do arithmetic without understanding as explained by Turing. His holy trinity within this book are Turing, Hume and Darwin. Each thinker provides an inversion to our 'manifest' knowledge by allowing an opening to the window to scientific knowledge. He'll explain in detail how each thinker allowed us to see the world differently but in an 'inverted way'. They all gave us an 'ontology' (his word) of the world for which we live in. Ontologies can be thought of as the furniture that makes up the world, the pieces of the things that we use to explain the world under consideration, the structure, the foundation, the ground, or the first principles.Dennett is never afraid to talk down to his reader. Pernicious teleology is how we think naturally as humans. We always impute a reason for the way things are. We accidentally assume a 'why' for the way things are, because that's how we think because we always assume meaning. ""Teleology is never free"" as he says in the book. We use science to redirect us back to the 'how' things are. There is no over all meaning for the way things became the way they are (at least I don't know the reason). Dennett is really big on emphasizing that 'free will' is an illusion in as much as that cause will always precede effect within the human realm (yes, there is an exception at the quantum level, but we don't control that, and it is not at our mercy), and if there was a great Judge in the sky or any where else, he would not be able to judge us knowing that we are the way we are because we were made that way and time and chance determined who we are. And as Dennett goes on to explain in this book, we still must be held accountable for our actions on earth, but, again, a great Judge in the sky can't hold us responsible for our actions because we don't happen in a vacuum we are a result of the world we are thrown into. Dennett doesn't say it but St. Augustine created the concept of free will as to be the analogous power that God had when he freely created the universe and that similarly resides in us in order that God can judge us. Yes, I know Aristotle uses the word 'free will' but he meant something different and closer to Dennett's compatibilitist definition. There's a template to the story that he's telling within this book that could be found in another book that I've read, ""Master Algorithm"". My mind kept referring back to that book as I was listening to this book and in the last chapter or so he tells you about that book in detail. I really loved that book but only rated it three stars because of two reasons 1) I didn't like its conclusions and 2) it was concise but overly complex in its presentation. I don't mind complexity in my books but I would not really recommend it to others because it could be very hard to follow. But, all the themes that were in that book are in this book. He called them tribes in the book ""Master Algorithm"". One of the tribes was Bayesian statistics. Our expectations based on prior experiences shape how we accept the present. That's what Bayesian statistics do for us. There is a really formal definition but it would involve probability functions, but at the heart that is what it is. Dennett relies on the heuristic to explain this. So I will too. The ""Master Algorithm"" shows how we are currently taking 'the inverse of the program and using machine learning' to solve complex problems through the aid of the computer. Dennett talks about Google and its language translation program which has done that brilliantly. It's a bottom up approach instead of a top down approach. Our mind and evolution both seem to work from the bottom up also. Cool stuff. But, Dennett only saved this stuff for the last chapter. Dennett definitely has a mind set that I tended to disagree with in this book. His very long section on the meme and culture over looked the reality of epigenetics and just briefly noted it and that was only to tacitly ignore it. Epigenetics are real. Just read Science News or check up on the Belgium babies born at the very end of WW II (June 1944 to May 1945) under the needlessly cruel Nazi occupation and see the analysis which is explained by epigenetics. Dennett takes TOM (theory of mind) and mirror neurons more seriously than I think should be warranted. He's trying to explain that our consciousness comes about through by the shaping of our environment by our behaviors. It's one way of looking at the problem, but maybe not the best. Popper (logical positivist) and Skinner (behaviorism) are probably not the right way to frame the extremes (imo) as he seems to do within the text. There just seems to be a another story that could be told.I really love Dennett. I've read four of his other books, and three of them are in my favorites list. I was little bit disappointed in this book because most of it was review for me, and I don't really agree with his behaviorism point of view in the development of consciousness, and I didn't really agree with his development of language as he presented it. Also, one can argue there is no proper ontology to the world (see Wittgenstein for details, e.g.), and embracing Hume (who is my favorite philosopher) leads to 'facon de parler' (Dennets phrase, means 'convenient fiction'), which doesn't bother me, but needs to be reckoned with in the context of the philosophy of science. I don't mind reading some one who I disagree with but I do mind not learning much more than what I've read in other books on the same topic."
5,0393355500,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3536004-jenna,2,"2.5 stars I had high hopes for this book, but -- *YAWN* Dennet's main ideas are interesting enough but there's not much new in this book. One gets the sense he is being paid per word, because he is extremely repetitive, the book just goes on and on and on; it is incredibly tedious and dull much of the time. 400+ pages that could be condensed into under 100. I forced myself to stay with the book, simply because this is Daniel C. Dennett, but had it been just about anyone else, I would have ditched the book after the first couple of chapters."
6,0393355500,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5817790-steve,4,"I love Dennett and I think he's brilliant. At the same time he's quirky and cranky and I don't know what else. A few bits in the book flew past me, but not so much - I think he was trying to reach a big audience. But I think the reason why I understood maybe 90% of this instead of 60% is because I've read other books of his and it's all beginning to sink in. So anyway, I liked it a lot, but I'm not sure I'd recommend it to someone who hasn't already read and enjoyed Dennett."
7,0393355500,http://goodreads.com/user/show/60074558-xander,4,"In 2017 philosopher of biology and neuroscience Daniel Dennett published a book that one could call his magnum opus. Dennett has dedicated his career to understanding the implications of the theory of evolution - which he sees as a set of algorithms - and applying the developments in neuroscience to philosophical debates on consciousness and free will.In From Bacteria to Bach and Back, Dennett explores his entire career and updates his arguments - which he developed over more than three decades with the latest scientific insights. In a sense, this is his grand historical statement about the human mind. No need to read his other books? Well, I doubt if a novice reader could understand Dennett's line of argument if he or she is unfamiliar with his earlier works - especially Consciousness Explained (1991), Darwin's Dangerous Idea (1995) and Freedom Evolves (2003). This makes it an invaluable book (for insiders) and at the same time a completely useless one (for introducees). This is a serious drawback, which hinders me from giving this book a higher score. Another serious drawback is Dennett's writing style - nothing new: all his books have this issue. He uses loads of philosophical jargon and terms and seems to make it a sport to offer the reader as many philosophical thought experiments as possible. Presumably to make difficult concepts easier to grasp for novices, but for me it works counterproductive: I get lost in details and have a hard time connecting the abstract pieces to the bigger picture. I'd rather have someone like Richard Dawkins, who is able to explain highly technical scientific insights in plain language without treating his audience as morons.But besides these two points, the book is a marvel and contains the most consistent, complete and persuasive, scientific worldview on the human mind - in all its complexity - that I know of. This is definitely an amazing achievement of Dennett: the domains of evolution, consciousness, free will, language are flooded with obscure and inconsistent books, in which the authors (almost always) set out to prove their ideological premiss and now - in advance - what conclusions they want to offer the public. This fact alone makes From Bacteria to Bach and Back one of the most important books on science of the 21st century (on par with Lawrence Krauss's A Universe from Nothing).So what's the book about? This can be explained best - as Dennett does in his book - in three parts.1. In part 1, Dennett explains the theory of evolution. He explains this as the Blind Watchmaker (a term that Dawkins once coined). Natural selection puts pressure on organisms to adapt themselves to their (continuously shifting) environments or perish. Dennett emphasizes that we should think in populations, gene pools, instead of in terms of individuals (or even genes). Dennett calls this process, which really spanned billions of years (up to now), Darwin's Strange Inversion of Reasoning. Before Darwin, it was assumed that Design was necessary to create the design we see in nature. All the complexities in nature - for example all the intricacies of an ant-eater that make it fit a particular biological niche- were designed by an Intelligent Designer. Ever since Darwin, we know it's the other way around: the design in nature is the product of infinitesimal small steps in an unconscious process (i.e. natural selection). After this, Alan Turing came along and showed us how to build computers that can do anything without knowing what they're doing. A human being can program a computer by using algorithmic subroutines and split a very complex task into such tiny, simplicistic steps that it works! This Dennett calls Turing's Strange Inversion of Reasoning. Dennett, throughout the book, calls this process competence without comprehension. We assume that comprehension comes first (hence our ideas of an Intelligent Designer) but it's really the other way around. Unconscious processes build design, which might - in the end (from our perspective, that is) - become comprehending creatures which can then Intelligently Design things. It is important to note that Dennett sees comprehension as a gradual process, there is no difference in kind between bears and humans, or bacteria for that matter - all the difference is in degree. Dennett distinguishes four types of organisms (he borrows this from his 1995 book):1. Darwinian creatures, which are pre-programmed to respond to stimuli in their environment in certain determined ways (simple stimulus-response type organisms like clamps).2. Skinnerian creatures, which come equipped with the possiblity of (reflexive) reinforcement of certain stimulus-response types - based on the seeking rewards and avoiding pain. 3. Popperian creatures, which can form internal hypotheses and test them mentally to see what works. This is the first step towards reflection.4. Gregorian creatures, which can reflect on their own behaviour and hence use thinking tools to manipulate their environment.This is a gradual scale and we humans belong to the fourth type - we are able to reflect on our thoughts and on our sensual perceptions and hence to reason. To reason, we use important thinking tools: words. Which brings me to the second part of the book.In part 2 of the book, Dennett zooms in on human beings and tries to explain how cultural evolution led to the world as we know it today (including our minds). This part is very speculative, in the sense that the origin of language is still an open question: where, when and how did it start? There is a plethora of scientific hypotheses and who knows what theory might be accepted in the (near?) future?Dennett basically says that genetic evolution led to our ancestors developing language skills. These skills are, ultimately, founded in physical developments in the brain. Once people were able to communicatie with each other - which likely was a gradual process, like almost anything in nature (and which, for us, is very hard to imagine) there was a genetic basis for culture. In other words, memes (mostly words, but memes can take many different forms) were software that could start to flourish once the hardware (linguistic modules) was in place. In still other words: genetic evolution leads to cultural evolution.But this was just the start. As Dennett explains, cultural evolution started to shape the world of our ancestors and was itself a driving force for genetic evolution. This is one type of Baldwin-effect, in which a random trait spreads in a population - by pure coincide - and then forces genetic evolution to fixate around this trait (by 'punishing' individuals who lack this trait). So we see here a process of synanthropic evolution, in which memes and humans develop in a reciprocal and interactive relationship. As in part 1, Dennett stresses that this co-evolution of genes and memes followed his 'competence without comprehension'. A frog that shoots its tongue towards a particular spot because a particular area on his retina spots a fly doesn't need to know what, or even why, it's doing - it just does (i.e. competence). In the same vein, a human being that uttered words doesn't need to know what he or she is doing, he or she just does. Over time, the mind that was build by genes, was shaped by memes.This sounds counterintuitive, but Dennett illustrates this by the comparison between a termite mount and Gaudi's cathedral. Termites build huge mounts - similar in structure to Gaudi's cathedral - by following local rules and without knowing consciously (i.e. comprehending) what they do. Only when creatures comprehend what they're doing can they intelligently design a thing like a cathedral - and we humans are the only ones (so far known) that intelligently design. All of Dennett's theory stands or falls with the origin and development of language. Together with the origin of life, this is the most controversial topic in science. It's controversial due to lack of evidence: how, apart from physiological hints like the human larynx/voice box, would rudimentary language fossilize? But this doesn't mean that we should be pessimists: there are so many possible theories that there's actually a surplus of explanations. Now science will have to decide which one fits the (scarce) facts best.Dennett puts his money on a combination of Noam Chomsky's linguistic theories. Once language started in a rudimentary fashion (proto-language), humans likely evolved something similar to Chomsky's (2008) Merger which allows humans to use recursion in language (allowing sentences to refer back to sentences to refer back to sentences......and so on). This Merger (Chomsky's term) then gradually evolved into Chomsky's (1975) Language Acquisition Device, which allows human babies to use the cues from their surroundings to evolve the language that is spoken in their environment and learn this particular language. Children learn too much words in too short a time to be physically able to learn all their words by imitation and explicit instruction. According to Chomsky, humans are born with an innate language module - universal grammar - which is very flexible in its syntactic and semantic structure. (Curiously Chomsky started off (in 1975) advocating this innate language module, but since he is a staunch denier of evolution - one suspects because he feels uneasy with the (misguided) social implications of this theory - he struggled his entire career with the innateness of this module. In 2008 he came up with this 'Merger', which can be seen as a proto-Linguistic Acquisition Device, that doesn't need evolution. Ironically Dennett can combine both of Chomsky's theories to explain - evolutionarily! - the innate linguistic capacity of humans. This is something that Chomsky wouldn't have expected!)To sum up: Dennett claims that language modules (hardware) allowed words and other memes (software) to spread and infect other brains. Reflection of individual humans on these memes led to new memes: meta-memes. In this view, words and ideas are viruses that spread throughout human populations and compete with other memes for memory and attention. This is what Dennett means when he says memes shaped our minds; the explosion of memes put genetic pressure on increasing our capacity for attention and memory. It is only at the end of this (long) process, partly under the influence of meta-memes, that reasoning became an option for humans, leading - for the first time! - to comprehending organisms. Comprehension comes with a cost, though. Since we use reasons to comprehend the world around us (namely, we project a reason on everything we perceive), we have the illusion that everything has a reason. Dennett calls this the intentional stance, the notion that everything and everyone that we see acting does this for a particular reason. We attribute intentionality to everything, including everything about ourselves. Which leads me to the last part Dennett's book, in which this idea is worked out more fully - with an amazing ending.In part 3, Dennett postulates that consciousness is an evolved user-illusion. His theory of consciousness (and consequently of free will) is a very strange one at first, yet I haven't seen any refutation of it - anywhere - and when one ponders Dennett's idea it sort of 'clicks all into place'. Dennett explains how software programmers build a smartphone application by building a hierarchy of subroutines (of subroutine on subroutine on subroutine......and so on). Yet we, as users of the application, use a specially designed interface to manoeuve through the application. We are presented with information that is relevant to us - as users - in a way that suits our needs - as users. In other words, while the programmers know and are familiar with the entire scaffolding behind the application, they treat us users on a need-to-know basis: we - as users - should not be bothered with all the subroutines and algorithms.Now, the step Dennett takes is to apply the same concept to the human mind. Our mind consists of countless of local subroutines, all emerging from neural activity (the dynamics of electrochemical impulses within our central nervous system). All these subroutines are controlled by higher-level subroutines. And these subroutines are yet again controlled by even higher lvel subroutines. And so on. Our mind is build up, bottom-up, out of a hierachy of subroutines on a need-to-know basis - just like the smartphone application. The crucial step in Dennett's argument is the introduction of communication. As soon as language evolves (which is itself a hierarchy of subroutines in the human brain), there arises a problem. We communicate with others, but if we don't make a distinction between ourselves and others, we would communicate everything to everybody. This is not an evolutionary stable strategy, since this is bound to make us vulnerable to exploiters (cheaters, in the language of game theory). Hence, there's an evolutionary pressure to (1) distinguish 'I' from others and (2) to create some form of communication control in order to guide deception. This second part is important, since we humans, just like any organism on this planet, are 'built' by our genes to manipulate our environment to survive and reproduce. This environment includes other humans, so there's evolutionary pressure to manipulate others with the new tool (i.e. communication). This puts the premium on control and deception, including deceiving ourselves. According to Dennett, consciousness is exactly this control centre - without a controller. It operates on a need-to-know basis and it is nothing more than a user-interface that is built (by the unconscious, step-by-step programmer Mother Nature), to let us manipulate our environment. Our notion of 'I' or 'Self' is just the product of the need to distinguish between us as organism and our environment; the idea of consciousness is, so to speak, an illusion. [i]""We can see human consciousness as a user-illusion, not rendered in the Cartesian Theatre [the notion of a place in the mind where 'I' view all the trains of thought and 'decide' what to do] (which does not exist) but constituted by the representational activities of the brain coupled with the appropriate reactions to those acitivities."" (p. 412)[/i]Interesting to note here, is how Dennett explains things like 'caring'. According to Dennett our mind continuously generates Bayesian predictions, which is a philosopher's way of saying that our mind seems to use our past experiences in order to make predictions about new events. The Bayesian predictions are hierarchically orderd and are about objects outside us (if I walk around a solid object I will see the back of the object) as well as about us ourselves (what should I do, think, expect now).When we see a baby we find the baby cute. There's nothing cute about the baby: there's no such thing as cuteness. We just have the prediction that we predict to find the baby cute, and when this happens, the absence of prediction-error signals is interpreted as confirmation that the world we interact with has (indeed) the properties that we expect. The same with sugar: there's no such thing as sweetness, we just predict that we predict the sugar to 'taste sweet' and when it (indeed) does taste like predicted, this confirms our expectations. Yet the predictions themselves are mostly based on experience and partly inherited. Now what is 'caring'? Our perception of properties in the world, like cuteness and sweetness, depend on properties of the central nervous system, which have been evolved to make something from this. These properties have a privileged role in our control systems and this is what we call 'caring'. (This, very conveniently, does away with more than two millennia of the war in philosophy between objectivists - who claim that perceptions derive from properties of objects in the world - and subjectivists - who claim that we create our own perceptions independently of the world around is; it might as well not exist.)Dennett ends his book by venturing into the (near) future. His whole book has been a long explanation of how unconscious natural selection, step by step, builds competent, designed creatures. These creatures are all good at doing something, while they're bad at doing other things, without having any notice of what they do and why. Reason without reasoners; competence without comprehension; design without a Designer. We are the first species to have developed comprehension, via cultural evolution through memes, which use our brains (like software uses hardware); hence we are the first ones to Intelligently Design things: cathedrals, computers, even intelligence itself. This huge adaptation comes with some flaws - the illusion of consciousness and free will, for example - but it is amazing. In the recent past, scientists and engineers tried to build new systems and programs via the top-down road; this proved to be a dead-end (since this assumes that the system in question has to have all the data beforehand!) Currently we are applying (bottom-up) evolutionary algorithms in such wide areas as artifical intelligence (to build self-learning systems that can beat the best Chess and Go players), genetics (to build nanorobots for medical and genetic purposes) and music (to create new Bachian or Mozartian music without the original composers). For the first time in this universe, human beings are able to let intelligence develop itself, by using and applying the exact same (unconscious) process that built us! I love this idea, it is really beautiful.Dennett distances himself from the alarm calls coming from (self-proclaimed) intellectuals like Elon Musk or scientists like Stephen Hawking and Martin Rees. He doesn't think AI is able to comprehend - like human beings - but is just extremely competent. We might not be able to follow the program, so to speak, but it cannot comprehend what it's doing. So there's no problem. The main problem Dennett sees is that we (already) decide to put our own competences in the hands of AI, leading to the situation that once flaws emerge, we will not be able to do anything about it anymore, and civilization as we know it might collapse. This is a serious problem, and we can see it developing even now. Science, technology, economics, and politics have become so specialized that there are almost no persons left who have a view of the totality. This might seem abstract, but we should remind ourselves of the Australians who, thousands of years ago, drifted to New Zealand and gradually lost all technology. They could hunt the abundance of animals on the island, so there was no reason anymore to build fishing or hunting tools, or to build ships for that matter. These skills and this knowledge weren't passed on to next generations, and once the animals were all hunted they all died. If we continue in the way we are developing the world - and AI is just the latest devlopment - the most important technological, scientific and political techniques will be known by a smaller and smaller group of specialists. If something happens, there's no one who can drive the car. But let's not end the review with such a dire prediction. This book is truly amazing. It offers a worldview, well thought-out and consistent with everything we know and care about. Even if you disagree with Dennett on some points (or all), it's still a pleasure to follow his trains of thought and see the story unfolding before your eyes - I had the same experience with his Darwin's Dangerous Idea. Unfortunately, I doubt most people will be able to understand him completely - you need a lot of background knowledge (on philosophy, biology, neuroscience, etc.); without this one drowns in details and abstractness."
8,0393355500,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2270881-ken-rideout,2,"Although I agree with the author and he is clearly a smart guy, I found this book to be fairly self-indulgent and meandering (lots of take-down of others in the field who think differently or who have attacked his ideas in the past). In the end, I didn't feel that much new was brought to the idea of consciousness-is-some-kind-of-illusion argument (which I totally buy!). Here are some of his key ideas:-Humans are special in our meta-cognition but not that special (we know bacteria exist but they don't know they exist!) -Evolution gives us ""reasons without reasoners"" (think of the fine-tuned mechanism of cellular respiration)-Natural selection gives us ""competence without comprehension"" (think birds building nests)-Information and words are memes that compete via natural selection in cultural evolution which is now (for the first time) intelligently designed as we are self-aware and make active choices in what gets passed down to the next generation.-Consciousness is a user-illusion that helps us navigate the world we live in by virtue of the ""representational activities of the brain coupled with [projected outcomes]""-Bayesian computer algorithms can do amazing things (think IBM's Watson) but are unlikely to produce strong AI because, although their 'competence without comprehension' amazes us, without the recursion of projecting causes-and-effects that humans do, that hallmark self-awareness of human consciousness will be lacking...I think the premise of the book is the following (although the writing is convoluted enough this was never made clear to me!):Just like the eukaryotic cells came from an unlikely synergy of two separate simpler cells, human consciousness is the unlikely synergy of words/memes and the Bayesian processing that brains do to sort things out."

Dennett!I was lucky enough to find Dennett giving a lecture at the Psycholinguistics Institute of Nijmegen on Oct. 17th, a mere 3 hours by train from my native the Hague. This of course was an opportunity I could not afford to miss, and so I attended the lecture along with my good friend and fellow pseudo-philosopher Leon Grant. The lecture was specifically regarding this book, and so while reading it I had a nice overview given for a public audience already making the relevant neural connections and Bayesian inference in my brain. I had the honour of talking to Dennett while he was signing my copy of 'Consciousness Explained', and asked him about my dilemma between studying either Neuroscience or Philosophy. His reply was, ""I have many students that have finished their PhD's and are now looking into studying Philosophy as they did not find the answers to their questions in Neuroscience"". 2. A family dilemma...- I had just finished reading the section of the book pertaining the nature of human consciousness, and for those unbeknownst of the work of Dennett he is quite the physicalist, specifically when it comes to questions on free-will and our conscious perception. Currently staying at my religious grandparents, I was asked at the breakfast table to tell about the book I was currently reading. To further ground my personal understanding of the concepts in the book, I gave a thorough explanation on the evolution of their minds, along with the cultural evolution of thoughts and ""memes"" or abstract symbionts of information. Stating that the brain is no more than a biological mass that has been hijacked by informational parasites that seek to be spread, that created our cognitive architecture, creating a manifest view of the world, allow us to be ""competent with comprehension"". Eventually concluding that consciousness is no more than an oversimplified user illusion of the output of the unimaginably complex nature of our cognition. Free-will being something that is not allowed for through our consciousness as it has no causal link to the informational processing of our brains. Later that afternoon my grandmother approached me with two books, one of a pastor, and one of the Dalai Lama, stating that it would be better for my future if I had read these books first...2.0 The Book  I am in no regards an expert on this topic, and so cannot say much on the validity of the arguments presented in this book. I am aware that there is an academic war going on between thinkers such as Dennett and Harris, or Chalmers, something he often hinted at in both his talks and his books, and I am looking forward to reading the argumentation on the other side of the aisle. I can however review this books in terms of how it reads for a Philosophy of Mind beginner, in terms of how well the concepts are explained and being a semi-'popular science' book, how enjoyable it was to read. The concepts investigated in this book are definitely challenging, it starts off easy, explaining basic evolutionary theory, with small intrusions of philosophy regarding the definition of a 'reason' or the darwinian inversion of reasoning. The book progresses into the notion of cultural evolution, and how the recent endosymbiotic relation of Homo sapien and 'memes' allowed for complex thought and a method for introspection. This contains fairly complex philosophical reasoning but nothing that cant be understood with careful and critical reading (the average reading time of a page was 1 min. 20 sec. an all time high). In the conclusion of the book there is no answer provided as to how exactly a phenomenal experience arises from our perception of the manifest reality (what we think to see). But the reasons that we do have a conscious perception of the manifest reality, in the sense that it is an abstraction of the scientific reality is explained in a satisfactory manner. I specifically found the parts of the book that regard our communication as a beneficiary and need of our conscious perception to be especially interesting. Eventually giving this book 5/5 stars because of its bearing of light on truths that are reasoned against my own intuition of belief. Why read a Franz Kafka to be unsettled when you can read a Dennett and be violently dethroned from our human superiority complex in terms of the nature of your very perception of reality, our being."
10,0393355500,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2704424-nick-klagge,4,"This is one of those books that I really liked, wanted to write a great review for, and consequently put off writing the review for way too long! I am remedying that now, not by writing a great review, but by writing a review.Dennett's purpose in the book is to sketch an outline of how consciousness as humans experience it could have grown out of a purely mechanistic process. This has been a focus of much of his work for decades, but he says in this book that he wants to attempt a summation, and that recent research can provide further support for things he has talked about in the past.The book is certainly too rich for me to summarize adequately here, but I will mention a few things. First, the concept of ""memes"" plays a huge role, and if you think memes are cat pictures, UR DOIN IT RONG. This was the first extended serious treatment of memetic theory that I've read, and I felt pretty amenable to it. More or less the idea is that there are patterns of thought that can reproduce themselves in other minds via communication, that there is some type of mutation that goes on when such a pattern is translated from one mind to another, and that these patterns have differential success in durably reproducing themselves in other minds. These patterns, or memes, can be a really wide range of things, from songs that get stuck in your head to big concepts like agriculture. The three characteristics I listed above are the same ones that Darwin describes regarding genes, and themselves are sufficient to produce natural selection effects. It's a little harder to think about memes than genes, but I'd be hard-pressed to argue against the premises and conclusion that memes reproduce and are subject to natural selection just like genes.Second, I'll mention the three ""strange inversions"" that Dennett kind of structures the book around. These are conceptual breakthroughs that he sees as paving the way for a theory of the evolution of minds. First is Darwin's own inversion, which says that you can have ""reasons without reasoners."" The concept of natural selection allows us to say that a certain type of bird has a long beak ""so that"" it can drink nectar from a certain flower, without ascribing that reasoning to any conscious actor. Second is Turing's inversion, which says that you can have ""competence without comprehension."" A Turing machine shows us that it is possible for an entity to do arithmetic (and much more complex tasks!) while demonstrably just following a deterministic set of instructions. Finally, and maybe most interestingly, is Hume's inversion. I don't think Dennett gave a catchy description of this one like the other two. But this inversion is the understanding that many things that we feel we ""perceive in the outside world"" are really only internal to us, including the perception of causation, sexiness, cuteness, sweetness, etc.Anyway, if you want to get a deeper sense of the argument, read the book! Last, I want to mention a few interesting quotes from the end, where Dennett is talking about the implications of ""thinking"" technology, particularly modern advancements such as deep learning.""The real danger, I think, is not that machines more intelligent than we are will usurp our role as captains of our destinies, but that we will over-estimate the comprehension of our latest thinking tools, prematurely ceding authority to them far beyond their competence."" (402)""Systems that deliberately conceal their shortcuts and gaps of incompetence should be deemed fraudulent, and their creators should go to jail for the crime of creating or using an artificial intelligence that impersonates a human being."" (403) - This is astonishingly close to the commandment of the Butlerian Jihad in Dune, ""Thou shalt not create a machine in the likeness of a human mind""!"
11,0393355500,http://goodreads.com/user/show/44021534-jules-findlay,2,"There is very little about Bacteria, even less about Bach. Dennett revisits his arguments to date, combining them into a fairly long-winded and non-essential worldview. It’s the same reductive materialist ontology that permeates all of his work. He attempts to explain away the problem of consciousness, accusing us of being faillible to ‘Cartesian gravity’. In other words there is no such things as ‘I’. Our minds are thousands of tiny robots dancing and self-control is an illusion. The mind isn’t composed, as Descartes argued, of something other than matter, but matter itself. Our inventions and societies are top down intelligent design from bottom-up evolution; only now are we beginning to understand that our competence can be comprehended. The designed have become the designers, and it is physical processes that give rise to phenomenal character, nothing else. Honestly I would give this one a miss and try some of his other books. Cue the haters. "
12,0393355500,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1045774-mehrsa,4,"I love the way Dennett thinks and reasons. He is the king of finding good analogies to explain difficult concepts. It's just a joy to hear him think through problems and offer counter arguments and reason his way through problems. I loved his other books and a friend recommended I read this one after I was over the moon about The Human Instinct by Miller. And perhaps if I had read this one first, I would love loved it, but the Miller book was so much more profound than this one. The promise of this book is incredibly ambitious--how does conscious come about? but the answer is sort of flat and predictable--just evolution and in the same way as other animals. I mean, yes, I agree with the answer, but he seems to evade or dismiss most claims of human superiority as just thinking we're special. Miller goes much further in explaining consciousness while never straying from a strictly evolutionary standpoint. So I would say read that one. "
13,0393355500,http://goodreads.com/user/show/26929453-todd,2,"There are great ideas in here, but they are not presented in a clear or convincing way. Some people may find Dennett's (somewhat subversive) writing style enjoyable, but I find it tedious and meandering. It is more of a clearinghouse of the author's scholarly knowledge than any organized idea or thesis. Try the first chapter and see if it works for you. I expected the intro to be a bit more scattered than the rest of the book, but unfortunately it never gets any better.That said, some of his metaphors make more and more sense as the book progresses such as the computer desktop interface model of higher thought process."
14,0393355500,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5594877-jl,2,"Way too much ""I/Me""; the author obviously likes to ""hear"" himself write. Frequently incomprehensibly didactic, and purposefully pedantic. Sample sentence: ""We won't have a complete science of consciousness until we can align our manifest-image identifications of mental states by their contents with scientific-image identifications of the subpersonal information structures and events that are causally responsible for generating the details of the user-illusion we take ourselves to operate in."" Riiiiiight."
15,0393355500,http://goodreads.com/user/show/16212136-peter-pete-mcloughlin,5,"First I really enjoyed the book even though many felt Dennett circled around topics too much. I enjoyed the circling around an idea and looking at it from different angles. Like a diamond with many facets explaining big topics like origins of life, language, consciousness are gonna take a careful dissection. I also get the vibe that Dennett is used to being distorted or misunderstood so he wanted to nail his case. His story on consciousness is actually quite plausible. I think Graziano whose book I read recently is a bit more direct and easily understood on explaining the hard problem of consciousness and uses language that can get through to even a qualia freak like myself but I think Dennett gives so much more detailed description of evolution, neuroscience, artificial intelligence, and philosophy that you get all kinds of interesting digressions some people might be turned off by all the diversions but I enjoyed it. Although in the end, I think Graziano explains for me the same solution to the hard problem a bit more intuitively. I will leave a link to his book on Goodreads.https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/4..."
16,0393355500,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1054712-kent-winward,4,"Dennett continues more on how our consciousness is an emergent property of evolution, but the thing that struck me the most was the underlying implication that our consciousness seems to arise almost outside ourselves. Without language and social structure, we don't have consciousness. Our body remembers early childhood trauma, our mind does not. Our first conscious memories only come until we are three or four as we first start to realize we are part of a bigger world. (This is my musings, not Dennett's.) We have limited thinking that our thoughts arise out of our brains, but our brains are designed for helping us an organism survive in the world. As a survival mechanism, socialization and language for humans has proven extremely effective. Awareness has levels and the ability to self-talk only can come after we learn to talk to others. Somehow in this process consciousness emerges, but it is more than just our brains that creates this, it is our surroundings and other humans. Consciousness is something we share. "
17,0393355500,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1339246-gendou,3,"This book explores the evolution of the human mind. Unfortunately, Dennett isn't an evolutionary biologist, so it's mostly driven by philosophical questions. Sometimes those questions have answers, other times, frustratingly, they do not. This isn't as well organized as other books/arguments by Dennett. It reuses a lot of material from his other books.I'd recommend this one for anyone who isn't convinced that the human mind evolved."
18,0393355500,http://goodreads.com/user/show/38288046-sopyka,2,"This book feels it's made only of Prefaces. Every chapters so far is explaining why he's writing the book and asking readers not to be angry with him for what he's writing.Write something of substance and let me decide if I want to be angry!And I'm getting sick of authors explaining why they've chosen a guy (ie. Bach) over a woman. I am looking for a book on the brain, I don't care if it's male or female.Have some balls and state your opinion."

21,0393355500,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1954093-phyllis,3,"First of all, dense and hard to read. Second, a little too much academic squabbling. But, third, very interesting. "
22,0393355500,http://goodreads.com/user/show/71924987-payel-kundu,2,"This book is Dennett looking back on a long and prolific career, and summarizing what he has learned. Except it seems like Dennett has given up all ambition of being concise. This book was too long, and pretty self-indulgent. In classic Dennett style, he spends a lot of the book laying out the criticisms of his work, and then refuting them, which gives a nice logical structure to the book. However, there was absolutely nothing new. The point of it seems to be like a reference book, in case you wanted the current thinking on this topic compiled in one place for easy reference. But for that, it’s terrible, because the organization is chatty, not really reference. And Dennett is not a scientist in a relevant field, but rather an enthusiastic amateur. It kind of left me wondering who this book was written for. The world’s two remaining neuroscientists who don’t agree with his argument that the mind is composed of tiny automatons without comprehension of their own? It’s surely not for a dualist lay-person as I found the book fairly dense even as a practicing scientist in the field. Overall, interesting enough because Dennett is a good writer, but not a book I will remember or recommend. "
23,0393355500,http://goodreads.com/user/show/24870603-jan,4,"Dennett’s valiant and probably ultimate attempt at convincing us of his views on consciousness, which he generously admits are rather outlandish. Although, like most people, I don’t agree with his conclusions, his arguments leading up to those conclusions are valuable insights into the evolutionary process and are interesting to read.His reasoning is more or less as follows: Life is information processing that produces design from the bottom up, by the blind, purposeless algorithm of natural selection, from the simplest microbes to complex multicellular organisms and social organisms like ants, and the intelligent adaptive bevaviour displayed by all these organisms. All this implies what Dennett calls ‘free-floating reasons’. A bacterium swims towards food in order to eat. It has a reason and a purpose, even though in fact it’s just a mechanism. A bird is more advanced. It has a representation of its environment, which is not the real, scientific image but a manifest image that improves its capacity to interact with it and survive. It acts as if it is wounded to distract the predator from its eggs, so it does it for a reason, although without being aware of it. Without actually understanding that reason. It's competence without comprehension. But even though it does not understand the reason, it is there, and it’s very useful to use this concept to describe its behaviour. Human beings have evolved a complex brain that resembles an ant colony. It produces very complex, adaptive, intelligent behaviour. These brains are used by memes, which enable cultural evolution by thinking tools like language, vastly extending their thinking power to abstract concepts and real understanding of the free-floating reasons. We can think about reasons, and we can think about thinking about reasons, and we can, for the first time in the history of life, carry out top down intelligent design. We can even build computers that can think, and have free-floating reasons, though no true comprehension, because they are just mechanisms that compute.Now instead of taking the introspective view and wondering at the mystery of how we humans can actually really understand, Dennett proposes, as usual, to take the third person, scientific view, from which our reasons are also just free-floating reasons. Consciousness is our manifest image. A ‘user illlusion’ constituted by the brain's activity. Like the desktop icons that symbolize the computations of ones and zeros in a computer, the manifest image consists of icons that symbolize the scientific image of physics.In this last step he loses me, because taking the third person view of consciousness is not to explain it but to lose sight of it. Consciousness just ís the first person, subjective view. It seems to me that pretending to take an objective, third person view and then call yourself an illusion is not done because it’s in any way plausible, but only in order to ‘explain away’ consciousness and try to save the doctrine of materialism.I would say the manifest image is the contents of consciousness. It's everything we experience. It's not consciousness itself. I agree with people like David Chalmers that this seems to fall outside all the categories of physics. I don't believe in dualism or panpsychism either. I do think consciousness is fundamental rather than 'matter', and I think a proper view of reality that may lead to a real theory of everything is best given by a form of idealism."
24,0393355500,http://goodreads.com/user/show/40019240-jan-vantilburg,4,"Very interesting ideas and theories! Although it took way too long to get Back from Bach!Much of the book is leading up to the concluding chapers. As interesting as the preceding were, they could have been much shorter. My main reason to read this book was the sub tittle: The Evolution of Minds.And to some degree the book delivered! There are explanations given where consciousness comes from and how understanding evolves.Although Dennett does admit: ..”the goal of delineating and explaining our stack of competences via bottom-up neuroscience alone is remote”.A degree of speculation does exist.For me the revelation was that consciousness comes gradually upon mastering language.“The arrival of language sets the stage for a great moment in evolutionary history: the origin of comprehension”.Dennett then states that Comprehension is only made possible by the arrival of a new kind of evolutionary replicator: culturally transmitted informational entities: memes.Words are the basic memes.And that in turn also affects the neurological pathways in the brain. Language evolved to fit the brain before the brain evolved to better accommodate language.For Dennett no “spark” that originates consciousness. It is a gradual process upon learning a language. All there is, is the material brain. Consciousness explained!The practise of sharing information in communicative action with others, giving and demanding reasons, is what creates our personal user-illusions.Communication makes our manifest image manifest to us! The self becomes apparent.Dennett used the concept of the computer throughout the book as a comparison to the brain. And it does help to clarify how our brain works. An intriguing thought came up then.About the soul (suppose it exist). If an AI becomes sentient, able to perceive or feel things, does it have a soul then?This is no issue for materialists but I wonder what dualists would make of it?(am now reading the book “Do Androids dream of Electric Sheeps” by Philip K. Dick written in 1968) in which androids can be detected because of their lack of empathy. Empathy is stated as one of the defining qualities of humans)From Bacteria => Competence without Comprehension, Natural Selection via Evolution to Bach => Comprehension, Top Down Design and Back => much of humanities current tools (computers et.al.) are not understood anymore. Research is done by multidisciplinary teams. One can not understand all of science anymore. Some concepts:Carthesian: means of or relating to the French philosopher René Descartes—from his Latinized name Cartesius.Descartes said: “I think, therefore I am”. Dualistic.The Carthesian wound is then materialism. There is no separate soul. From this Dennetts Carthesian Gravity is derived. The pull that humans feel towards dualism. This concept keeps on coming back in this book. And I had difficulty grasping it. Now I understand.Also to keep in mind, this is not a why narrative but a “how come”. The book is not about morality."
25,0393355500,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3093693-angie-boyter,0,"I have enjoyed many of Dennett's books, but I DID NOT LAST LONG AT ALL in this one )which is why I decided not to give it a star rating. MAYBE it got better.)! It seems everything in his writing that has annoyed me at all is here in spades. One is his EXTENDED use of what he considers clever metaphors that he is so proud of he grinds them into the ground and that I too often do not find very apt, like his term ""Cartesian gravity"", which I initially had trouble understanding and then decided was not worth the trouble after I figured it out!A part of my annoyance is that the book was poorly edited. There are too many editorial errors of the sort I might see in an ARC but not in a finished work. For example, I looked for Cartesian gravity in the index, and it said it began on page 15. It actually began on page 16, not a big deal, but no excuse in today's electronic world. Other errors may have been harder to spot and just made it harder to follow his thoughts. In addition to mechanical issues, though, he does things like using a puzzle about crossing a bridge as an example of a puzzle that has a retrospectively obvious solution. He gives the full problem---and then never provides the solution (Fortunately, Wikipedia did.). Using the puzzle at all and the retrospectively obvious solution was a digression not relevant to his subject, and the frequency of his digressions made the book all that much harder to follow.My bottom line is that I felt I was listening to the rambling musings of a very smart man who has a bit too much age on him to attempt a book like this without more editorial intervention than he apparently received."
26,0393355500,http://goodreads.com/user/show/71935584-ben-zimmerman,1,"Daniel Dennett, as a philosopher, is known for engaging a bit more with cognitive scientists and evolutionary biologists in forming his ideas, which made this work look interesting to me. I've read some of his work in the past, and my understanding is that he takes a stance that consciousness is an illusion, which has always been a contentious position and one that is difficult for me personally to understand (an illusion for whom? aren't illusions something?). I decided to read this book to see if I could get a better handle on it. I couldn't.Because he wants to explain human consciousness through a naturalistic account, he spends a lot of the book talking about the process of evolution. He starts with discussing the process of evolution, and then its application to biology and intelligent life in the early chapters, and then moves on to the idea of memes and cultural evolution in the middle chapters, which is the meat of the book. Then the climax is his discussion about the emergence and comprehension of consciousness and speculations on the ""post-intelligent design"" world. My opinion is that most of the good parts of this book have been done better by other authors - e.g. Dawkins with natural selection, memes also by Dawkins, and also Jonnie Hughes in the ""On the Origin of Teepees."" The ""post-intellient design"" world by a vast array of science fiction writers and Kurzweil. There was some good stuff about relating meaning and intention, which I haven't been exposed to in pop science and I also really liked the idea of the process of meme evolution co-evolving with our brains which harbor them. This is a really cool insight, although I'm unclear about if this is Dennett's original idea.The speculation that consciousness arises out of the need for an intentional stance is interesting, but I still can't understand the jump to using this to explain away conscious phenomena instead of just explaining conscious phenomena. I think my problem is just that I want to start from the phenomenon itself and Dennett doesn't. If a physicist explained gravity by saying, ""gravity is an illusion"", it wouldn't be very helpful. Instead they explain gravity through mathematical patterns that seem to explain the phenomenon, and in the end are left with something fundamental that is much more mysterious (e.g. a set of field equations that seem to be part of space for some reason). Explaining why these exist seems to be the ""hard question"" of physics, or if it turns out have some mathematical explanation, then the ""hard question"" is why does physical law follow mathematics. My feeling is that the ""hard question"" of consciousness is really similar! Even if I completely explain the mechanism behind my ""user illusion"", why does my ""user illusion"" of red appear red to me instead of blue? I was left unsatisfied with the conclusion of the book, and it took a long time to get there, with many side roads, which were only moderately interesting. It is a difficult book, requiring a lot of attention, and, in my opinion, with little pay-off."

Densely written but conversational in style, by the end of its 400 odd pages one is pressed to recall what Chapter One was about. Dennett explores ground he has mostly covered before. Indeed, he self-references frequently. He also openly praises other thinkers and researchers, and openly discusses, albeit not at gossipy length, disagreements he has had with several of the Twentieth Centuries' scientific luminaries. Of course, this is countered by mentioning the luminaries who support his ideas.Perhaps the single human achievement which has most baffled my understanding and won my wholehearted admiration is the way babies learn language. There they lie, goo-gooing and drooling, but it turns out they learn on average seven words a day, and intuit/unravel the rules of grammar and syntax which later seem to baffle them as adults. Seven-year-olds often speak well, without using 'like' every third word, unlike (!) their future selves.Dennett explores this language learning, and learning in general, using the different model and relying heavily on the meme of language. If you are looking for speculation on the role of bacteria in Bach's genius, be warned neither Bach nor bacteria are much discussed. Although humor abounds, if you seek hearty chuckles, or are blessed with a brief attention span, spend your money and time elsewhere. But if your taste runs to asking why we think, how we think, or where artificial intelligence may come from and where it may lead us, I can offer this as Recommended."
29,0393355500,http://goodreads.com/user/show/23763493-r-ta,4,"Okay, so I do have a problem with Dennett's ideas. On the one hand, you can't easily deny his naturalistic perspective. In fact, he plays a role in my ""conversion"" into it. As a philosopher and cognitive scientist, he can collect and analyze data of evolutionary sciences quite adequately indeed. So speaking about physical information, everything fits pretty nicely and all. Many qualities about Homo sapiens are not that unique (in a sense that would appear magically), there is no need for special qualia and zombies, consciousness did not have distinct adaptational value, so it must just have been a by-product of evolution. It is a by-product, therefore not causally active, the only ""creator"" is evolution. Cool. But then he presents memes, which are somehow causally active. So on top of phylogenetical processes, of which we are oblivious and cannot change, we have this cultural memes stuff, by which we can impact our evolution. Our evolution of.... what? I sense a bit of this old idea ""biological evolution is now changed by cultural evolution"". Meh... weak. Philosophically speaking, the leap is just too big to summarize that so easily.I think he does not explain comprehensively enough how physical/cultural evolving co-exist since modern human came. From an anthropological point of view, such vacuity makes the meme concept theoretically useless as a tool for understanding cultural evolution.This is not the first Dennett's book I read, but he still does not convince me with this meme's concept. Apart from this, he still is one of the strongest thinkers on evolution. "
30,0393355500,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7605433-stephen-palmer,2,"I wanted to like this. I should have liked it. I didn't much like it.I've enjoyed this brilliant author's previous work, not least the groundbreaking 'Consciousness Explained,' but this... this has great substance, yet the writing is terrible. Every paragraph is broken up with digressions, stuff in brackets - even a single question mark in one instance - and more utterly unnecessary stuff that any editor would ordinarily have excised. But Dennett's editor didn't. As a result, the book reads mostly like the half-assed ramblings of a doddery old professor.I'll say it again - the substance is great. The middle section didn't seem that important, but the opening and concluding chapters in particular were important and good. Dennett's thesis is that all explanations which posit a dividing line between mind stuff and brain stuff, as with Decartes' original concept, are misleading. He thinks the so-called Hard Question only appears if you take such positions. He also agrees with Nicholas Humphrey that the point of conscious, the reason for its existence, is that it makes things matter in human life. When you're in love with somebody, that person's highs and lows mean so much to you for exactly the same reason. You therefore make an effort for them, regardless of the circumstances. Similarly, the fact that consciousness is a user-illusion is no contradiction to the fact that we human beings matter to each other. For this insight, I applaud the author.In a nutshell: good substance, dire writing."
31,0393355500,http://goodreads.com/user/show/20246339-peter-a-van-tilburg,4,"It was a challenge to read it all because Dennett needs time to make his points. Only after some reading I understood his line of thinking. Further I think he is quite speculative. For instance with regard to the assumption that memes changed our brain structure, this is not supported by evidence like archeological,or brain survey how this could have happend. Also the working of the neurons is still very speculative I think we are only on the verge of discovering what takes place in our brain. With this little knowledge I think Dennett has far reaching conclusions already. Are nerurons the smallest entity in our brains and how do they work? I support further research fully and am anxious to learn what will be found.With all uncertainty still at hand he (like Dawkins) take an ontology where God has no place. I am not convinced that there is no entity like God. Science has not discovered Him yet and we know there is a lot to be discovered still. But if you put a premisse in your thinking at the start that there is no God than obvisiously you will not see Him. Stronger, you will do everything to reason Him out. I would expect a little more open mind. Further I read over and over again that there is a random goalless evolution but apparantly there is a goal and that is survival. For me it is hard to understand why survival is ‘baked’ into life. Where does that come from, for me it makes more sense that a mutation after occurring disappears because why would it take the bother to endure? This goal for me has something to do with God."
32,0393355500,http://goodreads.com/user/show/31081871-aldo-ojeda,3,"Part one of Dennett's book started slow, with a lot of explaining that I thought innecesary, or am I the only one who thought that the elevator analogy extended for too long? Maybe for me that's because I was already familiar with the subject and it wasn't necessary to convince me of ""Darwin's strange inversion of reasoning"".Something worth standing from all this was his example of how life could emerge not entirely at random, but from a somewhat regular system. Imagine the proverbial primeval soup, a pond with tides and currents, regular changes of temperatures and just the right ingredients floating around. In an enclosed system like this, the probabilty of proteines forming by chance increaces and from that, the first replicants could have been born.The book became interesting for me in part two, when Dennett started to explain about the emergance and evolution of lenguage. A series of grunts that slowly aquired meaning, forming the memes that make us humans and give us our sense of self. Something worth noting here about the illusion of conciouness, Dennett did a clear explanation of the heterophenomenology at the core of this illusion: we interpret our intentions and thoughts in the same way we interpret others' intentions and thoughts. Is just that simple.The book could have been 100 pages shorter, but if you are not familiar with the topics of evolution, conciousness and memetics, perhaps this is a good place to start."
33,0393355500,http://goodreads.com/user/show/15862910-steve-granger,4,"I have a great admiration for writers and thinkers like Daniel Dennett. Dennett's writing, like Bertrand Russell, is deceptively easy yet remarkably insightful. I cannot give this book a fair review because it deserves to be read at least twice more, but what I appreciate most of Dennett's approach to philosophy is how much effort he has made to consider all credible angles on ideas and his effort to escape the narrow focus of disciplines. This book is a great place to start with Dennett's work, as he practically summarizes everything he knows and has been considering over his career as a conscious(ness) explorer. Well worth reading if the philosophy of consciousness is something that interests you. "
34,0393355500,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3653446-joy-lawrance,4,"If you've ever wondered what ""consciousness"" is all about, Dennett explains HIS theory in this hefty tome. The development of the mind is a fascinating subject, and I really need a little higher IQ to understand ALL that he says, but I certainly got some good take-away information. One biggie: ""competence"" needs to precede ""comprehension"" - and not the other way around! He's also a believer in memetics - the ""culturally transmitted informational entities"" that shape the growth of knowledge. A heady read, but definitely some food for thought."
35,0393355500,http://goodreads.com/user/show/110433-socraticgadfly,2,"Meh, sounds like a lot of other Dennett, the new book does, including not only the repetitiveness and self-reference, but holding on to ideas long ditched elsewhere, like his claim that memes are something real.It's laughable. Near the end of a Guardian interview with him that accompanies his review, he laments how worrying over US politics has blocked him from doing new philosophy work.So, he's been worrying over US politics for 15-20 years then?"

43,0393355500,http://goodreads.com/user/show/39066355-craig-cowled,5,"This is a book that takes some time to digest. I've been reading it in short spurts over many months, allowing the deep subject matter to stew in my mind. Dan Dennett is a Professor of Philosophy at Tufts University and he has spent his very long career seeking to explain, among other things, how the brain produces mind. Dan's approach to this question is quite interesting. He insists on using scientific findings to direct his thinking and he avoids metaphysical prognostication.There is a school of thought in ""philosophy of mind"" studies that there exists a so called hard problem of consciousness. The hard problem of consciousness was described by Prof David Chalmers, an Australian philosopher at ANU, as the subjective experience of awareness that transcends the physical. Chalmers uses the label qualia to describe this subjective feeling that arises in our minds when we experience the world. He believes the nature of qualia is fundamentally different to physical matter and that, as a consequence, consciousness must be a foundational property of the cosmos.""Hogwash,"" says Dennett. According to Dennett, the hard problem of consciousness isn't hard, but it is difficult to get your head around it. The reason it is difficult is because our conscious experience is so compelling in its richness and detail that we are driven to believe that there is an internal observer, the self, which is the beneficiary of all the sensations and emotions we experience and which, importantly, is the author of all our thoughts, dreams and desires. We believe so strongly in this autonomous self, a belief enforced and maintained by a culture which rewards the worthy and punishes the unworthy, that we almost instinctively avow a metaphysical theory of mind. That is, we feel sure that there is something spiritual and ineffable about 'mind' which simply cannot be explained by the wet, meaty stuff in our 'brain'.The apparent duality of mind and brain has led to a widespread and persistent belief in dualism. René Descartes described dualism in a way that has resonated with Western philosophy for centuries. According to his view, which is shared by Chalmers, reality consists of matter stuff and mind stuff. It is quite understandable how dualism gains traction in our thinking when you consider the experience of death. One moment the body, made of matter, is breathing, moving and speaking and a moment later it is still and lifeless. It certainly seems obvious that some 'thing' has left the body at the point of death. This phenomena continues to support belief in souls and spirits to this day.Is there any evidence of a ghost in the human machine? The short answer is no. The evidence from controlled experiments in neuroscience indicates that the conscious mind becomes aware of decisions after the brain has already made the decision. To use a metaphor, our consciousness is like the surface of a wave. The surface of the wave is not the cause of the wave. It is where it is because of everything happening beneath the surface.Dennett's book is his latest attempt to synthesise the lessons of science into an explanation of how mind comes from brain. Dennett draws on three ""strange inversions of reason"" in the history of science and philosophy. I'll give a paragraph to each of these.Firstly, there is Darwin's strange inversion of reason from the 'trickle down' hypothesis of Intelligent Design to the 'bubble up' theory of Evolution. Darwin noted that there was variation of traits within a population of any given species. He also noted that individuals within the population struggle to survive within their environment. Darwin's key insight was that certain traits provide some individuals within that population an advantage, improving their chances of passing those traits onto future generations. To use a construction analogy, evolution is like a crane building up from the foundation and Intelligent Design is like a skyhook.Secondly, there is Turing's strange inversion of reason. Turing is the father of modern computing. What he showed, which we all now experience everyday with our smartphones and laptops, is that a perfect computing machine does not need to have any comprehension in order to do arithmetic.Thirdly, there is Hume's strange inversion of reason. Our conscious experience consists of a flow of moments in time. We observe things happening all of the time and we instinctively attribute causes to the things that happen. The cause - effect relationship is so fundamental to our experience, but Hume says that we never experience cause and effect, we only ever experience each moment. The cause - effect relationships we perceive are actually a projection from our minds onto the world. We do this, says Hume, because we have come to expect outcomes from certain actions. And this is Hume's inversion of reason, that, in a metaphorical sense, we project our expectations onto the objects of the natural world. We taste honey and say that it is sweet. The sweetness of honey is not an intrinsic property of honey. There is nothing about the molecules of honey that is, in essence, sweet. We have projected the attribute of sweetness onto the honey as part of our ontology, our 'way of being'.According to Dennett, these three strange inversions of reason provide us with the tools to understand how our conscious experience arises from brain stuff.Evolution through natural selection (Darwin's strange inversion) builds biology from the simplest of replicating forms to the amazingly diverse range of species we have today, of which humans are the beneficiaries of large and intricately wired brains.Our nervous system is stimulated by billions of neuron spikes in any given moment. These spikes result in a cascade of spikes throughout the brain, known as spike trains. Some of these spikes represent external things (i.e., sight, sound, touch, taste, smell), bodily sensations, responses from the brain's memory centres, and various layers of representations of those representations. There is no reason to suspect that individual neurons are somehow self-aware or conscious as they go about their business of responding to stimulus time and time again. The billions of neurons in our brain are competent without having comprehension (Turing's strange inversion).Some neuronal connections could fire in response to say the colour blue, a baby's face, the concept of multiplication, the word 'self', or a directive to contract a specific muscle. Every firing between two neurons strengthens the connection. The strength of the connections between neurons is a measure of the degree of expectation regarding the likelihood of that connection firing again. In this way, our brains develop expectations which can be triggered without any external stimulus, as happens with optical illusions.Most of the spike trains in our brain have no apparent impact on our conscious experience (e.g., regulatory processes in the medulla oblongata for respiration and circulation). Some of the neural spikes in our brain, however, are clearly correlated with consciousness. Our conscious experience seems to consist of representations that have been filtered through many levels of brain processes in many parts of the brain yielding a projection (Hume's strange inversion) into ""subjective space"". There is no need, according to Dennett, to ask the what, where, or how of subjective space. Doing so is a violation of Occam's razor because the subjective space adds nothing to our understanding other than a smug satisfaction that we have control of our brains when the reality is that our brains control us.Dennett does think the ""what for"" question is interesting, though. He suggests that our conscious experience is available to us to facilitate communication with each other. That is, having access to our own conscious experience helps us to share with other people what we are thinking, what we are planning, how we are feeling, and how we might be able to cooperate to make our lives better and enhance our chances of survival. Consciousness, in this view, is for others; not merely for our own benefit, but for the benefit of our social species.From Bacteria to Bach and Back is a difficult, thought-provoking read. Dennett's style is somewhat rambling as he advances the various prongs of his argument a little at a time, before back-tracking and carrying his argument a little further. He spends a great deal of the book attempting to point out the fallacies in our thinking that are a result of our conditioning. While reading this book, I found that I needed to take a break from time to time, re-read sections, and cogitate.In my view, Dennett's argument is quite convincing; however, I don't think he has captured the whole picture just yet. For one thing, research continues on the physical structure of brains (i.e., the connectome, and neuroglia, etc.), neuroscience, cognitive psychology, and artificial intelligence. I suspect that our understanding of consciousness will improve as the science progresses. I'm not entirely sure that Dennett is on the money, but he does seem to be on the right track. I will be particularly interested to see experimental results testing the validity of qualia.I'll leave you with a fascinating 2017 experiment by Roman Yampolskiy available in pre-print on arXiv titled, ""Detecting Qualia in Natural and Artificial Agents."" Using the hypothesis that the ability to be fooled by an illusion is an indicator that an 'agent' has a kind of subjective experience, which is not based on the real world, Yampolskiy shows that some deep neural networks can be fooled by optical illusions into seeing something that is not there. I'm not convinced that this is actually a demonstration of conscious AI, but it might be a rudimentary precursor on the pathway to conscious AI."
44,0393355500,http://goodreads.com/user/show/25525237-jim-robles,5,"A great read by one of the, if not the, preeminent philosophers of our time. Five stars!Of course the unanswerable questions remain unanswered. It is the journey that matters.From p. 371: ""If the brain was so simple we could understand it, we would be so simple we couldn't."" - Emerson M. Pugh, The Biological Origin of Human Values. I am inclined to agree that no entity/machine can understand itself. Also from p. 379: What I cannot create, I do not understand. - Ricard Feynmam.I disagree with Professor Dennett's assertion (p. 375 -388) that collaboration and tools are letting us create things that nobody fully understands. Of course our definition of ""fully"" is critical here. I have created computer programs (thermal models) whose computations I could not duplicate in my lifetime: that does not translate to I do not fully understand the results and how they were derived. Learning computers are a new challenge, but even here that act in accordance with their human programing. I have also been the architect developing (mechanical/electrical) avionics architectures trading mechanical/electrical options (as opposed to processor/network or software (options) across development cost, unit recurring cost, operation & support cost, performance, weight, volume, reliability, integrity and ease of technology insertion. Yes there were experts in each field on the team, who contributed specialized knowledge. Having said that such design teams are not democracies. The only place where there is enough bandwidth to pick the optimum solution, across the trade space, is in the brain of a single human being: AKA the architect. If the architect does not understand, although less absorbed in the details that the specialist, the architecture design could not be achieved. Again yes: there is a tiered structure of such architectures, but at each level there is an architect who understands their components at that level.I also had the opportunity to discuss mathematical proofs with a prominent mathematician at a Tier I university, who frequently collaborates with mathematicians in other specialties, who disagreed sharply with Professor Dennett's assertion that nobody understands the entire proof.""My overarching claim in this book is that the evolutionary perspective in general and the memetic perspective with regard to culture transform some of the apparently eternal puzzles of life, that is, meaning and consciousness, in way inaccessible to those who never look beyond the manifest image that hey grew up with and the disciplines they were trained in"" (p. 242-243). This just plays to my preconceptions: in much of what I have read and heard, about free will and consciousness, I have been struck the the lack of consideration of the evolutionary imperative.""The ultimate origin(s) of language and the orign(s) of life are still unsolved problems, . . . ."" (p. 265).I am a Stoic. We believe that our ""rights"" inhere in our ability to use language. There is a great deal here on the decisive difference between humans and other species. In particular ""Their motives may well be honorable - they are eager to expand the circle of the beings owed moral consideration because they can suffer - but until we can identify the important features, the features that matter, and explain why, this gesture is worse than empty"" (p. 337-338). Take that PETA! Beyond that it seems that our very human consciousness is a consequence of our communication by speaking.I read this as agreeing that we have autonomy but not ""free will,"" in the sense that we can pursue what we want, given environmental and other constraints, but we cannot change what we want. This may be disturbing to some, but it is not new. Paul acknowledges this in Romans 7-15:New International VersionI do not understand what I do. For what I want to do I do not do, but what I hate I do.New Living TranslationI don't really understand myself, for I want to do what is right, but I don't do it. Instead, I do what I hate.This and more at:http://biblehub.com/romans/7-15.htmMy Father ran into, and was ""cleaned out"" by, a shell game practitioner on a trip to Spain.

Also see p. 264 on ""bees"" to see how distance runners (Cro-Mangons)obliterated football players (Neanderthals).""Human culture started out profoundly Darwinian, with uncomprehending competences generating various valuable structures in roughly the way termites build their castles"" (p. 282-283).""And once you have a habit of going into question-posing mode, all your R&D becomes much more top-down, using more directed research, and relying less on random variation and retention"" (p. 297).""Here is yet another strange inversion: this practice of sharing information in communicative actions with others, giving and demanding reasons, is what creates our personal user-illusions"" (p. 343).""McFarland . . . . explaining ourselves to others is the novel activity that generates the R&D that creates the architecture of human consciousness. . . .""

45,0393355500,http://goodreads.com/user/show/11041240-zarathustra-goertzel,4,"Good book that details how minds and their subsidiary competences might come about.He has a passionate fetish for ""strange inversions"": competence without comprehension, designerless designs, et cetera.In other words, ""adaptation to the enivronment"" leads to ""designerless designs"", and we arrive at agent-free telealogy.In Soviet Russian words make you. Words are digital memes.All in all, his vision is fairly clear and lucid. Santa Danny is on the right track, making pretty decent headway.The vision alone would win him 4-5 stars.

No!We must know everyone who messes up, and how absurd Santa Danny finds them.Some of the ad-hominem is snuck in without explanation, so only those ""in the know"" will really notice what he's talking about.Moreover, he generally ""explains away"" disagreement with him by suggesting people just ""can't get it"" due to ""cartesian gravity"" or some other cognitive bias they just can't get over.Yes, thanks. I want to hear about how I am delusional if I don't agree with you after reading your book. Another possibility is that people are biased against Santa Danny because he's a douchebag. Hmm...Unfortunately, Dennett seems to go easy on himself. He seems not to apply the same level of sceptical scrutiny to his own ideas as he does to others, or at least he gives himself leeway in how he personally expresses them. Fortunately, these negatives are mostly concentrated in the start of the book. He is most likely the reason some people come to dislike ""reductionism"" as well.Occam's Razor applied to an extreme becomes its own sort of awkward bias, as you go out on a limb to, say, concoct an explanation with the 'smallest parts possible'. Is it still the simplest explanation?What does it mean to ""assume nothing""?A common case is the sceptic who doubts all observations about dogs until they are observed in the laboratory. Thus they will deny various capacities nearly every dog owner observes as they have not been satisfactorily verified in the lab yet. Of course the intent is to avoid athropomorphising and assuming too much capabilities. Yet why is assuming, obviously, too little a ""good approach""?One reason I read this book is that on topics of ""qualia"" and consciousness, Dennett seems to go 95% of the way and cut-off. (As well as general curiosity in the formation of minds :))Reading this book, it became apparent that the reason he leaves the icing out is because he's got his nose stuck in a ""war with dualists"" and fears using any wording that might give them any fodder against him. **cue the collective sigh**Anyway, he basically goes there (provided one has learned to read between the lines).He generally uses the ""manifest image"" and ""what it's like to be X"" rather than the gloss for the latter ""qualia"", as, well, we all know the term is kinda awkward. Although in arguing against the term ""qualia"" he essentially strawmans it or conflates it with some particular interpretation of ""qualia"" rather than simply regarding it as a gloss for ""what it's like to be X"" (as per the WIkipedia opening sentence definition). A shame he doesn't provide adequate scrutiny to his own rhetorical sleights. He seems to like the term ""user illusion"" for ""self/world model"", which is in line with his predilection with ""human/cognitive errors and delusions"". In my opinion, ""user interface"" would still sound better. To my surprise, he actually asserts The Hard Problem of Consiousness as a crucial component to the study of Mind and Consciousness! He was just nit-picking about the wording all along. Go figure: ""We won't have a complete science of consciousness until we align our manifest image identifications of mental states by their contents with scientific image identifications of the subpersonal information structures and events that are causally responsible for generating the user illusion we take ourselves to operate in.""All-in-all, he talks about the hard problem, qualia, and the Combination Problem -- simply in his own words. Questioning the ""cosmic divide"" between conscious, feeling, thinking entities like humans and stones, with grizzy bears somewhere in-between, Dennett suggests remaining agnostic. However, if he has to choose, he seems to come out on the side of ""why assume there's some cosmic divide?""Basically, he is on the panpsychist side of things. The reason he stops at 95% it appears is largely due to wanting to be careful. He wants to word things right, without risking saying ""too much"" with the wrong word choice.He mentions 2nd person consciousness studies (which Ben G has described in more lush detail).Ultimately, his view is fairly cogent and probably worth taking some time to see (before moving on) :).

46,0393355500,http://goodreads.com/user/show/111124452-mehdi,4,"In this compelling essay, Dennett takes his readers on a journey through time and space, from the competent yet uncomprehending bacteria to the semi-intelligent designers that we are, and back. As a newbie in the world of philosophical literature, I must say this book was both a revelation and a struggle. Dennett's ideas, thorough research, and his scientific and philosophical insights have given me a lot of food for thought (What is consciousness? What does set humans and other animals apart? How does cultural evolution differ from natural evolution?). I will definitely explore the topic more in the future.The struggle came from Dennett's writing style, hence my 4-star rating. On multiple occasions, I had the feeling that he had made his sentences and vocabulary unnecessarily sophisticated and, at times, difficult to understand for someone who isn't used to reading philosophy books. His overuse of brackets and m-dashes to add in comments, thoughts or details within sentences make them difficult to follow. Overall, I was not sure what audience he was targetting, whether it was the accomplished philosophy student, or an educated general audience.Reading some online summaries helped me push through the tough passages, and the journey was worth the trouble. I think Dennett is well aware of the difficulty of his topic, and I am grateful for the brief reviews and the final summary that he included in his book."
47,0393355500,http://goodreads.com/user/show/64785453-andrei-khrapavitski,5,"Finished reading “From Bacteria to Bach and Back,” the latest book by philosopher Daniel Dennett. It is a very readable volume for anyone interested in the problem of consciousness and evolution of the mind. It is also a great summary of Dennett’s many other works with some nice additions and references to some of the latest achievements in AI and CRISPR technologies. The mystery of consciousness still remains pretty much unresolved. This book will hardly push science any closer to resolving this conundrum, but it summarizes much of what is currently known or theorized in neuroscience and cognitive philosophy.For those unfamiliar with Dennett’s ideas, it is noteworthy to consider what he terms three strange inversions of reasoning. First, it’s Darwin’s blind processes of natural selection. Evolution by natural selection can uncover reasons without reasoners. Just think about it. That’s pretty much how we got to where we are today. Nature itself has demonstrated what Dennett calls “competence without comprehension. Now we do have comprehension. How come brains made of billions of neurons without any top-down control system could ever develop into human-style minds? Dennett explores the prospect of decentralized, distributed control by neurons equipped to fend for themselves, including as one possibility feral neurons, released from their previous role as docile, domesticated servants under the selection pressure created by a new environmental feature: cultural invaders. Words striving to reproduce, and other memes, would provoke adaptations, such as revisions in brain structure in coevolutionary response. Once cultural transmission was secured as the chief behavioral innovation of our species, it not only triggered important changes in neural architecture but also added novelty to the environment— in the form of thousands of Gibsonian affordances— that enriched the ontologies of human beings and provided in turn further selection pressure in favor of adaptations— thinking tools— for keeping track of all these new opportunities. Cultural evolution itself evolved away from undirected or “random” searches toward more effective design processes, foresighted and purposeful and dependent on the comprehension of agents: intelligent designers. For human comprehension, a huge array of thinking tools is required. Cultural evolution de-Darwinized itself with its own fruits.Second, it’s Turing’s inversion of reasoning: to be a perfect and beautiful computing machine, it is not requisite to know what arithmetic is. Machine learning, as it is today, presents another example of competence without comprehension. Dennett also revises the term “intelligent design” hijacked by theists. According to Dennett, we humans are intelligent designers. We create new intelligent technologies which beat us in many areas but they are totally devoid of comprehension. He refutes worries about AI Armageddon some thinkers (like Bostrom and Stephen Hawking) fear. Third strange inversion of reasoning is David Hume’s account of our knowledge of causation. Hume’s inversion implies that an object’s characteristics are intrinsic to our minds, not the objects themselves. In order to study the idea of a quality, Dennett argues, one must study the brain and its evolution rather than the physical object. We can then see human consciousness as a user-illusion, not rendered in the Cartesian Theater (which does not exist) but constituted by the representational activities of the brain coupled with the appropriate reactions to those activities (“ and then what happens?”). Concerning the so called “Cartesian Wound,” the view that human beings have an immaterial soul or mind distinct from the body, Dennett tries to disarm the whole idea. He distinguishes between a “manifest image” and a “scientific image” of nature. It is only in terms of the former that we have difficulties with notions of purpose, agency, mind, and consciousness. Dennett has written a lot on free will in his other books and articles. Here he just briefly presents his compatibilist argument. He presents free will, similar to consciousness, as a user-illusion, a product of evolutionary processes. Even if it is not there to be found, should we abandon red and yellow cards at the soccer game? His vision is pragmatic to our species. I hear they have finally reached an agreement in their dispute on the topic with Sam Harris.He finishes with an observation that “human minds, however intelligent and comprehending, are not the most powerful imaginable cognitive systems, and our intelligent designers have now made dramatic progress in creating machine learning systems that use bottom-up processes to demonstrate once again the truth of Orgel’s Second Rule: Evolution is cleverer than you are. Once we appreciate the universality of the Darwinian perspective, we realize that our current state, both individually and as societies, is both imperfect and impermanent. We may well someday return the planet to our bacterial cousins and their modest, bottom-up styles of design improvement. Or we may continue to thrive, in an environment we have created with the help of artifacts that do most of the heavy cognitive lifting their own way, in an age of post-intelligent design. There is not just coevolution between memes and genes; there is codependence between our minds’ top-down reasoning abilities and the bottom-up uncomprehending talents of our animal brains. And if our future follows the trajectory of our past— something that is partly in our control— our artificial intelligences will continue to be dependent on us even as we become more warily dependent on them.”"
48,0393355500,http://goodreads.com/user/show/46920995-john-bleasdale,4,I enjoyed this book. It’s a deep dive and it gets quite tough because it demands some counterintuitive thinking but it is ultimately worth it. The basic ideas are that evolution is essentially design without a designer and this also impacts on how we think of consciousness. There’s particular attention paid to the idea that there’s a fuzzy line between competence and consciousness. What I find most valuable is the wealth of information Dennett corals as part of his argument. There are some real nuggets in here which help illustrate his argument but also stand out on their own as interesting and for me new ideas. The origins of verbal language as a possible adjunct to a preexisting sign language for instance. 
49,0393355500,http://goodreads.com/user/show/91674903-thomas,5,"Gripping in its utter stream of real intelligence. Dennett doesn't just expound his thesis clearly – a sign that he knows what he's talking about – but he does so elaborately, which means you can't just sit back and relax. This is no mindless read. In fact, just watch how mindful you become after you finally get to hold the book backwards! This is a laudable feat on the part of Daniel considering that he's sharing the main takeaways from his life's research on how comprehension and consciousness came about. He definitely manages to set right the wrongs that have discombobulated us formally since the times of Descartes. And for that, Dennett, I thank you. "

54,0393355500,http://goodreads.com/user/show/48491608-paul-o-leary,4,"This book is basically an update on Dennett's earlier excellent works, Consciousness Explained and Darwin's Dangerous Idea. Both came out in the 90s; both are challenging, but enjoyable books from a philosopher who writes on scientific subjects with deft authority. From Bacteria to Bach and Back focuses more attention on cultural evolution than the prior books named. As our age is dominated by the viral meme, this elaboration makes sense. Dennett emphasizes and contrasts the bottom-up approach of Darwinian evolution against the evolutionary selected achievement of the top-down approach of human intelligence and its resulting culture. As Dennett writes: ""Evolution by natural selection starts with how come and arrives with what for."" This allows Dennett to show the reader how the game of human intelligence has been rigged. Competence, until very recently, has preceded comprehension, yet we naturally fail to understand it that way. Humans have a nasty tendency to bask in the supposed omnipresence of their comprehension. As man's perception of the world is structured through mental perceptions with its allied interpretative designs, illusions and analogies guised as mental perceptions or designs find a willing human audience fit for conning. Man creates God in his own image as this is not just more salubrious to his pattern of thought, but more structurally intuitive than the randomish process of evolutionary design which selects through chance rather than as a design with intent. Dennett spends a bit of space on the origins of language, too. Rather than a ""just so"" story of biblical creativity that appeals to humanity's design stance with the world, language was a long time coming. When it finally did, ""culture"" emerged as an exploitable tool for memes' survival. Also, Dennett's concept of a hetero-phenomenology, the investigation of other people's experiences, which he claims offers better scientific guidance towards truth than probing the historically traditional Cartesian subjective absolute many still retreat behind, offers the reader some controversy. It also may tend to put some off. The extended implication that scientific experts and philosophers might actually know better than you do either what's standing right before you or what constitutes a suitably truthful/accurate memory offers little diplomacy to common sense populists. Many will undoubtedly find this book tough to swallow whole. Consumed with thought accompanying each bite, however, this rigorous meal of a book offers some hardy and thought-provoking sustenance."
55,0393355500,http://goodreads.com/user/show/65978670-tiago-faleiro,3,"Unlikely many of his critics, I deeply respect and admire Dennett's goal. I don't mind the fact in a way he's going against the tide, and and I'd go so far to say as it's the correct approach. Not that his thesis is correct, but the way he's approaching the problem is likely to be the useful one. At best, you eventually (and this may take centuries or millennia) manage to fully explain the most complex thing in the universe (consciousness), but at worse, you have a better understanding of it than what you started with. To the validity of his claims, some I agree with, some I don't, but honestly, I'm just not knowledgeable enough to have a confident opinion on most of the topics, philosophically or scientifically (And I don't think almost anyone does).But ignoring the claims, I unfortunately find Dennett's writing quite tedious. It doesn't flow well, and it always seems to drag unnecessarily. The book is relatively long, and at times reasonably complex as well. I don't have a problem with either, but with a good book, the difficulty and length usually pays off. I finish it with a sense that I've learned something important and it clicks. With Dennett, this very rarely happens, if ever. I found myself struggling to fully understand a certain topic and after grinding through it, realizing how pointless it was, and how it would make little difference if you just completely removed it from the book.I don't think it's a completely terrible book, and certainly contains interesting ideas. Some that come to mind are the propagation of information (and what fundamentally information is), competence without comprehension, cartesian gravity, types of learning (darwinian, skinnerian and popperian) and the development and impact of memes on culture and language. It's just a shame that these ideas are hidden in a large amount of noise, and are dragged out unnecessarily. If he was forced to make a 20 page summary of the book, not only would you get 99% of the benefit of it, it would probably be an actual better book in itself."

I'd guess that only about 20% of it was new for me.I loved the idea of **competence without comprehension**. It has wonderful explanatory mileage.I can't say the same for memes. Memes were a fascinating idea when I first encountered them in Dawkins but it's laughable to treat them as any more than an interesting analogy with genes. About a third of the book is taken up with a defence of memes and, as so often with Dennett, I felt like an unwilling witness to an inside-baseball argument with someone over my left shoulder. I bough the book hoping to find an update to Dennett's ideas on consciousness — what it means and how to understand it — but the topic got cursory coverage at best. I was disappointed."

Reviews the development of the human mind via evolution and memes, memes being a relatively new and controversial concept introduced by Dawkins in “The Selfish Gene.” Tentatively, I would describe memes as cultural ideas spread in an evolution like manner. The development of human consciousness has resulted in a human culture of intelligent design. This in turn has led some of us (but not you and me, oh no) to impose the idea of intelligent design on the universe and the concept of God.Heady stuff. Generally speaking, I have only the faintest grasp of what the Mr. Dennett is talking about, for the most part. There is a chapter entitled “Consciousness As An Evolved User-Illusion,” just in case getting rid of God is not enough for you. There are a fair amount of Buddhists who believe that Gautama himself taught the concept of No Self, which is exactly what it sounds like. Mr. D goes them one (or two) better and says that consciousness itself (gee I wish I knew how to use italics on this thing MAYBE I SHOULD JUST USE CAPITALS) is an illusion. Goodness me.I came away from this book feeling like I had drunk from the well of knowledge. Confused but elated. Sigh. Some people are really smart.——-6/18/18- For those of you keeping score at home, I have begun to wonder lately if the suspension of belief in the “self” requires as big a leap of faith as that required to tell oneself that one believes that Jesus arose from the dead.

I think the story is very interesting, but I have some misgivings about this particular iteration of the story.Part of the issue is that there is so much going on in the book. Dennett has a huge corpus himself, and he invokes and builds on those ideas throughout, while also invoking a lot of other substantial and interesting ideas. This makes for a justifiably long and dense book, and normally wouldn't be a problem in itself, but it does create a problem that Dennett fails to solve.That is, the ideas have to be structure in a such a way that makes it clear how the parts fit together and what the relevant details are in this story. The structure of his views really requires a lot of background in his own work, to track the important elements in the various arguments. Dennett often successfully draws these things together with thoughtful metaphor and historical narratives, but I don't think this book succeeds as well as his other books, and the result is kind of a slurry final product.The lengthier review of the content is up at Pharyngula."

Highly convincing narrative on the emergence of consciousness as a fluid interplay between separate bottom-up derived mechanistic genetic and cultural building blocks, that serve as the basis for increasingly complex levels of functional and conceptual representation. (Note the strong similarities with the nested layers of feature representation in neural networks).In the case of homo sapiens, the evolutionary advantages of language and complex communicationfacilitate the emergence of top-down intelligent planning stemming from concepts of competence without comprehension. In the end you get top-down intelligent design based on mechanistic, non-intelligent building blocks created bottom-up by evolution.Non-trivial with multiple insights scattered across a breathtaking array of different topics. A massive tour-de-force."
