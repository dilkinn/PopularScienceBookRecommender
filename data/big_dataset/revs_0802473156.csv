My husband's ""love language"" is Physical Affection and mine is Quality Time. I totally see that. But this is like a ""Love Language For Dummies."" It talks to you like you're an idiot who has never had basic human social interaction before. And there isn't really any advice, just this guy rambling on about how smart he is for figuring out that people need to be loved in different ways. Like, his advice for someone whose spouse (not partner, not lifemate, and - in this instance, always the wife) prefers ""Acts of Service"" as a love language (because wives love when their husband does the laundry for them, basically) is just that -- do the laundry without being asked. Well no shit. That's not real advice, that's common sense. And if the husband were to argue ""I don't have time, I work a lot so that I can provide for my family"" blah blah blah, he just says ""WELL MAKE TIME."" Super helpful, guy.Not to mention the book is sexist and heteronormative. Unfortunately, I did a little googling on the author AFTER the fact, and of course it is, because he's a Bible beater. I wish I had known that before I wasted my $7 on the Kindle book. I'd really like to see this concept updated and brought into the 21st century, written in such a manner as to A) actually include all walks of life, not just middle class straight white married couples, and B) actually offer advice that can be applied to a relationship."

My assumption was that it would be religious in tone and not very relevant to today's relationships. I'm so glad I was wrong! This is one of those books I would suggest everyone read. It is such a simple explanation of what can so often go wrong in relationships. It's not about men vs. women, it's about the way people receive love.The basis is there are 5 Love Languages (obviously). And if you speak a different love language than your partner, then you may not feel loved. The 5 Love Languages are:Words of AffirmationQuality TimeReceiving GiftsActs of ServicePhysical TouchI'm sure everyone responds to all of these in some way, but we all have a primary language. There is a great quiz in the back that can help you more quickly define yours. By reading the book, I knew what mine was, but the survey pinpointed it to a T and helped me rank mine by importance, even better than I think I could have done on my own. This book will help you in your current relationships (of all kinds, not just romantic) and any future relationships you'll have. It really pinpoints how relationships can fall apart after the honeymoon period is over, even if you still love each other. It helps you understand how to show your love for someone else in a way that they'll best receive it. I could give a bunch of examples from the book, but I want you to read it! So go get it from the library TODAY. Then share with me what your primary language is! I'd love to know everyone's. Mine is Words of Affirmation.""Almost never do two people fall in love on the same day, and almost never do they fall out of love on the same day."" ""Love is something you do for someone else, not something you do for yourself."""

Things others say or do that make one feel ""loved"",they are follows:-words of affirmation.-recieving gifts.-acts of service.-physical touch.-quality time.Personally I want you to tell me how great I am (words of affirmation) while walking in the house with a collection of poetry for me (receiving gifts), make a beeline for the trash that needs to be taken out (acts of service), then come back in and read quietly next to me (quality time) before I ride you like the wild stallion that you are (physical touch) so where does that leave me? Which love language am I? This book was not helpful (as indicated by the shelf it's on)."

But I was stuck on vacation with nothing else to read so I reluctantly gave it a try. In a nutshell, this book has changed my life. Page after page I found myself wanting to yell, ""yes! Thats exactly right!"" If I could give this more than five stars, I would. Okay, maybe ""changed my life"" is a bit strong, but it has certainly enhanced my marriage like nothing else I've ever read or done.The advice this author gives is so profound and universal, it can be applied successfully to any deep relationship you have (children, parents, close friends). I just can't recommend it highly enough. Every couple, whether newly together or old marrieds, could benefit from this book."

That’s from the Bible or the Decameron or Archie Comics. I think.I’ll do the whole would-it-kill-you-to-read-something-positive-with-me-for-a-change thing  if I want something in return  in order spend some time with my wife. Plus, bonus, the audio book was relatively short.I’ve had to read a few scoops of self-help crap literature over the years, so I’m down with the lingo:Annie Wilkes’s How to Win Friends and Influence People.  I’m OK (Neurotic, OCD, manic-depressive), You’re OK (Nymphomaniac, Daddy issues, Passive-aggressive).Untying my “inner child” from the radiator and letting him have ice cream with my “toxic” parents.Books that give you a “thought for the day”, you know, something cosmic and revelatory to think about and chew on for eternity (or until you close the book).Jeff, buddy, I’m breathless with anticipation! What are the five languages of love, already?Well, as a way to work into that, fanatical (and borderline crazy) Goodreader, let me explain the good doctor’s theory on the FIVE languages of love. Basically, we all speak a primary language and we all have a language of love that we learned from mommy and daddy.One of five languages of love.Five! Count ‘em, Five!What was that number again?So, that number is five, right?Stop dragging this out in order to post “five” gifs.According to Dr. Chapman, the five languages are:Now, I’m done.1)	Giving gifts – If the last time you gave your wife flowers was when Nirvana was a thing, then this one isn’t you.2)	Words of affirmation – These don’t include: “You’re an idiot/moron/devil/shrew/succubus etc.”3)	Acts of Service or doing stuff for your loved one or something – Helping my wife bury the hoochies that chase after our son qualifies here.4)	Quality time – It’s not me, me, me. Maybe your wife, wants to hang with you and do stuff, like, I don’t know, talk…5)	Physical touch – It’s not only smexy times, but just being there, being present.Note to wife: Please treat every day like my birthday! So, in a nutshell, recognize your love language and your spouse’s love language and try to accommodate them in some small way.If I’ve saved your marriage, you’re welcome or just send me a check. Make it out to “CASH”.Warning! The doctor likes to work in the Christian stuff and this is strictly a hetero tome, so if the first is a turn off and you find the second limited, look for help elsewhere. And like anything in this world that makes money, Chapman has written enough additional books on this subject to choke a Tijuana stage show donkey."

Sometimes life can be stranger than fiction. I will say that this book has some reasonably helpful thoughts and ideas, but... it is way too simplified and way too heteronormative and way too traditional Christian-value based to speak to me in any meaningful way. Every single example featured a husband/breadwinner and wife/homemaker (who sometimes worked outside the home) couple. In one example, when the wife was asked to describe something positive about her husband, she says: ""he let's me keep any money I earn in my part time job"". Another example included a young wife who wished her husband would change the baby's diaper when he got home from work because she was busy cooking dinner (HIM: I would like her to cook dinner for when I get home from work).... WHO ARE THESE PEOPLE?!?!?! The author didn't overtly advocate for traditional gender roles in the home, but I couldn't help but think there was a subliminal message indicating his preference for this. In the one example where the husband seemed to take on a fair share of the cooking, cleaning and other assorted domestic chores, the wife complained. She wanted him to spend more time with her. As it turned out, the wife really wanted to cook and clean, but the husband was too efficient and didn't give her a chance to do so. Oh, happy ending. Needless to say, I'm crying feminist tears at this point.Don't get me wrong, I am all for good communication, respect and understanding how to make your spouse feel loved. But when this misogynist flavored relationship guru doled out advice to a woman in a 'horrible' marriage, I took issue. The details of horror of the marriage were largely unsaid, other than it was given that the husband cursed and said he hated his wife. This woman was very religious and clearly the idea of leaving her husband was at odds with her beliefs. Since the husband had no interest in seeking marriage counseling, the author/marriage counselor devised a unilateral plan he admitted didn't know would work. The crux of the plan was for the wife to speak to her husband in his love language, and hopefully he would eventually he would reciprocate and the love tanks would start to refill. This plan basically suggested, among other things, that the wife initiate sex with her husband (as his love language was physical touch) even though this idea did not appeal to the wife. Kind of a 'take one for the team' approach. The author clearly said that this was her decision to do so. Ok, so all this has the appearance of consenting adults and informed decisions, so where's the problem Katie? Oh, I don't know, how about emotional manipulation of the vulnerable? Call me cynical, but I picture an abused spouse (view spoiler)[emotional or physical, it makes no difference to me (hide spoiler)] reading this and thinking that I just need to have sex with my husband and maybe things will work out. And that leads me to the other big issue I had with this book. All the case studies were simple and tidy and all had happily ever afters. Not very realistic. This author only cited success stories and provided no useful examples of how this love language thing can go wrong. Overall, I think the idea of love languages seems reasonable, but I was sorely disappointed in the examples and approaches suggested by the author. At best, he gave an overly optimistic view of how implementing his ideas would work. (and if they don't work the first time, perhaps you could try one of his marriage $eminars or buy more of his book$) At worst, they pander to the emotionally vulnerable in abusive relationships, giving them specious relationship advice.

The idea of loving others the way they need to be loved might feel counterintuitive, but it something so essential to growing as a person and understanding what love really is.I had always known about this book and the love languages, but this was the first time I actually read it.

I felt like I was in couple's therapy without paying hundreds an hour. He used Jesus as an example once, for anyone avoiding religious text. As we all know marriage is hard and it is a daily choice to love but after the honeymoon bliss is over can we still have a happy marriage? Did the other person suddenly change or did we change without thinking about it? There's so much static in our daily lives; work, bills, kids, money, climbing the social ladder, other people, resentment, exhaustion etc. We start to take our relationship for granted and it starts to surface as anger and hate. So in 5 steps you find your way toward a more loving, enjoyable partner bc of the way you love him. Chapman doesn't promise easy; he promises a happier emotional love tank which can make the marriage reborn.WORDS OF AFFIRMATION QUALITY TIME RECEIVING GIFTSACTS OF SERVICE PHYSICAL TOUCH Which fills you up?

13,0,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6072718-samuel,5,"I read this book in 2 days; it is a quick read that incorporates stories to illustrate human nature when it comes to expressing love--especially in marriage. It is brilliant not for its originality of ideas but rather in its categorization and clarity of ideas. In the words of John Lennon, ""All you need is love."" Love is the most important thing, and yet, many people have a truly hard time feeling loved and successfully expressing love to those who matter most to them. Why is this? Dr. Chapman thinks it is because people speak different love languages. Within these broad fields there are different ""dialects"" but overall there are five love languages that people value: Words of Affirmation, Quality Time, Receiving Gifts, Acts of Service, and Physical Touch. In general, each individual has a ""primary language"" or two that he (or she) values above others. As a result of our complex variations of nurture and nature, people have individual preferences. When we are ""courting"" someone we experience the euphoria of ""falling in love"" and in general all of these languages are ""spoken"" between two parties to some degree. But after marriage (or even after about two years of courting--the euphoria stage rarely lasts a few months longer than two years), expressing love continually becomes less natural. It is common to focus on expressing love the way we want it expressed to us rather than understanding the needs of our spouse and choosing to ""speak their language;"" true love requires choice and sacrifice. This is not rocket science, but I found it very helpful to read through it and recognize the power of thinking through this simple revelation of differences in expectation and affection."
14,0,http://goodreads.com/user/show/98634-lachelle,5,My dad actually recommended this book to me and I finally decided to check it out from the library. Although I think my husband and I have a good relationship - it was amazing how much I learned from this book! And how I realized that by understand how we communicate differently - it could strengthen our relationship. I would recommend this book to just about anyone! A lot of it seems common sense but it's a good reminder and an eye-opener to read it. 
15,0,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5926124-matthew-moes,4,"The author says love is a choice. He says that the infatuation that people experience in the beginning of the relationship is not real love. It is something else. Real love takes work while the infatuation period is instinctual and effortless. But isn't it the stuff we dream of and wish would last forever? Can we really accept that we will only get that chance at the beginning of the relationship and that thereafter, in order to remain monogamous, we must accept that it is not for us to feel ever again? It explains a lot. But I accept his theory with the angst of a romantic.Yet anyone who is married and holds married life as a value that must be maintained must at some point consider the notion that making the marriage work after the honeymoon can be a matter of personal choice. And in so choosing, there are actions that communicate that willingness to different people psychologically. These are the five love languages that the author discusses: Words of Affirmation, Quality Time, Giving Gifts, Acts of Service, Physical Touch. I will not go into any details of what is meant by each of these here. The titles are somewhat self-explanatory, with the exception of the last one, which does not necessarily refer to sex. The author explains each love language along with the concept that most people are chiefly responsive to just one. He also discusses how to determine your own as well as your spouse's, and even provides some optimistic advice on how to practice the love languages with an unreciprocating partner. Despite the author's Christian underpinnings, as a non-Christian, to me this did not detract from the relevance of the author's ideas.In fact, these ""love languages"" are not confined only to the marriage relationship, but may also serve to strengthen bonds with children - or perhaps any other person you need to communicate your love and support for. I especially found the chapter on children the most valuable because it not only expands the concept beyond the marriage relationship, but also drives home the point. We might have a choice as to whether we wish to stay married or not - but our children are ours forever.And this brings me back to the point about marriage. Far from being ready to claim mastery of the ultimate male-female partnership, I have reflected upon it a great deal. In an age where the divorce rate challenges the age-old institution upon which the family is built, one must ask how marriages were ever successful in the past. Some may point out that they really weren't, but that society simply forced two people to be miserable by making it taboo to separate. And this then begs the question, why would the world's varied cultures and divinely inspired religions condone this relationship again and again? In fact, I would venture to point out that for the vast measure of our recorded history marriage has not only been a standard, but has also been traditionally arranged! What ancient wisdom allowed such ""life-sentences"" to form such a firm foundation for the basic building block of society?I suspect the answer lies right here in this book. As hard as it may be to admit, the commonplace yearning for finding a new and exciting fling is quite likely an unfortunate addiction to a desire that in its very nature is meant to be only a temporary rush that pulls two people inexplicably together at the heart during their initial engagement. It is later, through maturity and insight into what makes the other person tick that we can choose to make each other perpetually happy and foster the bonds of enduring love. This book provides some valid insight into this process. It is light and easy reading that I think every couple should invest some time into, again and again.MM March 1, 2005"

People have to want to work on things; have to want to communicate needs and expectations. Having said that, I have not seen a better way to tie in to your significant other's point of view, then trying to understand how THEY need to have love expressed. But even more importantly, maybe, is looking at ourselves and seeing how we automatically expect others to ""get"" love the way that we need to 'get' it. Which is simply not the way it works.I was especially enlighted when Chapman talks about the difference between love as a ""feeling"" and love as an ""action"". The latter is what Christ is asking us to do.I had previously read the ""Peacegiver"". These two books together would be an excellenet companion set."

Before reading I had considered the premise to be very basic, common-sense knowledge and didn't think the book would tell me anything I couldn't have figured out on my own. Five love languages, not everyone speaks the same love language....ok, well as long as you know what they are, shouldn't have to read the book, right? Wrong. Gary Chapman's years of marriage counseling have brought him invaluable insights that EVERYONE should be privy to. I'm not just talking married couples, I'm talking parents, children, friends...anyone in any relationship should know this stuff. Chapman explains what each love language entails, and gives examples of some of the ""dialects"" in each language (for example, quality time may mean quality conversation.) And then he tells you very specifically what you can do to learn to ""speak"" each love language. There are books geared towards different types of relationships that are probably worth taking a look at, too...but this one is fantastic!"

So many people recommended this book to me that I wanted to read it just so I could have an opinion on it and I have to say that I think it is pretty useful. It is definitely cheesy and certainly oversimplified, but the author is on to something. I have been trying this out not just on my marriage, but also with my children and other relationships and it's just nice to know that people speak different ""languages"" or whateve you want to call them when it comes to feeling appreciated/loved. I do not think that there are only 5 and I do not think people have just one or two, but it's good to know that it probably isn't the one you are using and to try to observe and use different ways of communicating. My other criticism is that Gary Chapman never even mentions gender differences and I am sort of relieved that he doesn't because I would be worried that they would be oversimplified. But I do think that a lot of miscommunication happens along gender lines. All in all, I liked it and I would recommend it to anyone in a marriage or any type of relationship--not as the only tool, but as a useful one, in trying to understand and appreciate your spouse/significant other/child."

It's written by a marriage counselor and directed towards couples, but it can be applied to all relationships, both romantic and platonic. The author's theory is that there are five major ways to express love (the five love languages). Each of us has a primary love language, and relationship problems occur when others fail to express love to us in that language. It's an interesting theory but WAY oversimplified, and I was extremely bothered by one of the real life stories where the author encourages a wife to stay with an abusive husband and rescue their marriage by learning his love language. That's crap! The book is written from a religious perspective, and I struggled a lot with that as well. Overall, I wasn't so impressed, but I did conclude that my love language is Quality Time, and I've been surprised by how much insight that has provided into how I operate in relationships. For that alone, it gets two stars instead of one."
21,0,http://goodreads.com/user/show/25605420-apoorva,2,"When I finished reading this book yesterday, I thought the first 70% of the book wasn’t that bad. Hell, I can even go as far as to say that it had pretty good points for someone new to relationships.Now that I’m writing this review, I don’t think I can hold back because the remaining part of this book is fucking trash and I have to talk about it!If you’ve ever been in a relationship where there’s healthy communication, I think all the advice given by the author won’t sound so revolutionary. That's because you don’t have the fancy words to label the ways you show your love to your partner.But, I don’t want to drag this book down completely as I feel that this has some good points in the beginning. “Love language” is a metaphor for the actions you take to show your love for your partner which results in a full love tank i.e. satisfaction in a relationship.After the emotional high of love wears off AKA honeymoon phase of the relationship ends, it leaves us with the reality that the person we are with is not as perfect as we had once imagined. In this situation, we have to make efforts to sustain love and cultivate intimacy.All of this is fine until the author ruins everything by attempting to save the relationship of a woman who has been abused. Using religion, he manipulates her to have sex with her husband (because his primary love language is physical touch). I’m not even exaggerating this. I found it wrong and vile.If he had given the same advice to a man, I’d be angry too. But this is especially disgusting because, in many cultures and communities, women are told to just put up with the abuse or sweep it under the rug. I just cannot believe he gave this advice using such pleasant words.It takes two to be in a relationship. It should be the decision of two people to make it work. If only one person is putting in efforts while the other person couldn’t care less, it’s best to give up because this is an unhealthy dynamic.It was wrong on his part to give such advice to the vulnerable woman who was in a dilemma of whether she should stay with her abuser or leave. It just plays into the mentality that a good girl can fix a bad guy if she loves him enough. We should wonder about something else. Is the guy even worth loving? Short answer: No. Long answer: HELL NOOOOOO!Secondly, he talks about how a relationship can be revived even after there has been sexual infidelity. I’m neither an expert in the field of dating and relationships nor have I read any research papers or statistics, but I feel there should be a line that cannot be crossed.In my opinion, certain actions should be forbidden and considered the last straw in relationships for eg, cheating, abuse, and some other serious offenses (murder?).I think aiming to make every relationship work by applying the love language rules is idealistic and unrealistic. Sometimes, people just aren’t compatible. There might be a hundred reasons for not being together. I don’t think all problems can be solved by applying the five simple rules.All in all, read the first 70% of the book as it is sensible. For the rest, hurl the book out of the window and forget about it."
22,0,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3789528-jane-stewart,5,"Interesting, insightful, useful. Good dinner conversation.The author is a Baptist church pastor who counseled thousands of people. As a result he discovered what he called the Five Love Languages. It works as follows.One should figure out what their love language is - which may be different from their spouse’s language. A person tends to do things for their spouse that they would like done for themself, but that won’t please the spouse if the spouse has a different language. For example, the husband might desire words of affirmation (needs to hear compliments and appreciation for his work). The wife might desire acts of service (like help with household chores). If the marriage has problems, one should try giving the spouse what the spouse desires - periodically and regularly.The other three languages are: physical touch, spend quality time together, receive gifts.This also helps with other relationships like friendships, family members, and co-workers.AUDIOBOOK NARRATOR:The author narrated his book.

24,0,http://goodreads.com/user/show/917504-gaijinmama,4,"The premise of this best-selling book is quite simple, but many of us haven't tried looking at our marriages this way. In short, people have their own, often unconscious way of expressing love and rarely do two spouses have the same ""Love Language."" This can cause trouble in a marriage because we may simply not understand the way in which our partner is expressing his or her love, even if s/he is trying really hard to express it and has NO idea we aren't getting it. In turn, s/he may not feel loved if we are ""speaking a different language."" Thus, we could be struggling for years and still be completely misreading each other.To my surprise, my husband was actually willing to take the quiz at the end of the book with me, and we have had a FABULOUS few days so far. Just knowing which Love Language is most important to each other can make us happier, and an awful lot less frustrated.Let's see if he keeps this up (nudge-nudge, wink-wink!).A couple things that annoyed me: the author is a devout Christian and mentions his beliefs a little more often than I would prefer. And he is more than a trifle sexist. He's convinced that women mainly have sex for emotional reasons whereas men have a stronger physical need. In a word: bullshit. On the men's version of the quiz there is a question about ""loving to have sex with my wife"", but on the women's version, the wording is changed to ""I love cuddling with my husband"".BAH HUMBUG to that! Dr. Chapman, sir, it is the 21st Century. Do you truly think that most women have that hard of a time admitting that they enjoy having sex?!Poppycock and balderdash and Honey, puh-leeze! Dr. Chapman, I really do feel you, and I cannot tell you how delighted I am that you got my husband's attention, but you just lost yourself a 5-star rating for going on and on about the Gospel of Luke and for being stuck in the Victorian era in terms of gender differences.In spite of that, I found the book readable, useful and, if my husband's behavior is any indication, very helpful.**2014 Follow-up:Still works for me. It helps just knowing that Mr. Gaijinpapa is trying to express love in his own way, which isn't my way, but hey I am me and he is he..so I appreciate his effort and I try to understand his way and do not try to change him. After 23 years, I think romance is all well and good, but marriage is really about patience and being willing to accept each other for who you are..I am still Royally Pissed Off about the Gender and Kinda Fundamentalist Religious stuff. Dr. Chapman, Sir, I maintain that women like to get some! Cuddles are nice too, and guys might be happier and healthier if society would allow them to admit that they too need to cuddle sometimes, but sometimes we ladies want..you know...It and why pretend otherwise?"
25,0,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6333165-yen-tzu,3,"Reasons I read this book:- It was free;and on a slightly more embarrassing note- I read blogs about The Bachelor and The Bachelorette and every season someone very seriously mentions their ""love language"", and not even in a self-deprecatingly British way, which is really the only way to pull off saying, ""my love language is words of affirmation"". Just to be clear, I don't actually watch the television show, I just really enjoy reading blogs that analyse each episode and all of the delightfully ridiculous things that happen. When people question this life choice, I like to think that it's my flaws that make me human.Now that I've hopefully sufficiently justified why I read this book, let's get to the content. As advertised in the title, this book is about five love languages. They are, in no particular order:1. Words of affirmation2. Quality time3. Receiving gifts4. Acts of service5. Physical touchThat list should have come with a spoiler tag because it's all rather self-explanatory, and now there's no reason for you to read the book. I'm sorry. (I'm actually not really, but apologising just seemed like the polite thing to do here.)The author implores you throughout the book to discover the love language of your significant other and then everything will be fine if you focus on meeting that one need. In my very humble opinion through knowledge gained largely by reading blogs on The Bachelor, I'd suggest being a bit more ambitious and trying to provide your partner with all these forms of love.So, things I liked about the book:- It's always nice to be reminded that one shouldn't be complacent in a relationship and you should remember to express your love.- I like the very specific examples about how you can express love in various ways because I'm lazy and now I can just shamelessly steal ideas straight from the book. Things that were bizarre:- The author was rather self-promotional about this book in the book itself. He kept encouraging the reader to give this book to family and friends.- The examples given about complaints wive and husbands had about each other were all very archaic (or rather I hope they are):Wife: We never talk.Husband: You should have dinner ready by the time I get back home.Highlight of the book:The author counsels a woman who was reluctant to be intimate with her husband anymore (it was a failing marriage) to initiate sex with her husband by leaning on Jesus and her faith. Here are some choice quotes: “You will probably have to rely heavily upon your faith in God in order to do this. Perhaps it will help if you read again Jesus’ sermon on loving your enemies”“You are simply choosing to do something for his benefit. I think that must be what Jesus meant.”Holy crap! "
26,0,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7671079-samantha,5,"I highly recommend this book for ANY couple. Married, engaged, dating, gay, straight. It matters not. I even recommend it if you're single. My husband and I were on the verge of divorce, even separated, but after some counseling and reading this book it has helped us out tremendously! I bought a copy for my mom, sisters, and brother because I think it is that important to read his book and understand your significant others love language."
27,0,http://goodreads.com/user/show/51035023-j-k-miller,1,"Quite disgusted by how the author counseled a woman, “Ann” who said her husband cursed her, mistreated her, and said he hated her. Chapman told her to stay in the marriage for six months, and do ALL the emotional labor and follow “the teachings of Jesus.” I fear for her safety. Ann’s closest friends, who presumably knew of her situation, told her to get out. I hope she followed their advice. "
28,0,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3335221-kaila,3,"Honestly, this could be a 5 star book, but the last 50 pages get really preachy. As in, ""You are more likely to find and keep the love of your life if you already love Jesus.""The 5 love languages themselves were the best and most interesting part of the book. I was constantly thinking, ""Of course! That's why this thing works and that thing doesn't!""Now, if your partner happens to be a philosophy major...you might have more problems getting the ideas in this book across. There's not much in the way of ""shades of grey"" in this book. He says, as far as I can tell, ONE TIME that you could be ""bilingual"". Otherwise, you get one love language, and that's it. The rest of them will only kind of work on you.That sweeps a lot of problems people have right under the rug, I feel.All the same, my partner and I had some good conversations about this, and even though our relationship isn't anywhere near some of the disasters that are talked about in this book, I am sure it will help us never get to that point.Recommended for anyone who has problems expressing love.-----------------I'm having a really hard time deciding on a rating for this. Objectively, it should probably be 3 stars. The author is very sure of his own importance and correctness throughout the entire book. At one point, he quotes a study saying that the ""in-love"" feeling lasts 2 years. That study is never mentioned again, but the in-love feeling lasting 2 years is quoted as truth from there on out.Every conversation is stilted and full of ""But Dr. Chapman! How could this ever work!"" Well guess what, they came back 3 months later and called me a miracle worker!Yes you are very special, Dr Chapman, good job.I am afraid that someone reading this who has no background in psychology or philosophy or morality in general, would find it very easy to take everything he says at face value and not look beyond it. I am lucky to have a partner who wants to discuss things critically, but when he first brought up criticisms I got rather emotional and said I felt he wasn't taking me seriously.Relationships are powerful things and I think this book could really help some people who want or need more from their love life. I just want everyone to go into this knowing that there's more here than meets the eye and to think about it.-----------Update March 2, 2014Although my star rating has steadily decreased, I am still finding myself referring to this book. Mostly it is internal, but I really do feel like I have been nagging my partner less. I hope he doesn't tell a different story, but I am TRYING.I am bringing this book up again now because I just had a really great conversation with my dad. We don't see each other much (I hang out with my mom way more), and we have drifted apart over the years. He just took me out to lunch, where he mostly talked about his newest interest, bicycling on gravel. Which sounds absolutely horrible to me. We got to talking about my mom, and how she is obsessive when it comes to keeping the house clean. Like, it's not unusual for people to visit their home and ask if they just moved in because it is so spartan. They've lived there for 20 years.That got me talking about my cleaning habits, which are nowhere near my mom's standards, but I do like the apartment being picked up and presentable. I've been working 60 hours a week for the past 4 months, with only one day off a week. I have been coming home, throwing my shit down, eating a quick frozen burrito, and flopping into bed because I just worked for 14 hours. Needless to say, the place looks like a disaster area within a day or two of me cleaning it.Which brought me to my partner. It bugs me how much I've been working and how I feel he has been doing very little to help me around the house. Like even though I'm the one busting my ass, it's still my job to keep the place clean.I told my dad all this, then mentioned how I had read this book. I briefly went over the 5 love languages. My mom's love language is obviously acts of service. It means a lot to her to come home to a clean house. Despite the anecdote above, mine is Quality Time. My partner's is physical touch. Then I said, ""I'm not actually sure what yours is."" It surprised me, but he actually looked thoughtful. This is totally not his thing, to talk about this kind of stuff. After a moment he said, ""What means the most to me is that everyone in our family is always there. You can be flaky, but when I really need it, someone is there. It means a lot to me to be able to rely on that.""I kind of felt like crying, really, because my dad is not an open person, and I felt like him saying that was some kind of break through.It doesn't really fit into any of the love languages, but I realized it doesn't really have to. This book is just a guideline, but it is still helping me define the love in my life."
29,0,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7132123-cyndi,3,"Although I did learn what my and my husband's ""love languages"" are I kinda already knew it.  I'm not saying this book isn't helpful, 'cause it is. It teaches some very valuable techniques to strengthen marriages. "
30,0,http://goodreads.com/user/show/71658-aj,2,"This book has a very interesting premise, that everybody considers different things to be acts of love, and that if you're not speaking the same ""love language"" as your partner, it's possible that what you consider to be loving isn't interpreted as such.However I found this book to be really limited. It focuses on married heterosexual couples. I think this concept would be really interesting applied in family situations, or for unmarried couples (honestly, shouldn't these things be discussed and figured out before marriage?), or for gay couples. I also feel that there is a lot missing here in terms of trauma, abuse and consent. Some marriages cannot be saved. That is an OK thing. It is not always appropriate to determine what your spouse or partner's love language is when you're in a traumatic, abusive or nonconsensual situation. I realize that this isn't a book focusing on that, but even a few sentences thrown in would have been nice. "
31,0,http://goodreads.com/user/show/22208207-tessa,1,"Before I start in on the reasons why I didn't like this book, let me mention the good parts of it. As someone who just got married, I value ideas about how to strengthen a lifelong relationship, and the book did have some good ideas. It's always good to be reminded that I should be looking for little things I can do to make my spouse happy, that even if I'm happy with everything in a relationship I should be checking in with my spouse to make sure he's happy too, etc. I've always thought personality quizzes were fun and this book has a certain appeal because of that. There is something fun about trying to discover your ""love language"" and your spouse's, and see what that says about you both. Just to establish, the 5 Love Languages in the book are Words of Affirmation, Quality Time, Acts of Service, Physical Touch, and Receiving Gifts. I can see how in certain instances, thinking about the love languages could strengthen communication in a relationship. For instance, if one spouse really communicates most strongly with physical touch but that doesn't come naturally to the other partner, they might feel unloved until the other partner learns to show love through physical touch. Finally I appreciated how the book suggested mindful, practical ways to maintain a relationship over time. It talks a lot about the ""in love"" experience at the start of a relationship and how that's different than developing a lifelong, sustaining love. It reminded me of a quote from an Adrienne Rich poem: ""I choose to love this time for once / with all my intelligence."" To me, loving with intelligence means that once those crazy feelings of infatuation at the beginning of a relationship subside, and you and that other person start to see each other's flaws, to learn about them as an individual and not an ideal you've built up in your own head, you still choose to love them (or, if you see that they are abusive or mistreating you, etc., you choose to end that relationship and love someone else who respects you). I think in a lot of our TV shows, books, and movies, there are two kinds of relationships: the young lovers who emerge victorious at the end of a romantic comedy, perfectly in love and just starting out with their lives, or the middle-aged married couple who nag each other and take it for granted that romance and sex are off the table permanently. It's kind of a sad pattern that I definitely don't want to be true in my own marriage. So to circle back to the book, I did appreciate that it was very practical about how to consciously nurture the love in a relationship; it doesn't assume that once the honeymoon is over, things will fall apart. But I still gave this book a 1-star rating. Even though it brought Adrienne Rich to mind, Gary Chapman is no Adrienne Rich. It's kind of a bumbling mess written by someone with maybe a slight Jesus complex. I noticed that even though platonic love is discussed, every example of a romantic couple in the book is a heterosexual couple and the book presumes, consistently, that the only form of acceptable romantic love is between a man and a woman in a Christian marriage. It was also openly against open or polyamorous relationships. I understand because I am not interested in that for myself--but I wouldn't judge someone who wants a non-monogamous relationship, because it's all a matter of personal choice. I didn't like that the book assumes so much or that Chapman feels he can tell people what's best for them. I also think too much emphasis is placed on finding your one true love language. Yes, I did just say personality tests are fun, but while reading the book I really connected with several of the love languages described almost equally. It's nice when my spouse compliments me, but it's also nice to hold hands with my spouse, or when he does the dishes for me, or gives me a gift, or when we spend quality time together; I can't really differentiate between the niceness of those different things. Yet the book really insists everyone has one love language and maybe one secondary love language. It smacks of someone trying to sell me something and I don't like that. It's also kind of creepy and weird to read about all these troubled couples who host Chapman in their homes for the night while he's traveling for seminars, just to beg him for marital advice. Reminds me of televangelists who prey on their flock. I'm wary of self-help books to begin with, I only read this one because I've heard good things about it, but it reinforced my view; I don't need to be sold on the idea of love or preached to about it.My biggest problem, which came close to the end of the book, is one example Chapman gave of how the miraculous love languages work. A woman came to Chapman who was so sick of her marriage, she was on the cusp of leaving, because her husband didn't care about her at all anymore. All her friends were telling her to get out. She said she hated him and asked Chapman, ""can you love someone you hate?"" Which of course he decided to meditate on by reading the Bible. OK, I can dig it; the Bible has some good quotes and advice even if you're not religious. In fact I have no problem with the words of Jesus Chapman chose to share with this woman--love thy neighbor, treat others as you want to be treated, if you give a measure it will be returned to you until your cup runneth over, etc (I'm paraphrasing because, lazy). OK so that's all fine. But then Chapman is all, ""what's your husband's love language?"" and she says ""physical touch"" and he's like ""well you need to touch him and have sex with him more"" and she says ""but I don't want to"" and he says ""well yeah that will be hard but just think of Jesus"" I AM NOT KIDDING. I laughed as my valuation of the book instantly crumbled before me into sad, atheist dust. It's not directly expressed in the book, but this lady basically hints that her husband is verbally, if not physically, abusive and at the very least totally negligent and uncaring. Well of course the suggestion works and he starts to come around and love her back in her own ""love language"" but any respect I had for the book disappeared at that point. Also, even though as I've said I'm all for choosing love and loving with intelligence, some of the suggestions Chapman has are just laughable. For instance, every day you should ask your spouse ""how full is your 'love tank' on a scale of 1 to 10?"" and then if it's less than 10, you're supposed to do something to ""fill their love tank."" I'm sorry but I just can't with that childlike, pandering language. You can choose to love mindfully without teetering over into this totally clinical, almost bureaucratic method. FINALLY, and this review is so long now I know nobody is reading at this point but oh well, all of the advice is totally directed at middle-aged couples who have basically fallen out of love, so a lot of it was not applicable to me. Also, a lot of the advice is the really basic flavor (listen to each other, give your spouse undivided attention, give your spouse little gifts or notes to remind them how much you love them) you could get anywhere, that honestly should just be common sense by the time you're married. And finally finally finally, the ""love languages"" are nice and all, but I can see so many instances where troubles can arise in a marriage that the love languages couldn't fix. For instance, disagreeing about money/family/politics, if one partner is downright abusive or uncaring or habitually cheating, if a partner withdraws to the point where they won't do anything to help fix the relationship despite how strongly you're speaking their ""love language."" The end. Phew."

This is a reread for me, and my 5 year wedding anniversary is tomorrow, so it was the perfect time for me to reevaluate how to show love to my husband. I definitely think you should reread every so often, because I learned that our love languages are both Word of Affirmation, and I learned tips on how to make sure I show that to my husband. I'll be writing down positive things to say, so that way I can be sure to say at least one nice thing to him every day. "

So now in 2015, an updated review is glowing and I give it 4 stars instead of 3. However, below is my original review:This is an entertaining, well-written book from the perspective of a therapist who shares interesting stories about his patients and their love problems and solutions.This book has potential to help people better understand those they love and to show love to them in ways they can feel/understand (I'll suggest a much better book below that does this).However, I worry that this book would do more harm than good since in it it says that a man's love language may be sex. How twisted is that??? And very dysfunctional! This could cause a wife to ""do her duty"" instead of viewing sex as a mutual consent action to unify the marriage and strengthen the couple.Also, another HUGE problem with this book is that it implies that others are supposed to ""fill your love bucket."" Which is VERY dysfunctional as well. If you desperately NEED someone, that's not love. That's need! A healthy love is where two people are already secure with themselves by themselves (or with the help of God) and then they can give from their already full love buckets freely. It is not the responsibility for others to fill you up! You need to take charge of your own emotional health. Then you can share freely and not be a wiggly, needy scrounge for love.I suggest reading a much better book that promotes healthy interactions with others. It teaches to give love freely from your full love bucket (and how to get a full love bucket without relying on the actions of others). Although it is not as well written grammatically as this 5 languages, it is the best! It is called: How I got this Way and What to do About it by Dr. Ellsworth. It has an amazing chart in it with a much better breakdown of love languages.The children's book The Missing Piece Meets the Big O by Silverstein addresses this issue about giving love from your fullness instead of taking love from others or trying to fill in their holes as the 5 love languages promotes."
36,0,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7842743-kelsey,3,"I struggle with rating this book anything more than one star because it is extremely heteronormative, misogynistic, and religiously restrictive. However, I think that these issues are the result of its author, rather than the ideas in the book. The concepts presented in this book, once I shook off their disgusting patriarchal rhetoric, were sound and Truthful. I honestly believe that Chapman discovered a fundamental aspect of love, which is a tremendous feat. When I got to the chapter which talked about my primary love language, I literally burst into tears and could not stop sobbing. For the first time in my life, I understood what love I craved most from the people in my life and, most importantly, I felt validated in that desire, like it was okay to want and ask for those things. I wasn't a freak. I was just speaking a love language that society tells me not to speak. Finishing this book was the first step in my ongoing journey towards transcending this societal expectation.Here's the truth: I am a young woman, but my primary love language is Physical Touch. In Chapman's book, almost every example of couples shows a woman whose language is Acts of Service and a man whose language is Physical Touch. While the world around me, and even this book, told me that I shouldn't want physical affection as much as I do, the chapter on Physical Touch was like someone reaching out to tell me that it's okay to be who I am. My understanding of myself burst open and I felt like I was given permission to be who I am and love how I love. I am disappointed that so many of Chapman's own biases and clear stereotypes are included in this book, but it still helped me. If this book can help just one more person to accept themselves and ask for love in their primary language, then it is worth it to share my story in this review. A few words of advice: Supplement this book with additional interpretations online and discussions with your significant other. Not everything Chapman says is good or right, but his theory can possibly open a door to other interpretations which work better for you than the opinions touted in the book.Recommended, but with reservations."
37,0,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1125845-jeannie,4,"Rating: a little over 4 stars.This book was good. The concepts are important. I got the singles edition as well so I could actually apply these ideas to my current life. The book got a little tedious, though. I felt the first 9 chapters were all that were needed. These chapters encompassed an overview of how Chapman came to the 5-language conclusion, a discussion of each of the five languages, and a ""how to determine your love language."" I felt the remaining chapters served very little purpose other than to make the book a little longer. In a few weeks, I will likely skim and maybe read the Singles Edition. One issue I had with this book was one Chapman didn't address at the extent I thought he should have. Because different people speak different love languages, a certain expression of love that might not be your primary language can mean more coming from a person for whom that expression is difficult than if that person acted within your primary love language. This might seem like an inconsequential issue, but, if I know that it is hard for someone to express him/herself through physical touch (he or she isn't a huggy person), I will recognize how much he or she must care about me if he or she gives me a warm hug. Now, I test low for physical touch being my love language; however, knowing another person's disposition would make that hug mean a lot more to me (""fill my love tank"") than if a huggy person embraced me, or potentially even if that person had spoken my language.I suppose my point is, while it is important for people to learn to express love for others in ways that speak to them in their own language, I didn't feel Chapman addressed the fact love is coming from another person and knowing what is more difficult for that person should mean a lot. Perhaps that wasn't addressed so much in this book, though, since it was written for married couples. I still feel that someone would value my hugs more than the gifts I give because those hugs are rarer than the gifts. "

It is all about improving your relationship with your spouse by showing your love to them in a way that resonates with them - which may be totally different than what would be meaningful to you. It was a very fast read, very easy to ""get,"" and I have found it very insightful not only in expressing myself, but also in recognizing when my Jon Jon is being sweet to me. Sometimes it can be hard to tell. Am I right, ladies, or am I right??? Even better than reading it was getting Jon Jon to read it...he did!!! Those of you who know Jon, know it was quite a stretch to think he would read it, (have you heard him drone on about Covey?!!) but I let him know it was non-negotiable & it seriously only takes an afternoon. It was a fun challenge to try to pin-point which of the love languages we spoke. Perhaps more amazing than just reading the book is that Jon has, upon occasion, mentioned how he was specifically thinking of my love language when he did something for me. (!!!) Sweet, I know! It is such a small time commitment to read this & the concept will stick with you, so go for it! "

It gives suggestions for using it's tips and lays out how to change the way that you deal with other people. So often we show love and are angry or at a loss as to why it isn't appreciated or accepted. The jist of this book is that you have to show love to people in a way they understand rather than in the way you like.

Keep in mind that just because ""X"" is your love language doesn't necessarily mean that it's your spouse's too!I'm not going to talk about the love languages in details because :A)- I don't won't to spoil the book for others.B)- I strongly believe that every couple regardless the type of their relationship (married,engaged, dating,...) MUST read this book.& C)- I highly recommend those who are not in a relationship to read it and benefit from it for their upcoming relationship. By the way, if my Mr. Right is reading this review : please read the book before approaching me! ❤"

She was surprised I had heard of The Five Languages of Love, much less read it and even more shocked to discover it was “old” – her term – i.e., it was written 20 years ago, in ’92, the same year her sister was born. Apparently some college friends had recommended the book and she wanted to read it and get her fiancé to read it. I skim reread it again last night. Good pop psychology although I don’t usually like this genre. Remember reading this when kids were little, shortly after returning from overseas. Found it helpful, although I don’t think people fall into nice neat categories or are quite so easily categorized, still I get the author’s point. "

This one also came recommended to me and is one of the highest selling books from that genre in our store. I just had to see what all the fuss was about. I did approach it with quite a bit of scepticism but in the end there were some interesting concepts that made sense. Will it be able to save a marriage? Will it fundamentally change a relationship? Will it stop people divorcing or having affairs? I'm not sure. But it was quite an insightful read and did get me thinking. And it fit into my Pop Sugar challenge so a good read over all. "

57,0,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4023963-heather,4,"Audio Book Review: The Five Love Languages by Gary ChapmanOnce you get past the fact that Dr. Chapman sounds a lot like Dr. Phil, and mixes in a fair amount of religious talk at the beginning and end of this book, The Five Love Languages is actually a really interesting way of looking at our relationships with others (both romantic and non-romantic). In the book, Dr. Chapman reveals that people express and receive love in different ways. Because of this, even in some of the most loving relationships, one or both parties may not feel loved because the way the love is expressed isn’t necessarily in a “language” the other is receptive to. In other words, we feel most love when the other person is expressing their love in a way that is important to us.There are 5 main love languages: Physical Touch, Words of Affirmation, Acts of Service, Receiving Gifts, and Quality Time. Physical Touch means that a person feels loved through hugs, pats on the back, hand-holding, back massages, hair stroking, and other thoughtful touches. An affinity for physical touch isn’t synonymous with wanting to get it on all the time. Sure, that can be part of it, but just being near someone can be enough to show them they are loved. Thus, when a loved one never initiates any sort of touching, someone who values physical touch may feel unfulfilled.Words of Affirmation focuses on encouraging words. People with this love language feel loved when others complement them, verbally express their love, and give them meaningful praise. These people are thus very sensitive to criticism and insults.Acts of Service is all about expressing love by helping others. These people feel loved when others offer their unsolicited assistance and do things to make their partner’s life a little bit easier. So, being lazy and not offering to help with chores around the house sends the message that you simply don’t care.Receiving Gifts is not the same as materialism. Rather, people with this love language love the thoughtfulness and effort behind the gift. The type of gift doesn’t matter. Bringing home a person’s favorite candy after work or making something heartfelt is just as appreciated as something expensive – especially when finances are an issue. Every-day, simple gestures really communicate to these people that others love them.Quality Time is the final love language. These people yearn for the undivided attention of those around them. That means no TV, no cell phones, no computers – just enjoying each other’s company and the chance to talk without interruption. Doing new things together or having a date night with a loved one are more meaningful than anything else.This book was really enlightening; I understand now where the miscommunications in some of my relationships have stemmed from. Throughout the book Dr. Chapman shares many stories about how doing a six month experiment in trying to speak your partner’s love language has saved hundreds of marriages and led to more fulfilling relationships with all types of people – parents, children, friends, etc. (Chapman also has written books for the love languages of the office, children, and teenagers). Sure, at first it may take extra effort to communicate your love in a way that doesn’t come naturally to you, but he promises the payoff will be worth it, and all things considered, what do we really have to lose by trying it out? I highly recommend anyone to check out this book (he also writes a book geared towards guys for those reluctant male readers). You can probably skim through the first couple of chapters though, and get to the good stuff when he actually starts talking about what the love languages are.Final Rating: 4/5 stars"
58,0,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1023606-rebekah,3,"A couple of years ago, one of our local church leaders (who is also a psychologist) recommended that every couple read this book...and now, having read it, I'm just a little surprised by that. Really? Out of all the books on marital relationships, you would recommend this one?Things I Liked:* The explanation of the ""in love"" phenomenon. It made so much sense, and confirmed my personal, whirling thoughts that I've been trying to sort out the last few years. Kind-of puts a damper on all of those movies and songs our society loves so much, eh?* The explanation of how couples can start out loving each other and end up hating each other. That has never made sense to me...now, it begins to. I can see resentment building when you're trying desperately to express love to your spouse and they just complain about it.* The confirmation that being loved is a fundamental need of all humans; also, that children will look for that love other places if they don't get it from their parents.* This quote: ""True love always liberates."" Amen!* Teaching that love (true love) is always a choice. So true. And that applies so much larger than just a spouse...made me think about the rest of my family, friends, co-workers, neighbors, etc.Things I Didn't Like:* I'm just not sure these principles apply to me. For the life of me, I can't figure out what my ""language"" would be, even after thinking about his suggestions AND taking the assessment. He sounds so sure that every person has their specific language, or two at the most, but I think I fall across the entire spectrum. I need things from all five categories. If my husband were to stop any one of them, I would miss it. Thus, I just can't buy into believing that it's this important.* The whining couples. Seriously, if your spouse does something to express their love for you, why aren't you accepting it and being grateful for it? I can't believe this attitude of, ""But that's not what I wanted you to do!"" Shut up, grow up, and let them know how grateful you are. It is possible to express what you need without being a baby about it.* Some of the things he was asking these couples to do seemed incredibly manipulative to me. Regardless of his intentions, I think a lot of couples probably implement these principles under the pretense of creating greater love in their relationship, when in reality, they're just trying to manipulate their spouse into doing what they want.I'd love to hear comments from others who have read this book. Was it meaningful to you?"
59,0,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1586355-chad-warner,4,"This book is unsurprisingly “touchy-feely”, but it contains insightful and practical lessons about love in marriage. Chapman says that people express love in five broad ways, or “love languages”, and he shows how to determine and speak your spouse’s love language. Chapman stresses the importance of communication and expectations in marriage. The book is mostly about love between spouses, but there’s a chapter near the end applying the lessons to parent-child relationships.It sounds cheesy, but the main concept is that each person has a “love tank” that must be filled for a person to feel loved. Your goal in marriage is to keep your spouse’s love tank full by speaking their love language. I liked Chapman’s idea of a Love Tank Game in which spouses ask each other each evening after work, “On a scale of 0 to 10, how full is your love tank? What can I do to fill it?”My pastor recommended this book during premarital counseling. My wife had already read it, and recommended it as well. Chapman is a Christian and he references the Bible throughout the book, but the lessons apply to anyone regardless of religion.The 5 Love LanguagesWords of Affirmation: praising & complimentingQuality Time: undivided attentionReceiving Gifts: spontaneous giftsActs of Service: chores and errandsPhysical Touch: hugging, kissing, sexClues to determine your love languageWhat you ask your spouse forHow you express love to your spouseWhat you love or hate about your spouseTake the quiz at http://www.5lovelanguages.com/assessm...While reading the book, I guessed that my primary love language is Words of Affirmation or Quality Time. According to the quiz, my languages rank as Quality Time, followed closely by Words of Affirmation, then Acts of Service, Physical Touch, and Receiving Gifts. I’m a minimalist, so gifts aren’t very important to me. A good point for me to hear was that even if you’re frugal and rarely buy yourself gifts, you’d do well to buy gifts for your spouse, if gifts are her love language. It’s not about you, it’s about your spouse.Additional notesRequest, don’t demand that your spouse perform acts of service.Don't give advice unless you’re asked for it; just listen and sympathize."
60,0,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3476595-simsian,3,"This book is a fair amount of solid advice with an unhealthy amount of old gender role support. There is much to take from the core of this book--that each shows and receives love differently and that one can be conscious of such to show you love you feel and want to feel--but the writing is stilted at times, written for too broad an audience. At other times, it is written specifically for a Christian audience, so that is something to be mindful of going in. The core advice is good for all, but you'll need to apply your own context.One of my biggest gripes with the book comes from the utterly unrealistic depictions of conversations between married folks going through some of their toughest times. I realize it is condensed for clarity, but the result is that the conflicts look minor and disingenuous on the page. Again, the reader must tease out the gold from the garbage.I'd like to see an updated (there are MANY) version of this books that isn't mired in antiquated gender roles, specific to marriage, and open to all faiths (as this purports to be before never giving any attention to anything but the Christian church)"

Though he specifically talks about marriage, it seems pretty applicable to any loving relationship between friends, parent and children, siblings, and so forth. It makes sense that what makes me feel loved by someone is different than what makes someone else feel loved. For example, compliments do very little for me, but washing the dishes for me definitely makes me swoon! I like how Dr. Chapman has broken these concepts down into 5 basic love languages and how he gives you simple suggestions to fill people's ""love tank."" Also super enlightening is the research on feeling ""in love"" that he presents. Apparently that euphoria only lasts about 2 years. This was a big paradigm shift to what we get taught in society which is the idea that if we don't maintain that euphoria through the entirety of a relationship then our relationships are dead or are failing. It was a good read and all the anecdotes make it an easy read. "

75,0,http://goodreads.com/user/show/37375308-bridget-jack-jeffries,0,"(Warning: Book Review + Relationship Autopsy ahead)A friend of mine recommended that I read this book shortly after my husband got together with the mistress that would end our marriage. She described Chapman’s theory to me in detail and said that she felt my husband and I had experienced so many disconnects because we speak different “love languages.” The theory sounded solid, so I asked my husband to read it with me, but to no avail. While I liked the idea of the book, I didn’t actually get around to audiobooking it until now, well over a year later.The basic premise of *The Five Love Languages* is a simple one: people give and perceive love in different ways (“languages”) and couples often experience disconnects because one person’s way of showing love falls flat with another person. The five languages Chapman lays out for us are Quality Time, Physical Touch, Acts of Service, Words of Affirmation, and Receiving Gifts. For example, a woman who experiences love primarily through Receiving Gifts may not feel loved when her husband regularly compliments her and says how much he appreciates her (Words of Affirmation). That same husband may feel baffled that his wife feels so unappreciated when he tells her how wonderful she is all the time. He is giving love in his primary love language, but she feels love in a different way, therefore they disconnect and both feel frustrated.(BTW, having “Physical Touch” as a primary language is not the same thing as “I like sex.” The book covers this.)The book also covers the difference between the euphoria that is being “in love” and real, lasting relationship love, and on that note, I could not agree with the book more. The euphoria of a new relationship is like a drug. It does not, by itself, create lasting relationships, it is temporary, and when it wears off, many couples find themselves struggling with how to love. Chapman insists that love is a choice, and a person who learns of (and agrees with) his theory will make an active attempt to use his or her partner’s primary love language in expressing love, even when that is far from the primary language of the one giving love. For years, I have insisted on seeing love as a choice rather than a euphoric feeling, and feel that there is wisdom in such a take on love.It’s a shame that I did not know about this book years ago. I’m not certain that it could have saved my marriage—infidelity is about poor character and a bloated sense of entitlement, which no amount of speaking the same “love language” will fix—but I know now that we did experience many disconnects because my primary love language (Acts of Service) was his least valued love language. I would do chores, errands, and kind things for him only to have him not notice/not care, while he almost never did chores for me. Conversely, his primary love language (Quality Time), which is my 3rd language, is something we did not make a lot of time for due to jobs and finances. We both had Physical Touch as a secondary language, and that was enough to keep us together for almost eleven years, but it wasn’t enough to run on forever. My ex-husband actually did read the book in January of this year and made what seemed to be a few sincere gestures at wanting to reconcile. We talked at length about how our “love languages” differed and where we had gone wrong. Reconciliation did not happen for several reasons, one of them being that “other women” were still a factor for him, but it was cathartic to have a clearer understanding of some of the areas where our marriage had been a struggle.I have a few criticisms of the book. It was originally published in the mid-90s and needs a gender-inclusive language update. Most of the examples of couples used are Stay-At-Home-Mom/Homemaker + Husband Breadwinner; I counted two examples of working women, one of whom was said to be working part-time “mostly to get out of the house.” (Newsflash: women don’t need excuses for why they work outside the home any more than men do!) Even the women who worked seemed to have stories where there was some expectation that they would be doing most of the at-home tasks. It felt like something out of the 50s in that regard, not the 90s, and needs to be updated to include examples of more diverse work situations: both parents work, mom works while dad stays home, work-from-home parents, etc.I was also a little troubled by two examples of couples that were given. One was an adulterer who abandoned his wife and later came back to her and got a happily-ever-after when his affair failed. I felt like the man’s abuse of his wife was not taken seriously enough. The other was a story about some moron who thought it was cool if he left to play softball at key moments in his wife’s life (after his baby’s birth, after his wife’s mother’s funeral). Chapman says this man needed to give his wife the gift of his presence because his wife’s love language was “Receiving Gifts.” I say this man needed to give his wife the gift of acting like a grown-up, because doing boring things like births and funerals is how grown-ups are supposed to behave (!!!).Criticism aside, I believe that the principles of this book can help me with future relationships. I also believe it will help me with my children (the book has a section on how the languages apply to children). I am not entirely sure of my daughter’s primary language; it might be “Receiving Gifts,” but I think more observation is needed. My son, however, has (since he could walk) had an odd habit of following me to wherever I am and staying close to me. He may not be paying attention to me, he may be playing on his Kindle or phone while I work on a paper for school, but he insists on being in the same room with me and sitting/laying next to me. As I read this, the thought occurred to me that he does this because his primary love language is “Quality Time.” I will have to experiment and see how he reacts.In my inexpert divorcée opinion, *Five Love Languages* is one of the most significant books a soon-to-be-married couple can read in order to prepare for marriage. Between this and Dave Ramsey’s *Financial Peace University* classes, I know what I’ll recommend to my children to prepare them for serious relationships."
76,0,http://goodreads.com/user/show/63317285-jenny-leiva,4,"I knew the concept of the book going in and what all the love languages were, but the book was very helpful in getting a deeper picture of what they all meant. I especially enjoyed the examples from different couples that demonstrated how loving your spouse in their primary love language could change a relationship. The author also included a lot of good ideas of how to implement each love language even if it is a difficult one for you to “speak.” Overall, I thought the concept was presented well and makes it seem simple to implement. The part I didn’t like as much was that the author didn’t seem to give enough credit and value to God and the Bible. He would sometimes present a Biblical concept or directly quote a verse but wouldn’t always say that it was from the Bible. He also talked about people relying on their faith, but I don’t remember him ever mentioning praying for your spouse or God working in the marriage. I am assuming he downplayed God and scripture to make it more accessible for anyone, but it still bothered me."
77,0,http://goodreads.com/user/show/18572396-klc,4,"I put off reading this because I always thought it would be massively overrated. It ended up being one of the most informative ""self-help"" books I've ever read. At first, I gave it five stars, but I lowered it to four for one reason. The book makes it seem like you should try to show your partner love in the one or two love languages that are most important to them. It seems to me like you should show love in all the languages. Of course, we have one or two that mean the most to us, but it could only make things even better if we use all five.The reason for claiming you only need to do one or two is probably because this book is marketed toward married couples who are one step away from divorce. If you tell them to learn all five languages, it would probably be too overwhelming at that point. But still, there could've been one chapter saying it's better to do all five. "
78,0,http://goodreads.com/user/show/10054249-marne-wilson,3,"This isn’t the kind of book I usually read at all, but a friend since childhood talked about it so much that I finally agreed to read it. Well, ok, I just skimmed it enough to tell what was going on, but she’ll never know the difference! Chapman’s thesis is that there are 5 primary love languages: words of affirmation, receiving gifts, acts of service, physical touch, and quality time. Everyone has one or two ways that resonate with them and others that just don’t work at all. Take me, for example. The way I know I’m loved is when someone is willing to spend a lot of time talking with me, telling me about their feelings in their own words and learning about mine. This falls under Chapman’s category of quality time. When I met my current husband, he didn’t spend much time talking to me, because he was too busy showering me with elaborate gifts, something his first wife had trained him to do. Meanwhile, all those heaps of expensive presents were actively annoying me! It took us a while to figure out why we weren’t connecting.Of course, Chapman goes into great detail about all this, but once you’ve been clued into his five categories, you probably can figure the rest out for yourself. (So there, I’ve just saved you the trouble of buying and reading this book!) Thinking about these things really has helped me with some relationships in my life. I think more carefully about what loved ones might need from me to feel safe, and if I feel that someone isn’t giving me the right kind of quality time/talking, I’m more likely to ask for it instead of going on feeling neglected and/or drained."

Many ( or most ) couples do not speak the same love 'language'. If she feels love thru gift giving and he feels love thru acts of service, then they will be at odds as she won't really appreciate all he does around the house and feels slighted that he went away on a two week trip and did not even bring her back a teeny tiny gift, even just a lovely rock or feather found along a road.It goes a long long way to explaining some of my own past failed relationships - we were NOT talking the same language."

I highly recommend it to everyone who is in a relationship and wishes to make the other person happier, as well as understanding oneself. It's curious that my partner read it and recommended it to me at the very start of our (soon) 4-year relationship. Still going strong."

It’s meant to be spoken about, it’s the books purpose. To enhance better communication and love giving methods between couples and families and beyond. Therapists know that when you walk around in the world, and Gary Chapman describes this, random people will tell you a lot of intimate stuff, and will want advice for all sorts of situations. If you tell someone on an airplane or at a cocktail party that you are a counselor of any kind, you are done for. And yet, what we want is to be able to help others, especially if you have a formula, a resource, an insight, or an ear that will help. But we therapists also like to spin our own yarns, and most of us went into this field because we can’t help thinking about topics like interrelationship dynamics and personal and couple growth.	In my world, the Five Love Languages, even if you never read the book is sort of a household concept. Most people know it and use it, and can readily name off the five varying modes of love, and which they speak most fluently. My patients have mentioned it, as have friends, but I never had actually picked up the book. I figured I could glean the concepts pretty readily and speak it out in a two-sentence format. The basic principle is – that if you know your partner’s (or child’s or parent’s or friends, boss, sibling, etc) love language, you will be more able to give love in a way that it will be best received, and to be able to eventually get what you need as well. Truth be told, I picked up the book because I needed something published in 1990 for a Decades Bingo game with my main group on Goodreads, and I thought, why not hear a little more? The audio is five hours, and I can listen to this while I am running. And I have enjoyed the audio and the deepening of the conversation. I have a few thoughts to share, before delving into my own personal experience of the way it manifests for us. 	The first is that as a therapist, or couples therapist, this theory is exactly how we work, even if this is not the exact language used. We try to identify each person’s “vulnerable groove”, what makes them “tick” and how that is the basis for how they love and operate. Often, each partner’s vulnerable groove is in an interlocking dynamic with the other’s. Once the partners come to know each other more deeply, and what circumstances have led them in their lives to love and be loved the way they do, and understand their dynamic, they can better understand how to hear one another, what the under-message underneath the difficulty, and how to speak to the under-message. It’s very similar to the process of how Dr. Chapman works. It’s is a little less formulaic, and I think far more complex, but the concept is the same. Identify the root of the need, and improve both understanding, communication, and resultant action and behavior. Many many couples have been helped worldwide with his method. My method is definitely more psychodynamic/psychoanalytic, but it relies on the same concept. Know thyself deeply, know your partner, know the dynamic, and then speak and act where the vulnerable groove can be met with compassion, love, and trust. This is at the heart of couples counseling and couples growth. And it’s a wonderful feeling to know you have helped/saved a couple or family. It‘s incredibly rewarding. I love growth, but I love love more. Seeing couples and parents and children create strong bonds, is the height of thinking you’ve done God’s work, or simply put, “ya done good!” You have given some light in the world that warms and lasts. 	A word about God and Religion. I did not know before listening that there was a Christian flair to this. Not that the concepts are lodged there, the love languages are universal. But in thinking about this, I was realizing that there are religious framework love languages. These concepts exist completely outside of the religious framework of the author or the couple. But I did notice listening to the author, that Christianity and God as the Vessel is not my love language or theoretical framework. It was interesting to think about, a religious orientation as a love language. I deeply love when books come from the conceptual thinking and spirituality of Jewish Thought. I attend services (virtually I have gone twelve weeks in a row) and have spent 10 weeks listening to a religious couple talk about Jewish thinking about bringing Faith and Calm to these challenging times. Judaism speaks my language. I love the liturgy, the music, the concepts, the approach. It simply speaks my language. It’s how I live, breathe, love, work, think, and grow. And for not everyone, religion or spirituality is that bridge. Many interfaith couples have zero difficulty with closeness and connection, as other connections are more primary and speak louder. But it is a basis for us in our relationship. Without question, for us, Judaism is a huge shared love language. And is a huge part of who we are, and how we live and love. It’s inextricable for us both I think. Admittedly, I did find myself more off-put by the Christian bent, and even though I don’t disagree about the idea of God putting us in a couple or an individual’s path, I don’t even really think of it in that way. It’s the couple that has to do the work. I do believe we are all here for each other for a reason or season, and that we are each and all vessels to one another. But it feels subtle to me, and less glorified. Maybe in a way more spiritual than religious. One thing I really have noted though from Christianity, which is not “our” thing, but speaks volumes, is how folks internalize the idea of forgiveness and turning the other cheek. I remember going to a friends’ 7 night event of showing and discussing Oprah’s series on Belief, which encompassed many varying kinds of cultures and populations, each so varying and beautiful. Some tougher than others. But in the first episode, a Christian woman came to pray with her daughter’s murderer, spent time with him with Bible verse and forgiveness, and they found healing together. I see Christians saying, especially during the violence and aggression we are experiencing right now, I don’t hate (…), I will pray for you. And that I think is the ultimate of what Jesus likely meant by “turning the other cheek.” To pray for those that harm you. Its religious love expressed by trying to see another fully and with compassion. In that regard the parallel to marriage is obvious. To walk in another’s shoes with love and with action and with compassion over hatred.So love languages being an every day concept. I remember when I first heard it. Like with most things, it came from my friend Keri (of blessed memory). Who taught me so much about spirituality, humor, compassionate listening, non-judgement, resilience, and love. I find that since I’ve been listening to the book, these concepts are coming out everywhere. With patients, with friends, and certainly toying with the concepts with my family. Thinking about love languages and more deeply vulnerable groove, where we are most hurt, and where we most need tenderness, understanding and insight. Recently when some of us thought to celebrate our friend’s daughter’s graduation, the friend said. I love the gesture and the thought that went into it. But it’s not my daughters love language. Its mine, and I would be so moved by your idea. Deeply moved. But it’s not going to be received by her, despite the amazing idea. And I don’t want a fabulous idea with great effort not to land. But that we thought of it, was enough for the mother. Our thought was love for her and her daughter in her love language. And yes, once the idea of love languages was circling around in my consciousness, all of a sudden one sees and hears it everywhere.So what are the love languages. Acts of Service, Quality Time, Words of Affirmation, Physical Touch, and Gifts. Immediately, I understood ours – and even if reading these for the first time, you will immediately get a sense of what yours is. The idea is that we all need and use all of these things when we love. They are all important. But that there is one that we are most fluent in, that is primary, even if another comes almost as close. I knew immediately, that my husband’s and mine were the same. We are both the embodiment of Acts of Service in everything we do. It is the basis of our love, the basis of who we both are. Truth be told, if you look a little deeper, I can see that all the fights and conflicts we have also fall in this category. Like when Acts of Service are in danger, or are in compromise or distress, we are fighting almost brutally, over this principle and what it means to us at our cores. It is absolutely how we live and love, and with Words of Affirmation right behind it, as a second language. Not that the other three aren’t important – well they are. But they are not our first language – this is. When I first met Scott, he impressed me in so many ways. He was on a number of boards for community service and quickly became the co-president of the Young Leadership Division of Combined Jewish Philanthropies. He helped start Family Table, and was on the Board of Brookline Brighton Service Committee. But it was just who he was. He found himself shoveling snow when a couple was coming home with a new baby, or parking cars so an elderly person could get into Services. He was a Big Brother, and checked in on elderly folks. On the night of our first date, we went to services, because he had made a commitment to usher, and I had plans on the Saturday night. After services we went and had the other kind of first date, but it started there. I found out sometime after we were married that he still (51 years now) sends flowers to his first grade teacher every year on her birthday. Has never missed a year. He is the one who sends masks to a cousin in need, sends food to healthcare workers, who checks in on an elderly neighbor. Remembers to clear a path. Helps to deliver meals for the synagogue, like his mother and father did before him. He thinks of the essential workers, and long before they had their day in the sun. He is the guy who sees on Thanksgiving morning that the police are having breakfast alongside us at Sarge’s Deli, and quietly pays for their meal. Because he honors service. He is the one who will stand in the rain and the cold at our kids sports meets and games. Who makes sure that if someone needs to get signed up for sports, or needs gear, that it happens. He is the guy who puts money in my wallet, and fills the cars with gas. His household skills are extraordinary, and sometimes it gets on my nerves a little bit to tell the truth. If he hears the quiet whisper of an ow, or an oh no, or thinks I might be organizing, cleaning, or making dinner, he appears. If I flinch at a spider, it is gone before I’ve had the chance to call him. Earlier this week, I texted him about a dead squirrel in the yard, while we were taking the bikes out of the shed. Before we could ride away, he was there with materials. My youngest son nailed it. He says that Daddy “Apparates”. He does. It’s weird and eerie and borders on controlling. But if I forgot to bring a towel into the bathroom, he never leaves me hanging. But I would sometimes like to wipe down a sink, take care of a spill, make a cake or macaroni and cheese, it’s a little unnerving that he turns up for the task in a way that is more controlling than helpful. He makes beds, does dishes, goes grocery shopping, changes lights, manages cars and trash, and the second I say something needs to be done, he has likely thought about it and done it already. He is in full charge of the dog to the exclusion of the family. He sounds ideal, but sometimes its too much of a good thing. Especially since my need for control is more than equal. Those who know me, know I put 100% into everything I do, and into the spirituality behind each act. I throw elaborate holidays, and each time, each year, it is an all out new event that requires no shortcuts. This year for the Pandemic, Rabbis told us we were allowed to cut some corners, have a mediocre Passover Seder. I have never heard of such a thing, and in fact the mere idea of that caused me extreme sadness and possible panic. Miss even a year of the Seders and holidays we put forth for the kids, my parents, our friends? Not on my watch! I put laborious effort into every detail of the bar mitzvahs, seeing each even tiny detail as an act of love. Packing for Camp, for the Israel trip. It’s no small matter. Even the elementary school teacher requests are a laborious effort. Preschool shopping, college planning, SAT Prep, anyone who knows me, knows these aren’t regular activities. It’s a whole affair that is laden with small details, each that are overwhelming acts of love. And merely getting my teen through high school, teaching them to ride a bike, to dance, to read, my acts of service are endless and a little bit over the top. Plus, I do the laundry and the bills. My life is filled with trying to do the little things for others that make a difference. I am a care-taker, and we are care-takers. I find ways to make sure ears are clean, computer keyboards are clean, birthdays, vacations, are planned, books to read are bought or gotten from the library. That charities are thought of, that random acts of kindnesses happen, that people are remembered. Holiday cards have never been late or gone missing. He won’t touch any aspect of that, although he mails them. All 150-200. I’m overextended and overworked. But we don’t live any other way.But when two people are firmly Acts of Service, how really does that work? Well we butt heads some, both of us are controlling and have an idea of what the other should be doing. We both have quirks. Scott does not like a milk bowl in the sink with milk residue in it, so I try never to leave that. I cannot stand price tags on my shower products. It makes me crazy to see some sticker of how much the conditioner cost, when I am trying to take a meditative shower. I also don’t like stickers on wine, name tags, bandaids, etc. We are both finicky. We insist in the most nagging of ways to tell the other how a small thing must be done and in what order, so that we each have peace. And we can have it out about the stupidest things. Or just give in to the idea that each of us cares about something enough that the other should back off. We can absolutely yell and scream when something that should work does not. I swear to God that twice this year, we were on the brink of divorce due to the Printer. Like when I need Jaden’s letter to a college coach printed ASAP, (Pt 2 of review found in Heart of 5)"

83,0,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5717792-scott-rhee,3,"I will preface this review by saying that I am pretty fortunate to have married someone as wonderful as my wife. We are nearing our fourth anniversary, and we have a baby due in a few short months, and I can honestly say that I am pretty happy. Could things be better? Sure, probably, in little ways, there is always room for improvement, but for the most part, my wife and I seem to be doing things right. So, it might seem odd that I am reading marital-help books when I don't think our marriage needs any help, but I view it as a wise bit of proactive ""pre-emptive first strike"" against marital problems that may develop down the line, because, let's face it, they will. My wife and I don't know of any of our married couple friends---some who have been married for a long time---who DON'T have some kind of marital issue, be it financial, emotional, sexual, or other.Gary Chapman's short little book, ""The 5 Love Languages"" has been recommended to me by numerous friends and married couples, and having read it, I can understand why they find it useful. Chapman, an anthropologist and a marriage consultant (a strangely appropriate combo), theorizes that most marriages fail due to a lack of understanding the proper ""language"" of love by one or both partners.His premise is that everyone speaks one of five different languages of love. ""Language"" in this case refers to the way that a person feels loved. If your partner does not speak the same language as you, obviously miscues and miscommunication may occur in regards to how your partner expresses his or her love for you.It sounds corny, but it does make a bit of intuitive sense. Chapman illustrates his points with examples of some of his case histories with couples. For example, in one case, a husband who worked long, hard hours felt that his wife was constantly nagging him, and he didn't understand how she didn't appreciate the fact that his hard work was an expression of his love for her. She, on the other hand, felt that her husband didn't love her precisely because he was working long hours. She felt he was trying to avoid being around her. According to Chapman, the wife's language of love is based on Quality Time: she felt loved when her husband spent time with her---even small amounts of time, like just sitting to eat a quick breakfast before he went to work. To her, those times were extremely important, even if they didn't seem that significant to him. The husband's love language is based on Words of Affirmation: he felt loved when his wife complimented him or recognized his achievements. Any show of appreciation---a simple ""Thanks for taking out the garbage, hon.""---was his way of knowing that she loved him. Needless to say, her words of frustration and anger made him feel unloved.Knowing these things and acting upon them are, of course, two very different things. In some cases, one partner may not feel comfortable speaking the other partner's love language. For example, the language of Physical Touch---hugging, holding hands, any type of physical intimacy---may be difficult for someone who was not raised in a family where those types of physical contact were commonplace. The language of Receiving Gifts, in which a person feels loved when his or partner gives them actual objects symbolic of love, may be completely foreign to someone who doesn't need or like material things as an expression of love. Acts of Service, the fifth language of love, is feeling loved when your partner does things around the house: doing the dishes, the laundry, filling the car's gas tank, etc. To someone whose love language is different, Acts of Service may not mean much.The five languages do make sense, however, and after reading the book, I immediately recognized my own language and my wife's. We're just fortunate enough that we have intuitively gathered what we need in the relationship to make it work. The book simply helps in recognizing how and why we do this, and how we can improve our relationship.I would recommend this book for any married couple, either newlywed or those married for decades, who may feel that their love life has become stagnant or who simply want to re-energize an already-healthy marriage. It's worth a read.Apparently, Chapman has made this book a franchise, having published ""5 Love Language"" editions for single people, teenagers, and children. There's also an edition for divorced people and one for the workplace. I guess when you have a good idea, you need to run with it..."

Without love, I may spend a lifetime in search of significance, self-worth, and security. When I experience love, it influences all of those needs positively. I am now freed to develop my potential. I am more secure in my self-worth and can now turn my efforts outward instead of being obsessed with my own needs. True love always liberates.  Camp out in the living room. Spread your blankets and pillows on the floor. Get your Pepsi and popcorn. Pretend the TV is broken and talk like you used to when you were dating. Talk till the sun comes up or something else happens. If the floor gets too hard, go back upstairs and go to bed. You won’t forget this evening! Love doesn't keep a score of wrongs. Love doesn't bring up past failures. None of us is perfect. In marriage we do not always do the right thing. We have sometimes done and said hurtful things to our spouses. We cannot erase the past. We can only confess it and agree that it was wrong. We can ask for forgiveness and try to act differently in the future. Having confessed my failure and asked forgiveness, I can do nothing more to mitigate the hurt it may have caused my spouse. When I have been wronged by my spouse and she has painfully confessed it and requested forgiveness, I have the option of justice or forgiveness. If I choose justice and seek to pay her back or make her pay for her wrongdoing, I am making myself the judge and her the felon. Intimacy becomes impossible. If, however, I choose to forgive, intimacy can be restored. Forgiveness is the way of love. Forgiveness is not a feeling; it is a commitment. It is a choice to show mercy, not to hold the offense up against the offender. Forgiveness is an expression of love.Our most basic emotional need is not to fall in love but to be genuinely loved by another, to know a love that grows out of reason and choice, not instinct. I need to be loved by someone who chooses to love me, who sees in me something worth loving. That kind of love requires effort and discipline. It is the choice to expend energy in an effort to benefit the other person, knowing that if his or her life is enriched by your effort, you too will find a sense of satisfaction—the satisfaction of having genuinely"

I personally believe in the authors assessment and diagnosis for adding another level of understanding to your partner. This system will not help you identify toxic relationships. This is not that sort of relationship guide. This is for improving relationships that need a little bit of tweaking, or course corrections, or for understanding your partner a little more than you already do.The bad. This book could be ten pages long and still accurately discuss the philosophy in depth and using examples. There is nothing new presented after you grasp the concept, which is immediately apparent. The entire book is just example after example. You're learning a simple concept in the first chapter, and the author drags it out page after page of nearly identical examples. Each ""story"" he talks about is not only a reinforcement of the concept he presented, but also a gentle push to traditional roles in marriage (most examples had the wife either a homemaker, or a part timer who allowed her husband to be the head of the family - or something similarly outdated) This fact makes this book seem like it's about families stuck in the 1950's.Heads up to the real people who read this. If you are in an abusive relationship, this is NOT the author for you. His examples suggest ""solving"" abusive relationships rather than properly advising an exit strategy. Most professionals acknowledge that abusers will never stop abusing, regardless of how circumstances change. People who abuse others have that need or tendency baked into their personality, it's never because of circumstance. No one should ever stay in a relationship if they're being abused.Conclusion? For healthy relationships this is a great concept. Very relevant. Excellent information for even someone who wants to improve an already great relationship, or for someone who just wants to understand their partner better.The overall, the presentation is slightly offensive, it talks down to the reader (Likely unintentional, probably a side effect of the author's style of teaching). Instead of buying it, take the test online on the author's website. It's free. The book is basically the same five pages repeated over and over. It feels like a cash grab by the publisher and author. If you are not religious, you might get turned off by the thinly veiled Christian context. This book has a very low reading grade level that might make it readable even by those who struggle with reading."

Had it not been for a book group discussion assignment I guarantee I never would have picked up this book.I'm so glad I did! It's really fun to read. The concept is very simple and makes loads of sense. The writing is very down to earth and Chapman gives so many examples through stories that it's a very fast read.In short, he explains that everyone speaks different languages in life (Spanish, German, English, etc.) and it's the same with love. We're all raised differently and what we try to do to show our spouse/kids we love them doesn't necessarily mean they are receiving the message that we love them after all (and vice versa). We all have different love languages and he helps the reader discover what hers/his is.When I asked what my husband thought my love language is he told me, but it wasn't right...it was actually his own love language he thought was mine and I thought his was what mine is. It was quite eye opening and I love that now that I know that I feel differently when he does certain things because I know he's trying to speak my love language...and I'm trying to speak his. We were already very happy in our marriage, but this does open eyes and make things a bit richer for us. Great book...glad I read it."
87,0,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1353601-brennan,3,"I work with a lot of couples doing marital therapy and I think Chapman's main points are very interesting and probably provide a missing piece to the field. One caution is that book is based completely on anecdotal clinical stories and to my knowledge, none of this is supported by any literature or studies. I could go on and on and bore with you the arguments about empirically-supported treatments versus those based on clinical consensus. Although I think Chapman's points are over simplistic and not supported by any research, they do provide important insight into the nature of love and how our need to be loved can either be met or unmet in our marital relationships. Marriage counseling aside, I think this book has the most value for anyone who is married. It proposes that in order to express love for another it is first essential that we understand how our spouse feels loved (i.e., their love language). Once we understand this, we need to willing to choose to love the person in that way. This is difficult as we commonly want to love someone by treating them in ways that would make us feel loved. As a result, few people ever are able to do this successfully. But since increasing our capacity to love is one of the highest human ideals, it makes sense that it will also be one of our greatest challenges."

It also has exercises at the end that bring clarity and give you the tools to start a healthy discussion. It was somehow a nice read, I enjoyed the theory, and I think it is highly applicable and helpful in relationships (couple ones, friendship ones, parenthood ones). I did not enjoy most of the examples, though. Like 90% of them were about couples in which women were doing all the house chores. And just one was about a couple in which the man was doing most of them, because he was enjoying it, and the author asked himself, ""what is the woman doing all day?"". I mean, I do understand that this book was written in the 90s, but hey, equality? Except that you will find a lot of other gender stereotypes too. Anyway, I do recommend it, but I, personally, got annoyed many times while reading it. If you get annoyed by these things too, arm yourself with patience."

I'd actually heard about the theories behind this one a couple years ago from a woman I was dating, though at the time it was more of a lecture. . .I digress. . .Anyway, this was another really helpful book looking at the different ways men and women like to receive love, and it again explained a lot both in regards to past relationships as well as about myself. It was really interesting reading about the frustrations Chapman's clients felt because they were truly giving what they believed to be love, but because their spouse spoke a different ""language"", it didn't really mean anything to them. It's good info to know and to just be aware of, and like the other relationship books I've read, most of this stuff just feels like common sense that you kind of already knew but hadn't really thought about. There was even a quiz to tell you what ""language"" you prefer. I found that I prefer physical touch followed closely by words of affirmation. Now I can lecture someone else about it."
