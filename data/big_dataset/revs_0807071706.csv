0,0807071706,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2018505-thomas,4,"A powerful book that pierces through the notion that women are biologically inferior to men. With great diligence, Angela Saini combs through decades and decades of research that tried to show how women are worse than men in several areas, ranging from intelligence to aptitude for work to physical health. She uses a thorough understanding of science and a fine eye for detail to reveal how many of these perceived sex differences were actually the product of biased researchers or flawed studies. Saini discusses an array of ways in which this inaccurate idea of female inferiority came to popularity: research journals favoring studies that show differences over studies that show similarities, scientific findings that fail to take into account culture and patriarchy, sexism in research labs and universities, and more. She sheds light on new research that seeks to understand gender and sex from more nuanced, feminist, and holistic perspectives.Overall, I enjoyed this book and would recommend it to everyone, in particular to those interested in science, feminism, and the production of knowledge. While I do not think we necessarily need a biological argument to fight for women's advancement (i.e., cancer can be perceived as ""natural"" and we fight it anyway), Inferior does advance the discourse surrounding gendered discrimination in science in meaningful ways. It makes a great follow-up to Cordelia Fine's 
Delusions of Gender
, which addressed similar topics with a specific focus on neurosexism. Inferior has inspired me to continue striving for more socially just and feminist approaches in my research agenda, and I hope it does the same for many other scientists."

I particularly found the medical stuff very interesting — the differences between male and female immune systems, the set of diseases unique to people with Y chromosones, etc. Pretty neat.But, while there was a lot of great content in the book, I often found myself a bit annoyed with the biased presentation of some of that content. Despite claiming at the beginning that she ""had no axe to grind"", it's very clear that she actually did. I especially had issues with her discussion of the anthropological data. She concludes that ""science"" has ""proven"" that men and women have evolved biologically and culturally performing the SAME tasks, which is not only, I would say, highly controversial but which she provided counter-examples to in her own book! She points out that women in certain communities kill animals with their digging sticks, and therefore women are hunters, and therefore women and men are exactly alike. I don't find that argument convincing.She includes but doesn't comment upon the very interesting fact that women almost without exception are responsible for weaving cross-culturally. And somehow she completely ignores war. That,to me, is an incredible omission. If you're going to make the argument that there are no population-wide behavioural differences between men and women, how can you leave out war? (Of course you can find examples of warrior women throughout history, but I think it's utterly disingenuous not to recognize how steeply gendered warfare is and has been). I don't see a convincing way to account for that that is based purely on socially constructed gender norms.It would have been nice to see inclusion of the Batek people indigenous to Malaysia. They are (or were) a completely non-authoritarian society with almost no social hierarchies whatsoever. Any person could do whatever they liked, and compulsion was viewed as a crime. Women could and did hunt. Men could and did weave baskets. And yet what anthropologists found is that men were overwhelmingly the hunters, while women were overwhelmingly the weavers. Even without any overt or implicit social pressures! Highly regarded men could and did weave, but most men still didn't. No one told them they couldn't, their status wasn't threatened if they did, but most men preferred to spend their time elsewise. The same goes for women hunters. They weren't ostracized or discouraged, and yet very few women dedicated themselves to hunting. Why?I think Saini makes the same error that so many of her opponents make in conflating difference with inferiority. So she is right to point out that women are just as important as men in the development and maintenance of human culture. I really liked her discussion of Woman the Gatherer, where the argument is made that the kinds of activities women end to be responsible for cross-culturally in small-scale societies (gathering tubors, picking fruit, etc) are just as important (if not more important) than the large-game hunting that men often pursue in terms of calories. But the behavioural differences there are very hard to ignore, and Saini didn't do a good job at all of demonstrating that those differences don't exist. In fact, she switches between presenting the argument that ""women's work"" provides more calories than ""men's work"" and the argument that men and women do the same work. That would be fine if she were simply presenting all the various theories, but she makes it clear throughout the book that women and men are functionally the same, and that ""science"" supports that view.She brings up intersexed people, and talks about the ramifications, for example, of surgically assigning an intersex person with underdeveloped testes a female gender, but she doesn't seem to acknowledge the significance of those ramifications for her argument that men and women are fundamentally the same. If a person born with underdeveloped testes grows up with gender dysphoria because they were made to believe they were female, then obviously there IS something significant about the psychological differences between males and females. Indeed, the entire transgender movement now is premised upon there being fundamental differences between men and women — you can't have dysphoria if gender differences are purely social. It would have been nice if Saini had discussed transgender people more broadly. She dismisses scientists like Baron-Cohen for not having had their experiments reproduced, but then is happy to include without qualifications untested speculation about things like whether language developed so that babies could communicate with mothers. She also dismisses Baron-Cohen because his findings (that men are more interested in systems and women in people from birth) is sexist because it implies that women are ""more suited"" to low-paying jobs like teaching, childcare, and nursing. Okay. So this is interesting. What, exactly, is wrong with those jobs? Those are perfectly fine and necessary vocations. Her problem seems to be that they aren't especially high-paying, and so I guess the implication is that only high-paying jobs are worthwhile. But this presents a problem, because the fact is that women dominate in exactly those kinds of jobs. So how do you explain the dramatic over-representation of women in those careers? Baron-Cohen would say that this distribution is entirely consistent with his findings (women tend to prefer working with people). Saini suggests that it is purely a result of social factors. Her argument is that women have to face a lot more discrimination and hardship than men, and so they stay out of male-dominated, high-paying careers like STEM or finance (this explanation, of course, doesn't offer any account of how those careers became so gendered in the first place — saying that ""women's jobs"" are low status simply begs the question). To prove her point, she gives the example of Iran and Latin America, where women make up proportionally more of the STEM field. Okay. So. Does that mean, then, that women in IRAN are facing LESS discrimination that women in the U.K or Canada? Personally, I find that argument very hard to believe. Saini doesn't consider the fact that the economic situation in Iran is very different, and that women might be facing more pressure to take high-paying jobs that they might not actually prefer in order to survive.She also ignores the fact that in Iran (as far as I know, and I could be wrong), the state plays a significant role in determining the post-secondary careers of students based on test scores. IE, women in Iran have LESS CHOICE in career than women in the United States, and so the social pressures in this case might very well be working to increase gender equity in STEM, rather than to diminish it, contrary to her assumption. This is consistent with the data from Nordic countries, where increasing attempts to remove gendered barriers through things like maternity/paternity protections etc. are resulting in MORE differentiation between men and women into traditionally male and female dominated fields.If that's true, then the situation now really isn't that different from the situation with egalitarian hunter-gatherer communities like the Batek: men and women might naturally tend to differentiate across different fields of activity, without that differentiation producing or resulting from any perceived inferiority on the part of either gender. Saini, I'm sure, would reject that suggestion on the grounds that it is sexist and that it promotes stereotypical gender norms. But there is a difference, for example, between saying that women don't have the intelligence or the fortitude to be software engineers, and saying that women might tend to prefer other careers over software engineering. Just because someone CAN do something, doesn't mean that they WANT to do it.Obviously women can do anything that men can do (except pee standing up). Anyone who suggests differently is sexist. But I don't see, and I was not convinced by this book to believe, that any population-wide behavioural differences or distributions between men and women must be the result of sexist attitudes. Saini says that there are some people who ""assume that there is a fundamental difference between men and women"". Well, I mean, that's not really an assumption, is it? There ARE fundamental differences between men and women. We're significantly different morphologically. We differ chromosonally. But, most significantly and most obviously, only women can get pregnant. This is not a trivial difference, and it's one which you would expect would produce some variations in gendered behaviour over millions of years of evolution. Which is exactly what we see in other animals. Is the lioness inferior to the lion, simply because they have slightly different behaviours?"
2,0807071706,http://goodreads.com/user/show/28602001-emma,4,"The overarching point of this book, that the imbalance between men and women is socially and culturally, rather than biologically or scientifically, defined seems to me to be self evident. Of course, being female might have something to do with that outlook since i'd be on the losing side otherwise. I have never seen or believed in any inferiority in my sex or gender, neither do I believe in male/female characteristics, assigned gender roles, specific colours for boys and girls...etc etc. If anything, the most surprising thing about the book and wider contemporary society is that we're still coming up against these outdated and increasingly unsupported ideas now. That is one of the main aims of the book, to underline the essential bias of societal and cultural norms that formed the basis for the apparently impartial scientific studies of the past. As a historian, one of the most important things you learn is the time specific nature of research: the type of questions asked, how the questions are framed, what seems important, methodology, desired outcomes- all these elements are determined by the current social, cultural, religious, economic, and political themes of the time. Scientific investigation is far from free of these biases and Saini suggests that only now are we starting to develop new ways of thinking. Of course, there may be some biological differences between men and women, but they need to be considered without linked ideas of superiority or inferiority. For example, Saini notes that in the case of heart attacks, men and women tend to have different symptoms and reactions, yet studies, and therefore medication, have been focused on the male experience, thus potentially being less effective for women. If that is true for the pathways of disease on a wider scale, how often are women not receiving the kind of care they need? It's a perfect example of the kind of assumptions that need to be addressed- what works for one does not necessary work as well for the other. There's a lot of research here, which Saini systematically explains, evaluating both strengths and weaknesses. Importantly, the author is positive overall; while she spends time exploding some of the scientific myths of the past, she also highlights the way changes have already been put in place and the increasingly expanded and essential role of women in, and as subjects of, scientific research. A timely and worthy read.ARC via Netgalley."
3,0807071706,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6100646-brian-clegg,5,"There are times when a book comes along that is perfectly timed for the zeitgeist - and that's true of Angela Saini's Inferior. Most of the educational and scientific community would, I'm sure, protest their absolute lack of gender bias - but the fact remains that the scientific establishment is still predominantly run by men, even if in some disciplines there are more female students and postgrads than male. And some scientists tell us that there is evidence to underline why this is the natural order, due to brain differences between males and females.Saini systematically pulls this assertion apart, showing how many of the apparent brain differences (and even physical modification of the brain) can be the result of cultural influences. It's not that there are absolutely no male/female differences in the brain, but they are small - in fact significantly smaller than the differences from individual to individual, a comparison that should mean that they are considered insignificant.After a shocking opening, demonstrating just how recently women's brains were genuinely considered inferior - Saini is able to quote Darwin in a letter making it clear that he believed this to be the case - it's not surprising that we get a lot of material showing how unfair this is. The only danger when this is done is of using the same type of dodgy data to make the counter argument. So, for example, a couple of times we are told that girls are, in fact, better at certain intellectual activities at some ages than boys - but clearly, given the lack of difference in brains, this too is presumably not a real distinction, but a cultural imposition.We also see some remarkable bias in the development of anthropological ideas, pushing through to evolutionary ones. Saini shows us how a 1960s symposium put across the idea that 'man as hunter' was the driver for civilisation, while totally ignoring the arguably more significant roles of women that went in parallel with this and would have to have been at least equally important in any shaping of our evolution and civilisation. It does seem shocking that scientists could get it so wrong in the modern era - and its hard not to see these errors pushing through into a sustained gender bias that should be incomprehensible with a proper, object scientific viewpoint.This is strong and thought-provoking stuff. If anything, Saini holds back in certain areas. While she points out the horrors of female genital mutilation, she only mentions in passing the way that some cultures, often driven by religion, still impose strictures on women that are accepted in the West because we don't like to be seen as racist or intolerant. Whether we talking about the culturally imposed wearing of a headscarf or large scale restriction of female independence, as long as these are tolerated it's hard to see that opinions can be universally changed. There were a couple of small scientific issues. Those who insist on a strong distinction between the male and female brain often using evolutionary arguments. As Saini begins to pull this apart she makes the statement 'For every difference or similarity we see, there must be some evolutionary purpose to it.' But this suggests a non-existent directed nature for evolution. And while natural selection makes it more likely that many changes will stay in a species if they have a benefit, it's entirely possible for changes that don't have a benefit to be kept, because no better alternative displaces them. There are plenty of oddities in the human body which, frankly, could be designed better - they don't have a purpose. Similarly there was significant focus on other primates to make observations on human evolutionary biology. But these are species that have changed as much genetically from our common ancestors as we have. I'm not sure how much we can learn about human evolutionary gender differences from a species we split from millions of years before Homo sapiens existed. But in both these cases, the impact is relatively small on the argument.I can imagine some readers will say that surely it is no longer necessary to make these points - we're all aware of them. You only have to look at the kind of society portrayed in a 1960s-set drama like Mad Men to see how much we've moved on. And we do, for instance, have more major political parties led by women than men in the UK at the moment. But the reality is that there are still unnecessary distinctions being made. We do see examples of women being treated as mental and social inferiors, or being segregated because of their gender. In some areas of science, there are still strong advocates for theories that probably should have been left with the Victorians. So this is a book we certainly need."
4,0807071706,http://goodreads.com/user/show/21669148-carling,5,"One day in high school I was discussing with someone the possibility of getting certified in first aid. While they were encouraging, they also recommended doing some reading outside of the classroom. When I ask why, their reply was simple: ""They didn't tell me that a woman's symptoms of a heart attack are different than a man's."" At the time I remember being shocked that something so deadly and so important to know wasn't a part of the very lifesaving course I and many others rely on. It was the first time I felt like science maybe wasn't as equal as I imagined. Fast forward four years and I'm diagnosed with a chronic illness that mostly impacts women. I can list to you maybe five facts that we know for sure about it and the research is scarce. Again, I find myself thinking back to those high school days and wondering why erectile dysfunction is more studied than my own very real disease. Inferior discusses ways in which science has historically suppressed women. Part feminist analysis and part scientific overview of certain aspects of gender-based and evolutionary scientific fields, Inferior is incredibly well researched with equal balance given to both sides. I can't remember the last time I felt so empowered by a book and validated for feelings I never knew I had. In an age where we question science for all the wrong reasons, Inferior sheds a light on questions that we should be asking. 5 stars"
5,0807071706,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4739465-monica,4,"I almost classified this book incorrectly. I thought it would be more social science/feminism than it is. While there is plenty of that too, the book is ostensibly about the bias in science and scientific studies that lead to questionable findings. Indeed, the quest to maintain the patriarchy is pervasive where gender distinctions/differences are concerned. Such biases have shown up in animal studies in a sense scientifically anthropomorphize animals to fit traditional human gender roles. The assumptions that females are inferior regardless of species. Saini goes back to history and shows that even Charles Darwin started from an intractable, sexist view and also mentions that Lawrence Summers former President of Harvard declared that there were fewer women in science because they simply are not as intelligent. This by the way happened in the 21st century. Enjoyable book that on the whole really is more about physical and biological science than sociology. It's interesting and brief and not too in-depth. Recommended for anyone with an interest in unconscious bias and how it impacts everything. Even science.4+ StarsListened to the audio book. Hanna Melbourn was a good, not great narrator."
6,0807071706,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3409532-april-does-feral-sometimes,4,"Edit July 7, 2019Here is a link to an essential video on masculinity on youtube:https://youtu.be/Cetg4gu0oQQMy review of ‘Inferior’:Gentle readers, especially you men, if you have great expectations in raising a girl child, especially of raising a girl child who will support you in your old age, I recommend 'Inferior: How Science Got Women Wrong'.This excellent, if too brief, overview survey of the cultural history of Western science studies on women is a general reader's book, very accessible and easy to read. The author lists all of the sources for the statistics, studies, quotes, and actual science results in the back of the book in a References section, so if the reader wants more science than history, you can do more in-depth research yourself. The author, Angela Saini, has a master's in engineering from Oxford University. Currently, she is working as an award-winning science journalist.The chapters are:Woman's Inferiority to ManFemales Get Sicker but Males Die QuickerA Difference at BirthThe Missing Five Ounces of the Female BrainWomen's WorkChoosy, Not ChasteWhy Men DominateThe Old Women Who Wouldn't DieThe most fascinating and revealing takeway I had in reading 'Inferior: How Science Got Women Wrong' is that most of the current research scientists are working on today in regards to female physiology and psychology is about studying, and ultimately disproving, what were commonly believed and unproven 'facts' about women from the Middle Ages which are STILL commonly believed around the world today.Gentle reader, like me, you may have noticed most of the 'scientific studies' in the recent past century written up in magazine articles - even about actual studies which actually have included human women as laboratory test subjects, even if only as cells in Petri dishes - did not occur much until around the 1950's. It was rare even so. Women were only occasionally included in actual scientific studies. Today, it is being discovered that what works for men, or inside of men, sometimes does not work for women. Lately, people are figuring out it isn't always about hormones, but it possibly could be because women are smaller. Big shock, right? Wait! There is more!Most so-called science articles I grew up reading about gender and sex characteristics/differences, and in some written even today, describe culturally-based opinions, not facts, but OPINIONS, promulgated first by men, and then later by women, as scientifically-based conclusions. The Truth is the vast majority of gender/sex-characteristics studies, until the last fifty years, do not include any actual science or scientific studies using the scientific method on women. Does it help to understand the situation better to learn that most universities, including the top elite colleges, forbid women from studying for a science degree, or sometimes from even enrolling in science/medical/engineering/machine-shop classes, until the mid-1970's? That most women never attended school throughout history thus they never learned to read and write? That even today, many Muslim theocracies forbid male doctors from even treating women, so their experience of women is ludicrously shallow and based on cultural folk-tales from the Middle Ages? There have been many recorded cases of women dying from easily treatable injuries or diseases because of religious and cultural beliefs and a lack of female doctors.It still was a rarity to have real women included in scientific studies until about 2000. There was lots of ink spilled on scientific OPINIONS about women written by men dating back to the 1880's which, of course, were accepted as facts. When actual science was done, it was more along the lines of dissections of dead bodies by men noticing women's brains were smaller than men's, which led to the scientific conclusion women were dumber and more permanently immature than men (never thinking about whales' brains, obviously). Mind you, this was the same period when scientists studied the bumps on skulls and the angle of foreheads to determine the levels of male intelligence. Some scientists of these times were also experimenting with transfusing dog blood into people, and were looking at the pituitary gland, among other organs, for a sign of a soul, and were still scratching their heads about what the heart's purpose was, since most human dissections were performed on dead people.What this means, logically speaking in my humble opinion, is that what we all 'know' about women has been pure mythology until the last fifty years or so.Is there any correlation between the events of male scientists deciding to apply true scientific principles FINALLY to studying women, and the unfeminine unruly unladylike mass protests/marches/strikes - violent and non-violent - of the women's liberation movements - part one being the suffragette anarchy in the 1920's and part two, the women's movement in the 1970's? I suggest, potential reader, especially male readers, that you sit with this thought a bit right now and think a little more deeply about this for a minute or two. Especially if you have young daughters, especially if they show an interest in fixing or programming your car, or building your house into a 'smart' house, or are designing a bridge or a rocketship while doodling, or even if they are figuring out how to re-program that video game console to spy on the neighbors from your livingroom but you still don't know how to turn it on, or they set the cat's broken leg after a misadventure, much less that they can run faster/bench press more reps/do higher maths than you ever could, daddy...pride in a daughter is as wonderful as in a son! I hope more and more parents discover this verity.Meanwhile, according to the book (and I agree) it seems, perhaps, male sexual jealousy has been a primitive driving force, if not the main one, behind the creation of the segregated and lower social status of women. Men can't make children without a woman's womb, and they can't guarantee any child is actually one they helped make unless they take drastic action in making sure a woman has not been with another man (until recently, no man could know for a fact a child was from his sperm without controlling women's freedoms). In my humble opinion (not stated in the book), it may be behind the millennia of years that women have been imprisoned in some kind of a purdahed state by the many differing and accrued cultural social accretions around the world (religion, brute force, cultural customs, fear, punitive morality, no education, enforced roles of motherhood and cook). Unbiased scientific studies are proving women are much the same as men (within a few statistical deviations on the usual bell curves), in behaviors, brain talents, psychology, if raised with the same expectations and educational opportunities as men. Actual behavior differences can be put down to gender window-dressing, imho, once culture is eliminated.I wish I could remake the world."
7,0807071706,http://goodreads.com/user/show/83144-el,3,"There were (and still are) people who like to say that men and women are inherently different, as in our minds are ""wired"" differently. Men ""naturally"" are better at science, technology, engineering, and mathematical fields (STEM), women ""naturally"" are better at other stuff, like having babies and being pretty. For years (and still), women in the STEM fields have been largely ignored for their contributions and their efforts, and the men in the same fields have taken the credit for the work that women have done. We are learning more and more about this sort of thing everyday, but the fact that we are still learning about something that should have been public from the get-go is insane to me.Even the women who fought for equality, the ones who challenged this backwards thinking (that men can just do all the science-y and math-y things and women can't) are still largely lost to history. Angela Saini did a good job of pointing out some of those people in this book.So, Charles Darwin? Sort of a prick when it came to how he viewed women. Yeah, yeah, we can argue all day about how he was a product of his time, yada yada yada. But did you know someone (a WOMAN, gasp) challenged him on his viewpoints? In 1881, Caroline Kennard called Darwin out on this whole inferiority of women thing, and he responded that while women are morally superior, they will never be equal to men unless they become breadwinners, but then that's a problem too because then the children and the household would suffer. In other words, women are more stupid than men, and they should have no aspirations.I'm just pointing out that Kennard was also a product of her time, and she didn't sit back and let Darwin call the shots. That's the thing about the historical context argument - there are always people fighting the good fight, even if everyone else wants to ignore them for disrupting the status quo.This is an interesting, short book. The argument is that science is proving more and more that the differences between men's and women's brains are not biological. There are more social and cultural reasons for the differences between how men and women often think. Some countries outright kill their female offspring because male heirs are much more appealing.Pretending like women never made any advancements in any fields other than baby-raisin' and house-keepin' is bananas. Saini brings up all sorts of names and their achievements, many of whom have been ignored for so long. This still happens all the time, right? Women in STEM fields are still harassed (sexually, emotionally, mentally, physically), their contributions are adopted by their male colleagues and their male colleagues receive the credit, and they still don't make the same amount of money in their lines of work as men do. And it's not just the STEM fields, but because Saini's book discusses the ""science"" of the matter, it's natural that the STEM fields would be the primary focus of her research.One thing scientists seem to know for sure but don't know why this is the case, is that women tend to outlive men. We seem to handle sickness differently and survive illnesses differently. We seem to survive some crazy shit that can kill a man in no time. But this is all relatively new study because, of course, no one has really ever wanted to study women. Which leads me to believe that we women truly are witches.It isn't that women don't get sick. They do. They just don't die from these sicknesses as easily or as quickly as men do.One explanation for this gap is that higher levels of estrogen and progesterone in women might be protecting them in some way. These hormones don't just make the immune system stronger but also more flexible, according to Sabine Oertelt-Prigione, a researcher at the Institute of Gender in Medicine at the Charite university hospital in Berlin. ""This is related to the fact that women can bear children,"" she explains. A pregnancy is the same as foreign tissue growing inside a woman's body that, if her immune system was in the wrong gear, would be rejected. ""You need an immune system that's able to switch from proinflammatory reactions to anti-inflammatory reactions in order to avoid having an abortion pretty much every time you get pregnant. The immune system needs to have mechanisms that can, on one side, trigger all these cells to come together in one spot and attack whatever agent is making you sick. But then you also need to be able to stop this response when the agent is not there anymore, in order to prevent tissues and organs from being harmed.""(p35)See. WITCHES.But that magical lucky charms immune system can also backfire, and that can explain why some many of us women have autoimmune disorders. Basically our immune systems see us as being foreign and therefore must be destroyed. So it attacks itself. As someone who has an autoimmune disease, I found this fascinating, even if sounds like some version of baloney. All I'm saying is there's a lot that still hasn't been figured out yet because women's bodies are apparently so bizarre that no one can do the proper studies of it. Except maybe women, but no one listens to them anyway.This is an interesting book and a quick read. I managed to read it in one day, sort of accidentally, but it reads quickly because Saini is a scientific journalist, so this is sort of her forte. She doesn't put on airs. She did her research, she shared the information, she seems to have cited her sources accurately. I appreciated the number of names provided of women who have contributed to our society that no one knows anymore, but we should because most of us wouldn't be here without them."

9,0807071706,http://goodreads.com/user/show/71228611-anastasia,2,"It is profoundly disheartening that a noble task - namely, to scientifically proof biological equality of men and women - saw such disappointing a realisation in this book.The author is extremely partial to female researches, leaving the whole idea of impartiality of science behind. I first noticed that in her lashing Simon Baron-Cohen's theories. The author, for example, quite derogatorily mentioned that one of Baron-Cohen's assistance in one of his experiments was a ""life-guarding on a beach in California"" (Chapter A Difference at Birth) How is that relevant to an argument? Or, when she met a fellow female researcher, she ""immediately empathised with her"". Objectivity anyone?The author clearly mixes up biological and social, choosing her evidence depending on advantage of that or another approach for her immediate argument. The social factors that we as humans developed only several thousands years ago cannot be cited to be as solid an evidence to hundreds of thousands of years of years of human evolution (Chapter The Old Women Who Wouldn't Die)I feel this book failed feminism, portraying it as a movement that wants to silence the scientific facts and forcefully level the scientific ground. It is the more upsetting, as after reading the book, as feminist as I am, I am convinced in the biological inborn imbalance of the sexes. Baron-Cohen, with his weighted and logical argumentation communicates more gravitas that the author, who is jumping from one topic to another, catching supporting arguments on the way from everywhere, starting from evolutionary biology to the 80s feminist movements. I do NOT recommend this book if one is looking to bolster their arguments in a scientific community when it comes to gender and science. What the book prompts one to do, is to continue the research."
10,0807071706,http://goodreads.com/user/show/829466-sara,2,"I didn't really enjoy this book as much as I hoped I would.For one, I didn't love the author's prose and style. A scientist says this positive or negative thought about women. Another scientist says 'no you're wrong!' Another scientists says 'actually I'm right!' That was the format... Plus, there was pretty overt bias that women are basically not significantly different from men in any cognitive or behavioral area, which I don't really buy. For example, in the argument about differences in developmental having a biological vs a cultural cause, she clearly prefers the cultural explanation (as also evidenced in the beginning quote). While she does cycle to contrary evidence- namely babies of genital mutilation who are assigned different genders and then are unhappy, she neglects transgendered children- a huge omission. I also thought she relied too heavily on cherry picking animals and tribes living hunter gatherer lifestyles to fit her hypotheses and beliefs. Actually she even used negative descriptors for scientists with beliefs she didn't ascribe to and positive ones for scientists she did like. I did enjoy some historical segments of female discrimination and suppression. Certainly some insights into old, dated theories of women's inferiority were enlightening and I agreed with some arguments. I just didn't like much of the presentation. Too bad... "

There is always social, cultural and political aspects to this large question but science has come with its own contrived objectivity which has stunted different voices. The research that do get quoted, become sounding board for many of the modern arguments, has never been repeated with same results. Scientists have left out half the species, women, in their anthropological quests as women became mere sidekicks in human history as men evolved. Its interesting to note that sexism that existing in society that was slowly recognizing evolutionary biology influenced minds like Darwin who differentiated between male and female evolution and goes as far as to say that the modern day man as well is better version of the species due to genetic advantage. Saini collects research from various disciplines and puts into a modern context that is most relevant. She cites research that has cemented perspectives in society (women's brain is 5 ounces less than man, for example) which in turn has influenced lawmakers and society at large. Over course of decades the research moved further and further away from investing time and resources to include women and female oriented studies, thus the myths that originated in Victorian parlors, imbibed into everyday society. It takes years to undo an ideology that is so deeply rooted in all of us, we don't realize how it has been hindering our own progress. Ironically, almost everything Saini says is known. Common Knowledge. Yet here we are in this century still battling issues that have existed for centuries. There has been progress, yes, but it isn't enough. In many parts of the world we see ideologies in men and women that should have been left in eighteenth century. Inferior shows systematic induction of these ideologies over centuries. The book makes a good tool of educating ourselves about the research that is prevalent and the gaps that exists in those research areas. "
12,0807071706,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4243191-faith-justice,4,"I love science and history and truly enjoy it when they overlap in books such as Inferior: How Science Got Women Wrong—and the New Research That's Rewriting the Story. As a feminist, I keep up with gender-based research and have for several decades. Disproving bad science that stated women's minds, bodies, and emotions were inferior to men's was a key element of my job when I worked with school systems to implement Title IX in the 70's. Title IX a.k.a ""the law that will destroy boys sports"" in football-crazy Ohio and basketball-obsessed Indiana where I did most of my work. Maybe those coaches and teachers were right. Look who took home most of the medals on the US team from the Rio Olympics. But Title IX was about so much more than sports--equal access for girls and women to all aspects of education. I knew about many of the studies described in this book, but it was still educational seeing them all pulled together and analysis of their techniques and possible biases hashed out. One of my favorite chapters dealt with brain science. Try as they might, neurologists and endocrinologists cannot find differences between the brains of males and females. There is far more variation within each sex than between them. Another favorite chapter was on women's sexuality which explored in depth the myth that women were naturally more modest, choosy, and had lower sex drives than men (only in those societies that demand it of women and punish the non-conformers). In all the chapters Saini comes to some conclusions based on the evidence, but her final chapter is ambiguous and (as a woman of a ""certain age"") my favorite of all--""The Old Women Who Wouldn't Die""--that looked at the evolution of women living after menopause. There are only a handful of species, including killer whales, where the females continue to live and thrive after their childbearing years are over. She discusses the ""grandmother theory"" which posits that a few long-lived females way back in the mists of time were able to contribute additional resources and important knowledge that favored their daughters and grandchildren. This set up a virtuous cycle that resulted in human females living well-past child bearing years. The opposite is the ""rich old man"" theory that said a few long-lived high status males had access to many females and passed on their long-life proclivity to their offspring including daughters. You can imagine which theory I favor, but there isn't enough evidence or ways of studying to come to any provable conclusion. We'll just have to live with all of us old broads continuing to positively contribute to society long past the time when we're ""useful"" as incubators.I found the book quite readable, but I like this kind of thing. Saini does a great job of putting the science in historical and social context. She is NOT ""male bashing."" Individual men who did poor science or let a male agenda color their conclusions, might feel pinched. But this is not a ""women are better in every way"" book. It shows how science was used to marginalize women, as the basis for laws and societal norms. By updating that science, Saini demolishes those arguments for keeping women from having equal access to all the advantages of modern life. She writes plainly and gives lots of background for the studies, so you don't have to read them yourself. This was an ARC and I missed the index which will be in the final version. Highly recommended for casual science geeks and people who like women. Misogynists and fundamentalists of all stripes should give it a pass. I learned long ago before the current post-fact fad, that people with biases can't be persuaded with facts. However, sometimes--just sometimes--they can be persuaded with stories and personal connections.Note: I received this book through an Early Reader program in exchange for an honest review."

Funny how much of both one sees reinforcing prejudice. As if tiny differences in averages between two groups could possibly justify discrimination against individuals. People are just the worst.And yet there are scientists in every field doing excellent work, publishing reproducible results, much of which is ignored by popular media and leaders in the field who get lots of research dollars for publishing stupid conclusions that can be used to justify ongoing systemic abuse and discrimination against women and girls. The chancellor of UNC -CH is paid 3/4 of what the chancellor of State is paid. It isn't fair, it isn't just, it isn't defensible. Women could change it if we cared to. I despair every time some public figure says ""I'm not a feminist but"". How is it hard to sign on to the idea that women are humans and are therefore deserving of being treated equally? How can any politician be elected who won't work to acknowledge that women deserve to be recognized as legally equal citizens in the US constitution?If people insist on treating trivial differences between men and women On Average as more significant than the enormous similarities, I can't stop them. But I will fight like hell when they try and use that crap to justify discrimination against men or women.We should no more tolerate being denied fair wages than we should put up with other forms of sexual harassment at work. No one wants to do the housework, but no one should get stuck doing twice as much of it when she comes home from work. Surely one reason households are not fair is that work isn't either and women who are kept poorer by their jobs don't have the bargaining power in their homes, or the financial independence to leave an abusive home.

Saini reviews the changing scientific theories about sex differences in several different disciplines, from evolutionary theory to biology to psychology. She obviously has strong personal feelings about the mistreatment of women, but that's not what this book is about. She describes how the various sexist theories were developed, and how they've been disproven. And when they haven't been fully disproven, she's honest about that.

Honestly, this was the book I've often thought needed to be written. I follow the topic, so I'd heard about most of this science, but it's awfully handy to have gathered in one place. Plus, it's beautifully written: she's readable. Plus professional. There were times I wanted to scream in frustration at the sexist things scientists did -- the kind of stuff that makes you get ranty -- yet the author always felt even tempered.

Alas, many of these people turn out to be men declaiming the natural inferiority of women. As much as some men would like you to believe it, however, “science” doesn’t prove that women are naturally inferior to men. As Angela Saini explains in her book of the same name, “science” backs up what many of us have observed for millennia: it’s complicated, y’all.Inferior references 
Delusions of Gender
, which I also read recently. Whereas Cordelia Fine’s book is about the perceived differences between men and women (particularly neurologically), Saini is more interested in examining scientific explanations that have historically been used to justify the view that women are somehow the “inferior” sex. So, while there is some overlap between these two books, they by and large have different theses.Saini takes us right back to Darwin and his theories of natural selection and sex selection. She explains how Darwin, as important as his writing was for the development of the theory of evolution, nevertheless maintained sexist views about the role of women—and people like Caroline Kennard challenged him on it. From here, Saini starts to examine certain apparent biological differences between men and women—such as the fact that “females get sicker but males die quicker.” Finally, Saini confronts outright myths and misconceptions that have propagated across science and history, and she tackles how it’s difficult to determine how much of our sexual and social mores are biological or cultural in origin.My overall impression of this book is that much of what Saini says here won’t be, overall, that surprising if you’ve been interested in this topic for a while like I have. Nevertheless, what makes Inferior so interesting is the amount of detail. There is a wealth of knowledge here. It is, as she says in her introduction, a resource that you can refer to if you need specific evidence when you’re trying to refute someone’s annoyingly essentialist arguments (though I’m not sure I have the memory to actually remember these studies off the top of my head, sadly).The last few chapters are fascinating in their facts about the diversity of human sexuality. I loved learning about various cultures that have matriarchal elements to them, particularly when it comes to sexual behaviour and infidelity. For example, I hadn’t heard of the Mosuo “walking marriage” before. Saini does a good job highlighting these various departures from what we consider “normal” from our stunted Western perspective without exoticizing or fetishizing them.I do wish she had been somewhat more critical of evolutionary psychology in general…. Saini admirably criticizes specific experiments in evolutionary psychology, and she is quick to point out how various biases (cough, old white guys, cough) can taint results. Yet she doesn’t really delve into the problematic nature of evolutionary psychology in general.Saini demonstrates that even with the amazing tools of scientific method available to us, we need to be careful about the conclusions we draw, the theories we publish, and the statements we make about so-called “differences” between sexes. We are so obsessed with creating categories and labels and putting people in boxes, when the reality is that we are complicated, and that there’s a lot more to our bodies than certain chromosomes or specific hormones might determine.

22,0807071706,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5071202-amy-neftzger,4,"This is one of those books that needed to be written in order to explain the gaps in research as well as real life. There are differences between men and women that research has identified that don't actually exist, while at the same time missing some of the true differences. This is a study in bias as much (or more) as it is a study in gender differences. Science is a quest for truth, and while the truth may ultimately be revealed, our biases can mislead us down some dark alleys along that quest. What is interesting is how these biases manifest in different cultures and how much truth can be ignored by so many highly educated individuals. A very interesting read."

It’s accessible and enlightening, although probably not very surprising if you are interested in these kinds of topics - most of us know about bonobos by now. I wasn’t fully convinced by Saini’s approach, though: it isn’t a full-on feminist thesis, rage against established/out-dated theories; but despite its attempts at objectivity, it isn’t unbiased either. I suspect it may have been more powerful if she had chosen one or the other."

The book featured a lot of male against female research, which would be fine if it would merit to a conclusion. Unfortunately very often the ""debate"" about a certain topic went on, but no real conclusion was reached, which left me confused - why was such a chapter included in the first place? The book was very chaotic and I had a hard time understanding what is going on at first. The different opinions (!) that are thrown at you don't seem to be enough to merit for a ""scientific conclusion"". It appears that the author tries to show different approaches to the issues she discusses in each chapter, but at the same time without knowing the pool of research, the reader has only two choices either blindly follow the author's opinion - the direction the author tries to steer you in (!) or to conclude, that no one really knows what the fuck is going on with the humankind, what are the roles, why everything is happening as it is and really there's no safe bet how find out. I'm saying opinions because although the author talks about research, very often she uses expressions that make the reader think about scientist's and her own ""beliefs"", not ""conclusions after lifelong research"". Mixing biology with sociology seemed quite an issue here as well. ""Inferior: The true power of women and the science that shows it"" - there is no such science. Most of the ""science"" I saw in this book wasn't conclusive, it was a biased look with scattered bits of research all over the place which was lacking evidence. The research obviously needs to be continued taking more serious approaches than discussed in this book, that is the only thing I was convinced of. The book covered way too many topics, some serious issues were skimmed over. Why were they mentioned at all if they weren't fully explored? This book tried to do too much, obviously. So much that after reading this book I genuinely feel like the researchers (and by extension me after reading this book) know nothing. And what was the deal with attacking Darwin so many times?"
26,0807071706,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4973578-iset,5,"Although the book clearly draws inspiration from Professor Fine's book, Delusion of Gender, and sometimes discusses the same studies and published papers, often it brings different material to light and expands upon Fine's work. The book also isn't afraid to interview scientists from both sides of the debate, and discuss studies which do not support as well as those that do. Perhaps frustratingly, was the finding again and again by scientists that studies that had not had their results independently replicated were picked up by popular media, rehashed to say something that they hadn't concluded at all, and then used in public debate (say, online discussion forums) as even further evidence for something which neither the study nor even the rehashed article had claimed at all. What ultimately shines through is the incredibly human failing - our preference for confirmation bias - and when alternative evidence is presented that challenges the existing paradigm of how gender roles operate in our society, we are more likely to dismiss it as aberrant or a freak fluke."

Angela Saini points out that biological differences between male and female bodies are still only imperfectly understood, and are not as clear-cut as are commonly thought. When it comes to male and female brains, it's not clear that there are inherent differences at all.Inferior is, as I said, a brief overview, and so Saini remains focused on biological sex as opposed to gender—which is understandable, but means that her exploration is perhaps not as incisive as it could be. There is some mention of intersex people, but Saini does seem to presume heterosexuality as the historical default (I think the only mention of same-sex acts is when discussing great apes).

Are we serious here? Even though this book clearly argues that a more feminist science is actually more accurate and better able to avoid bias, people are still tiptoeing around the word ""feminist"" as if it's a pile of stinky political dog poo? The whole POINT of this book is to show that by using basic feminist frameworks, we can arrive at a MORE objective science about sex differences.Feminist! Feminist! Feminist! Ok, there.

I really liked the talk, thought it was very balanced, and had lots of interesting tidbits. Unfortunately the book itself did not live up to the promise of the talk. I think the main issue I had is that she doesn't seem to have an understanding of even introductory level ecology and evolutionary biology, which is what I have my MS in, and I spent the entire time going ""but.... but..."". She's a journalist, and an engineer, but not a biologist, and it really fails her here. A specific gripe is that she doesn't seem to having even passing familiarity with Tinbergen's 4 levels of analysis, which is pretty basic, and critical when you study or critique evolutionary theory. For instance, there was a chapter about how female humans are less likely to die at every stage of development than male humans. The chapter ends quoting an MD saying, ""and no one knows why!"". This is not the least bit true at any level of analysis. For one, there are tons of mechanistic explanations for this at every stage. Secondly, from ultimate perspective, yes, we do know why this is true. It's actually true for lots of mammals, and it's called life history theory. This is something that we covered in the introductory biology class I TA-ed as a graduate student. Very basic, and indicative of an overarching problem with the book. Now, that's about where I gave up, so maybe she addresses this later, but the chapter after this one was unrelated so I'm assuming not. It's really a pity because there are tons of interesting journalistic tidbits she included in her talk, that I didn't really get to, because of the lack of scientific competence. I really wish the editors had given this book to an ecologist or evolutionary biologist to check for such basic issues, because it sunk the entire book for me."

Where there are debates that still exist, Saini does a good job giving an even hand to these debates, being clear about what we do and do not know. At the same time, she makes it very clear where debate does not exist, but where assumptions were made due to broader social norms or indeed just individual researcher bias. This book highlights that in many respects science is social and scientists are human, and we need to be cautious and recognise when we are simplifying complex scientific through biases and heuristics that may be based less on evidence and more on what we choose to study, who we choose to study, and which data we decide to believe. I am sometimes cautious about reading books that could be construed as feminist, not because I am not a feminist, but because I have read some really awful, hysterical books that would be categorised as such. This is a well-researched book that focuses on gender in medicine and scientific research, rather than a book that seeks to advocate for a particular view.My main complaint about the book is that it is somewhat repetitive and yet omits quite a lot. I especially would have liked to see more discussion about how science has largely neglected the study of certain conditions and a more thorough discussion of why including women in studies is still, even now, put into the 'too hard' basket because of our endocrine systems. She touches on these things but does not go into them in depth, whilst she seems to return to the same themes again and again. Still, overall this book exceeded my expectations, and I would recommend it for anyone who is interested in science, history, or skepticism."

Saini manages to make quite complex ideas very accessible and is pretty balanced in presenting both sides of the debates. Obviously there's a risk of preaching to the choir - personally female equality has always seemed blindingly self evident to me, but I was educated and work in female dominated environments which perhaps might have given me a specific outlook - and I'm sure someone who strongly disbelieves female equality will not read this book (unless they take the title at face value!). But Saini preempts this in the introduction by suggesting the contents can be used as (reasoned) debate fodder when one invariably encounters such backward people.

Women should not work in certain fields because of biology has been a debated topic for long. So much so it made me also question myself. I picked up this book looking for answers. Strongly recommend everyone to read this to get a better perspective. "
37,0807071706,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7125076-rachel,3,"I really wanted to like this book. And I did. But.The premises are good questions. How different are women and men? How much of the difference is hardwired and how much is cultural? And how did the differences evolve? The author looks at past and current scientific thinking on these issues, and separates out scientific method from ""science"" as a culture that is still evolving from an old boys' club. For the most part, she succeeds. If I hadn't read other, better books about the subject matter (for example, Cordelia Fine's Delusions of Gender and, way back, Barbara Ehrenreich's For Her Own Good), I would like this book better. And, being newer, it adds new material, including some studies and debate in the science culture. The book is short, under 200 pages, and easily readable. This is good in that it can reach a wide audience, but the corollary is that the information is just a small look into several chosen aspects of the premises. The author's looks into the history of scientific views on gender are hardly more than glimpses, especially until about 50 years ago, but these glimpses are chosen and presented well. I am not as impressed by the reviews of current opinion on some of the issues. She allows current ""evolutionary psychology"" more credibility than, say, Cordelia Fine does. The last chapter, on menopause, seemed repetitive, and I think that none of the theories she reviewed were at all compelling. On the other hand, some of the other chapters, including ""Females Get Sicker but Males Die Quicker,"" ""The Missing Five Ounces of the Female Brain,"" and ""Choosy, Not Chaste,"" were packed with interesting information."

You may even find yourself reshaping your perceptions of who women are and what we can do. Science doesn't operate in a political vacuum: Much of our science is biased or conclusions are made within a certain box of thinking. We need to test and retest our experiments to confirm. If there is enough contradictory evidence, this should put the underlying theory in doubt. The principles can't be considered principles if there are so many exceptions.: Sounding sexist may not be a good reason to ban a theory but evidence that you are wrong should be.I was using sex effects on the genitals as an implicit model when thinking about sex effects on the brain. This is not a good model. If you take any two brains they are different but how they differ between any two individuals you cannot predict.: Angela concludes Our brains are intersex. There is little evidence that a male brain is significantly different than a woman's. Which means there is little difference between what a woman's and a man's brain can do. Culture can dictate almost every aspect of what women and men do. There's no biological commandment that says women are natural homemakers and unnatural hunters or that hands on fathers are breaking some eternal code of the sexes.: I think of my Dad who does all the cooking in our house. He is amazing. Just having a female name impacts how others (both men and women) think of you and your capabilities because of unconscious bias: I can't help but think that I would do any daughters I have a favor in life by giving them a gender ambiguous name. No wonder so many women publish with just their initials. Would J.K. Rowling be the leading author she is today if she had published with her full name? This is where the die seems to fall when it comes to male dominance over females. Female cooperation makes the difference... Male domination isn't inevitable when females work together to establish their interests.: Equality is not a recent discovery. It has been repressed through centuries of male domination and ""mate guarding"" through subjugation, double standards, brutality and isolation. The key to breaking this pattern is women uniting and standing up for each other. #MeTooThe Grandmother Hypothesis: I love how this idea poses that after menopause, women are perfect ""all mothers,"" powerhouses, and vehicles for enormous change. A Proverbs 31  woman exercising her full strength at last.Why only 3 stars?

There were interesting facts and research mentioned, but I bet it could be stronger if they weren't scatted and had a clearer goal.For example, she starts with the fact that women's health issues weren't studied as well as men's, mainly because people thought that the human body is similar (and the default is men in our world still): “As clinicians, we know very well that diseases show up differently in men and women. Every day, men and women present to the emergency room with different symptoms with the same condition,” adds Clayton. “So heart attacks, for example, have different symptoms. Our research has shown that women who are going to have a myocardial infarction [heart attack] are more likely to have symptoms like insomnia, increasing fatigue, pain anywhere in the head all the way down to the chest, the weeks before they have a heart attack. Whereas men are less likely to have those symptoms and are more likely to present with the classic crushing chest pain.” Given differences like these, she believes that excluding women from drug trials for so many years must have affected their health. “It’s certainly a real possibility that the reason there are more adverse events in women than in men is because the whole process of drug discovery is tremendously biased towards the male,” agrees Kathryn Sandberg, who researches sex differences in health, aging, and disease.And later there are many examples of female being more like male than we think. Here's an example about Bonobo females: “Females are larger than males in more species of mammals than is generally supposed.” In her paper in the Quarterly Review of Biology she adds that, for a variety of species, size doesn’t seem to correlate reliably with which sex is dominant. The African water chevrotain, which is a type of deer, and many small antelopes, for example, have larger females who aren’t dominant. Meanwhile, the Chinese hamster, ring-tailed lemur, and pygmy marmoset all have smaller females that dominate the males. Bonobo females, too, are generally smaller than the males. “Their larger size is balanced by the fact that females cooperate against males, whereas males seldom cooperate against females,” notes Barbara Smuts. The common thread that unites species in which females are particularly vulnerable to male violence is females being alone. An orangutan female, for instance, will travel alone with her dependent young almost all the time. Female chimpanzees, adds Barbara Smuts, spend three-quarters of their time alone, with no other adults present.How much can we trust the science? It is limited (to be gentle). Here is one example that would probably make you squirm: revealed how it might be possible to read just about anything into a brain scan. He and a colleague tried to find the most unusual objects they could fit inside a functional magnetic resonance imaging machine, to help calibrate it before their serious scientific work began. It was a joke that started with a pumpkin and ended with a dead, eighteen-inch-long, mature Atlantic salmon wrapped in plastic. A few years later, when Bennett was looking for evidence of false positives in brain imaging, he dug out this old scan of the salmon. By chance, proving the critics right and showing how even the best technologies can mislead, the picture happened to show three small red areas of activity close together in the middle of the fish’s brain. The dead fish’s brain. Continuing with how much pressure is on scientist to publish, and with the fact that this topic is so biased to start with. “Science doesn’t operate in a political vacuum” together with “If you take any two brains, they are different” give a better picture of the problem. I wasn't sure if she tried to give the science (which was fine minus), or tell some kind of a story (which wasn't very coherent to me), or make anecdotal points of it.For example, I have similar experiences to these as an engineering lead that is surrounded by men (and it was even more in the late 1990s). On the other hand, does that fit this book, and what do you try to conclude from this part? If you were the geek growing up, you’ll recognize how lonely it can be. If you were the female geek, you’ll know it’s far lonelier. By the time I reached my final years of school, I was the only girl in my chemistry class of eight students. I was the only girl in my mathematics class of about a dozen. And when I decided to study engineering at university, I found myself the only woman in a class of nine. Things haven’t changed much since then. Statistics collected by the Women’s Engineering Society in 2016 show that only 9 percent of the engineering workforce in the United Kingdom is female and just over 15 percent of engineering undergraduates are women. ... The picture is similar in the United States: according to the National Science Foundation, although women make up nearly half the scientific workforce, they’re underrepresented in engineering, physics, and mathematics.I have a full book to write about this point. I know that we need to do so much more to have women in professions that are considered ""male"". I have so many ideas of how we got to the current state and why it is changing so so so slowly. I just don't think that it made a lot of sense in the context of this book.I also agree here: Even today, we live in the balance of that question, feeding our babies fantasies in pink and blue with the assumption they are deeply different. We buy trucks for our boys and dolls for our girls, and delight when they love them. We are creating some major issues for our own society, and (or maybe but) this is unrelated to the scientific question of differences. Whether there are or aren't differences - we should try to not push our children to these traditional roles.I could continue for much longer. I have tried to cover the main points and issues. 2 stars for me."

45,0807071706,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3145939-ellie,5,"In Inferior, Angela Saini looks at the bias at work in science, specifically when it comes to studies in sex difference. From Darwin's frankly appalling (but of his time) attitude to women to modern day studies, Saini looks at their evidence and takes apart theories that have been used to demonstrate how women are the inferior sex.As a woman, it's hard not to be outraged by some of the interpretations of results. It often appears that the male scientists are using their work to reinforce their own prejudices, making leaps from the evidence to come up with theories that fit their own world view. They don't seem very scientific.I am willing to accept that there are small differences in our brains, but I don't understand how someone calling themself a scientist can go from seeing more baby girls look at a photo of a face and more boys look at a mobile, to interpreting that means women will enjoy coffee mornings, being carers and manning suicide hotlines. Whilst, you guessed it, men will enjoy things that will result in better paid and more respected careers.Many of the studies used in the book are observations from other species. Some of it is fascinating but it also shows how unreliable comparing animal behaviour to human behaviour is. You can find both sides of the debate displayed if you look far enough. I love how the book tries to explain the ways that women are stronger, with our better immune systems and longer lives, our pickiness over mates and contributions to a community that mean we cannot be less evolved than men. Sex differences are so slight that cultural and societal influences must explain most the gaps between the genders seen today.Studies into the changes in the brains of London cabbies, help us understand the elasticity of the brain and that comparing adult brains of men and women can't be relied on to prove an underlying biological difference. If women's lives are shaped by a society that oppresses them, when men have freedom to do whatever, the theory is that their brains will adapt differently.Inferior is very accessible science writing and I highly recommend it, especially to young women embarking on a career in STEM. It will arm you well for any man who should argue that biology means you are less capable."

The second half is about monkeys.There is some incredibly horrifying ""scientific research"" in here that makes it easy to think twice about everything we think we know. Saini does an outstanding job poking holes in studies to show how they're flawed, how our own biases can influence results, and in the case of women, how that can have catastrophic consequences. I enjoyed highlighting large sections of this book... until she started talking about bonobos and chimpanzees. There's a clear divide between human studies and animal studies, and I found that second part to be incredibly boring. Also, I got to read way more about menopause than I ever wanted to (but hey, fun fact—we don't really know why menopause exists!)This is an important book for everyone to read, but it may require some patience.See more of my reviews: Blog // Instagram"

Inferior totally blew my mind and referenced studies I'm pissed about not knowing about until now- it's made me determined to read more recent studies in terms of commonly held sexist opinions that are bandied about as facts- when they actually aren't. There were only three times where the authors bias did show through- but they were easy to spot (& understandable- humans are biased period, and whatever we touch will always have at least a little of that that shows through, which Angela Saini makes clear at the end in her own words 💕) & didn't subtract from the piece as a whole. Definitely my nonfiction choice of the year."

The rest of the world has patriarchy too, and in many cases it is far more damaging to women, but nowhere else do men do such mental gymnastics to rationalize it. They are more like: ""I'm strong enough to kill you with my bare hands and I'll do it if you don't do what I say. End of story""."

52,0807071706,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5037696-jess,4,"Ah how I love binge-reading feminist nonfiction by scholars with a penchant for witty turns of phrase! Inferior is a book on biology and genetics written for laypeople. Sort of a ""Mythbusting Sexist Science for Dummies,"" if you will. And while the author did a great job of writing for a general audience in a way that even this dummy could understand, it sometimes came off as needlessly repetitive, especially in a book so short. Brief interlude to note that while this book both acknowledges the existence of intersex and transgender people, interviews an intersex scholar, and uses science on intersex people to prove its overall point, for the purposes of this review I'll be referring to gender ass a dichotomy, as that's how it's historically been understood by those who make the ""women are inferior"" argument.The basic premise is simple: In most societies from the dawn of humankind, women have been oppressed and considered inferior. As to who's been doing the oppressing and the inferiorizing, it's the men... but often the women as well. Because after all, the patriarchy and misogynist systems the world over have always happened with the cooperation of more than half of the population. But I digress. The point is that prominent menfolk since time immemorial have restricting women's education, opportunities, and property and then pointed at women and said ""Hah hah you suck. See, I can tell because you're wildly underrepresented in academia, varied career opportunities, and independent wealth."" Which, speaking from the scientific understanding of a kindergartner, is TOTALLY UNFAIR AND UNTRUE.So Angela Saini sets out to painstakingly reveal a) there is no known scientific difference between the brains of men and women, b) if one does exist we haven't figured it out yet, c) the biological differences between the sexes cannot prove ""inferiority"" or ""superiority,"" and d) the topic of gender inferiority and superiority is hugely complicated by the social conditioning humans receive from birth. In other words: suck it, misogynists. I thought a whole book could be spent on just the social construct of women's powerlessness. As an opinionated lady type who has used the Internet in the past decade, I've come across more than one sexist argument that starts, ""If women are the equals of men, then where are all the famous historical inventors/artists/scholars/leaders?"" It's so inane and frustrating simply because the answer is ""Locked in convents, sold by their fathers into marriage, dying in childbirth, forced into prostitution, and actively outlawed from entering institutions of higher learning."" Saini touches on this, and includes a handful of debates between brilliant historical women and the well-known male scientists who argued in favor of sexism using this self-same argument. (Looking at you, Darwin!) I could read those kind of anecdotes in righteous fury for AGES.It was distressing (and unsurprising) to me to read that many scientists who study gender receive threats and insults because of the topic of their work. There are feminists who (sometimes rightly) fear that any research that concludes in a mental difference between the genders just fuels the sexist fire of historical, patriarchal oppression of women. And there are the misogynists who (like the ass-hatted douche-nozzles they are) see any research that concludes in NO mental difference between the genders to be feminist propaganda. The former do things like write op eds and participate in other research. The latter send death and rape threats and call the scientists ""stupid c*nts"" on the internet. #thisiswhyineedfeminismIn the end, I'm glad I read this book. The science was easy to understand, and I learned about the long and storied history of the scientific study of gender. I feel armed to debate the next ass-hatted misogynist who comes my way spouting evolutionary biology and we-hunted-the-mammoth bullshit."
53,0807071706,http://goodreads.com/user/show/27552214-ally,5,"It's common, nowadays, to hear news reports proclaiming that there are too few women in STEM fields. With such a feminist consciousness-raising of women's and men's equality, being proven time and time again, how could this be? Angela Saini, in her deeply researched book Inferior: How Science Got Women Wrong and the New Research That's Rewriting the Story, provides historical information, current research of sex/gender differences, and personal references to contribute to the discussion of why women may have been excluded from the sciences. The book is divided into eight chapters, each of which focuses on different focuses of gender research over the years. In Chapter 1 - ""Women's Inferiority to Man"", the author discusses the blatant sexism of such preeminent researchers as Charles Darwin and others who laid the foundation for what would become sex/gender research. Darwin explicitly believed that women were intellectually and physically inferior to men. In his theory of evolution, he viewed men as more evolved than women. The author also explores the nascent discoveries in sex research, including the discovery of hormones and their impact on male-ness and female-ness.Chapter 2 - ""Females Get Sicker but Males Die Quicker"", looks at the differing average lifespans between men and women, why men are thought of as the stronger sex, and the longstanding preference in some cultures for male babies. The chapter opens with the personal story from a hospital administrator in India. She was pregnant with twins, thrilled to be bringing new life into the world, but her husband and his family wanted only male children. Since she refused any sex selection testing, her husband intentionally fed her something to which she was allergic, thereby forcing her to go into hospital. While she was receiving treatment, he coerced the medical staff to perform a prenatal scan to determine the sexes of the babies - without her knowledge or consent. Once it was clear that the twins were both girls, he and his family tried to coerce her to get an abortion and, when she refused, abused her horribly. She believes that her husband was acting this way and holding these ideals only because of the strong social conditioning in Indian culture. The chapter then continues, discussing preconceptions about the kinds of work that women and men do, why women typically live longer than men in most societies, and what biological and social constructs may be at play. Chapter 3 is titled ""A Difference at Birth"". The focus here is on whether males and females are born distinctly different from each other, or if the differences are learned or acquired during the course of interaction with the environment. Based on the research presented, although differing positions abound, often what is observed and intuited to be biological is in fact due to bias and preferences which are reinforced and passed down over many generations.Chapter 4 - ""The Missing Five Ounces of the Female Brain"" is externally concerned with research studies that found, on average, women's brains are 5oz smaller than men's brains. In full, it looks at cranial and structural differences between the brains of the sexes, and what (if anything) can be learned from studying them. With regard to the mass of brains, research has found that the size of a human brain is proportional to the size of the human body. Therefore, if a man is significantly larger/taller/etc. than a female, it is likely that his brain will have more mass than hers. When brain size measurements are corrected for differences in size of their human containers, the size differences truly disappear.In chapter 5 ""Women's Work"", the author looks at research surrounding the types of societal duties that humans and other animals perform, by gender, to see if there are commonalities or differences, and what those findings could illuminate about our experience. It's not always true that men were the hunters and women were the gatherers and child-carers. And in those cultures where that paradigm was active, it doesn't necessarily implicate women's work as being less valuable or worthwhile for the survival of the group.Chapter 6 - ""Choosy Not Chaste"" examines the differences in expressions of sexuality between females and males. Why are women supposed to be demure, virginal, and faithful to one partner while men are allowed be playboys, have many sexual partners, and enjoy their bodies to a great degree? Dating practices, courtship and marriage, and other partnerings are examined. The author also dives into cultural stereotypes, religious dictates, and the various double standards that exist for men and women when engaging in the same behaviors. Chapter 7 - ""Why Men Dominate"" turns its gaze to the preconception that men are superior to women because they, on the average, are stronger and more aggressive. Since the stereotype is that women are seen as having always been subjugated by men, the thinking leans toward there being some kind of evolutionary reason for it being so. In fact, there are many societies - human and animal - where the culture is a dominated by females (which I call a matriarchy), which puts holes in the common narrative.The final chapter, ""The Old Women Who Wouldn't Die"" examines what happens to women as their fertility decreases. In particular, menopause and its discovery is investigated. Why does menopause take place, and how does it impact a woman's role in society? Some historical researchers have come to the conclusion that, because a woman's role is the production of offspring and furthering the genetic line, once she is no longer able to perform that job she is essentially of no value. This has led to the vast explosion of hormone replacement therapy, which does help alleviate some of the negative symptoms associated with menopause, but puts the woman at risk for serious health conditions later. And it's interestingly noted that the symptoms that most American women experience during menopause - night sweating, hot flashes, moodiness, etc. - are not universal to all human females. Therefore, there may be some cultural constructs that go into the felt experience of such a biological process. The chapter also discusses the attitudes that societies have towards its older females, and how those attitudes may be based on stereotypes and unfounded biases.Inferior: How Science Got Women Wrong and the New Research That's Rewriting the Story is a fascinating read, whether you are a woman or not, and whether you are interested in STEM or not. Its focus may be science, but the book is full of tenets that are applicable everywhere - feminist generalities that encourage readers to think more critically about the way they view the world around them. Angela Saini argues, throughout, that mounting research points to human biases, not biological inferiority, as the reason for why there are so few women in STEM. The scientific process historically and current, is not perfect, but by increasing our awareness of its (and our) flaws, we can make progress as a society towards a more full and robust knowledge of ourselves and the world around us."
54,0807071706,http://goodreads.com/user/show/98013784-lia,3,"It took me AGES to finish this, I think because I've been finding non-fic hard going, given that there's a pandemic and that jazz.It was a nice summary of debate around several scientific hypotheses concerning the supposed 'inferiority' of women to men. It's appealing to anyone with an interest in science and feminism, as it reads like a long review paper of various pieces of research.However, it was quite dry and I found it hard to really absorb myself in it. Saini is very balanced and journalistic in her approach, at the expense of any particular feeling. I'm sure this was her intention (how many women have been labelled hysterical for writing a feminist book) but it just didn't do it for me.I started reading this because I had an argument with some dude about his perception of women's 'biological' tendency to be x y and z. I was hoping this book would give me something to respond with, but really the whole issue of gender and science is a lot more nuanced than that. It's a case in which the folk who would benefit the most from reading this book are the least likely ever to do so. Tragic."
55,0807071706,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1842352-shomeret,0," I received a review copy of Inferior: How Science Got Women Wrong from Edelweiss last year. I admit that I should have gotten to it sooner. I finally read it because it was the Book of the Month on a Goodreads group. I've posted some comments to the group's discussion thread, but I know that isn't sufficient. When I request books from Edelweiss, I commit to reviewing them. My review is rather late, but I still feel that I owe the publisher and Edelweiss a review. So let's see if I can generate one.  I consider Inferior a survey on the subject of science written about women which has actually been dealt with in more depth in narrower books dealing with women in particular fields of science. So while I do agree that we need better science about women, I didn't find that Saini provided much in the way of fresh insight on the subject.

The author tries to cover way too much ground given the page count but I did learn some new things from the book. The author cites the same people too often and I think it would be easy for an intellectual opponent to tear apart some of the ideas since they aren't given enough space to nail down. Probably the most interesting thing to me was the author does a great job of showing how scientific findings change with the social tides, which if you believe in objectivity, would be difficult to explain. It's like one of the quotes she includes: ""Humans studying humans. What could be biased about that?"" :gotem:"

Per primatologist Amy Parish: “It’s certainly given me hope for the human feminist movement. That here we can see females actually bonding with each other, maintaining those bonds, maintaining that loyalty. And then ultimately having the power in their groups. So I think they’re a great model for that. That yes, females can be in charge. They can control the resources. They don’t need to go through males to get them. They don’t have to be subjected to sexual violence or infanticide, all because they have the upper hand. And they do that by staying loyal to their female friends.”"

Where Fine zeros in on hormones, Saini takes a broader lens. I particularly appreciated the work on primatology and evolutionary biology and psychology.

It makes the point very clearly that scientific research is being conducted by human beings which makes it difficult, if not impossible, to generate objective, rationale, factual results that are not influenced by our perspectives, beliefs, cultures, etc. I come away from reading it as more of a feminist.I look forward to reading other books by this author."
