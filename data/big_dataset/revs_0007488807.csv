0,0007488807,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6068530-jim-whitefield,5,"I have read many books, fiction and non-fiction. I love science and learning all I can about life. This latest offering from Professor Brian Cox, based on the very latest scientific understanding as of right now, in late 2014, expanding and developing the TV series (now available on DVD) of the same title, left me astounded, amazed and actually breathless. It is beautifully illustrated and brilliantly written. It is by far the very best and most compelling book that I have ever read on anything. It is probably the most important (simply explained) read for anyone who wants to at least try to understand ‘us’. There are no words I can use to describe it adequately and I can only say there are not enough stars available to rate it highly enough and I recommend it beyond any other work I have ever read. Saying that it is a ‘must read’ simply isn’t enough – it is a ‘must read now’, without delay, so you can at least die with an understanding of life that most people may never come to appreciate."
1,0007488807,http://goodreads.com/user/show/20498957-claudia,5,"This book is based on its namesake BBC documentary, Human Universe. If you did not see it yet, you should – totally worth it; the others in the series too. Brian Cox does an amazing job presenting it – his enthusiasm and joy are written all over his face and you can hear it also in his voice. Part of that excitement is present here, in the book, too.The facts themselves aren’t ground breaking but the way they are presented is a total different story. From Big Bang to quantum physics, from Lucy to Paul Young, from Giordano Bruno to Hubble, this book is an ode to science and humanity.Instead of making a summary of the book, I’ll better leave you some fragments from it. If these do not convince you to read it, I don’t know what will.Enjoy!Bertrand Russell: ‘Mathematics, rightly viewed, possesses not only truth, but supreme beauty – a beauty cold and austere, like that of sculpture, without appeal to any part of our weaker nature, without the gorgeous trappings of painting or music, yet sublimely pure, and capable of a stern perfection such as only the greatest art can show. The true spirit of delight, the exaltation, the sense of being more than Man, which is the touchstone of the highest excellence, is to be found in mathematics as surely as in poetry.’ Just have a look at something – the smallest, most trivial little thing – and enjoy trying to figure out how it works. That is science. In a famous BBC Horizon film broadcast in 1982 called ‘The Pleasure of Finding Things Out’, Feynman went further: ‘People say to me, “Are you looking for the ultimate laws of physics?” No, I’m not. I’m just looking to find out more about the world and if it turns out there is a simple ultimate law which explains everything, so be it; that would be very nice to discover. If it turns out it’s like an onion with millions of layers and we’re just sick and tired of looking at the layers, then that’s the way it is … My interest in science is to simply find out more about the world.’(Lovely film, BTW. I read one of his books too, Surely You're Joking, Mr. Feynman!: Adventures of a Curious Character and it was amazing - can't recommend it enough)In the words of Georges Lemaître, ‘Standing on a well-cooled cinder we see the slow fading of the suns and we try to recall the vanished brilliance of the origin of the worlds.’ Our cinder is not special; it is insignificant in size; one world amongst billions in one galaxy amongst trillions. But it has been a tremendous ascent into insignificance because, by the virtuous combination of observation and thought, we have been able to discover our place. How Giordano Bruno would have loved what we found.‘Our obligation to survive is owed not just to ourselves but also to that Cosmos, ancient and vast, from which we spring,’ wrote Sagan.Science and reason make the darkness visible.One of the central themes of this book has been to argue that the human race is worth saving because we are a rare and infinitely beautiful natural phenomenon. One of the other themes is that we are commonly and paradoxically ingenious and stupid in equal measure. I do not personally think that there is anyone out there to save us, and so it follows that we will have to save ourselves; at least, that would seem to me to be a good working assumption. This is why I don’t feel naïve, idealistic or like a particularly radical member of the Student Union in a Che Guevara T-Shirt when I ask the question ‘Is it reasonable to spend less on asteroid defence than on a footballer’s annual salary?’ When I look in the mirror and think about that, my face assumes an interesting shape – you should try it.What a piece of work is a Man. So certain, so vulnerable, so ingenious, so small, so bold, so loving, so violent, so full of promise, so unaware of his fragile significance. Someone asked me what they thought was a deep question: What are we made of? Up quarks, down quarks and electrons, I answered. That’s what a Man is. Humanity is more than that. Our civilisation is the most complex emergent phenomenon in the known universe. It is the sum of our literature, our music, our technology, our art, our philosophy, our history, our science, our knowledge."

3,0007488807,http://goodreads.com/user/show/800291-andrew,4,This is another sumptuous book from Professor Cox in conjunction with the BBC tv series of the same name. The book is full or amazing photographs and articles showing the amazing challenges and how we have excelled over them through the ages - from evolutionary imperatives to pushing the boundaries of our planet. Professor Cox is a very human face to what could be a very dry and antiseptic subject. My only possibly criticism is that the this time round they have chosen such a wide subject with so many possible avenues of study that you wonder who really chose the subject matter and what other details did they leave out (as compared to their other subject matters from previous projects - such as Wonders of the Solar System to Wonders of life). As always the book is a brilliant spring board off in to further studies and subject - one thing I do like about the book and even Professor Cox himself - is that the do not assume they are the definitive source of all this information or that there is some exclusivity over studies - like some - but rather that human curiosity and motivation are the key requirements to learn about the world around us and that as long as that remains then all else is possible. 
4,0007488807,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1016626-tim-pendry,5,"If you are not deterred by very occasional moments of trite humanist polemic, special pleading for investment in hard science and a slight tendency to pander to an American readership, this is an absolutely brilliant introduction to current scientific cosmological thought. It deals with big questions in an adult, uncompromising but clear way. Cox and Cohen have managed to offer us some seriously hard science (well above my comprehension) as jewels in a setting of explanation that mean we actually can understand what we need to understand.Cox and Cohen do not over-claim for science. They claim for it only what it can do - give us the best framework 'to hand' for understanding what the world is really like out there and what makes us what we are or at least appear to be. This highly probabilistic approach based on rational questioning of available hard evidence and using mathematics as a predictive tool is now giving us a vastly speeded up re-evaluation of our place in the universe to those prepared to listen to what is being said.The book helps us ordinary Joes catch up with hard science and strip away some of the layers of presumption about our place in the universe. It avoids the tiresome tendency of many science writers to try to explain through speculation in order to force awe on us.Awe and wonder do not need such rhetorical trickery - the facts now contain enough to make us wonder at the situation in which we find ourselves as accidental emergent consciousnesses in a corner of an incalculably vast multiverse who may or may not be alone in it. Cox and Cohen look at five basic questions - where are we? are we alone? who are we? why are we here (not meaning why some man in a beard decided to put us here but what are the conditions that enabled our existence) and, the weakest section, what is our future?Apart from their too pat dismissal (contradicted by some of the data in the rest of the book) of the likelihood of our aloneness as emergent consciousness, there is nothing to argue with in their general conclusions - they have science at its best on their side.The last section, however, should have been a better and more thoughtful disquisition on existential risk around which there is considerable contemporary hysteria.One gets the impression that the expansion of the TV format fell apart here because Cox wanted to lobby for investment in the asteroid impact space programme. This is where the bulk of the irritating posturing noted in the first paragraph appears. There is much to say on existential risk. I share the authors' puzzlement at our political classes' hitherto slow response to the asteroid issue, far more humanly serious than the threat claimed by the less secure science of climate change.The authors present almost everything they offer us in an uncompromisingly scientifically-based way. They lapse rarely, for example by simply asserting in a few sentences the 'threat of climate change' - either they know and can explain or they cannot.Still, this is not the bulk of the book. 95% and certainly the sections on the first four questions contain some of the best science writing currently available. It is highly recommended for that reason.Nor should you be put off by the mathematical formulae. They are there for the clever ones with that sort of mind. The authors do not patronise us with noddy-and-big-ears versions of science but they do not try to take for granted the meaning of the formulae either.They give brief explanations and then embed the complexity in a narrative that tells us what the science actually means and challenges us to challenge it. But the hidden sub-text of the work is not just scientific but cultural. In a world in which the vast bulk of the population have no inkling of what the universe is really like or our place in it and in which a democracy of the ignorant is lauded as the right and proper means of conducting ourselves, what this book contains is dynamite.It shows us that we are both significant and insignificant in different ways. We are significant to ourselves as the only or one of the few emergent consciousnesses capable of understanding its own situation across vast tracts of space and time.We are insignificant because we are highly vulnerable to the workings of a universe of unpredictable moving parts that does not appreciate our planet-bound biology very much and whose scale is far beyond our imagining except in awesome mathematical and theoretical terms.Even the 'Big Bang' (last refuge of the theistic scoundrel) is not merely under assault. Cosmology now makes it a blip amongst uncountable infinite blips. The conditions for life or not come into existence in a complex multiverse in which all things are possible. A personal God will never go away for those whose minds are stuck on such matters but the last vestiges of a cosmological God are hurtling behind yet further barriers of multiversal infinity. Our insignificance in relation to such a 'system' is truly awe-inspiring.The authors imply that the only option left (other than the cosmic existentialism that is always an individual's fall-back position) is a scientific humanism in which we become the measure of our own significance just because we are, in universal terms, insignificant."
5,0007488807,http://goodreads.com/user/show/13378211-rachel,5,"I've got a confession to make: I'm having a love affair. The name of the one that's stolen my intellectual heart - science, and in particular, physics. And I've primarily got one man to thank for that. Professor Brian Cox. Brian Cox writes, speaks and explains vast, mind-bending complexities with the air of a man who, to coin a term, knows his stuff. Thanks to him, I've started to grasp the very corners of physics, from Einstein's theories of special and general relativity to white dwarf stars and black holes to the tiniest quarks and the Standard Model that makes the cornerstone of our existence. Human Universe is just what the book says. It is a conscious, intellectual human beings process of trying to understand how and why we've ended up as so on a tiny speck in a nondescript galaxy in an ever expanding universe. This book is somehow comforting and terrifying at the sane time. Comforting to know that, despite 13.45 billion years, I have somehow come to exist by pure coincidence or luck and can live in an age where man can understand himself and the stars he inhabits. But also terrifying because it could just be us - alone on a rocky planet with no other civilisations (or, slightly more optimistic, none that are near enough for contact). Where does that leave us? With our capacity for choosing precisely what is bad for us and an unnerving trend towards stupidity as the norm, how long can we last? I suspect not long in the grand scheme of things. However this book gives me hope. Hope to explore, to dream, to ask questions and to maybe, maybe, try to contribute some small knowledge about who we are against the vast unending backdrop that is our universe."
6,0007488807,http://goodreads.com/user/show/35107740-jo-anne-atkinson,3,"In the book to accompany the TV series of the same name Professor Brian Cox links human evolution to the development of our exploration of space - or tries to...In fact this is a confused and confusing book. There are two stories trying to work together but they don't really manage it. The story of the development of space exploration and understanding is well put together and whilst some of the maths and concepts may be beyond the average reader, it doesn't become a 'textbook' of quantum physics. The parts about human development are also interesting but they don't seem to fit in with the physics. This feels like a good idea that is in fact a rather self-indulgent vanity project and it's all about the 'rock'n'roll physicist'"
7,0007488807,http://goodreads.com/user/show/11654681-paul,5,"So many science books are dumbed down these days, but not this one. Being a novice in mathematics, I really enjoyed the explanations of some of the more famous equations in the world of physics."
8,0007488807,http://goodreads.com/user/show/23314834-pippa-dacosta,5,"This was an amazing read. Brian Cox has a way of mingling mind-bending physics with his own brand of down-to-earth humor which results in a really entertaining read. I'm not a scientists by any stretch of the imagination, but the topics discussed in this book, from the moments before the Big Bang to 'Why are we here?' are explained and discussed in such a way, that anyone can follow the theories and enjoy discovering new science. It's a really uplifting and engaging read, peppered with some punchy moments, such as why we pay footballers more money in a year, than it would cost to observe for known asteroids that WILL at some point hit the earth. Priorities people!? Cox reasons that we exist in an infinite number of galaxies in an infinite number of universes, which makes us both incredibly special as a species but also extremely rare. He marvels at the wonder of man, of what we can achieve. ""We're both clever and stupid in equal measure.""""Our existence is a ridiculous affront to common sense...Our civilisation is a combination of seven billion affronts"" A wonderful, thought-provoking read. I highly recommend everyone try this book, even if you're not heavy into science. "
9,0007488807,http://goodreads.com/user/show/47021487-jose-moa,5,"This book based on a BBC programme is one of the best popular science books I have read,it gives a very readable unified cosmic vission of almost all,the universo,its origens,the fundamental laws of nature,the emergence of life,the emergence of inteligence,the fine tuning,if we are alone etc...The book explores,at least for me,two very interesting points :the fine tuning and the improbability of emergence of a technological civilization ,and so solving the Fermi Paradox,and I personally believe that it success in the explanations and reasoningsIt explains fine tuning as a result of the eternal inflaction that leads to a infinite inmortal universo growing fractal like withut end,there is not fine tuning problema,given the infinite multiverse,we are inevitable.As if we are alone,given the eucariotic and the oxigenic photosyntesis bottleneck the Galaxy could be teeming with life,,but it will be slime life,the emergence of complex multicelular not mentioning the emergence of the technological inteligence surely would be extremely improbable,we cannot comunícate with others because we are the first to emerge in the whole Galaxy,the Fermi paradox solved.We as example emerged because a asteroid colide with earth giving the rise of mammals,the dinosaurs dont give proofs of much improving inteligence despite their 150 milion years of kingdom,and we are here surely by a particular Earths orbit features that trought the Milankovich cicles give way to ice ages that trigered as a consecuence of strong climatic changes our emergence in the Rift valley.A must to read for everybody book."

11,0007488807,http://goodreads.com/user/show/50001743-m-l,4,"I really enjoyed this book, so much so that I got through it in two sittings. Though I was already familiar with the concepts discussed in the TV series, this book went into more detail and also gave some historical context to the ideas and theories discussed. It was this 'further investigation' that I found the most interesting, though I did greatly enjoy Cox's political interpositions. The text was accessible and understandable, and I am greatly looking forward to reading Cox's next book that is waiting in my bookshelf."
12,0007488807,http://goodreads.com/user/show/39476772-allan,5,"I simply loved it, non ebook ever could be more beautiful than the hardcover version of this book, it makes you feel proud to be a human, it makes you to love astronomy, to want to reach the stars... It gives you hope about the future. It makes you like a child again looking forward to read each page and to look each picture without wanting to miss any detail; and when you finish this pleasant trip through the history... You feel like your new cool friend is now gone."
13,0007488807,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5108317-mark,5,"Fascinating, compelling, uplifting and inspiring, this is a warm and humane exploration of science, the universe, and our place within it. As the author himself puts it, Human Universe is a love letter to humanity, filled with a light of optimism. Read it and be inspired."
14,0007488807,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5686119-book,4,"Human Universe by Professor Brian Cox “Human Universe"" is a very good complementary book to the BBC documentary series of the same name. Professor Brian Cox takes the reader on an uplifting journey of the big questions that has taken humanity from ape-man to space-man. This entertaining 256-page book is broken out by the following five sections: 1. Where are We?, 2. Are We Alone?, 3. Who are We?, 4. Why are We Here?, and 5. What is Our Future? Positives:1.	Innate ability to make science accessible and fun for the masses.2.	An excellent topic, answering big philosophical questions based on the best of our current knowledge. “This book asks questions about our origins, our destiny, and our place in the universe.” 3.	Cox is a gifted author and educator; his books are fun and educational. His passion for science and love of humanity is exuded throughout the book.4.	Great use of charts and illustrations to assist the reader. 5.	Excellent, easy-to-follow format. Each section begins with a big philosophical question followed up by bite-size supporting topics.6.	As you would expect, the book is full of interesting factoids. “The Sun is one star amongst 400 billion in the Milky Way Galaxy, itself just one galaxy amongst 350 billion in the observable universe.” 7.	The impact of the grand theory of General Relativity. “Many physicists regard General Relativity as the most beautiful piece of physics yet devised by the human mind.”8.	Great examples where science clashed with religion, handled with the utmost respect and care. “Catholic dogma asserted that the Moon and the other heavenly bodies were perfect, unblemished spheres. Previous astronomers who had viewed the Moon, either with the naked eye or through telescopes, had drawn a two-dimensional blotchy surface, but Galileo saw the patterns of light and dark differently. His training in chiaroscuro revealed to him an alien lunar landscape of mountain ranges and craters.”9.	The beauty of science at work, evidence for the Big Bang Theory. “It is sufficient to say that the discovery that the universe is still glowing at a temperature of 2.7 degrees above absolute zero was the final evidence that convinced even the most sceptical scientists that the Big Bang theory was the most compelling model for the evolution of the universe.”10.	The science method applied. “It is scientific only to say what is more likely and what less likely, and not to be proving all the time the possible and impossible.”11.	A fascinating discussion on the possibility of extraterrestrial civilizations. The Drake equation. “If there are any civilisations making a serious attempt to contact us with technology at least as advanced as our own within a thousand light years, the Allen Array will hear them.”12.	The recipe for life discussed. A look at alien worlds and what’s considered the habitable zone.13.	A brief history of life on Earth. “We are mammals, which first appeared 225 million years ago in the Triassic era.”14.	A look at space exploration. 15.	Human evolution. “It is believed that around 7 or 8 million years ago we split from the chimpanzees and the process of evolution into bipedal Homo sapiens began as these monkeys started to spend more time on the ground than in the trees.”16.	A brief explanation on how the laws of nature allow for human beings to exist. “The Standard Model of particle physics is a theory that explains the interactions between subatomic particles in the form of the strong, weak and electromagnetic forces.” “General Relativity and the Standard Model are the rules of the game. They contain all our knowledge of the way that nature behaves at the most fundamental level.”17.	An amusing look at the snowflake.18.	Was the universe made for us? An excellent response worth repeating, “Our universe appears to be made for us. We live on a perfect planet, orbiting around a perfect star. This is of course content-free whimsy. The argument is backwards. We have to be a perfect fit for the planet because we evolved on it.”19.	A great case for science. “Science and reason make the darkness visible. I worry that lack of investment in science and a retreat from reason may prevent us from seeing further, or delay our reaction to what we see, making a meaningful response impossible.”20.	A picture section included. Negatives:1.	Solid effort but not quite to the standards of previous outstanding books.2.	The book is quite ambitious and loses focus.3.	Let’s face it some topics even at its simplest (quantum mechanics) are a challenge to follow.4.	No formal bibliography or book recommendations.In summary, this is an inspirational and fun book to read. Brian Cox is one of my favorite science personalities and his books reflect his warm, engaging personality. However, this is not his best effort. This book though very good does not live to the standards of some of his previous outstanding books like Wonders of the Universe. That aside, this is an excellent complementary piece to the documentary series of the same name and is worth your time. I recommend it.Further recommendations: “The Quantum Universe”, “Wonders of the Universe”, “Wonders of Life” by the same author, “Origins: Fourteen Billion Years of Cosmic Evolution” by Neil deGrasse Tyson, “Faith vs. Fact” by Jerry A.

15,0007488807,http://goodreads.com/user/show/19218176-flapper72,4,"Ok. I have a bit of a science back group - A levels and then a bit more. Anyway, did I like this book? I didn't watch the TV series - love the pictures/scenery but Prof Cox I find a bit too 'media friendly' (look, tone of voice, etc etc) so tend not to want to see science bastardised that way. Anyway, this really wasn't dumbed down science. I found it took us through things but didn't stop in a patronising 'well, they won't understand it anyway' he continued, including explaining theorem and equations, and I found that really refreshing. He is obviously still excited and amazed by the world around us and, by the end of the book, I had that sense of awe again that I haven't felt for years. The sheer size and expanse and endlessness of the universe made me feel amazed rather than intimidated or overawed. Is there life out there? Prof Cox made me realise something I'd never though of: if time is eternal, and the amount of time we (for example) as a race have lived is tiny, what are the chances of another living group to being alive at the same time and be able to be in contact for that, relatively, miniscule period of time. I really had never thought about it but once I did it's like, 'Of course. Why didn't I think like that before'. He's not 'preachy' in his belief of science being able to explain everything but is encouraging, light hearted in places but sits by well founded scientific explanation. To start with I didn't think I was going to enjoy the book but maybe I was trying to just trawl through it. Perhaps, reading a chapter and then assimilating and considering was a much better way of treating this book. It definitely allowed me to appreciate it, enjoy it and be overawed by the amazing universe we live in. "
16,0007488807,http://goodreads.com/user/show/33276635-chaunceton-bird,4,"This book explains reality through the examination of five ambitious questions: Where are we? Are we alone? Who are we? Why are we here? And what is our future? Through the use of interesting stories and simply explained complex scientific principles, Brian Cox provides answers to these questions. The book is certainly a relative of Carl Sagan's Cosmos (and, like Cosmos, it is based on a TV series by the same name). Like Cosmos, this book examines the history of the universe in an inviting and entertaining way.Overall this is a hopeful love letter to humanity, encouraging the species to snap out of its meaningless superstitions and harmful social constructs and build a brighter future. For example, from pages 114–15: ""The division into hundreds of countries whose borders and interests are defined by imagined local differences and arbitrary religious dogma, both of which are utterly irrelevant and meaningless on a galactic scale, must surely be addressed if we are to confront global problems such as mutually assured destruction, astroid threats, climate change, pandemic disease and who knows what else, and flourish beyond the twenty-first century."" I hope this book inspires many humans to study the sciences and contribute to progress of humanity. "
17,0007488807,http://goodreads.com/user/show/223837-nicky,3,"Reviewed for The Bibliophibian.If you’re expecting something based a bit more on humans and how they evolved, remember it’s Brian Cox and think bigger — it’s more about our place in the universe, our understanding of it, and what we might find out there in the vastness of space. It’s not really about us as a species, I think, but about how we see the world around us. So yeah, more physics, less biology. Which makes sense, given the author, and it’s easier to absorb than his other book I’ve read (Universal). It goes into interesting stuff like the Fermi Paradox and the Drake Equation, which is right up my street, and it avoids too much jargon or demands that the reader understand math.That said, it wasn’t amazing, from my point of view — mildly interesting, but not really my thing."

So certain, so vulnerable, so ingenious, so small, so bold, so loving, so violent, so full of promise, so unaware of his fragile significance.' This book is astonishing, fascinating and very well written! It is a reminder that we are unusual creatures living for a finite time in an unusual place set in a vast mysterious universe and that what makes us even more unusual is the fact that we are able to question who we are and where we come from and, no matter what, stubbornly carry on in our endeavor.

Not as provocative or brilliantly written as Sapiens or Homo Deus, nor as deep as any of the Brief Introduction... series, this is an episodically interesting overview of who we are and where we are.I found it a wee bit unbalanced, Cox waxing mystical when he felt it like it but then giggling at mysticality - missing, I think, the point that our same 200 000 yr old brains looked at the skies and earth in wonder when they first popped into our heads as he does now. He's also at pains to point out science is not there to answer the big questions and then sells books off the back of purportedly answering them.Not great."

So at the first chance I had, I picked physics for my A Levels but boy, was I disappointed. Instead of learning about quantum entanglement and how galaxies are formed, I spent two miserable years calculating acceleration, force, pressure and a whole bunch of other boring stuff that I can’t even remember now. Human Universe is what I wish I had been learning the entire time instead. While it does cover some basic principles like Newton’s laws, these are made extra relevant by relating them to interesting things like how the position of planets and stars were calculated. It also goes into all sorts of really cool stuff about aliens, space and the multiverse. Some of it is a bit technical but most of it was entirely entertaining to read and think about. The whole book is written in such a passionate and optimistic tone, it made me truly appreciate the beauty of science and the joys of learning more about this beautiful, mysterious world."

Apart from a few tiny typos and slight repetition in a few places, this is a fantastic book that really should be read by everyone at some point. It is much more accessible than you might expect even to those with no scientific background and Brian's political polemicising towards the end is laudable, deserving the widest audience possible. Books don't come much better than this. I bought 3 copies. 5/5"
26,0007488807,http://goodreads.com/user/show/26187865-herb-andy,4,Brian Cox is a great science popularizer. His enthusiasm is engaging and he presents some challenging concepts in an accessible way. The broad sweep of this book takes us from speculations on human origins through distant galaxies to theories on the origins of the universe. This is good primer for a variety of science topics and should whet your appetite for further reading.

Loved the narrative, the articulation and the way everything was sequenced.If you have read books by Carl Segan, Stephen Hawking, Richard Dawkins or Neil DeGrasse Tyson; many ideas and topics may sound repetitive, but essentially so, as these topics need constant revisiting and we should all try to be more aware of our fundamental ideas of our universe.I will definitely be reading the other works by the author. I highly recommend you do the same."
32,0007488807,http://goodreads.com/user/show/43656208-liam,3,"This is a decent book for some popular insight into some of the topics it explores. However, it is written with a certain level of naivety. Cox falls into the same traps which plagues the study of human evolution without seeming to take much time to think about the assumptions. The study of human evolution is still controlled by a minority of treasure hunters and, frankly, poor scientists. Finding bones is still the currency to make a statement. There is a big difference between saying that the first evidence we have for anatomically modern humans comes from the Omo Valley in Ethiopia and saying that the first homo sapiens come from the Omo Valley in Ethiopia. The truth of the matter is that the chances of any species leaving a fossil is extremely low. The most parsimonious answer is that we don't actually know where the first Homo sapiens is from. But this is a science that wants to tell a story. The problem is that when the first assumption is made on tenuous at best evidence you start making a deductive narrative as opposed to one based on evidence. In other words you start looking for facts to fit your narrative. This can lead to thinking that the particular geography of the rift valley created humans rather than the objective truth that the rift valley an excellent place for preserving fossils. Everything about the rift valley is a treasure hunter's dream. The ground literally faults in caked layers. You can find fossils by just walking around. In other environments fossils are destroyed by the acidity of the soil or buried so deep you would need an earthquake to free them. That said, hominin fossils are extremely rare in the rift valley; close to non-existent when measured against other preserved fossils. If stripped from the sensationalism that is paleoanthropology, there really isn't much of a statement to be made from the bones have been found. It used to be that the savanna made us stand on two feet and march towards rocket ships and blowing each other up with missiles. Now it's the unique climate change in the unique rift valley provoked our being and both were completely necessary. Cox takes it even further and believes that intelligent life elsewhere would have to arise in the exact same circumstance. He also, erroneously, puts a clock on the time this would take. In actuality there is no particular reason that intelligence couldn't have evolved much sooner in the Earth's history. The point he is trying to make with his bottlenecks is sophomoric at best. Cox show no imagination for how life could evolve given other circumstances. Almost like saying that all the decisions that you made in life to lead you to be sitting in that chair were very unlikely but also completely necessary for the act of chair sitting. The assumption about a goldie locks zone seems extremely naive. It's almost as he is looking for other primates who speak English in the known universe rather than intelligent life. I was hoping that a scientist from outside would throw some much deserved mud on what passes for science in paleoanthropology. Instead he extends their poorly formed arguments and assumptions to planets which likely have rift valleys with no talking primates. "
33,0007488807,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1973982-erika,4,"Human Universe was written by Brian Cox and Andrew Cohen, both theoretical physicists. It was based on the series with the same name. In this book the authors try to make sense of human life in a very clear way. I guess their main point is to make us appreciate and value humankind instead of destroy it. They believe in the power of education to help us live in a more constructive way and to focus on what is really crucial for our survival as a species."

I've always been fascinated by science and space and astronomy (yeah yeah, who isn't), so I bought this book, having always been a fan of Brian Cox's work, to give myself a change in scenery; rather than watch his show I thought I'd read the accompanying book instead.At first though I thought that was all it was going be, a kind of 'bonus feature' to the TV series. Perhaps a sort of behind-the-scenes look at how it was made, or whatever.No. Wrong. On every level. This was so much more. This took the TV show, which of course is created with the intention of captivating and intriguing everyone from a fetus to a man on his death-bed, and went into a whole new level of detail. This is for those who want more than just the brief explanations accompanied by the pretty pictures that come with the on screen version. (I'm not downgrading the TV show here by the way - love it. I'm just making a comparison). Cox goes into all the depth and scientific intricacy you could hope for, without going so far as to baffle the non-scientific reader. He truly does the universe justice with this story. The way you see things changes, and the level to which you begin to appreciate your own existence becomes astonishing. You (or speaking from my own experiecen, I, at least) learnt so much reading this. My passion for the natural order of everything we see (or can't see) around us has expanded far beyond our observable universe. If and when you give this book a read you will note, towards the end, that that was not only an intended pun, but a literal explanation as well.I honestly cannot recommend this book enough to anyone.

But how did this stupendous change take place? What significant events occurred that made such a breathtaking evolution a reality? Questions such as these are the preserve of ""Human Universe"". Professor Brian Cox and co-author Andrew Cohen go back in time and also in space to chart out the wonderful path of human evolution from primate to astronaut. During the course of traversing this long and fascinating path, they also acquaint the reader with heroic individuals whose indefatigable passion to the Sciences shed precious Light into the formation of mankind. While the book on the whole is extremely illuminating and at places, even profound, there is no doubt that some of the chapters could have been made more simpler instead of being shrouded in technological esoterica. For example, the passages dealing with Yukawa Couplings, Gluons, and Quantum Physics challenge the intellect and endurance of the reader no end and a layman might well be forgiven for giving up in unavoidable exasperation!On the whole this is a book worth reading and more importantly worth possessing. It acts as a trusted springboard for all those desiring to whet their appetite on a dose of Human Evolution and an understanding of the Universe.""Human Universe"" - Ought to be universally recommended."

Brian Cox is the host of the show and author of this book. He is a physicist and science popularizer in the same spirit as Carl Sagan, and his writing reminds me very much of Carl's. Like COSMOS, Human Universe is a person voyage and Brian gives his personal perspective on how our understanding of the universe is woven into the fabric of society. What I admire most about his presentation is his clear delineation of what is established scientific consensus, what is scientific speculation and what is his own personal opinion. He doesn't hold back. He lets the popular press, television producers, politicians, the blissfully ignorant and even his fellow scientists have it with both barrels of the proverbial shotgun when it comes to criticizing the misunderstanding of science, miscommunication of science, or the inappropriate use of institutional power to muzzle scientists. Filled with captivating photographs and engaging stories, this book has an emotional appeal that most popular science books do not. If you read it electronically, do so on a tablet. I highly recommend it. "

The book talks about the universe, and how insignificant humans are, at the same time how unlikely we are. The size of the universe is unbelievable, from atoms to galaxy, even atoms are composed of quarks, an infinite space. More interesting is the idea of inflation, which caused the big bang, there are an infinite number of universes with different physical laws, and we are in one with laws favorable for life. If you think about it how huge can existence be, if there are an infinite number of universes, taking an analogy with computers, where is all this information stored?Surely, we don't understand everything, and perhaps we never will, but as the book states science moves step by step, and someday we will reach the end of our journey."

48,0007488807,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7726595-tarun-rattan,5,"I’d read the book before but there is so much information in this book that only the multiple readings would allow to digest all that. In particular I wanted to just revisit the chapter on general theory of relativity in the second reading but was engrossed with it that I ended up reading the whole book again. The book and the related series should be read and shown in schools all the over the world. Brian Cox has done a great job in demystifying the scientific knowledge of the world by putting it into an easy to understand format and also his use of anecdotes are so to the point. I’m a cricket fan and his analogy of the complexity of physical world with the game of cricket is so apt. The rules or the scientific laws & theories does not define this world but the wonder is in the amazing cosmic play that results from that. In the same way the rules of cricket are just boring rules but in the end they have given us near perfect matches and series like the 2005 Ashes series mentioned in the book.The explanation of the theories of relativity in particular is so fascinating and has been articulated so well that anybody can understand it and in that simplicity lies the beauty of this book. The book’s premise is that this universe is a human universe and most likely we’re the only intelligent species in this universe. This premise has been built on the notion of real flukes that somehow conjured up and resulted in evolution of life of earth. These conjectures are so rare that it is unlikely it can happen again anywhere else at least in our galaxy. Some scientists might vehemently differ from this conclusion but the author’s argument for his case is really factual and he does make it pretty convincing.I’m sure that I’ll be reading the book again, perhaps few more times."
49,0007488807,http://goodreads.com/user/show/28753553-laura,5,"Our existence is a ridiculous affront to common sense, beyond any reasonable expectation of the possible based on the simplicity of the laws of nature, and our civilisation is the combination of seven billion individual affronts. (...) Our existence is necessarily temporary and our spatial reach finite, and this makes us all the more precious.I do not claim to have understood everything in this book, and I found the section on particle physics extremely hard. However, it has given me a better insight into the laws of our human universe than my extremely poor physics teachers at school. Had I had Brian Cox teaching me and inspiring me as a child I truly think I might now be a scientist. Therein lies the value of education and the importance of having well prepared and passionate educators for the next generation of scientists. This work is important because while putting humankind into perspective, it also explains why we are unique, in the sense that a multitude of fortuitous planetary and natural occurrences have led us here. The laws of gravity and relativity are explained in simple terms, if that is possible, and contextualised. This is what makes it so special - that for every law of nature exemplifications are given that make it accessible to the layman in a non patronising manner. I was fascinated to find out for example about the quantum theory of scalar fields 'the scalar field oscillates and in so doing dumps its energy into the universe in the form of particles. In so doing it creates a hot dense soup, which we identify as the 'Big Bang.' So we can now potentially explain what came before the Big Bang. There are a lot of hypotheticals in here, but nothing that does not make some sense. Truly fascinating. Am hooked."
50,0007488807,http://goodreads.com/user/show/90126634-izzy,5,"Written with genuine, palpable passion for the subject, this is Brian Cox's love letter to humanity, and our ""ascent into insignificance"" through scientific inquiry and astrophysics. Reading this inspires a sense of wonder and a strange feeling of being at once insignificant and also filled with true meaning at the same time. A cosmically scaled zooming out on our existence - examining universal human questions in each chapter: ""Where are we? Are we alone? Who are we? Why are we here? What is our future?""He creates a compelling argument for why humanity is very much worth protecting, and refocuses the lens on further scientific progress, such as asteroid defence, and inspiring the next generation of young scientists.There were a few short snippets of historical retellings from his own lifetime, for example Apollo missions or Vostok launch, which seemed to assume prior knowledge or recognition of the event in order to enjoy reading about it and situate it in context, making it pretty dry for someone who wasn't even born when those events happened! I can still appreciate why Cox decided to include them, to track our ascent from ""apeman to spaceman"" - just some more context would make them more accessible.Overall, a really good book for finding a new perspective on both humanity and physics."

That and many other questions are not so much answered, but they are at least discussed in this companion book to the BBC series of the same name. It charts the history of humanity, how we are where we are, and the cosmology that has come from it. Unashamedly closely linked with Brian Cox's area of expertise (physics/cosmology) this still takes us through biology, & chemistry and manages to steer clear of criticism of religion.This is the first book by Brian Cox I have read and I found it very easy to follow, lots of examples (from the real world, not just the halls of mathematical physics) and good short sections which were definitely 'pick-up/put-down' able. (Although I read in 2 evenings unable to put it down at all). I should say as a slight warning that I did the relativity and quantum theory referred to in the books at University and it was great to see the formulas again... but you don't need to understand them. Cox would like that you *try* but it is far from a necessity.Easy to access, interesting, fun and informative... and who doesn't like a Professor who's a Monty Python fan, loves cricket and still makes fun of Geoffrey Boycott... in a science book."

You end it, as you end any of his documentaries, with great eagerness for knowledge and a new-found passion for Physics. This book is reasonable easy to read - albeit some mathematical details that left me a bit overwhelmed (but then again it's just me), but it doesn't shy away from complex terminology or concepts, even when simplifying them for readers with little to no knowledge of Physics or Astronomy.The reason why I am giving this book a 4-star rating (more like 4.5 if the website allowed such a rating) is because I thought it would be 100% Astronomy. Not that the book is any less interesting the way it is, but I really thought it would be all Astronomy; a little disappointment it's all. This book does bring together data from different sciences to better analyse who we are, and that is definitely an important detail that make this such a good book. But on the other hand, I couldn't help but feel that the Palaeoanthropological data was a bit generalised, as it is more complex than it looks. But then again that's my area of study, so it's easy to feel a bit too personal about it."

From looking at the reviews it always strikes me that people feel the need to use the longest, most complicated words they can to review a scientific book in an attempt to look smart themselves. This goes against what Brian Cox has done with this book, he has taken many different areas of science such as biology, chemistry and obviously a heavy physics influence and broken them down into language that everyone can understand. Not once did I have to search the words he uses in this book, however for the reviews of it I did!Moaning aside this book is brilliant, it details the story from the big bang, the potential of existence before this due to inflation theory, all the way up to where we are today and how the galaxy may end up destroying us anyway! A very good read and not heavy on the maths at all, I can only recall seeing one differential equation and this was only because he was explaining what it is and why it was relevant!If you are looking for a very well researched and written account of who we are, where we come from and then an educated guess on where we are going you can't go wrong with this book! Excellent read."

It’s all very interesting and one thing I love about Professor Brian Cox’s documentaries and books are that they are accessible, no matter how little knowledge I have on physics - however, at times in the book I was a bit overwhelmed by the mathematics and physics which were a little heavy.But what I did understand was all down to Cox’s ability to make a potentially dry subject so engaging and exciting. He is curious and passionate and that comes across in the book-which is inspiring when you aren’t a physicist, just an interested human.There are cool quotes, illustrations and photos throughout which are nice visuals to go with all of the knowledge.‘What a piece of work is a man.

Everybody should read it and feel the comfort of being so small in this infinite universe.Brian Cox can explain the most complex physics theories and laws in the most simple way, so this is perfect for people who are curious about astrophysics. He also has a beautiful way of writing and, although I read Neil deGrasse Tyson and the king Carl Sagan, Brian puts in words the fascination and awe I feel for the universe better than everything I've ever read.I'm really grateful for this book and I'm really grateful for living in such an amazing time for humanity, when we went from ""Apeman to Spaceman"".I'll I ever want to be is a tiny speck of dust in this wonderful universe."

What lets this down is that it tries to be everything. It is also very similar to so many other works that arguably do it better. The author pushes a very anthropocentric rare earth angle which is disappointing given his authority in physics, though most seem to be and it may be something to do with rational skepticism than anything else. The anthropology is interesting as is the musing philosophy. But punctuating these with cold complex algebraic equations which serve to either impress or completely alienate is not doing readers any favours. Not is the cheesy mock American accents. And the many disconnected personal anecdotes appear only to paint a picture of an idealist trapped in the mind of a mathematician."

Some of the scientific concepts I thought were well explained and I was able to follow and understand. Others just went over my head and I guess I'll have to try watching the TV series in the hope of finding better explanations there. Overall though this book left me with a good appreciation of the natural world and an appreciation of the human mind in how we've progressively (slowly but surely) advanced our understanding of it all."

This book deftly presents its content in ways that don't force concrete conclusions – stimulating thought and inspiring further investigation. I particularly enjoyed the introduction to the 'Drake Equation' (which seeks to calculate the probability of the presence of alternate intelligent life in our universe) and the surprising conclusion drawn by the author, given the number of exoplanets in the 'habitable zone' that have recently been discovered in our galaxy alone. I would strongly recommend this book to anyone seeking to build or develop an understanding of our place in the universe."

Cox does a good job of giving enough of the detail of the physics to be interesting, without becoming overwhelming and uninterpretable. In fact, even in the most technical parts, it remains compelling and engaging. The perspective on human history, viewing it through the lens of developing the scientific method, is hardly novel but is engagingly and entertainingly presented.And I loved the line...

These are some of the questions that Brian Cox attempts to answer in this book, quite eloquently, if I might add.It's the use of language of Science that makes it a contemplative read, but it's the same usage that made it hard to follow at times. Occasionally, in the web of all theories and hypotheses refernced by him, I found myself lost, but when I did understand them , it enabled me to appreciate the points he was trying to make even more. Like many already have pointed out, Human Universe is indeed a love letter to humanity and (possibly) its (greatest) creation- Science."

Rather, I go into these books expecting them to fascinate me and and create curiosity for further deep dives by presenting complex subjects in a digestible way. Human Universe does that and more. At the crux of it, the book is a love letter to humanity. It attempts to tackle the questions of Where, When, How and Why, and in the process, takes the readers on a journey of how humans went from ape-men to spacemen. The science is explained in a easily understandable format and even subjects like general relativity are tackled in a way that a layman can get the gist of it. While I admit to being a bit lost when it came to the subject of quantum particles like quarks, gluons etc., I feel that to be the case because of the nature of the subject itself. I haven't seen the documentary that the book is based on, but if it is anything like the book itself, I need to seek it out soon.

Without any knowledge of the author, you can clearly distinguish that he is a scientist based on how he lays out the highly debated theories and then gives his opinion of what is more probable based on recent findings, just like in science, nothing is absolute and subjected to change based on new evidence. There is an enormous contrast between this and Sapiens by Yuval Harari covering the same subject but, I think, it's merely two different point of view from two very different professions, a scientist and a historian. Both are highly entertaining and I recommend reading one after the other."

Written by true scientists that manage to write for a broad audience understandably and meaningfully. There are sections that are hard to understand or beyond my mental powers, but it gives a glimpse how complex science in these frontier disciplines like cosmology and quantum physics is.

I imagine that, the average viewer who enjoyed the TV series, would find this significantly more challenging. Maybe some people want to feel challenged, and well done you, if you do. I imagine more will fall by the wayside, which is unfortunate. If you decide to give it a try, just be prepared that it's not light entertainment 'fluff', or a little light bedtime reading, it is brain taxing and thought-provoking. Be prepared. And enjoy the littering of Monty Python quotes.... :-)"
66,0007488807,http://goodreads.com/user/show/54230327-david,5,"Extremely intelligent writing. Truly a love-letter to humanity, pointing out how extremely lucky we are to even exist. Professor Cox mixes his personal thoughts and experiences with interesting scientific facts and researches on the fields of anthropology, evolutionary biology, astronomy, astro-physics, history etc. In the center of the book is the existence of life-as-we-know-it on Earth, and the fact that humans can comprehend this fact. You will see your everyday life from a different perspective after reading this book. "
67,0007488807,http://goodreads.com/user/show/56629704-ashley-vu,5,"Human Universe is a beautiful odyssey of the cosmo and humanity. The book follows the questions:- Where are we? - Are we alone? - Who are we?- Why are we here? - What is our future?Brian explores the topics using science, but the stories that he tells are also full of heart and optimism. Human is so insignificant in the grand scale of the universe, yet so extraordinary and precious. How beautiful to think how far our civilisation has evolved despite all the nature odds. I didn’t watch the TV series and still enjoy the book thoroughly. "
68,0007488807,http://goodreads.com/user/show/8753687-john-pollard,4,"Very well written and some good accessible explanations of the universe big and small. Slightly going over ground in so many similar books, with the usual focus on the revolutionary steps of key characters such as Euclid, Copernicus, Newton, Galileo and Einstein. An interesting look at the chances of there being other intelligent life in the universe, with a worrying thought that the lack of evidence of anyone out there might be due to the self destructive life cycle of ""intelligent"" beings - i.e. that we will destroy ourselves once our technology advances far enough to do so easily!"
69,0007488807,http://goodreads.com/user/show/43740152-richie,5,"Thoroughly enjoyed my daily commute, listening in the car. Becoming easily engrossed in such a book is a great way to mitigate road rage.Although based off a TV series, it easily stands on its own. I quite enjoyed the flow, the finishing note actually left me quite emotional as I pondered all of humanity with it's hopes and fears. It really touched me and will leave a lasting impression. The human story told through scientific words, yet eloquent and serendipitous, such that a layman can grasp big concepts, is truly inspiring. Highly recommended, even in spite of the maths formulas!"
70,0007488807,http://goodreads.com/user/show/37929503-fredrik,5,"Science starts with figuring out the smalls bits, wanting to know how it works, and uses that to investigate the larger questions and truths of life. I found the book charming, at times funny and written in an understandable way (for us that don't know much about anything).Going through the history of science, if we are alone in the universe, how we know pretty much anything about the universe, and more, in what seems to just be a short time. And still it is written so you can understand how one leads to another, why using the methods science has come up with works and more. "
71,0007488807,http://goodreads.com/user/show/41480546-akankshya,4,This book was an amazing ride! From cosmological classification of stars to Von Neumann probes to Fermi's paradoxI enjoyed every bit of itI think what's especially stuck to me was his views on intelligent life and that really helped me refine my own worldview and position in this universeThis book will be great for anyone who wants their sense of wonder ignited especially if they're pursuing science like me and classrooms have simply let your enthusiasm rot in an avalanche of rote memorization and exams
72,0007488807,http://goodreads.com/user/show/27635093-eleen,4,"Although I dropped my science and maths classes as soon as I could in high school, this book made me want to study astronomy and begrudgingly brush up on physics. Can you even brush up on physics? This book was exciting. I appreciated the easy blend of history and science; the writing style, which made it comprehensible to laymen; and especially the clear distinction between what was the author’s opinion and what was fact."
73,0007488807,http://goodreads.com/user/show/70956305-mkk,5,"This is a beautifully written book. It is a romantic nonfiction, an ode to science and to humanity itself. It’s not just about space, it’s about life in various aspects. Brian Cox brings out the wonder in us, he extracts the appreciation within us that hides amongst our daily angst. This is a visual and verbal therapy for those in despair. This is the book we must carry with us on all our adventures. "
74,0007488807,http://goodreads.com/user/show/76449937-kaspar-g,5,"This book goes hand in hand with the Human Universe BBC series. Compared with the other book of the same name, it goes into greater depth and behind the scenes thoughts and interactions that Professor Brian Cox experiences whilst filming the Human Universe series. The knowledge base in the book covers those from basic science knowledge to much more in-depth analysis of the mathematics that makes human life possible. A really good read. "
75,0007488807,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7604613-sudha-hamilton,5,"Brian Cox wears his heart on his sleeve for a scientist. I enjoyed his inclusion of his love for Joy Division, cricket and a favourite grandparent. This is mind expanding cosmology and physics earthed by biology. Reading this during the coronavirus COVID-19 lockdown gave me heart during a dark time. Can't wait till we find out more about all this dark matter and dark energy, which makes up most of our universe."
76,0007488807,http://goodreads.com/user/show/113389440-joachim-bjerg,4,"When you dive into this book, the unfolding of the evolution of the world as we know it today starts. The astrological way of describing the current understanding of the world is both fascinating and mind-blowing. You can really feel the curiosity of Brian Cox as a scientist, and this is rather inspirational. Overall a really enjoyable book, where you gain insight in a science very few know about."
77,0007488807,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5841574-linda-rawlinson,5,"I need that ‘mind blown’ emoji for this book. It’s quite simply beautiful. I should say that the heavier bits of physics and maths go right over my head, but that doesn’t really matter because Brian Cox gets to the heart of things with some very lovely prose and I still understand what he’s trying to tell me. I cried twice reading this - there are a few very profound and moving stories. Just wonderful. "
78,0007488807,http://goodreads.com/user/show/36019776-balaji-aresh,4,"This short but excellent book takes you on a journey from the primordial soup to the Inflation Theory and how we fit in between. This is a story of our existence, the stories behind equations and the people who created them. This book builds around the Drake equation, and each element of that equation has a story to tell. The narrator Samuel West has done a fine job but at places that needed a bit of dramatisation with an American accent needs work!"
79,0007488807,http://goodreads.com/user/show/77030320-mr-c,4,"I was torn when rating this book as I flipped between 3 & 4 stars. Whilst sections of this book were too mathematically advanced for me to truly understand, the majority of it whilst complex was delivered in a way that even I, the layman, followed and understood. And for that reason I ultimately opted for 4 stars. The books raises some good discussions and considerations without being preachy. In part I just like Brian Cox and think he is a great ambassador for science."
80,0007488807,http://goodreads.com/user/show/50110643-helen-windebank,4,"Suffused with Brian Cox's enthusiasm and sense of wonder, this book was a great read. The explanations were comprehensive; I even felt that in understood partial physics (a bit!) by the end. I didn't watch the TV series that the book was built on and don't feel that I missed out. It is incredible how much content is covered and how interconnected everything is."
81,0007488807,http://goodreads.com/user/show/54113602-scott-langston,4,"Inspirational stuff from Brian Cox. I haven't yet watched the series which the book is based upon, but will definitely do so. Well written, humorous at times, not preachy, but firmly underlining the essential role of science if humanity is to survive. Clearly written and well-argued, even the maths wasn't too scary."
82,0007488807,http://goodreads.com/user/show/63240697-gu-mundur,5,"Brian Cox at his best. ""His best"" being explaining relatively complex subjects in simple ways with such an contagious enthusiasm that you cannot help but be pulled along. In a good way of course.Compiled with the same titled BBC shows this series comes really close to explain and answer the most interesting questions of all. How did all become? why is it like it is? and why are we here?"
83,0007488807,http://goodreads.com/user/show/16834715-jane-bruyns,5,In the silence of the mountains I read what proved to be one of the best books I have ever had the honor of reading. Professor Cox & Andrew Cohen made science accessible to a scientifically illiterate human. This is an important book that inspires while it teaches but most importantly provides a perspective on humanity that is awesome in the true sense of that much over used adjective.
84,0007488807,http://goodreads.com/user/show/46393393-divya,3,This book is based on a documentary as part of a TV series. It covers several different topics. I enjoyed reading most of it but it was a difficult read for me. I forgot most of the initial chapters by the time I completed reading the book 🙃 . May be I will watch the documentary someday and it would all come back to me.
85,0007488807,http://goodreads.com/user/show/90103376-mj,4,"The book is well written, and I can totally hear Brian Cox in my mind as I read the text. I have always enjoyed his content on TV.The science in the book was intriguing and kept me interested. His enthusiasm and wonder for science is contagious. Minus one star for being preachy and grinding a philosophical, anti-religious, and political axe."
86,0007488807,http://goodreads.com/user/show/32273183-mike-mchugh,5,"Fascinating This book gives an excellent overview of human and scientific history and the place of humanity in the universe. It demonstrates how tiny we are in the cosmos, but also how unique and valuable we are too. This book is also very readable and has a pleasant, friendly tone. "
87,0007488807,http://goodreads.com/user/show/51795834-sawubonasana,5,I listened to this book as the topic is of interest to me but English is not my mother tongue. I was scared of starting reading it and never finishing. As an audio it felt like a space adventure. I recommend listening. There is a lot of information. It took me a few months to finish it. All worth it.
88,0007488807,http://goodreads.com/user/show/20811025-rachel-stimson,5,I thoroughly enjoyed this book. I have had my mind alternately expanded and compressed. Prof. Cox doesn't avoid discussing complex topics or details of physics that ordinarily most would find baffling; instead he patiently explains the concepts clearly using stories and analogies to be sure that the point is well communicated.I am very much looking forward to exploring his other works.
89,0007488807,http://goodreads.com/user/show/541568-raymond,4,Excellent book. Brian Cox and Andrew Cohen really give detailed information in a style the lay man can understand. I would have like to have learned more of the existence of parallel universes and quarks and quantum mechanics. But it’s only a small thing. Mind expanding stuff.
90,0007488807,http://goodreads.com/user/show/73131686-anna-van-koeverden,5,"This book is about how the universe came to exist, how our earth came to exist within the universe, how the human race came to exist on earth and how we have figured all of this out. A beautiful ode to science and the human race."
91,0007488807,http://goodreads.com/user/show/18843824-scott,4,"A great exploration into our place in the universe.There are books that help you think, and then there is The Human Universe which makes you think.“What a piece of work is man”, is shown in this great book.Let’s aspire to the lofty heights of JFK and going to the moon and now beyond.

A great book to read that will leave you informed and inspired and entertained at once "
