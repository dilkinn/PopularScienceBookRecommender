0,0805078533,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4110877-chrissy,3,"Okay. This book and I didn't get along terribly well, but the experience was nevertheless a valuable one. So, 3 stars, even though I disagree fundamentally with some of the theory and the style of presentation. This will be a long one; bear with me.To put it simply.... Jeff Hawkins is a very intelligent computer engineer who thinks he understands brains in ways that no neuroscientist ever has before, mostly because he is willing to stand by a grand picture where most neuroscientists want to investigate every small chunk before declaring they've solved brains. He has read a lot of books about neuroscience and has spoken to a lot of neuroscientists, and has trudged up a (not patently incorrect) theory from the 1970's and used it as a foundation for what he considers the first general theory of cortical brain functioning (it isn't). He then equates ""cortex"" with ""intelligence"" and takes off on a grand tour of his theory: that we can build intelligent* machines to perform complex pattern recognition tasks in much the same ways that he proposes an organic cortex does.*NOT human-like, though you wouldn't know it from the wording in any blurb you read about the book, including the book's own jacket summary.There are a lot of theoretic assumptions in this book, and unpacking them is quite unfortunately left up to the reader, who may not have the requisite background knowledge to separate out responsible assumptions, backed by data that Hawkins rarely mentions in order to keep it digestible to a lay audience, from irresponsible ones. There are many of the latter, detectable only by those who know the field or the scientific method well enough to know a red flag when they see it. Hawkins plays loose on owning up to these assumptions, even when they are cornerstones without which his theory loses a lot of its appeal. I was relieved when he admitted to the oversimplification of his view at the end of the chapter on neurology, but it felt like an afterthought that could (should?) have been used to temper his conviction and factual flippancy up to that point. The tone of the book is occasionally that of a conspiracy theorist who has figured it all out, against all conventional belief, and pulls you along a fast sequence of premises and conclusions while waving his hands and telling you the details of the premises are too complicated to get into.One of the bafflers that stood out to me (this is a bit technical, sorry) was the notion that the basal ganglia and cerebellum are old structures whose functions have been largely subsumed by the neocortex, and thus were unnecessary for a theory of intelligent motor behaviour. The balls it takes to make that claim, when such vastly debilitating diseases as Parkinson's, Huntingtons, or Ataxia exist, blew my brains out a bit.At that point, it became clear that Hawkins was so fixated on the neocortex that he was willing to push aside contradictory evidence from subcortical structures to make his theory fit. I've seen this before, from neuroscientists who fall in love with a given brain region and begin seeing it as the root of all behaviour, increasingly neglecting the quite patent reality of an immensely distributed system. It's pretty natural, and honestly not limited to neuroscientists: when you stare too closely at one piece of a puzzle, you begin to forget that there are other pieces. For most scientists, however, this view need not be a detriment, because they generally aim their research programs at very specific questions-- questions that this atomized focus are fit to answer. In the case of Jeff Hawkins' general theory of brain function, however, it's entirely disingenuous.Putting aside my qualms with his approach to the theory, there is actually some overlap between his views my own, and some points of valuable and probably instructive disagreement. Hawkins views intelligence as a result of hierarchical and recursive neural organization: basically, there are higher and lower levels, with communication tracing both upwards (from sensory input) and downwards (from higher levels of analysis) via patterns of activation. What we experience is a complex interaction between external input and internal input from memory, resulting in a continuous stream of online prediction. Up to this point, my theories of what we might call consciousness match his theory of intelligent pretty well. Where we differ is in the details (and in our respective convictions that we are correct!).In neuroscience, there is a theoretical construct called the 'grandmother cell,' to illustrate the ludicrous idea that there is a single neuron in your brain that represents your grandmother, another for your cat, and so on. The grandmother cell has been disproven time and time again: the brain is a HIGHLY distributed system, and a given representation is the result of patterns of activations across many cells, not one cell. Jeff Hawkins acknowledges this.... before proposing instead that representations in the cortex are handled by (my term, not his) grandmother cellular columns. Briefly, the visual cortex has been shown to have a columnar organization that traverses six parallel layers of anatomically and biologically different cell types, such that cells at Point X of layer 1 respond to the same sorts of basic visual information (e.g., line angles) as cells at Point X of layers 2 through 6. Because the rest of the cortex also seems to be organized in six distinguishable layers, Hawkins suggests that the entire cortex operates in columns, such that the composite idea of your grandmother should be represented by a given cellular column in a high-level area of cortex. He never states these logical conclusions outright, but they follow from the way his theory proposes hierarchical organization to work. He briefly admits the oversimplification at play, and then nevertheless uses the oversimplification as the foundation for the rest of the theory. This is not a novel theory so much as it is an outdated theory with the goalpost pushed back one step. And while oversimplifications are a necessary evil in scientific progress*, they need to be acknowledged and admitted so that they can be refined, again, especially where a general theory for a lay audience is the goal.*as my advisor says it, the goal of a scientist is to maintain a productive level of ambiguity.The rest of the book was (to me) less controversial. There was the requisite chapter to answer such questions as ""does this mean animals are intelligent!?"" for readers who've never thought about the implications of a physical and evolutionarily-derived brain before. Yawn. This was followed by a chapter on what I assume is the whole reason Hawkins wrote the book: the prospect of intelligent machines. Having defined 'intelligence' as 'cortex,' he rather plainly announces that an intelligent machine will be one organized with recursive and flexible hierarchies, a reveal that will shock or excite no cognitive scientist. He very clearly explains why current artificial intelligence built on existing computer memory structures are not up to the task, an argument that AI researchers have been ignoring for decades. Much to my pleasant surprise, again given the blurbs on this book, he then laments the cold hard reality that we will never have viable machines that are intelligent in the way humans are: humans are intelligent the way humans are because of all the sensory and proprioceptive input coming in from their human bodies to shape their brains. Unless we build almost impossibly costly and cumbersome human-like bodies to go with our fancy intelligent machine brains, it's a moot point trying to make machines like humans-- and why would we want to anyways? Hawkins outlines some realistic goals that are achievable (e.g., self-driving cars, diagnostic machines, weather prediction machines...), none of which I particularly disagree with except for the optimistic time-frames forecasted. However, I can't help feeling that most readers are set up to be vastly disappointed by the propositions. With the majority of the book devoted to neurological theory, it's hard not to anticipate that the machine intelligence he will eventually propose will mimic neurology. The book jacket itself claims that Hawkins' theories will ""make it possible for us to build intelligent machines, in silicon, that will not simply imitate but exceed our human ability in surprising ways."" But nothing about the analogical applications of his neurologically-based theory are intended to imitate humans. He expressly states, in fact, that the aim to build artificial humans is wrong-footed and fated to fail. The message is a bit confusing, and while I would have personally been offended to hear him say what most readers likely wanted to hear-- that we can build human-like machines by analogy to human cortex-- I again get a sticky sense of disingenuity, this time to sell book copies.Overall, this was an interesting but infuriating book that takes some great ideas from existing cognitive science, laudably exposes them to a lay audience in ways that most cognitive and neuroscientists won't bother to, shoves them into a flawed neurological framework, and then announces brains to be solved. The ego involved is staggering, the conclusions less so, and the applications underwhelming. I am admittedly very interested to see, hopefully in my lifetime, just how intelligent Hawkins' intelligent machines can get with only an analogical neocortex. Since he never discusses this fact, spoilers: a neocortex is not enough for either humans or nonhuman animals to function, let alone intelligently. The (rather expensive...) exercise of trying to evoke intelligence from cortex alone could provide us with a better appreciation of subcortical structures, much needed in this species-self-congratulatory era of cortical fixation."
1,0805078533,http://goodreads.com/user/show/875719-m-l,3,"""On Intelligence (and Condescension)"" The only thing wrong with Jeff Hawkins's book is Jeff Hawkins. His idea for the brain basic structure is exciting. (basically he argues that the brain works off a near-recursive prediction model based on stimulus and memory.) And he's really into intelligent machines. In fact, he may have convinced me not to fear the giant robot armies that have plagued my dreams. Nope. Now I can fear the infinitely-sized hyper-conscious EverMind that operates mainly in the sixth dimension. But don't let that sort of thing keep you away. He doesn't get to that until chapter 8. (ish).Unfortunately, like a great many successful industrialists who have spent most of their life outside of academia (I'm talking to you, Mr. Soros), Hawkins writes with a chip on his shoulder and something to prove. Mainly that he's smart. Really really really smart. It would have been a far nicer read if he'd stuck to proving his thesis.Notice in the beginning how he goes out of his way to point out that Sandra Blakeslee (science writer) is NOT the author...just a ghost writer or editor or something like that. It's belittling and a little embarrassing. You'd think a lifetime student of the mind would be less inclined to pride.Okay. If you want to learn more about the brain than you know, probably, then this is a great book to read. But if blowhards bother you, maybe you should reconsider your curiosity. It is an unfortunate fact that a lot of these industrialists have really great ideas and so are forced to promote them in these kind of books. (Now I'm talking to you Mr. Wolfram). The capitalists have no humility, but are often smart and right.5 stars for content1 star for voice3 stars and praise for the book this could have been."
2,0805078533,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1971043-rich-brown,3,"Condescending, but interesting. A thousand examples too long. Or, to put it another way, the examples were 1 + 999 too many. Or as one might say, 10*100 examples are too many. In case I haven't made myself clear, think of it this way: more than 200 + 800 examples are in this book. This is heady stuff, so let me say it again. 400 + 600 examples are here, and more.Computers compute, but brains do pattern recognition. Then they do pattern recognition on the patterns they've recognized. Then they recognize patterns of patterns of patterns... etc. It's an endless Matryoshka doll of pattern-recognition. Computers don't/can't work this way. One major difference is the thousands of feedback loops for every connection. Another major difference is the fact that a mechanical binary switch and a biological chemical neuron are dramatically different. The end."
3,0805078533,http://goodreads.com/user/show/206483-dj,4,"Hawkins' theory is that the entire sensory cortex runs a single cortical algorithm to perform all of its sensory functions.This single algorithm simply looks for patterns. Layers and layers of brain cells performing this pattern recognition result in our sensory experience. Here is an example of how this might work for vision:Layer 1 receives sensory input from the outside world and looks for general patterns of lines.Layer 2 receives input from layer 1 and looks for patterns of edges from those lines.Layer 3 receives input from layer 2 and looks for groups of edges forming rectangles and other shapes.Layer 4 receives input from layer 3 and looks for patterns of shapes (a circle on top of a vertical rectangle with 2 long vertical rectangles below and 2 long horizontal rectangles on the side might be a human with 4 limbs)....and on and on*I'm not a neuroscientist. Go read the book to get a much better explanation of this theory.The variety of sensory functions our brain can perform then arise, not from a set of varied algorithms, but from the structure of the brain.Hawkins also suggests that behavior and prediction are one and the same. To perform an action, our brains imagine us going through the action, our motor neurons fire in response, and voila!, we act. (Its been a few months since I read this book and my memory on this theory is a bit fuzzy. Again, go read the book.)The great leaps forward in science of our past have often been counterintuitive simplifications of a complex issue and Hawkins' theory is just simple and elegant enough to qualify. Research over the next decade will prove him right or wrong, but in either case, this is a fantastic book to stimulate thinking on what's going on inside your head.(Note: this is a scientifically dense book and you may have to reread sentences, paragraphs, and chapters to make sense of it all. I personally intend to go back and read it again after reading a few other books on intelligence and the brain.)"
4,0805078533,http://goodreads.com/user/show/18528295-eric-hamilton,2,"I picked this up on sale but I can't finish it. I wanted a bright person's coherent and logical progression through a model of the brain. As bright as the author might be, he is astonishingly tone deaf to how distracting the relentless implicit and direct accolades he gives to himself are to the science he is trying to explain. The book might be summarized as a tapestry of ....introduction (all about me!)...look at me again!...science...look at me!...look at me!....science...did you see me?! etc Assumptions and assertions about research threads other than his own are conveniently packaged with plenty of straw men, when with a little bit more scientific humility he could be so much more effective. I would love to see what he put in his later chapters, but can't deal with all the sludge you have to put up with to get the good stuff."
5,0805078533,http://goodreads.com/user/show/31999040-shea-levy,2,"Moderately entertaining speculation on how intelligence works on a neural level in humans. A lot of his criticisms of neuroscience as practiced rung true to me (a more-than-layman less-than-initiate for this field) 10 years later, though I wouldn't be as extreme as he is. The framework he puts forth is at least plausible and has a certain elegance to it. Unfortunately, there's not a whole lot of support provided, and a lot of the assertions he makes (particularly his high confidence in Mountcastle's ""Organizing Principle"", which underlies the entire framework) are much stronger than seems justifiable, even given his explicit hedging. Given the core ideas around which his theory was built, I think Hawkins would have been much better served doing some cheap tests (literature review + novel experiments) to see if they can be easily discarded and then gone on to design experiments to flesh the theory out and validate it at the same time, rather than trying to build a full-blown framework and publishing a book.The discussions around intelligent machines were interesting and raised some good points about how the AI field has progressed and what we might expect artificial intelligences to look like. I especially liked his dismissal of the behavior-intelligence equation and his avoiding the trap of ""Church-Turing thesis, therefore von Neumann architecture is as good a choice as any"" that so many seem to fall into. Ultimately, though, a lot of his speculation seemed really weak and more importantly it seemed remarkably premature to start speculative engineering before we have the science. I wouldn't put much stock in any specific predictions he makes either way. He also seriously strawmans the AI risk concern.Finally, the book was hilarious in the ""laugh at him, not with him"" way. In addition to the story of the memory-prediction model, On Intelligence is also the story of how awesome Jeff Hawkins is and how silly everyone else is. The book is littered with spurious anecdotes, personal perspectives, and seemingly sour grapes at how misunderstood his genius is. I enjoyed this aspect of the book, but not in a way I'd expect Hawkins himself to appreciate."
6,0805078533,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5896715-dave,5,"Jeff Hawkins has done a remarkable thing. He's essentially synthesised all of the information we have on how the brain works into a simple, elegant and utterly comprehensible theory of intelligence that will pave the way to the creation of truly intelligent machines. That's a massive claim I know but I honestly don't think I have ever read a simpler, more straightforward account of what intelligence is. Hawkins' theory, in a nutshell, is that intelligence is a manifestation of the brains ability to predict the future and test its perceptions against its predictions. Like a fractal there is a mass of self-similarity at work here. At the very fine-grained level the predictions the brains making are very mundane but as sensory information is handled, and exceptions passed up the hierarchy, and predictions passed back down the hierarchy, our brains learn from their experiences and, over time a genuine, common understanding of the world emerges. Anyone working on machine intelligence should read this short, simple book."
7,0805078533,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3548397-faisal-nawab,4,"The book is a take on understanding (human-like) intelligence. The author introduces memory prediction framework to explain the kind of intelligence humans possess. He defines intelligence as the ability to predict. This ability (prediction) can then take different shapes, like decision-making and even creativity. He view the brain as a pattern-recognition device. Different sensory inputs, he claims, are treated in (almost) the same way by the brain. The treatment of the subject was very pragmatic. His aim to understand the brain was motivated by building intelligent agents that can solve intelligence problems that are (currently) unattainable by machines, e.g. image/sound recognition. This pragmatism is refreshing for those familiar with kurzweil and Hofstadter's view of intelligence (and to some degree consciousness) as they also hint in their work that patterns are a constituent view of information for intelligent machines.The (almost) identical treatment of patterns is backed up by two main arguments. First, as Ramachandran present in his ""A brief tour of human consciousness"", different parts of the brain can treat the same sensory input while resulting in an output (e.g. by consciousness) that is consistent with that part; as what happens with people with synesthesia. Second, the structural similarities of the human neocortex. However, this point was particularly surprising since the author, in the first half of the book, attribute intelligence to the neocortex, where it would be expected to be attributed to the cereberal cortex. However, he retain in the second half of the book this conventional view.In general, the book is a really interesting read. The used language and the progression of ideas are easy to follow. It mixes the right amount of pragmatism and theory for a joyful general read. The only thing that I found bugging was his treatment of the notion of intelligence when he discussed the Turing and Chinese room test. His view that a system is intelligent if it can predict is not really satisfying oppose to the original Turing behavior requirement. Also, I find that his view on the Chinese room test actually contradicts his views in consciousness. "

This book takes a stab at trying to explain how we learn, and breaks down the steps that our brain goes through during the process of learning and recollection.It's a really good mix of easy to understand, higher level philosophical arguments as well as lots of technical details when he get's into the details about how the neocortex performs it's actions, from sensory input all the way to invariant representations.Would definitely recommend to anyone who has any interest in understanding how things work (and how our brains understand how things work!)."
9,0805078533,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3960665-ryan,4,"Author is one of the top people in consumer tech (created Palm Pilot), and is deeply interested in AI. He does a pretty good job of presenting a few elements of the field (neural networks, primarily, and that prediction is the most key activity in the neocortex) to a general audience, and then includes some of his own theories and predictions (which is tricky because it's hard for a non-expert to know which parts are broadly accepted and which are his own theories...). Overall, a very interesting book, and since it's nearly 20 years old, it's interesting to see which of his predictions were accurate (things took about 10-20% longer than he predicted, I think, but were much more successful than he predicted); always neat when someone's errors in ""wild predictions"" are that they were too conservative in some way.I honestly don't know anywhere near enough about neuroscience to really evaluate that portion or his presentation, but the more general information/cs part was pretty solid.Most interesting thing to me was the theory that the neocortex evolved to make predictions better in animals, which is a great way to have it merge with the sensory and motor control parts of lower elements of the brain, and provides an incremental and continuous benefit from even slight levels of new capability all the way up to what we have in humans today."
10,0805078533,http://goodreads.com/user/show/76152913-carina-kaltenbach,3,"To be honest, I have very mixed feelings about this book. I really enjoyed the first part, it gave a good introduction and discussion of neuroscientific research. Even though I didn't agree on most points (being somewhat a neuroscientist myself), I think it was well written and ~interesting~. But, I am not quite sure how to feel about the whole second part: his theory. Hawkins surely has good points, but I'm missing some kind of evidence for his ideas. Overall, I was a bit disappointed by the lack of references: even if you write a popscience book, it's nice to actually cite the studies you're talking about - especially so the interested reader can learn more. I also found there was too much of Hawkins person in the book and too little of the actual content. I had hoped for a book that would give a nice sort of introduction into the field, not explain a new theory without evidence for it. Overall I felt a lot of it was too subjective, too ""I founded this company, and made this important invention"", especially since his inventions actually ended up being pretty not important 15 years later.Nonetheless, an easy-ish read with loads of good parts and ideas. Definitely suitable for people without any prior knowledge but should be taken with a big, BIG grain of salt."

14,0805078533,http://goodreads.com/user/show/62836492-romil-kinger,5,"we humans are just a brain and a body. brain in this equation is the integral part, it gives us the identity and makes us what we are. you lose a limb, you just lose a limp; you lose a brain, you lose everything.it is as complicated an organ as important it is, but science still doesnot know how it works, we just know the basics of how neurons interact, how signals are passed and which area is doing what work. jeff hawkins, a neuroscientist, is trying to propose his theory of how, he thinks, brain works. it is just a theory which does not completely mean that it is exactly how the brain works but it surely is a step towards that quest. this book will provoke your thoughts and stimulate more questions. i am putting some ideas presented in this book here:whatever we are seeing is portrayed on retina of our eye, the brain doesn’t see the image. All our senses are reporting their inputs to the brain and it is producing an output. All the inputs (from eyes, ears, etc) are converted to the same thing and our brain follows one universal algorithm for all of them. Pointing to the thought that the kind of input doesnot matter, it is how it is perceived in the brain. because it is following mostly one single kind of algorithm for all the work. Other senses can be trained to cope up for the missing senses, and may be that’s why blind people are good at hearing.it talks about memory prediction framework, which says all of our experiences are being stored in our memory(how and where in the book) and then we predict everything based on that memory, and then behave accordingly. prediction is the key essence of human intelligence because every time we are predicting, if things go according to our predictions we call them normal and when they don’t we feel absurd. we can walk in our rooms without light because the structure of the room is in our memory and we can predict well which thing is where.it says, we all make a model of this world from our memory, experiences, and surroundings. We predict things and make decisions based on that model. most of things in our models are same but not everything. no one has a perfect model in their brains. what we call reality is based on that model. that’s why people give different weights to things because in one person’s model that thing is important but not in other’s model. This way the early years of someone’s life are the most important ones.if we completely understand how brain works, we will be able to replicate it and humanity will see new horizons.this is a review of this book, not my thoughts. my quest for how brain works will continue."
15,0805078533,http://goodreads.com/user/show/37979978-sarah-soderberg,3,"Jeff Hawkins is most commonly known for inventing one of the first handheld computer devices, the palm pilot, and founding the Redwood Center for Theoretical Neuroscience. Although he has expressed interest in artificial intelligence his whole life, he has also expressed a deep interest for Neuroscience as shown in his book On Intelligence. In this book he brings the ideas of artificial intelligence and neuroscience together to present his theory of how the brain processes information. Here are my thoughts on the book:The first point that Hawkins makes is that in order to create truly intelligent machines, we need to understand how the brain functions, and apply that to artificial intelligence. Although neuroscientists will never be able to fully understand how the brain functions, a general understanding of the brain will be enough to apply on artificial intelligence. He then presents the reader with his theory of how the cortex of the brain works. His theory is that the brain is essentially a series of hierarchical patterns that perceive information through the different senses. He claims that the senses all work together to make predictions, and therefore create patterns that we don’t even know. This part of the book (chapter 6) is very detailed and at times hard to understand because it’s all about Hawkins’s theory of how the cortex works. Hawkins builds on all of his ideas throughout the book, making each of them important to fully understand in order to understand the next section. A lot of the book is this written this way, where he explains very difficult specific details in a very general way. For example he says, “Second, a face can appear on the left side of your V1 or on the right side of your V1 and you would recognize it. But experiments clearly show that non adjacent patches of V1 are not directly connected; the left side of V1 can’t know directly what the right side is seeing” (Hawkins 121). Although this idea is pretty clear by itself, he continues to build on it until on it’s very hard to understand. He tries to put a lot of difficult ideas into a short amount of space, making it impossible to clearly explain every detail. Because he goes so in depth it takes a lot of thought to process the information. Although he doesn’t explain everything with a lot of detail, he does use a lot of effective analogies. For example, he uses the analogy of breaking a pen to show how the brain predicts from experience. If you broke a pen you would expect to see it break in half, and hear it snap. If you didn’t see/hear both of these things then your brain would know that something was wrong. These parts of the book are easier to understand and are quite interesting. Overall, some parts of the book were harder for me to understand because of my unfamiliarity with neuroscience, while other parts were more straightforward.Another point that Hawkins brings up is that intelligence is defined as consciously processing information, and using predictions to create patterns. Therefore, he concludes that humans animals, and essentially all living things are intelligent to a degree. Trees are intelligent in the sense that they pick up signals from their environment and send them to their roots, branches, and leaves to alter or change its state. The tree is making patterns, but is doing it automatically without knowingly processing it and is therefore not as intelligent as a human. What distinguishes plant intelligence from human intelligence is the idea that humans can interpret and process the different things we encounter. However, I find myself disagreeing with Hawkins definition of intelligence. Personally I think that intelligence is also defined by interpreting patterns and making predictions, but I think intelligence can be automatic like a plant. To me a plant is just as intelligent as a human because they both have to interpret their surroundings to alter their situation and make prediction based patterns. I understand the point Hawkins makes and his definition of intelligence, but I don’t think a plant is any less intelligent than a human. While reading the book, Hawkins also uses a lot of ideas and theories from other neuroscientists. However, most of the theories he disregards as false to make it seem like he is the only comprehensive neuroscientist. He is constantly stating why every other theory about the brain is wrong, and why he is correct. I understand that in order to create a theory you have to go against what others have said, but neuroscience is such an unknown topic that one cannot completely disregard all other theories. He is very credible and I don’t doubt that he completely understands what he is talking about; however, I wish he wouldn’t have disregarded so many other theories about neuroscience. Aside from the sometimes difficult language of the book, the book overall is very interesting and a good read. He does use a lot of analogies that are helpful, and has corresponding images throughout the book that help visualize what he is talking about. In the beginning he is very repetitive with his purpose, clearly explaining his question of how to join neuroscience with artificial intelligence. It’s very interesting to learn about how humans think, and learn how we make predictions that we don’t even realize. It’s exciting to relate to the book and connect what he’s saying to how we think. He finally concludes with the idea that building intelligent machines could possibly dangerous, but could benefit society greatly. We could create intelligent voice recognition devices (like siri) that could understand and interpret language. We could create machines that process information like the brain, but faster, with more capacity, and with sensory detections. Creating truly intelligent machines would completely change the outline of society for the better. Overall, I would recommend this book to anyone with a genuine interest in neuroscience and/or artificial intelligence. It is at times hard to understand but very interesting and mind-opening. Hawkins explores all aspects of human, plant, and artificial intelligence and brings it all together in one idea. "
16,0805078533,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7402577-dimitri-yatsenko,4,"Mr Hawkins' dream was to encapsulate a basic theory of intelligence in a straightforward plainly written book. Written with science writer Sandra Blakeslee, ""On Intelligence"" combines Mr Hawkins' motivational autobiography, a scientific treatise on natural and artificial intelligence, and a philosophical discussion delivered in a no-nonsense, unembellished, yet stimulating narrative.At its core, ""On Intelligence"" postulates that all higher cognitive functions are built on a single relatively simple algorithm replicated across the neocortex. This hypothetic ""basic cortical algorithm"" is described as a predictive autoassociative hierarchical network. Left to its own devices, such a neural network should spontaneously generate stable invariant representations of regularities in the environment giving birth to perception, behavior, thoughts, consciousness, and imagination. If we could only mimic Nature and build such a network in silicon, we should be able to make computers that learn, think, and imagine. Mr Hawkins admits that most of these ideas are not original and his contribution is to organize them into a coherent hypothetical framework.How credible is Mr Hawkins' hypothesis? How do we know the brain does this? How do we know that such an artificial model would exhibit animal-like intelligence? Mr Hawkins' answer is: be optimistic -- we are way overdue for some kind of a general theory of the brain. In a break from scientific form, Mr Hawkins does not seek out contradictory evidence. The autobiographical sections carries an air of a quixotic struggle against the errors and prejudices of the scientific and corporate establishments of the past and present, who lack the audacity to imagine that a comprehensive theory of intelligence could be within reach. In its more technical sections, the book identifies specific cortical structures responsible for these computations in rather computational than biological terms. No experimental evidence and no working computer models are described or reviewed critically. Instead, the key premises derive from introspection and personal interviews with authorities on the subject, e.g. ""I had spoken to several ... experts and asked them to explain..."" Mr Hawkins mixes experimentally supported findings with speculation and swiftly decides standing controversies without identifying them as such, leaving a casual reader with an exaggerated impression of how much is understood about cognition. In this way, the book often reads rather like marketing material for a specific approach than a thoroughly researched thesis presenting latest scientific findings.Every neuroscientist strives to intuit a fundamental principle behind the ocean of facts about the nervous system and every computer scientists dreams of creating systems that could develop intelligence. Yet Nature is slow to give up her recipes. By helping envision what the answers could be, ""On Intelligence"" stands to inspire the budding scientist and engineer with the confidence to probe into the most daunting natural phenomenon that is intelligence. And it is for its enthusiasm and inspiration that ""On Intelligence"" earns my four stars."

I really liked the way he addresses the topic of intelligence and what it really means to think about it in a non-linear way. If your going down this track of thought, On Intelligence sticks out. P. 51 For example, a framework of mechanistic development of systems where the location is the difference vs. modularizing in a way that does not really understand the flexibility created by nature via the brain. Brilliant if you're thinking at all of building systems. P. 69 The idea of the forgotten time element and what that means to visual and auditory inputs via the brain vs. what we are programming. Very insightful. P. 81 The way your brain differentiates important vs. unimportant in storage into long term memory (for example, memorizing a song by tonal modulation vs. perfect pitch) and the ability to recall even if the pitch differs. Really great observation.Lots of great stuff on pattern recognition and how to think of the brain as a pattern recognition machine. Some of his thoughts on speech recognition has come a long way as with a few other ways that people now think of AI. Still, great book for a beginner like me. "

It was writted by Jeff Hawkins, creator of the PalmPilot and Treo. Turns out Jeff's other passion is trying to understand how the brain works.This book lays out his theory of how the mind works in layman's terms. Hawkins premise is that the brain uses a ""memory-prediction"" framework to operate, and states that his model fills in a lot of holes in existing models of how the brain works. In other words, the brain store past experiences as patterns, and uses those patterns to predict how future events will occur. If future events differ from the predictions, the brain parses the new patterns and adjusts its predictions accordingly.The model is simple at heart, and makes a lot of sense to this layman. Hawkins' goal is to ultimately build computerized brains, and expresses disappointment at current efforts to do so. This book is a well thought-out argument that thumbs its nose at current thinking, and in my experience, this will only help in achieving Hawkins' ultimate goal of building a functioning brain."

22,0805078533,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5070927-paul,4,"This engaging, non(too)technical book offers a new and plausible theory of how the brain, or more specifically the neocortex, works.When I learned about the existence of this book, I was drawn to it for a number of reasons. For one thing, I'm intrigued by the faculty we call intelligence: what is it, exactly? For another, I, like the author Jeff Hawkins, have long been fascinated by the brain and how it works. And finally I was eager to read a book on neuroscience by a nonscientist, for Hawkins, inventor of the Palm Pilot and other things, is a technologist who has long pursued brain science as a hobby. I love the idea of contributions to knowledge being made by amateurs, for they seem best able to think outside the box.And thinking outside the box is what Hawkins has done here. His point of attack was to discover whether it is possible to build an ""intelligent machine,"" and how this might be done. He noted the relative unsatisfactoriness of the results achieved by ""artificial intelligence"" in the computing world, and wondered why this was. How was it that a computer, with processors executing millions of instructions per second, could not seem to remotely approach the prowess of the human brain at most tasks requiring ""intelligence,"" when the cells in that brain could only execute a few tens of ""instructions"" per second? Even relatively simple perceptual tasks, like recognizing faces and chairs, are done effortlessly and almost instantly by humans, while machines toil to achieve a success rate well below 100%. What have humans got that computers don't got?Humans have got a way of processing information that is completely different from the way computers process it. The brain, unlike a computer, does not run on the instructions of a single master program controlled from the top. The brain, says Hawkins, operates as a vast array of small, localized processing systems. In particular, the neocortex--that sheet of neurons that covers the upper frontal part of our brain, and is responsible for all of our human intelligence--is set up as an intricate, interconnected feedback system that can be boiled down to performing two functions: memory and prediction. He's saying that what we call intelligence is the interplay of memory and prediction.To defend and illustrate this thesis, he goes into some detail on exactly how he thinks the neocortex is wired up. It is known to consist of 6 layers of neurons, which are all interconnected in certain characteristic ways. Hawkins shows why they are so interconnected, and how this results in the formation of memories at increasingly high levels of abstraction. What we call intelligence is the recognition of a current sensory input as belonging to an abstract category already in memory. According to this view, animals that also possess neocortexes have this same intelligence, but in lower degree than humans, who have the most sophisticated neocortex (one interesting fact in the book was that dolphins, which are intelligent and also possess large brains, have a neocortex with only 3 layers, as opposed to the humans' 6).Hawkins makes his case very well; I found it persuasive. Where I found myself less persuaded was in what I would call the philosophical side of the book, where the author addresses questions such as, What is creativity? What is imagination? What is consciousness? And, of course, the basic question: what is intelligence itself? I think that Hawkins, an extremely able technologist and even scientist, overplays his hand as a philosopher.Along the way, for example, he talks about Plato's theory of forms as an explanation of how we are able to recognize sameness in the hurly-burly of our ever-shifting sensations. Hawkins notes offhand, ""His system of explanation was wildly off the mark."" Well, maybe it was and maybe it wasn't, but what makes Hawkins so sure? I recall that Roger Penrose, in chapter 1 of his Road To Reality, treats the world of mathematical truth as one part of a Platonic world of forms, seemingly real but also different from the worlds of mental experience and of physical things. My point here is just that Plato's ideas live on; they'll keep climbing back out of the dustbin of history.I had similar feelings about Hawkins's take on the other philosophical questions. He contends that there the difference between the intelligence of, say, a rat and of a human is purely one of degree. But Mortimer J. Adler, in his book Intellect: Mind over Matter, contends the opposite. According to him, intellect--which was the word formerly used to label the faculties that we now point to with the word intelligence--is something more than the rudimentary power of abstraction used by brutes. In this view, animals are able to respond to individually differing things in the same way, as when a rat is able to press different triangular buttons to get food, but this is not the same thing ascognizing what is common to them or knowing them in their universal aspects. . . . By means of concepts, and only by means of concepts, we understand kinds or classes as such entirely apart from perceived particulars and even though no particular instances exist.Adler argues that the brain is a necessary but not a sufficient condition of the human intellect. The existence of the intellect, he thinks, is a sign that a human being is something more than just a body.Is Adler right in this? I don't know. And I don't think Jeff Hawkins knows either, no matter how confident he is in his assertions. But for someone who wants to build intelligent machines, I think a cautious outlook would be fitting. Hawkins dismisses people's worries that superintelligent machines might become our overlords or our executioners, like HAL in 2001: A Space Odyssey or the Skynet computers in the Terminator movies. He thinks that such behavior would require the presence of the equivalent of the emotional centers of the brain in addition to the neocortex, and he's only planning to build an analog of the neocortex. So don't worry, folks.I recall reading a comment from the Dalai Lama, apparently changing his mind about whether robots or machines could become sentient. He said that if some being had the necessary karma to take birth or manifestation in a machine, then that would happen. I note that karma is not a word that occurs in the index of Hawkins' book.But this is a good, clear, strongly argued, plainspoken, provocative, and, yes, intelligent book. Hawkins has persuaded me that ""intelligent"" machines are very likely in our near future. And I'm sure they will be very helpful and will have no reason to do anything mean to us, their intellectual inferiors.If they do turn on us, then, well, maybe God will help us."

25,0805078533,http://goodreads.com/user/show/38042296-nizar-hadeli,5,"Nizar Hadeli12/14/14Book Review: On Intelligence	The book, On Intelligence, is an informative text on the physiology and psychology of the brain, and a philosophical discussion about the use of intelligence in machines and its possible effects in the future. This book is written by Jeff Hawkins with help from Sandra Blakeslee, but it is mainly centered on Hawkins and his knowledge and opinions. Hawkins is an electrical engineer with a degree from Cornell. Hawkins worked at Intel, helping with the creation of the microprocessor, the PalmPilot, the Treo smartphone, and several other devices. After his success in the engineering industry, he left engineering to become a neuroscientist after reading an issue of Scientific American that detailed the mechanisms and physiology of the brain and mind. The book starts by explaining why prior attempts at creating artificial attempts failed, and it then introduces Hawkins’ opinion on the memory-prediction framework. He then explains how the brain implements this framework, social ramifications of artificial intelligence, and a final discussion of intelligent machines and how they may shape our future. Hawkins’ main theory is that through the different hierarchical regions of the brain, the brain memorizes different sensory input sequences to constantly predict the future, and that this framework can be used on machines to create intelligent machines. While this sounds confusing, Hawkins finds a way to explain this in a simple and elegant manner.	Probably the most satisfactory part of this book is how Hawkins explains these complex topics. In the epilogue of this book, Hawkins says, “With this book, I hope to entice young engineers and scientists to study the cortex, adopt the memory-prediction framework, and build intelligent machines” (Hawkins 234-235). Since Hawkins’ main audience is young readers, the bulk of this text is used to explain these complex topics in the simplest terms possible. To ensure the audience’s understanding of this book, Hawkins uses a series of anecdotes, theoretical examples, and connections to give the readers an idea of what he is saying. While talking about the predictive-memory framework and its impact on understanding, Hawkins uses an example of him and is wife saying, “To predict what my wife will say when she sees me, I must know what she has said in the past, that today is Friday, that the recycling bin has to be put on the curb on Friday nights, that I didn’t do it on time last week, and that her face has a certain look”, showing us how prediction impacts understanding through a real life example. Besides personal examples, Hawkins uses exercises, visuals, connections to music, and several other tactics. Through these tactics, the audience gains an enhanced knowledge of the physiology and psychology of the brain, allowing the audience to create logical opinions on Hawkins’ theory. Since the main point of the book is to get young readers to understand and implement the memory-prediction theory on machines, this book is successful in giving the audience the information needed to pursue these actions while enticing them to do so with fervor. So while it can be long and drawn out at times, it is an interesting and informative book that is recommendable to anyone looking to learn about the brain or the philosophical inquiries that come with intelligence.	While the majority of this book was made for explaining how the brain works, the nitty gritty comes with the discussion of the social implications of artificial intelligence. Hawkins starts by explaining the technological advances needed to suffice artificial intelligence, and he then transitions into talking about how artificial intelligence could fit into our future. Hawkins is extremely insightful in explaining the social ramifications of intelligent machines. He even brings up pop culture with movies like The Terminator and A Space Odyssey. He explains that artificial intelligence can be created without human emotion, taking away the possibility of evil machines, and he even gives examples of possible machines that can be improved through intelligence. Hawkins even makes the reader pose their own questions about the ethics of artificial intelligence. Do we want to have machines with intelligence? If these machines become more human, what will happen to us? If these machines experience human behavior, should we trust them with large responsibilities and power? Some readers may disagree completely with the possibility of artificial intelligence while others stand behind Hawkins’ theory wholeheartedly, either way, Hawkins gives the necessary information needed to allow the readers to create these opinions, which is not present in most books today. Even relatively unbiased books like history textbooks usually don’t give the reader an array of opinions to view, which makes this book so good to read. Because of this, Hawkins truly does a good job in bringing the reader into the discussion, and overall, he does a great job in creating a book that allows the reader to choose their own side and opinion. With all of this in mind, this book is an interesting, informative, and relatively impartial book that is successful in entertaining and informing the reader about the brain, and the steps needed to make this theory into a reality."

Yes, this book will be a lot of review if you come from a neuroscience background, but I still found that I was being introduced to new concepts that really rang true. For example, I liked how he described intelligence as being about making accurate predictions. His description of the feedback loops found in the brain circuitry as existing to facilitate prediction-checking really made a lot of sense and is a great foundation for building intelligent machines. If I were a neuroscience or AI professor, I would add this audiobook as required listening to my curriculum. His call to action at the end of the book to become an AI entrepreneur was particularly meaningful to me. I'm surprised this was published over a decade ago; it is still very relevant today.

31,0805078533,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2599825-josh-giunta,5,"Jeff Hawkins' theories about the brain are genius...this video below outlines the main premises for his brain theories:http://www.ted.com/talks/jeff_hawkins... Synopsis of the book:  In a nutshell, his theory claims that the evolutionarily unique intelligence of our species can be attributed to the advanced functioning of our neo-cortex. This part of our brain offers a unique memory system of our experiences. The neo-cortex is like a giant file cabinet of all of our previous experiences.... in a sense, it analyzes the input arriving from our 5 senses and compares them with the memorized experiences, allowing one to make predictions about one's environment. This process can inform one to make intelligent decisions based upon the memorized experiences and thoughts related to it.   My Thoughts: Jeff's theory got me thinking about the nature of learning itself. If the neocortex is constantly ""playing back"" recalled information into your consciousness, then this in itself prevents one from truly experiencing the new input of one's surroundings, as it actually is. Instead of observing the actual surroundings, one may instead be devoting energy to observing the memorized information about the surrounding. If you have been to a particular grocery store 50 times in the past, the neo-cortex will essentially convince your consciousness that the experience is far from a new one. In doing so, it projects 'old' and 'previously learned' information into your consciousness, thus tranquilizing the power and attentiveness of the senses. This induces the ""same ol' same ol'"" feeling that we are all familiar with. But, when the senses experience 'something new', such as a new grocery store (or something more significant, such as visiting India for the first time), learning itself is kicked into high gear, because the neo-cortex does not have an exact point of reference. The senses become heightened, and learning occurs at a more accelerated rate.  When the neocortex 'does its job' this occupies a good deal of mental energy and conscious 'real-estate' within our minds. The neocortex is obviously essential to our nature and our survival, but if we understand how it operates within our minds, then perhaps we can learn for more hours in the day. Children are so captivated with the world partially because their neo-cortex does not have enough 'reference points' to offer the consciousness. Therefore it is relatively quite and children seemingly are learning round the clock, growing and understanding at a rate that makes us adults jealous.  At an age somewhere between 8-14 this rate of learning seems to change. Around that age, we seemingly no longer have the ability to learn 3 languages simultaneously, for example. But why? Perhaps it is because around this age, the neo-cortex matures and starts feeding the mind its predictions.  What if adults contain the capacity to control the neocortex's function for periods of time in order to learn with the vigor that our minds are capable, as proven by childhood learning? I believe this is something that is exercised regularly. Perhaps this is the scientific explanation for mystical states of being, as illustrated by Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi with his theory of ""Flow,"" the timeless immersion in an activity often exemplified by athletes, musicians, meditators, and children.  It is important to examine the affects of meditation on the mind. Perhaps the scientific explanation of meditation involves the neo-cortex. Perhaps over time, meditation allows the meditator to use the functions of the neocortex at his/her discretion. I believe this is the explanation for 'being in the moment' and the concept of 'oneness.' Meditation may inhibit the neocortex from replaying the information it has obtained over time, therefore illuminating the senses, making observation and learning a constant.   "
32,0805078533,http://goodreads.com/user/show/17522753-pohsuan-huang,5," insightful, inspiring, scientifically supported piece of technical writing, which however more thrilling than sci-fi to me. Easy to understand for general public, straightforward writing style saves your time on understanding what exactly is intelligence.  Jeff Hawkins's work points right to the question “ How does brain work? ” As an engineer, he tackle with this one of the most crucial questions of humanity with great scientific scrutiny and incomparable enthusiasm that stems from his childlike curiosity. Consulted his neuroscientists colleagues in Redwood Institute, Berkeley, this book combines latest scientific findings, his engineering ingeniousness, and a his audacious ambitions in reaching this high hanging fruit of academia, he proposed a “theory of brain” that delineates how under the superficial complex and complicated nature of brains, its characteristic functions can actually be reproduced by a hierarchy of multi-layered neuron columns and some simple neuron-mimicking rules. In the eyes of a physicist, this book has quite an impact on physics amongst other fields like artificial intelligence, neuroscience, or other networks systems related fields. In the physicists' study of “complex systems”, an assembly of unit agents interact with each other with common known rules, which however exhibit unpredicted “emergent” collective behaviors that cannot be reduced to the rules known on agent level. These networks systems shares some common properties: non-linear feedback iterations, emergent phenomenon, memory of previous states( hysteresis), and cascading phase transitions. Neuronal networks are believed to be such kind of systems, aside form other complex systems like electrical grid, birds flock, spin ice, or certain bacteria.  Not sure if Jeff Hawkins has ever heard of complex systems, but his model of neocortex actually matches every requirements of it, and he himself understand the meaning of cascade in such a network- strengthen memories and improve predictions. He omitted in his theory some unimportant details of neocortex, including all neuron firing patterns (EPSP, FS,LS, etc.), cell morphology (pyramidal, granular cell, etc.) ,which are regarded essential to most neuroscientists, while reserves some general principles like sparse encoding, Hebbien learning, whose importance might be underestimated. These reserved traits are consistent with what physicists believed: The emergent phenomenon has nothing to do with the microscopic detail of unit agents (neuron), but with interactions and interrelationships between them. Jeff Hawkins's model give me a hint that maybe Hebbien learning and sparse encoding are not exclusive traits of neuronal networks, but a universal property of complex system.  His book also astounded me by demonstrate how memory of states can be stored and retrieved in a neuromorphic network system and can even make prediction by summing up the system's “experience”. His HTM algorithm (Hierarchical-Temporal Model) is not only an ingenious invention of applicable value, but actually a simplified realistic (roughly speaking) model of neocortex, which is pioneering in theoretical neuroscience. It links between the neurological facts in cellular scale to psychophysical knowledge we have in cognitive scale and give us a more integrated picture of “how brains work”. This book can be seen as a indication that to what extend we can achieve in this century understanding our brain. Also, it also shed some light on the ultimate pursuit of all nature philosophers- the mind-body dichotomy problems in the last few chapters. This book inspires me on my understanding of consciousness and free will tremendously. Maybe physicalism and idealism are not contradictory, it is just brains' complexity that hinders us to get the unitary picture after all. The more I know about myself, the more meaning and thus true happiness I find in my life.This book is beyond the category of a technical book introducing brain, it actually answers a part of my doubts towards life. Really glad to have such a book that suffice two purposes at one time.A wonderful, enjoyable reading experience that worth guaranteed solid five stars in my opinion.  "
33,0805078533,http://goodreads.com/user/show/9767799-anagh,5,"On Intelligence is a telling reminder that there is as much role for theoretical ideation as is for experimental inquiry in the field of neuroscience. At a time when any concrete 'universal' theories of the brain are elusive, books like these bring fresh perspectives through the sheer boldness of their hypothesis. So this then is intelligence. Intelligence, as understood in context of the brain, stems from an ability to glean information from the inherent statistics of the natural world at various levels of abstraction in order to make better forecasts about future events. In plain English, nature has certain hidden regularities and the job of any brain is to unearth those regularities in the interest of survival. Hawkins identifies the Neocortex as the spring from which intelligence gushes forth.The tantalising take home message of the book is that, essentially, the cortex is running a common algorithm across all sensory modalities. That is to say that there is no fundamental difference in the cortical processing that goes into visual perception and other forms of perception like auditory or somatosensory(touch) perception. All sensory modalities are fed by the same back-end algorithm and if I were to tweak the appropriate inputs, I could use the visual cortex to ""perceive""sound. Much of these insights are built on the pioneering work of Vernon Mountcastle. It's easy to fathom that the implications of this assertion on AI are humongous.At the centre of this framework is the cortical column, which, in Hawkins’s understanding, is the fundamental unit of computation. The book goes at length to lay down the blueprint for such an algorithm. Hawkins dedicates a substantial portion of the book proffering testable hypothesis aimed at, in the Popperian tradition, disproving his theory.In line with his memory-prediction framework, Hawkins identifies certain key aspects of memory organization. Firstly, as experience will testify, memory comes in sequences of patterns. The memories of an event, specially those events that have an inherent temporal structure, say for example a song, are never recalled at random but are always organized in the same order as the original stimulus. In that sense, there is no such thing as a random recall. Secondly, memory has the curious property of invariant representation. The memory of a face, for example, is independent of the exact low-level details present at the time of initial stimulus. The memory of the face of your mother is invariant if I change its orientation by a few degrees or present it to you in different lighting conditions. Similarly the memory of a song remains the same if instead of the studio recording, I present the live version to you. Thirdly, memory has the interesting property that presenting even a small part of it unleashes a cascade of activity that results in the completion of the entire memory. For example, even a brief presentation of a song snippet causes you to retrieve the entire song involuntarily. Hawkins devotes much real estate to describe possible models of cortical architecture that account for the salient features of memory though a thorough reading might be required for understanding the nitty-gritty.Along the way, Hawkins dispels naive notions of what truly intelligent AI would mean. Think prediction systems for weather, stock markets etc. and driver less cars instead of the emotionally labile humanoids as envisioned by popular science fiction.A new wave of neural network research, buoyed by concurrent progress in neuroscience, is currently sweeping academia and industry with renewed promises of “truly intelligent” systems. These calls are all too familiar to historians of AI who will point to a chequered past, replete with instances of promising avenues that lead to dead ends. Its as if the AI revolution is destined to occur in fits and starts. "

36,0805078533,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6857911-ryan,5,"If, like me, you're a software developer with an interest in true artificial intelligence, this is a very stimulating book. Hawkins applies his own engineer's mind to an effort to discern and describe the human brain's underlying ""cortical algorithm"", the means by which intelligence ""works"". As Hawkins sees it, the neuroscience community has been too focused on the minutae of how neurons function, without giving adequate consideration to the brain's overall learning and decision-making architecture, while the computer science community has been too absorbed in traditional symbolic and procedural computation methods, ignoring insights that might be gleaned from studying the most powerful problem-solving system in nature. Of course, it's untrue that neuroscientists and comp-sci academics aren't interested in each other's disciplines, but the crossover is still a long way from mainstream. For coders working in industry (like me), Hawkin's thoughts may be revelatory.The author focuses most of his attention on the cortex, the most recently evolved part of the human brain, and the one responsible for many functions of higher intelligence. His speculation is that this system uses the same generalized learning/prediction algorithm throughout, with little difference in how input from vision, hearing, touch, and other senses are processed. All this data is just sequences of patterns that the cortex filters through its multilayered hierarchy, each layer discerning trends in the input from lower layers, and forming models of the world.This may sound like the traditional AI concept of ""neural networks"", but Hawkins breaks from that model with his view that the cortex uses massive amounts of feedback from higher, more time-invariant layers (which view the world more abstractly) to lower, more time-variant layers (which deal with more concrete experience), activating many context switches. He sees the cortex as a blank slate upon birth, which follows relatively simple programming to accumulate and categorizes knowledge. As our minds form, we find ourselves experiencing the world less through our sensory input, and more through our pre-formed models. Only when there is conflict between those models and our input sequences, is our conscious attention drawn to our senses.In terms of biological neuroscience, this is all probably overly simplistic and not completely accurate (Hawkins doesn't give a lot of attention to the older, more instinctive parts of the brain), but if he's even partly right, his ideas have huge implications for artificial intelligence. If much our human intelligence really does boil down to a generalized memory-prediction algorithm -- one that may be complex, but not beyond our understanding -- the effects on the future will be astounding. Even if Hawkins wasn't able to prove his claims, they're fascinating to contemplate, and the next few decades will certainly shed a lot of light on their truth.If this book speaks to you, consider also reading Marvin Minsky's A Society of Minds, which contains a lot of complementary ideas."

But I had it here and decided to tackle it. Jeff Hawkins is the guy who invented Graffiti (the software for handwriting recognition that was used on the Palm Pilot and also on the Handspring) but he has also had a real interest in human intelligence. So he started his career as a programmer - but as he thought about it the way we build computers is not the way the brain works. He tried at one point to get into a couple of doctoral programs in areas related to biology or AI but was rejected because his thinking and theirs did not coincide. He now runs a foundation to continue to think about the issues raised in the book.I am not a science guy although I am interested in understanding how the brain works. This book tested my limits but in such a way that it offered some challenging concepts that any dedicated reader could get through. There are a couple of basic premises of the book. First, intelligence is not about behavior. AI is based on mimicking behaviors and that seems to be a false path to understanding intelligence. He also is critical of research on neural networks - which create redundant mechanisms to solve problems.His fundamental thought in the book is that intelligence is about predictive abilities and the book goes into some significant detail about the human cortex and also about how it functions in all of its layers. And how with a series of functions it is able to offer predictions of what is likely to happen next. Humans have an amazing amount of neurons in their brains (trillions). Somehow all those interact in a way that allows us to try to order our universes.I am not going to go into the depth of his theory except to say that I found the arguments to be well stated. The senses seem to be able to interact in odd and curious ways. That seems to be a function of the layers in the cortex but also how they interact.What I will say is two more things. First, Hawkins is very open to having his theory (that intelligence is ultimately about the ability to predict outcomes) challenged. Indeed, at the end of the book he offers ten testable hypotheses. Second, he put up a website which seems to have a wealth of information about how his theory is developing. (http://www.onintelligence.org/index.php) "

I certainly think so).Instead of a formal review, here is the text of the email I just sent the author:Dear Mr. Hawkins,Very quickly into your book I came to the novel realization that I was reading a work that will, in 50 years or sooner, ascend to its rightful position amongst the hallowed likes of Darwin's ‘Origin of Species', Newton's 'Principia', Smith's 'Wealth of Nations’, etc. What perhaps surprised me most was that your book was published 13 years ago, and yet I had been unaware of it. After devouring it, I believe I understand why.I've been monitoring AI development as an IT professional since the 80s, and I grok the perennial joke that (regardless of the date) “AI is just 10 years away"". Your book has shown me why, and remarkably how that gulf will ultimately close. Now, I am zealously recommending ‘On Intelligence’ to everyone capable of appreciating it.From a brief web review, it appears that you're very busily working to refine and manifest your brilliant insights. For that I applaud you, and I’m sure it keeps you exceptionally busy; but even so… I've two (rhetorical) questions for you: Why have you not published any subsequent editions? Are you considering doing so?I implore you to revitalize your wonderful book, in that doing so you will accelerate your inevitable and profoundly positive effects on humanity and the world. Mr. Hawkins, your ideas MUST be spread further, faster, and with exponentially greater impact. I believe a revised version of 'On Intelligence' could perhaps be the most effective vector towards these ends. Meanwhile, I shall continue promoting 'On Intelligence' in its extant form, as it remains phenomenal, and for that you have my highest kudos and congratulations.I am humbly and sincerely yours,Christopher B. GeorgenSan Jose, CaliforniaJanuary 27, 2018 PS: Please note that I have NEVER before written to an author, as I respect the privacy of famous persons too highly. The number of books I've read is in the (low) four figures, certainly not to brag, but just to place this missive in its proper context. This is how moved I am by your brilliant book. Thank you again."
39,0805078533,http://goodreads.com/user/show/15710879-jordan-lewis,5,"I have plenty of praise for this book, but most important is its accessibility. Apart from necessary jargon, Hawkins speaks in layman's terms and is willing to crack a joke at the right time. That said, the author takes his work seriously, and is determined to get his readers prepared to understand the results of his neuroscience research. For that reason, On Intelligence isn't light reading. That the book taught me a great deal about intelligence while rarely requiring me to look up information or reread any part of the book is a testament to Hawkins' organization and hard work.Any clarification of physical processes taking place in the brain is balanced with examples and analogies. I believe that someone can pick up On Intelligence knowing nothing about the brain (I knew very little), and within 100 pages be able to explain how the brain identifies sensory patterns, creates spontaneous order, leverages memory, and informs better and better predictions about the world around us.As the inventor of the PalmPilot, Hawkins has a consistent hypothesis that grounds his research: understanding the algorithms that produce intelligence in the brain will guide us to develop more intelligent machines. The author's bold claim (that most neuroscientists, AI researchers, and software engineers have been misguided, trying to build a better, faster brain rather than develop top-down theories on the root of intelligence) is well-argued, and just as accessible as the rest of his book.I don't believe Hawkins' work is the definitive view of intelligence; no doubt there are experienced researchers with competing theories. The author spent limited time developing his own rigorous experiments, instead preferring to apply deductive reasoning using the limited intelligence research available. To me, Hawkins succeeds more as a explainer than an expert.At the least, On Intelligence is a great book for thinkers and dabblers. At the most, it is a powerful springboard to greater knowledge. I can't wait to read more on the topic."
40,0805078533,http://goodreads.com/user/show/61461058-march-slashcheva,5,"Although published in 2004, this book still gives many insights on how information flows through the brain and how perception arises. Nowadays, when scientific news are full of breakthroughs achieved by AI and machine learning algorithms, that`s exactly the moment to ask - how far this algorithms from the actual work of the brain? Does it need to imitate brain at all in order to achieve the same level of object recognition and sophistication as humans have? According to the book, the main feature of the brain - it is not the complex behavior, imagination or learning capabilities, but memory and ability to make predictions consistent with the memory, and then, change behavior if needed. Many species have quite developed memory, and also do some kind of predictions - no doubts, it`s beneficial from evolutionary perspective, but, in addition to the huge volume of this memory, humans have completely different type of connections in the brain. Motor system is under the control of cortex, unlike the animals, where movements are controlled by the older parts of the brain. Unique layered structure of the cerebral cortex allows immediately detect all changes across the visual field and keep the principal object of perception stable at the same time. Such representation called “invariant” and provided by the hierarchical structure of cortex, which is true for each region of cortex - visual, auditory or motor. Authors also points out how feedback on each level is important as it sends back information about if prediction was correct or not. While many neuroscientists study something deeply focused and narrowed about the brain, the problem of consciousness and intelligent will not be clarified without attempts to summarize everything we know about how the cortex works. It doesn`t make sense to study how vision or sensory perception works separately, but essentially to figure out what is in common between them while processing through the cortex. So the biggest challenge of intelligence is to unravel the intelligence by itself. "
41,0805078533,http://goodreads.com/user/show/35970992-manuel-alfonseca,3,"This book offers what the author considers a revolutionary framework to understand the workings of the brain. Unfortunately, the author gets carried by his own enthusiasm for his pet theory, to the point that he speaks as though all his ideas, suggestions and suppositions were facts, and sometimes it's difficult for the reader to notice the difference. One must read the appendix with proposals of experimental confirmation / refutation, to see clearly that most of the ideas in the book are actually unsupported suggestions.The author correctly states that our knowledge about the brain is very scanty. However, this does not make him doubt his belief that strong artificial intelligence is possible and impending. Nothing in the book made me change my opinion that this is not as likely as Jeff Hawkins and Ray Kurzweil find it.On top of this, in the beginning of the book and in his discussion on conscience, the author makes a confession of materialistic faith that taints a supposedly scientific book. I have written on this in more length in my blog:http://divulciencia.blogspot.com/2015...http://populscience.blogspot.com/2015... Finally, in his discussion on conscience, Hawkins mistakes two different meanings of the word: I am conscious of myself and I am conscious of seeing you. His thought experiment to prove that conscience is just declarative memory is taking the word conscience in its second acceptation, while we were supposed to be speaking about the first. This is an example of the straw man fallacy, as his materialistic declaration is an example of the begging the question fallacy. I wonder why materialists fall so frequently in logical fallacies. Perhaps because their knowledge of logic is very scanty?"
42,0805078533,http://goodreads.com/user/show/26735165-jess-hollmeier,5,Even for a complete noon like me this was a fantastic read and I learned so much about how our brain works and understand the 'struggle' with AI so much better now. I wish he would write a follow up as this one is already more then 10 years old...
43,0805078533,http://goodreads.com/user/show/29141033-wersly,4,"Best of this book: the chapter where Hawkins lays down his theory of cortical function and expands on its implications. Really thought provoking stuff; he's got a way of extrapolating and coming to big, far reaching conclusions from the nitty-gritty of cortical wiring and structure. This is largely due to Hawkins attaching an overarching 'theory of intelligence' to his descriptions and illustrations of cortical organization. I find this perspective much needed given the current state of science education. An example: Hawkins reiterates everything regarding cortical structure I learned in my first college neuroscience class; however, where my course dove into the specifics and failed to provide any big 'aha!' explanations, Hawkins comes through in his theoretical perspective.Some drawbacks of this book: the chapter on memory is awful. Hawkins fails to sketch any of the actual machinery that drives memory, and instead puts together a whole sloppy chapter of horribly dull Malcolm Gladwell-esque anecdotes about remembering things. Given how wonderfully detailed he gets in his cortex chapters, this was pretty disappointing. Additionally, Hawkins' tone in the earlier chapters is pretty funny: in his writing about how he was rejected from both MIT and IBM, he comes off sounding as a pompous late-teenage hackathon reject (""I'm too good for them anyway!""). That is, his writing is a bit egocentric, and he likes to draw examples from his own life and discuss his achievements. This doesn't really bother me - if anything, I see it as a keen insight into Silicon Valley start-up science - but it could be a turn-off for those that like their science writing 'objective.'Really cool book."
44,0805078533,http://goodreads.com/user/show/26674095-gy,5,"If to put it short, Palm Pilot-inventor Jeff Hawkins book explains his memory-prediction framework theory of the brain and describes some of its consequences.Well, that's makes sense to me, as I've learned from professor Wang in my first lectures of neuroscience: ""Brain is just a surviving organ..."".Sure, but there is always the Homunculus, that little bastard that is preventing us to perceive our realm directly, straightforwardly. Every time we turn to study ourselves we get into mess with that little guy, who interferes with us,...with us, with the real owner of our body and we found ourselves trapped with lost framework, with no philosophical background that would support our theories.To comprehend Mr. Hawkins theory, the reader must accept what Mr. Thomas Metzinger believes strongly that it is possible to solve the philosophical puzzle of consciousness only if we come to understand that to the best of our current knowledge there is no thing, no indivisible entity that is us, neither in the brain nor in some metaphysical realm beyond this world.So, to enjoy and understand this book, start with eliminating the ""Homunculus"", accept that the voice and dialog occurring in our heads is normal communication between brain modules that competes for the action of the body to keep us alive, and join Mr. Hawkins in trip into unknown of neurobiology and neuroscience generally. To comprehend intelligence and AI, one must acquire proper framework, and learn about the brain and entire nervous system thoroughly. From point of view of AI however, one vital part of the brain is essential to fully comprehend- the Cortex! This is the trip that will lead you deep into the 6-layered magic cover that is making us exactly what we are. Have a nice trip! "
45,0805078533,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4705307-miguel-duarte,5,"This is a fascinating book. If you are interested in the topic of human and artificial intelligence, please do yourself a favor and read it. This books aims at describing a unified theory of how the brain works and intelligence arises. Jeff Hawkins developed a a passion for the brain quite early in his career, and has obsessed over it ever since. He starts the book by explaining that although there are thousands of people studying the brain, there is no unified theory of how it works as a whole. Many little details have been unraveled, but scientists remain clueless of how it all comes together. He looked at the problem the other way around by creating a model of how the brain works that not only fits all these small pieces, but it also explains other things that we didn't understand before.At first I was a little taken aback because I felt Jeff Hawkins' writing was quite pretentious: here's a guy saying that everyone else is wrong and that he has the answer to everything. I gave him a chance, and I'm glad I did. The theory is supported by state of the art research (or at least it was at the time of publishing), and there are a lot of ""holy ****, it makes so much sense"" moments. I can guarantee that this book will change the way you think about yourself and how your brain works.As an AI researcher and sci-fi lover myself, I can't help but identify with Jeff's goals of designing truly intelligent machines. I give him credit for thinking about the problem differently, and coming up with a very compelling theory. Only time will tell if he was right, but I'm certainly rooting for him."
46,0805078533,http://goodreads.com/user/show/33538535-cinnamon-toast-read-matt,5,"A fascinating new framework on a theory of the neocortex, otherwise labelled a theory of intelligence. Although the complexity of the human brain seems insurmountable even with current technology, Hawkins makes a very compelling hypothesis about how intelligence operates. The most significant revelation is that how we've been likening intelligence to machines, or more recently computers, is essentially dead wrong. We don't compute, we remember. We don't process, we predict.Although the framework is just a set of hypotheses at this point, they are a fresh enough look on their own to scream for experimental verification. I found the framework compelling enough that I almost kind of believe it, until I hear something better.The section on 'Building Intelligent Machines' is very short, be warned there. This is not a book about AI, but it's a great book to make you ponder about intelligence in general. Hawkins is right on one count: we should better understand biological intelligence (the only source we know of) before we go ahead and try building artificial intelligence.This book stands in stark contrast to the opinions of some other futurists like Ray Kurzweil, who practically believes fast enough CPUs will be enough to open-and-shut the case for human and superhuman level AI. According to this new framework, no, all the CPU cores in the world will never make a computer intelligent.Not unless machines are designed to truly remember patterns, to predict future patterns, to build their own model of the universe (whatever universe that may be), and to truly understand."

It's a journey through the anatomy and functionality of the human brain exploring many things we take for granted like hearing, seeing and thinking.Armies of scientists working on AI for decades have not come close to doing what an average human simpleton does effortlessly, but the problem could be in the lack of a novel theoretical framework which, once discovered, could unlock a series of discoveries similar to what Einstein unlocked with his relativity theory.As Einstein started from the simple assumption that speed of life is constant and brained his way through the rest of the story till he reached the famous E=MC2, we could achieve something similar in neuroscience by starting from some simple premises about our brains, namely: (1) the brain is composed of similar but highly connected computational structures(2) The brain is organized in hierarchies of low level soldiers that identifies and anticipates an auditory or visual sequence or executes a motion sequence (3) The brain is a memory-prediction machines, i.e., a system whose sole purpose is to match the relentless flow of sensory data to predictions about the future using stored memories. As my brain was busy thinking about its inner structure, throughout the book, I had the feeling that I want to flip my eyes inwards and look inside my frontal loop :)Highly recommended for my computer science geeks out there"
48,0805078533,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1562421-don-skotch-vail,4,"The adrenaline ran through my veins as I read this book, because I loved it so much. I think he is onto something, although I suspect he got some of the details wrong. When I tried to map out what he was describing, somethings didn't look like they would pan out. E.g. ""names"" flowing up and down the cortical regions were very vague, and how they could still be static names while getting less specific at each region was confusing to me.He doesn't do a great job of describing how he think the cortex works, although he tries. Apparently, you can download the software for from his company's website so I guess only high level details matter for the book. He says it takes about a year to get good at it. He is pro-Chinese Room experiment. I was annoyed that he takes Searle's side that computers will never be able to simulate intelligence / consicousness, and yet his company creates software using his proposal that is intended to simulate visual intelligence. Basically he says here are the data structures involved in the cortex, and that is most of everything that is needed for intelligence, but you just won't be able to simulate or implement these in the computer. You'll need a new device that is not a computer. Then he goes off and simulates it on a computer. I wonder how the rationalizes this contradiction. "
49,0805078533,http://goodreads.com/user/show/8537957-mikal,3,"Hawkins book highlights how difficult it is to make predictions in areas of deep experience. Fundamentally the cortex theory is clearly presented but belabored. Sadly, Hawkins makes no efforts to cite or reference sources, leaving the reader to trust Hawkins at his word or do due diligence on their own to review the neuroscience community's perspective of his work. On Intelligence has two major goals: define intelligent machines and the roll of intelligence machines in future society and to define the cortex and how it works as a foundation for building intelligent machines that replicates them.Hawkins does an above average job at both, which ultimately hinders his goal. He spends too much time describing the hierarchy of the cortical region (with too few diagrams) and too little time proving his basis of the feasibility of intelligent machines- and further supporting his blanket statements that intelligent machines are net positives and not a genuine threat to our society.But the reality is the cortex learns false patterns and does not do a great job at many types of reasoning, Hawkins does little to explain how a machine built on the model of our biology will overcome our logical fallacies.Here we are ten years after the book was written and the impact and echoes of the perspective appear to have gone cold."
50,0805078533,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2436371-dennis-littrell,5,"The brain as a ""pattern device"" that works through memory""Prediction is not just one of the things your brain does. It is the primary function of the neocortex, and the foundation of intelligence."" (p. 89)Perhaps the crux of Hawkins's insight into how our brains work and how that is different from how computers work can be gleaned from considering how to catch a ball in flight.It used to be thought that such tasks were solved by the brain through calculation. The brain would calculate the flight of the ball, adjusting the muscles of the body appropriately so as to arrive at a spot where the ball would be and grab it. Artificial intelligence people working on robots used this method and found out that it was enormously complex, so much so that the robots remained clumsy (and not about to play centerfield for the New York Yankees).What Hawkins is saying is that the brain does NOT calculate the flight of the ball but instead recalls from memory similar flights of balls while at the same time recalling again from memory the muscular workings of the body as it went after and caught or did not catch similar balls in flight. After a bit of practice (storing memories) a person can get very good at catching balls.In other words the brain predicts where the ball is going to be not through a laborious and lengthy calculation but through memories of similar events. This is a startling insight. Hawkins shows how everything we do is based on our brain's ability to predict events based on previous experience. Here's how it works:First there is a ""sequence of patterns"" of past events stored in the brain.Second, the brain has an ""auto-associative mechanism"" that allows it to ""recall complete patterns when given only partial or distorted inputs."" (p. 73) Unlike computer intelligence, human intelligence can figure out that ""Wass up?"" means the same thing as ""What's up?"" or that a face seen from one angle is the same as that face seen from another angle or even seen in some sort of distortion. This is something computers cannot reliably do.Third, the brain stores ""invariant representations"" of things seen, heard, felt, etc. ""Invariant"" in this context means unaffected by differences in light or tone or inflection or background or any one of millions of small, inessential differences that could throw us off. These representations are not exact. They are in a way like Plato's ideal forms except they are not ideal but generalized. They are memories of the relationships between and among various features. In the case of a human face, Hawkins writes that what makes a face recognizable ""are its relative dimensions, relative colors, and relative proportions, not how it appeared one instant last Tuesday at lunch."" (p. 81)Hawkins's definition of intelligence in terms of predictive ability is what I found most exciting in the book. When people talk about intelligence I usually want to demand ""intelligence for what?"" since the criteria for defining intelligence has always been so muddied. One of the ways of establishing a theory in science is through its ability to make accurate predictions. To judge the brain the same way seems strikingly right. Not only that but no longer do we have to beg the question of what intelligence is. It is the ability to predict.These predictions are about everything in our lives and they involve all of our senses. As Hawkins puts it, ""All regions of your neocortex are simultaneously trying to predict what their next experience will be. Visual areas make predictions about edges, shapes, objects, locations, and motions. Auditory areas make predictions about tones, direction to source, and patterns of sound. Somatosensory areas make predictions about touch, texture, contour, and temperature."" (pp. 88-89)While the first five chapters are eminently readable and exciting, Chapter 6, ""How the Cortex Works"" (the longest in the book) might be a bit tedious and technical for the general reader. (I know it was for me.)In Chapter 7, ""Consciousness and Creativity"" Hawkins writes, ""Most of what you perceive is not coming through your senses; it is generated by your internal memory model."" (p. 202) We do not experience the world directly and we do not interpret it objectively. Our predictions in a sense are prejudices or stereotypes that sometimes lead us astray. Hawkins writes, ""…you could substitute the word 'stereotype' for 'invariant memory'…without substantially altering the meaning. Prediction by analogy is pretty much the same as judgment by stereotype."" (p. 203)In the final chapter, ""The Future of Intelligence"" Hawkins makes it clear that intelligent machines will not be taking over the world. He writes, ""The computer in your home, or the Internet, has as much chance of spontaneously turning sentient as does a cash register."" (p. 214) Furthermore, an intelligent machine ""will not have a mind that is remotely humanlike unless we imbue it with humanlike emotional systems and humanlike experiences. That would be extremely difficult and, it seems to me, quite pointless."" (p. 208). Finally, fears that machines will take over the world ""rest on a false analogy…a conflation of intelligence…with the emotional drives of the old brain--things like fear, paranoia, and desire. But intelligent machines will not have these faculties. They will not have personal ambition. They will not desire wealth, social recognition, or sensual gratification. They will not have appetites, addictions, or mood disorders."" (p. 216)Hawkins goes on to predict that, with an approach based on learning and memory instead of brute calculation, we will build truly intelligent machines, the applications of which will be numerous and include applications impossible to predict.I would like to point out that Hawkins' idea that our cortex is continually making predictions about the environment, predictions that we scarcely notice unless they are wrong, is similar to an idea that John McCrone presented in his book Going Inside: A Tour Round a Single Moment of Consciousness (2001), a book I also highly recommend. --Dennis Littrell, author of “The World Is Not as We Think It Is”"
51,0805078533,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3112-scott-lerch,4,"Hawkins comes off really arrogant but if you can get past that he has some really interesting ideas on how the brain works. I totally don't agree with some of his criticisms of AI research and he totally doesn't understand why Searle's Chinese room argument is complete crap. I also think he belittles the Turing test a bit too much, I think there is definitely still value in it, although I understand that it's not the only or best way to demonstrate intelligence. My last criticism is that his framework seems awful general and I'm not sure how it can be applied to current AI research directly. After checking out Numenta.com (a company creating AI algorithms based on his framework) I was completely underwhelmed. He hasn't demonstrated that his framework will produce any better results than any other modern AI frameworks. Even with my criticisms I thought his explanation of human intelligence was interesting and seemed to make sense and I really hope AI research can benefit from it."

One of the interesting main points Hawkins makes is that prediction is essential to understanding intelligence. We are constantly predicting as we sense; we are constantly sending feedback back ""down"" the hierarchy while reading ""up"" the hierarchy. The book had a few flaws, in my eyes. One was the presentation of neurobiology; it was unclear to me where the author's speculations stopped and biological facts began, and on top of that, the description of the functions of the 6 layers of the neocortex was unclear. Another was Hawkins's claim that AI will soon be applicable to a worldwide weather prediction service; I find this claim highly dubious. Our powers of prediction lie most strongly in active prediction, not passive prediction."

These two features help to explain why brains, even though they are small and slow are still able to perform some amazing feats.He also discusses computing, artificial intelligence and neural networks and why these techniques have yet to produce intelligent computers. The chapters discussing Hawkins theory of brain function will only be of interest to neuroscientists. It was odd that in presenting this material Hawkins presents precisely no experimental evidence to support his claims. It's possible that none exists, and he somewhat makes up for this by listing some experiments that could be done in the appendix to the book. "

The most important study mentioned, it seemed to me, was Mountcastle's 1978 study, ""An Organizing Principle for Cerebral Function"", which demonstrated the rather astounding fact that the human cortex is highly uniform and its segments are not specialized, but highly flexible in use. The rest of the book is highly influenced by this finding and goes on to explain Hawkins' own ""memory-prediction"" model of intelligence."

Great read, and that it needs an update after such a short time is testament to the rapid development in this field."

66,0805078533,http://goodreads.com/user/show/71935584-ben-zimmerman,4,"It's hard to rate ""On Intelligence"" now in 2020 because on the one hand, it seems remarkable to me that this was written in 2004, and I really wish I came across it then, but on the other hand, parts of it have not aged very well, particularly in regards to the limitations and potential of A.I.I was in high school in 2004, and now I am a neuroscientist almost 4 years out of obtaining my Ph.D. In that time period, I spent a lot of time thinking about a lot of the same questions that Jeff Hawkins presents in this book, and like him, I felt like it was often like being on a treasure hunt in the neuroscience literature to find the clues that point to some more overarching theory on cognition. Not once in this time did I hear about the existence of this book. At least in the academic literature, I think that better and more comprehensive accounts exist now for thinking about intelligence that include important mechanisms to intelligence and cognition are somewhat ignored in this book (primarily theories that incorporate attention and goal representation and more nuanced views of the mechanisms involved in the hippocampal learning). However, I found myself wishing SO BADLY that I read this when I was 16 instead of 32. I still don't think I've come across a better book for explaining basics about how the brain works to a lay audience.The framework is pretty correct from a modern perspective, but it's hard to tell from the book exactly which parts Jeff Hawkins believes are his original ideas and how much he believes are older ideas that he is explaining. I think that he might take credit for more than he should, although it's hard to think back to what was available in 2004 and to know the degree that others were thinking in a similar way. A really interesting part of reading this book now is how much A.I. research has changed from 2004. Hawkins says that he lived through the ""rise and fall"" of neural networks, and that only a cortex-like architecture of implementing intelligence has a chance of doing things like describing visual scenes, directing smart cars, or doing speech-to-text. Now that these exact sort of problems are either solved or on the verge of being solved by modern implementations of neural nets, I wonder how much his view has changed. He might say that neural nets adapted to incorporate some cortical features, and that's why they kind of work, or he might concede that neural nets do better with big data and big computational resources and novel engineering ideas (like the neural net engineers contended all along). He also is not worried in any way whatsoever about A.I. being dangerous, which seems absurd today. The later chapters, including those about A.I. and also about consciousness and creativity, leave a lot to be desired, but the beginning chapters represent some of the best descriptions of how the brain works for a lay audience that I've ever heard. I kept thinking as I was reading it, ""oh, this is a great way to explain this concept!"" I'm looking forward to reading his new book next year when it comes out, and maybe I'll be as obsessed with it as I'm sure I would have been with this book if I had read it in 2004."
67,0805078533,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3286533-jurij-fedorov,2,"ReviewIt's a book introducing the very basics of thinking. Now, I'm not sure what level you need to be at to enjoy this book. On one hand it's super simple and basic and easy to read/listen to if you love this topic. On the other hand it's so basic that it's mostly air. Any biological psychology textbook is endlessly deeper than this. It's basically taking 10% of a biological psychology textbook and making it into a very long philosophical argument.What I don't get is why I would need an introduction to the fact that the brain has memory and that the future will have some form of AI that we can't predict yet? It's so vague and fluffy that it's just basic stuff people think about at home. This expert doesn't know more about the brain than anyone else in the technology sector. It's not his fault it's just that there is not much to tell besides the basics unless you start talking about experiments which he doesn't do.At least comparative psychology could have told us more about the brain. Or just any brain scan experiments. What he has to say is either basic stuff like humans having a memory or his 5 layers of neocortex theory. The latter is something new to me but without any visual guide I don't really see how this all looks like. His theory would be endlessly better presented in a short visual YouTube video than in a book. It feels like he is trying to act smart in this book or something. But maybe he is just trying to introduce super focused intellectual laymen to his theories of thinking? Would they fall for this snake oil and think this is really the forefront of psychology? Vague philosophical ideas about neurons is all we know? Not really. This is not just a philosophical topic. It's a research area… for some people.ConclusionPersonally I didn't really learn anything new from this book. I also didn't quite refresh my knowledge on anything. It's a loose intro to thinking in the brain but it's stuff I don't really think anyone doesn't know already. Who doesn't know the brain uses memory to predict events? And then if he wanted to explain it in a deeper way why doesn't he use clear examples of the instinct failing in real life? Just thinking about how basic but yet complicated this book is makes me irritated. I'm not demanding super deep stuff. I just want something that's not stuff a 6th grade student could think up in a similar way but with less flashy language.I guess I'm not pro flashy simplified philosophy for the sake of it. I do need something I can actually think about.I still think it may be a good read for some readers as I have seen some people praise it. But I frankly don't understand it. One thing that's good about it is that it's actually fairly understandable English. Which is not a given for philosophy books. So 2 stars."
68,0805078533,http://goodreads.com/user/show/91261074-chris-esposo,4,"Although the book is dated with respect to it’s narrative on the technology (originally published in 2004 before the advent of web 2.0 and the deep learning movement -or even the broader movement of machine learning in enterprise/society that preclude the DNN trend), it’s still a worthwhile read, especially for those who want to gain a more biologically-driven understanding of how one may try engineer intelligence (artificial or otherwise). The author, who developed the Palm Pilot, a proto-tablet/mobile assistant device, in the 90s, came into the study of AI via biophysics, which though is unusual in the modern era, where most AI/ML researchers either have an explicit background in computing, or applied mathematics, in the decade of the 50-80s, the name of the game was to build AI via mimicking the structure of biological intelligence. For those who would like to know more about the history of this era with respect to AI/ML, I’d highly recommend the recently published “Deep Learning Revolution” by Terrance Sejnowski, there’s some overlap with the historical material covered in this book, but I view the two books as complementary. This background in biology manifests itself in the author’s central thesis, which is that the human mind is a “prediction machine”, and that the “hierarchical structures” of the neuronal network is what enables learning for the mind. Further, certain pathologies of this prediction-prone organ can be explained by the mind incorrectly predicting an event. This idea seems sound, and it makes sense that the mind is constantly making predictions, and if wasn’t the case, there would be a noticeable addition in latency to our internal operations that would prevent us from acting the way we do. A rough analog to this could be current “real-time” web apps like Uber, which is able to cut the process-time of you requesting a ride, and a ride being hailed to you, by constantly processing prediction scores on the likelihood of you hailing a ride at any given moment. I think one would get much more out of this book if they had studied brain structure prior (or came to the book with some rudimentary background). Though the author makes a good effort of explaining the hierarchical structures he discusses via diagrams and description, I never fully felt I understood the science behind that biology. Still, it’s a rare thing for a book to be hitting 15 years of age and still be somewhat relevant in a field like AI, and so this speaks well to the ideas and the way it was laid out by the author. Definitely a recommend for those who are studying this subject matter and/or working in industry."
69,0805078533,http://goodreads.com/user/show/47755613-scott,4,"“Intelligence” is a frequently used word, but it is a very difficult and complicated one to define. The author of this book makes what could be very complicated subject matter easy to understand for the lay person, but the topics can also be enjoyed by those in the field of artificial intelligence (AI). He uses common words to explain difficult subject matter, and warns the reader of the one or two chapters where things get very technical. I appreciated his use of understandable illustrations along with examples making it easier for me to comprehend and appreciate the subject matter.“On Intelligence”, written by Jeff Hawkins and Sandra Blakeslee, was a surprise find for me while doing research on the topic of AI. I was searching for books covering the subject from a primer level, however I was intrigued by the author’s premise from the book’s description. I wanted to note that the majority of the book is expertly and professionally narrated by Stefan Rudnicki with a few sections voiced by Jeff Hawkins himself. The author comes to the subject matter with a vast amount of knowledge and study in the field of intelligence. He also comes to the table with a large knowledge of technology and the technology industry. He was the inventor of the PalmPilot along with other software accomplishments under his name. The author quickly setups up the difficulties of defining the word “intelligence” because it would be hard to have an “AI” without first understanding what intelligence is. As stated earlier, this is a difficult word to define and it really depends on who you ask this question too. A technologist will tell you one thing, a biologist another, and a psychologist another, etc. Mr. Hawkins takes a different approach to how others have defined it, and the remaining chapters of the book lay out his arguments.I thought it humbling the author said that his own premise may be flawed in areas needing additional study, and he is willing to modify his beliefs based on new data or details. I will say that after listening to the book, I will not think of intelligence in the same way, and I’m sure while continuing my research on the subject of AI, I will be passing any new details thought the framework given in the book. Regarding the narration of the book, as I stated earlier, it was professionally done. The narrator currently has over 531 others titles he has participated in voicing. There were no audio artifacts or issues I detected while listening and I have listed to other books by this narrator which I have enjoyed very much."
70,0805078533,http://goodreads.com/user/show/215221-bria,2,"This has been on my to-read list after a recommendation something like a decade ago, so I figured I'd better go check it off, although I wasn't all that excited about it. A pop-sci book written by someone outside of their expertise - there's nothing I love more than reading about some dude's life story and how nobody recognized their genius! Not to mention the sloppiness - when trying to illustrate how his ideas were so much better than those of competing companies, he tells a story about a company that he wasn't impressed by, despite its grand claims, but ends with sentence ""I think Nestor went out of business"". You think so? You can't be bothered to check? Why do research when you can just write whatever fits your narrative?But I trudged on and once he shut the hell up about himself and about how brilliant and misunderstood he is and just actually talked about the brain, it really picked up. You get to actually learn a bit about some brain structure, as long as you're satisfied learning only through vague analogies, and honestly, his whole framework of how the brain works really sounded like the predictive coding theory, which I've mostly read about on SlateStarCodex - https://slatestarcodex.com/2017/09/05... - but have also seen various versions of other places I read about the brain and consciousness. So it seems plausible that this is the direction neuroscience has been moving in over the past 15 years, but I don't actually know - I tried to go search around to see what's happened since he wrote this book. I did like that he had specific predictions - many many points to you, sir! - but the wikipedia page on this book only mentioned any follow up at all for two of them. And what else I found about him and his work wasn't very promising - he's still riding the misunderstand genius wave, founding a company so he can do the research he wants without being bothered by people who don't get him. Well, let's hope what I learned about the brain from this book was more or less in the right direction, in which case it probably wasn't a waste of time."
71,0805078533,http://goodreads.com/user/show/11936064-djcb,4,"Jeff Hawkins, famous for creating the Palm Pilot and some other technology, is also deeply interested in neuro-science. Furthermore, he thinks that the most viable path to artificial intelligence is through understanding (parts of) the human brain, rather than through bottom-up programming (as in classical-AI) or various neural-network (NN) approaches (though inspired by early brain research, the NN approach took its own path with little regard for the advances in neurology).So, what's one to do then? Jeff Hawkins came up with his own theory about how the brain works, of which the core is that your brain works in hierarchically ordered memory, where each layer n abstracts the information from layer n-1 and involves layer n+1 when there's something unexpected. Crucially, layer n gives feedback to layer n-1 so the 'unexpected' becomes less so -- ""learning"". So from, say, the retina the next layers register movement, edges, and further up the hierarchy (hard to describe what each of these layer perceives in normal language) and depending on how ""unexpected"" the information is, it could bubble up to some concept (""dog"").Hawkins makes it sound plausible, but is true? Though Hawkins is a wealthy technologist outside academia but he is not a crank. He has seriously thought about this, and comes up with testable predictions; moreover, he tries to implement his model in a computer - through his company Numenta. The book is from 2005, but I don't think we can see to what extent his model is correct -- however, the Numenta software based on his model competes with software based on ""traditional"" NN-models -- the ""deep learning"" software of today, which is much stronger and useful than their 2005 predecessors against which Hawkins argues.Regardless, interesting read. Hawkins can come off as a tad... self-confident here and there... but on a scale of 1 to Wolfram/Taleb, it's not too bad. "
72,0805078533,http://goodreads.com/user/show/71924987-payel-kundu,3,"I read this book as part of my neuroscience book club. Hawkins’s perspective as an entrepreneur and computer expert differs from that of most popular neuroscience book authors, who tend to be either neuroscientists or journalists. He makes it clear from the outset that he’s always had a fascination with the workings of the brain. He begins by outlining why he thinks previous attempts to create truly intelligent machines have failed: mainly that computers don’t really learn new things, they just store information without the ability to use that information later. This is very different from the brain, which as sensory information comes in it is combined with existing memories so that the new information fits into an existing framework. The neocortex is made up of multiple layers, one on top of the other, and information from the senses travels through these layers, each adding increasingly detailed prior knowledge to the raw sensory information. Thus, Hawkins contends that to build truly intelligent machines, we have to first understand the human brain. While the brain (Hawkins thinks the neocortex is our real concern here and so uses these terms interchangeably) seems irreducibly complicated at first, Hawkins is encouraged by the fact that the neocortex is organized into consistent columns which all seem to use the same processing algorithm. So if we solve that algorithm once, it will unlock a great deal of understanding about how the brain processes information. Since this book was written in 2004, I’m not sure how much of the AI portion is still relevant. Hawkins has several predictions about machine intelligence, some of which turned out not to be true in light of innovations like neural networks and machine learning. I’d like to see an updated version of his thoughts on machine intelligence given the technology we have today. Luckily, he’s coming out with a new book in a few months, and I’m looking forward to reading it. "
73,0805078533,http://goodreads.com/user/show/27650260-anirudh,4,"I found this book fascinating with regards to the ideas it proposes regarding neuroscience, intelligence and intelligent machines. I have no background in this field and in that context, I found the theories contained within it to be worthy of consideration. The writing style was generally good and the author painstakingly ensures that this is accessible to the general public.Jeff Hawkins proposes a theory that he says is radical and has the potential to boost both neuroscience and AI. I dont have the qualifications or expertise to vet these claims, but considering that 10 years after the book's publication we still do not have 'intelligent' machines makes it at least a little suspect.That said, this book is certainly well-researched and Jeff Hawkins has certainly spent a great deal of time and effort into ensuring that he knows what he is talking about. Will be interested to see what a neuroscientist or researcher in the field has to say about the theory and its ramifications.My only complaint with the book itself was the fact that the author proceeds far too slowly and methodically. He puts forward a point or argument and after 2 analogies, I have a pretty clear idea as to what he is talking about. There are 3 or 4 more analogies for the same argument after that, which made me want to throw the book at the wall. This beating of the dead horse was my only crib with the book, which is why I give it 4 stars."
74,0805078533,http://goodreads.com/user/show/54514199-gaurav-chhaparwal,4,"It's surprising how far we are from understanding the workings of our brain and what is the source of human intelligence. Author rightfully brings out the concern that the current programs based on artificial intelligence / machine learning / neural nets are pre- disposed to be specialized for a specific task like understanding vision, language etc. by using specific understanding of humans or massive amount of pattern matching and are not a 'general purpose intelligence'. Author also very nicely brings out the definition of intelligence to be 'ability to predict' and not 'ability to demonstrate behavior similar to intelligent beings (humans)'. A general purpose intelligence', like humans, should be able to learn to predict by being exposed to patterns in the available sensory data. The author also builds up a good case for suggesting that the way our brain provides us intelligence is using a 'memory prediction framework' based on memories stored hierarchically in our neo cortex and not by doing massive amounts of computing the way most current machines are being tried to be made intelligent. While author tries to go get very deep into how human brains work, that part of the book seems to be unnecessary and a force-fit given the very limited verifiability or even need of it as a premise. The book is a good read overall primarily because like any good book, it makes you wonder and realize how little you know. In this case, something so core to us - our intelligence. "
75,0805078533,http://goodreads.com/user/show/41433998-mohamad-ahmad,3,"Jeff Hawkins proposes a theory centered around the neocortex about how the brain works. He argues that in order to build intelligent machines that work we should understand intelligence in the brain first.According to the theory, the brain is a prediction machine composed of a hierarchial system of memory and invariant representations of the world around us. The neocortex recieves sensory inputs through our five senses, these sensory information are processed identically in the brain no matter where they came from, they then enter the memory hierarchy that transfer these informations to higher parts in the hierarchy, which refine and give constant feedbacks to lower parts of the hierarchy,in an enless loop of error refinement,until finally, when the brain recieves the clearest picture of what is happening around it. Our neocortex predicts the future based on the analogies of the past( previous experiences and learnings). Jeff Hawkins wants us to think of intelligence not only in terms of external behaviour but rather, in terms of brain processes happening internally, which shouldn't necessarily be obvious in external human behaviours. Jeff Hawkins says that the potential to build intelligent machines that are way smarter than us humans is pretty high and would benefit us immensely if we understood first how we do it right."
76,0805078533,http://goodreads.com/user/show/21518138-paulynn-yu,4,"I've been interested in neurobiology lately as I delve into the field of machine learning and think about my past readings in psychology / emotional science. I was looking for a book that would give me some working model of how the cortex works and how it is comparable to how machine / deep learning is being practiced today. This book did a 1st class job in giving a working model of the cortex; I appreciate how there are large sections of just the biology part without being yet muddled with philosophical debates and applications. I am studying how the brain works generally, but it was great to have a focused book on the cortex, difficulties in understanding the brain, memory-prediction hypothesis of intelligence.He holds the Chinese Room Argument in the book. And while I appreciate and agree with the analogy, I was slightly taken aback about his claims on current inferiority of machine learning technology in many areas one of which is image recognition which I find is untrue. Additionally, I think his claims on human consciousness and whether humans have a soul or we die with our brain crosses the line on what you can claim scientifically about the spiritual realm. It's an educational book for sure, but do take some claims with a pinch of salt."
77,0805078533,http://goodreads.com/user/show/65204196-dan-riaz,4,"Great read for those interested in learning more about the brain, and theories of it's underlying structures. Note, this book is primarily focused on the neocortex, the thin layer resting atop the brain that scientists believe is responsible for so much of higher-level human thought (including consciousness and self-awareness). While the author discusses widely known concepts such as plasticity, the primary focus is on the anatomy of the neocortex, and a theory of the neural architecture that attempts to explain it's remarkable ability to create intelligence. While this may sound like a dull affair, the author is incredibly provocative. The general simplicity of his ideas elicits an intuitive understanding of his core theory. Without going into great depths, his key thesis is that intelligence is nothing more than memory, and more specifically our ability to leverage our memories to make predictions about the world around us. Definitely offers a new perspective on the value of experience. Not much else to say here other than go and buy it if you enjoy scientific theory, and are curious about the inner-workings of the human brain. Won't be disappointed."
78,0805078533,http://goodreads.com/user/show/69313297-jina,4,"I actually found this book incredibly fascinating. While I admittedly have a very basic understand of the brain, it’s interesting to think about the neocortex working the way Jeff Hawkins suggests. He goes into great detail on how the neocortex most likely behaves under certain circumstances ; explains things such as imagination, thought, creativity and stereotyping; and acknowledges that these are manifested in every one differently not only because the neocortex evolves according to our life experiences, but also because everyone has a slightly different brain for genetic reasons. We’re visually drawn to people with deformities because our neocortex has detected a prediction error. Once you start to try to break down your human experience and see the world the way he has described you are, it’s a bit mind boggling. While other scientists might find Jeff Hawkins overly obsessed (to the point of delusion) with the functions of the neocortex, I can’t say that I finished the book with the same impression. "
79,0805078533,http://goodreads.com/user/show/69150535-kyle,4,"This book explores a new model of intelligence. The book is fascinating, and presents a compelling solution to the intelligence problem. The book is easy to follow, and presents the author's theory in a concise manner. The theory explored makes a lot of sense and overall I would absolutely recommend this book to anyone who is interested in artificial intelligence and cognition in general.The reason I did not give this book 5 stars is the author's attitude. Throughout the book there is an air of condescension, the author views his intelligence model as the last word in the field, and seems to view other theoretical neuroscientists and the field as a whole as being ignorant for largely not recognizing his theory as ""fact"". Early on the author compares his theory to Einstein's theory of relativity, and while he may be correct, the self association comes off as self absorbed and egotistic.The author does not hold a doctorate in any neuroscience field."
80,0805078533,http://goodreads.com/user/show/54266689-christina,5," It is the ability to make predictions about the future that is the crux of intelligence.  A fascinating book and well presented (even if Hawkins is a little full of himself). Especially noteworthy because despite several neuroscience classes, I have yet to come across the importance of predictions or really the function of the neocortex beyond vision/language/memory. Wonder how much an impact this had on the field because it seems visionary but more or less grounded. The parts on AI are also interesting, especially the analysis of a field that focuses primarily on behavior and machines acting like humans as opposed to intelligent thought processes (which comes down to machines learning to predict and store memories and learn).Hard to believe this was published over 10 years ago, and a really interesting read about intelligence/AI/the neocortex."
81,0805078533,http://goodreads.com/user/show/66443200-william-levine,2,"Question begging and glosses over many of the concepts that would undermine his theory. Hawkins spends too much time bragging about his accomplishments in personal computers so that you'll believe him even when he provides little evidence for some of his claims. For example, he mentions that we should not fear artificial intelligence because people were scared of computers and nothing bad happened from the growth of computers. Many people would beg to differ with the latter part of that statement, but he does not acknowledge this and instead continues to say that artificial intelligence could not possibly result in any negative consequences. He also doesn't do a great job explaining consciousness or emotion, which are crucial aspects of intelligence and provide significant barriers to creating Turing-test-passing machines."
82,0805078533,http://goodreads.com/user/show/82891836-pradeep-kumar,4,"The book kept me interested throughout. Jeff Hawkins presents his theories around four attributes of ne0cortex handling inputs from external world through sequences, hierarchies, auto-association and invariant forms. He gives day to day examples and makes it simple for anyone to understand the theory he is proposing. He ends the book summarizing on how far we are from building the AI system that is more close to real intelligence.  Good read for someone who is interested in the area of AI. The ideas might help build a better AI system.  Probably adding example's of current AI system, then comparing their working with the human brain and highlighting in detail the missing parts would have kept me more interested in some of the pages in the middle."

Jeff Hawkins declares his theory in the following (as understood by me) postulates:The entire cortex is a memory system. The neocortex stores sequences of patterns. The neocortex recalls patterns auto-associatively.The neocortex stores patterns in an invariant form.The neocortex stores patterns in a hierarchy.Although brain scientists and neurobiology experts may find his theory or some parts of it controversial, being not a brain scientist I believe that intelligent machines, as described in a book including upcoming fixes, are the future if technology.Special thanks to mr.

Today, after much mulling over of the contents in the book, I sought to read any critiques or reviews of the book I could find online. After reading a couple of the reviews here, I have been deservedly brought down from my high horse. Passion for an idea is a great thing, except when it clouds the scientific method. Perhaps the merit in Mr. Hawkins book lies precisely in its ability to inspire passion for the first time in those that may then, so impassioned, commit themselves to these questions."

Further, he reiterates the point that understanding of brain is needed for designing intelligent (not humanlike) machines. His theory on neocortex and memory prediction framework is interesting. Memory prediction framework has been used in anomaly detection since the past two years. As he says, technology is changing and improving every second so the findings are not yet complete and it is updated with time.

Also gives predictions and insight into the future, some of which already turned out to be true.But all these are not that important and would not warrant the ratings given.

That said, everyone today fundamentally understands that this is different in nature than human intelligence.

96,0805078533,http://goodreads.com/user/show/71935584-ben-zimmerman,4,"It's hard to rate ""On Intelligence"" now in 2020 because on the one hand, it seems remarkable to me that this was written in 2004, and I really wish I came across it then, but on the other hand, parts of it have not aged very well, particularly in regards to the limitations and potential of A.I.I was in high school in 2004, and now I am a neuroscientist almost 4 years out of obtaining my Ph.D. In that time period, I spent a lot of time thinking about a lot of the same questions that Jeff Hawkins presents in this book, and like him, I felt like it was often like being on a treasure hunt in the neuroscience literature to find the clues that point to some more overarching theory on cognition. Not once in this time did I hear about the existence of this book. At least in the academic literature, I think that better and more comprehensive accounts exist now for thinking about intelligence that include important mechanisms to intelligence and cognition are somewhat ignored in this book (primarily theories that incorporate attention and goal representation and more nuanced views of the mechanisms involved in the hippocampal learning). However, I found myself wishing SO BADLY that I read this when I was 16 instead of 32. I still don't think I've come across a better book for explaining basics about how the brain works to a lay audience.The framework is pretty correct from a modern perspective, but it's hard to tell from the book exactly which parts Jeff Hawkins believes are his original ideas and how much he believes are older ideas that he is explaining. I think that he might take credit for more than he should, although it's hard to think back to what was available in 2004 and to know the degree that others were thinking in a similar way. A really interesting part of reading this book now is how much A.I. research has changed from 2004. Hawkins says that he lived through the ""rise and fall"" of neural networks, and that only a cortex-like architecture of implementing intelligence has a chance of doing things like describing visual scenes, directing smart cars, or doing speech-to-text. Now that these exact sort of problems are either solved or on the verge of being solved by modern implementations of neural nets, I wonder how much his view has changed. He might say that neural nets adapted to incorporate some cortical features, and that's why they kind of work, or he might concede that neural nets do better with big data and big computational resources and novel engineering ideas (like the neural net engineers contended all along). He also is not worried in any way whatsoever about A.I. being dangerous, which seems absurd today. The later chapters, including those about A.I. and also about consciousness and creativity, leave a lot to be desired, but the beginning chapters represent some of the best descriptions of how the brain works for a lay audience that I've ever heard. I kept thinking as I was reading it, ""oh, this is a great way to explain this concept!"" I'm looking forward to reading his new book next year when it comes out, and maybe I'll be as obsessed with it as I'm sure I would have been with this book if I had read it in 2004."
97,0805078533,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3286533-jurij-fedorov,2,"ReviewIt's a book introducing the very basics of thinking. Now, I'm not sure what level you need to be at to enjoy this book. On one hand it's super simple and basic and easy to read/listen to if you love this topic. On the other hand it's so basic that it's mostly air. Any biological psychology textbook is endlessly deeper than this. It's basically taking 10% of a biological psychology textbook and making it into a very long philosophical argument.What I don't get is why I would need an introduction to the fact that the brain has memory and that the future will have some form of AI that we can't predict yet? It's so vague and fluffy that it's just basic stuff people think about at home. This expert doesn't know more about the brain than anyone else in the technology sector. It's not his fault it's just that there is not much to tell besides the basics unless you start talking about experiments which he doesn't do.At least comparative psychology could have told us more about the brain. Or just any brain scan experiments. What he has to say is either basic stuff like humans having a memory or his 5 layers of neocortex theory. The latter is something new to me but without any visual guide I don't really see how this all looks like. His theory would be endlessly better presented in a short visual YouTube video than in a book. It feels like he is trying to act smart in this book or something. But maybe he is just trying to introduce super focused intellectual laymen to his theories of thinking? Would they fall for this snake oil and think this is really the forefront of psychology? Vague philosophical ideas about neurons is all we know? Not really. This is not just a philosophical topic. It's a research area… for some people.ConclusionPersonally I didn't really learn anything new from this book. I also didn't quite refresh my knowledge on anything. It's a loose intro to thinking in the brain but it's stuff I don't really think anyone doesn't know already. Who doesn't know the brain uses memory to predict events? And then if he wanted to explain it in a deeper way why doesn't he use clear examples of the instinct failing in real life? Just thinking about how basic but yet complicated this book is makes me irritated. I'm not demanding super deep stuff. I just want something that's not stuff a 6th grade student could think up in a similar way but with less flashy language.I guess I'm not pro flashy simplified philosophy for the sake of it. I do need something I can actually think about.I still think it may be a good read for some readers as I have seen some people praise it. But I frankly don't understand it. One thing that's good about it is that it's actually fairly understandable English. Which is not a given for philosophy books. So 2 stars."
98,0805078533,http://goodreads.com/user/show/91261074-chris-esposo,4,"Although the book is dated with respect to it’s narrative on the technology (originally published in 2004 before the advent of web 2.0 and the deep learning movement -or even the broader movement of machine learning in enterprise/society that preclude the DNN trend), it’s still a worthwhile read, especially for those who want to gain a more biologically-driven understanding of how one may try engineer intelligence (artificial or otherwise). The author, who developed the Palm Pilot, a proto-tablet/mobile assistant device, in the 90s, came into the study of AI via biophysics, which though is unusual in the modern era, where most AI/ML researchers either have an explicit background in computing, or applied mathematics, in the decade of the 50-80s, the name of the game was to build AI via mimicking the structure of biological intelligence. For those who would like to know more about the history of this era with respect to AI/ML, I’d highly recommend the recently published “Deep Learning Revolution” by Terrance Sejnowski, there’s some overlap with the historical material covered in this book, but I view the two books as complementary. This background in biology manifests itself in the author’s central thesis, which is that the human mind is a “prediction machine”, and that the “hierarchical structures” of the neuronal network is what enables learning for the mind. Further, certain pathologies of this prediction-prone organ can be explained by the mind incorrectly predicting an event. This idea seems sound, and it makes sense that the mind is constantly making predictions, and if wasn’t the case, there would be a noticeable addition in latency to our internal operations that would prevent us from acting the way we do. A rough analog to this could be current “real-time” web apps like Uber, which is able to cut the process-time of you requesting a ride, and a ride being hailed to you, by constantly processing prediction scores on the likelihood of you hailing a ride at any given moment. I think one would get much more out of this book if they had studied brain structure prior (or came to the book with some rudimentary background). Though the author makes a good effort of explaining the hierarchical structures he discusses via diagrams and description, I never fully felt I understood the science behind that biology. Still, it’s a rare thing for a book to be hitting 15 years of age and still be somewhat relevant in a field like AI, and so this speaks well to the ideas and the way it was laid out by the author. Definitely a recommend for those who are studying this subject matter and/or working in industry."
99,0805078533,http://goodreads.com/user/show/47755613-scott,4,"“Intelligence” is a frequently used word, but it is a very difficult and complicated one to define. The author of this book makes what could be very complicated subject matter easy to understand for the lay person, but the topics can also be enjoyed by those in the field of artificial intelligence (AI). He uses common words to explain difficult subject matter, and warns the reader of the one or two chapters where things get very technical. I appreciated his use of understandable illustrations along with examples making it easier for me to comprehend and appreciate the subject matter.“On Intelligence”, written by Jeff Hawkins and Sandra Blakeslee, was a surprise find for me while doing research on the topic of AI. I was searching for books covering the subject from a primer level, however I was intrigued by the author’s premise from the book’s description. I wanted to note that the majority of the book is expertly and professionally narrated by Stefan Rudnicki with a few sections voiced by Jeff Hawkins himself. The author comes to the subject matter with a vast amount of knowledge and study in the field of intelligence. He also comes to the table with a large knowledge of technology and the technology industry. He was the inventor of the PalmPilot along with other software accomplishments under his name. The author quickly setups up the difficulties of defining the word “intelligence” because it would be hard to have an “AI” without first understanding what intelligence is. As stated earlier, this is a difficult word to define and it really depends on who you ask this question too. A technologist will tell you one thing, a biologist another, and a psychologist another, etc. Mr. Hawkins takes a different approach to how others have defined it, and the remaining chapters of the book lay out his arguments.I thought it humbling the author said that his own premise may be flawed in areas needing additional study, and he is willing to modify his beliefs based on new data or details. I will say that after listening to the book, I will not think of intelligence in the same way, and I’m sure while continuing my research on the subject of AI, I will be passing any new details thought the framework given in the book. Regarding the narration of the book, as I stated earlier, it was professionally done. The narrator currently has over 531 others titles he has participated in voicing. There were no audio artifacts or issues I detected while listening and I have listed to other books by this narrator which I have enjoyed very much."
100,0805078533,http://goodreads.com/user/show/215221-bria,2,"This has been on my to-read list after a recommendation something like a decade ago, so I figured I'd better go check it off, although I wasn't all that excited about it. A pop-sci book written by someone outside of their expertise - there's nothing I love more than reading about some dude's life story and how nobody recognized their genius! Not to mention the sloppiness - when trying to illustrate how his ideas were so much better than those of competing companies, he tells a story about a company that he wasn't impressed by, despite its grand claims, but ends with sentence ""I think Nestor went out of business"". You think so? You can't be bothered to check? Why do research when you can just write whatever fits your narrative?But I trudged on and once he shut the hell up about himself and about how brilliant and misunderstood he is and just actually talked about the brain, it really picked up. You get to actually learn a bit about some brain structure, as long as you're satisfied learning only through vague analogies, and honestly, his whole framework of how the brain works really sounded like the predictive coding theory, which I've mostly read about on SlateStarCodex - https://slatestarcodex.com/2017/09/05... - but have also seen various versions of other places I read about the brain and consciousness. So it seems plausible that this is the direction neuroscience has been moving in over the past 15 years, but I don't actually know - I tried to go search around to see what's happened since he wrote this book. I did like that he had specific predictions - many many points to you, sir! - but the wikipedia page on this book only mentioned any follow up at all for two of them. And what else I found about him and his work wasn't very promising - he's still riding the misunderstand genius wave, founding a company so he can do the research he wants without being bothered by people who don't get him. Well, let's hope what I learned about the brain from this book was more or less in the right direction, in which case it probably wasn't a waste of time."
101,0805078533,http://goodreads.com/user/show/11936064-djcb,4,"Jeff Hawkins, famous for creating the Palm Pilot and some other technology, is also deeply interested in neuro-science. Furthermore, he thinks that the most viable path to artificial intelligence is through understanding (parts of) the human brain, rather than through bottom-up programming (as in classical-AI) or various neural-network (NN) approaches (though inspired by early brain research, the NN approach took its own path with little regard for the advances in neurology).So, what's one to do then? Jeff Hawkins came up with his own theory about how the brain works, of which the core is that your brain works in hierarchically ordered memory, where each layer n abstracts the information from layer n-1 and involves layer n+1 when there's something unexpected. Crucially, layer n gives feedback to layer n-1 so the 'unexpected' becomes less so -- ""learning"". So from, say, the retina the next layers register movement, edges, and further up the hierarchy (hard to describe what each of these layer perceives in normal language) and depending on how ""unexpected"" the information is, it could bubble up to some concept (""dog"").Hawkins makes it sound plausible, but is true? Though Hawkins is a wealthy technologist outside academia but he is not a crank. He has seriously thought about this, and comes up with testable predictions; moreover, he tries to implement his model in a computer - through his company Numenta. The book is from 2005, but I don't think we can see to what extent his model is correct -- however, the Numenta software based on his model competes with software based on ""traditional"" NN-models -- the ""deep learning"" software of today, which is much stronger and useful than their 2005 predecessors against which Hawkins argues.Regardless, interesting read. Hawkins can come off as a tad... self-confident here and there... but on a scale of 1 to Wolfram/Taleb, it's not too bad. "
102,0805078533,http://goodreads.com/user/show/71924987-payel-kundu,3,"I read this book as part of my neuroscience book club. Hawkins’s perspective as an entrepreneur and computer expert differs from that of most popular neuroscience book authors, who tend to be either neuroscientists or journalists. He makes it clear from the outset that he’s always had a fascination with the workings of the brain. He begins by outlining why he thinks previous attempts to create truly intelligent machines have failed: mainly that computers don’t really learn new things, they just store information without the ability to use that information later. This is very different from the brain, which as sensory information comes in it is combined with existing memories so that the new information fits into an existing framework. The neocortex is made up of multiple layers, one on top of the other, and information from the senses travels through these layers, each adding increasingly detailed prior knowledge to the raw sensory information. Thus, Hawkins contends that to build truly intelligent machines, we have to first understand the human brain. While the brain (Hawkins thinks the neocortex is our real concern here and so uses these terms interchangeably) seems irreducibly complicated at first, Hawkins is encouraged by the fact that the neocortex is organized into consistent columns which all seem to use the same processing algorithm. So if we solve that algorithm once, it will unlock a great deal of understanding about how the brain processes information. Since this book was written in 2004, I’m not sure how much of the AI portion is still relevant. Hawkins has several predictions about machine intelligence, some of which turned out not to be true in light of innovations like neural networks and machine learning. I’d like to see an updated version of his thoughts on machine intelligence given the technology we have today. Luckily, he’s coming out with a new book in a few months, and I’m looking forward to reading it. "
103,0805078533,http://goodreads.com/user/show/27650260-anirudh,4,"I found this book fascinating with regards to the ideas it proposes regarding neuroscience, intelligence and intelligent machines. I have no background in this field and in that context, I found the theories contained within it to be worthy of consideration. The writing style was generally good and the author painstakingly ensures that this is accessible to the general public.Jeff Hawkins proposes a theory that he says is radical and has the potential to boost both neuroscience and AI. I dont have the qualifications or expertise to vet these claims, but considering that 10 years after the book's publication we still do not have 'intelligent' machines makes it at least a little suspect.That said, this book is certainly well-researched and Jeff Hawkins has certainly spent a great deal of time and effort into ensuring that he knows what he is talking about. Will be interested to see what a neuroscientist or researcher in the field has to say about the theory and its ramifications.My only complaint with the book itself was the fact that the author proceeds far too slowly and methodically. He puts forward a point or argument and after 2 analogies, I have a pretty clear idea as to what he is talking about. There are 3 or 4 more analogies for the same argument after that, which made me want to throw the book at the wall. This beating of the dead horse was my only crib with the book, which is why I give it 4 stars."
104,0805078533,http://goodreads.com/user/show/54514199-gaurav-chhaparwal,4,"It's surprising how far we are from understanding the workings of our brain and what is the source of human intelligence. Author rightfully brings out the concern that the current programs based on artificial intelligence / machine learning / neural nets are pre- disposed to be specialized for a specific task like understanding vision, language etc. by using specific understanding of humans or massive amount of pattern matching and are not a 'general purpose intelligence'. Author also very nicely brings out the definition of intelligence to be 'ability to predict' and not 'ability to demonstrate behavior similar to intelligent beings (humans)'. A general purpose intelligence', like humans, should be able to learn to predict by being exposed to patterns in the available sensory data. The author also builds up a good case for suggesting that the way our brain provides us intelligence is using a 'memory prediction framework' based on memories stored hierarchically in our neo cortex and not by doing massive amounts of computing the way most current machines are being tried to be made intelligent. While author tries to go get very deep into how human brains work, that part of the book seems to be unnecessary and a force-fit given the very limited verifiability or even need of it as a premise. The book is a good read overall primarily because like any good book, it makes you wonder and realize how little you know. In this case, something so core to us - our intelligence. "
105,0805078533,http://goodreads.com/user/show/41433998-mohamad-ahmad,3,"Jeff Hawkins proposes a theory centered around the neocortex about how the brain works. He argues that in order to build intelligent machines that work we should understand intelligence in the brain first.According to the theory, the brain is a prediction machine composed of a hierarchial system of memory and invariant representations of the world around us. The neocortex recieves sensory inputs through our five senses, these sensory information are processed identically in the brain no matter where they came from, they then enter the memory hierarchy that transfer these informations to higher parts in the hierarchy, which refine and give constant feedbacks to lower parts of the hierarchy,in an enless loop of error refinement,until finally, when the brain recieves the clearest picture of what is happening around it. Our neocortex predicts the future based on the analogies of the past( previous experiences and learnings). Jeff Hawkins wants us to think of intelligence not only in terms of external behaviour but rather, in terms of brain processes happening internally, which shouldn't necessarily be obvious in external human behaviours. Jeff Hawkins says that the potential to build intelligent machines that are way smarter than us humans is pretty high and would benefit us immensely if we understood first how we do it right."
106,0805078533,http://goodreads.com/user/show/21518138-paulynn-yu,4,"I've been interested in neurobiology lately as I delve into the field of machine learning and think about my past readings in psychology / emotional science. I was looking for a book that would give me some working model of how the cortex works and how it is comparable to how machine / deep learning is being practiced today. This book did a 1st class job in giving a working model of the cortex; I appreciate how there are large sections of just the biology part without being yet muddled with philosophical debates and applications. I am studying how the brain works generally, but it was great to have a focused book on the cortex, difficulties in understanding the brain, memory-prediction hypothesis of intelligence.He holds the Chinese Room Argument in the book. And while I appreciate and agree with the analogy, I was slightly taken aback about his claims on current inferiority of machine learning technology in many areas one of which is image recognition which I find is untrue. Additionally, I think his claims on human consciousness and whether humans have a soul or we die with our brain crosses the line on what you can claim scientifically about the spiritual realm. It's an educational book for sure, but do take some claims with a pinch of salt."
107,0805078533,http://goodreads.com/user/show/65204196-dan-riaz,4,"Great read for those interested in learning more about the brain, and theories of it's underlying structures. Note, this book is primarily focused on the neocortex, the thin layer resting atop the brain that scientists believe is responsible for so much of higher-level human thought (including consciousness and self-awareness). While the author discusses widely known concepts such as plasticity, the primary focus is on the anatomy of the neocortex, and a theory of the neural architecture that attempts to explain it's remarkable ability to create intelligence. While this may sound like a dull affair, the author is incredibly provocative. The general simplicity of his ideas elicits an intuitive understanding of his core theory. Without going into great depths, his key thesis is that intelligence is nothing more than memory, and more specifically our ability to leverage our memories to make predictions about the world around us. Definitely offers a new perspective on the value of experience. Not much else to say here other than go and buy it if you enjoy scientific theory, and are curious about the inner-workings of the human brain. Won't be disappointed."
108,0805078533,http://goodreads.com/user/show/69313297-jina,4,"I actually found this book incredibly fascinating. While I admittedly have a very basic understand of the brain, it’s interesting to think about the neocortex working the way Jeff Hawkins suggests. He goes into great detail on how the neocortex most likely behaves under certain circumstances ; explains things such as imagination, thought, creativity and stereotyping; and acknowledges that these are manifested in every one differently not only because the neocortex evolves according to our life experiences, but also because everyone has a slightly different brain for genetic reasons. We’re visually drawn to people with deformities because our neocortex has detected a prediction error. Once you start to try to break down your human experience and see the world the way he has described you are, it’s a bit mind boggling. While other scientists might find Jeff Hawkins overly obsessed (to the point of delusion) with the functions of the neocortex, I can’t say that I finished the book with the same impression. "
109,0805078533,http://goodreads.com/user/show/69150535-kyle,4,"This book explores a new model of intelligence. The book is fascinating, and presents a compelling solution to the intelligence problem. The book is easy to follow, and presents the author's theory in a concise manner. The theory explored makes a lot of sense and overall I would absolutely recommend this book to anyone who is interested in artificial intelligence and cognition in general.The reason I did not give this book 5 stars is the author's attitude. Throughout the book there is an air of condescension, the author views his intelligence model as the last word in the field, and seems to view other theoretical neuroscientists and the field as a whole as being ignorant for largely not recognizing his theory as ""fact"". Early on the author compares his theory to Einstein's theory of relativity, and while he may be correct, the self association comes off as self absorbed and egotistic.The author does not hold a doctorate in any neuroscience field."
110,0805078533,http://goodreads.com/user/show/54266689-christina,5," It is the ability to make predictions about the future that is the crux of intelligence.  A fascinating book and well presented (even if Hawkins is a little full of himself). Especially noteworthy because despite several neuroscience classes, I have yet to come across the importance of predictions or really the function of the neocortex beyond vision/language/memory. Wonder how much an impact this had on the field because it seems visionary but more or less grounded. The parts on AI are also interesting, especially the analysis of a field that focuses primarily on behavior and machines acting like humans as opposed to intelligent thought processes (which comes down to machines learning to predict and store memories and learn).Hard to believe this was published over 10 years ago, and a really interesting read about intelligence/AI/the neocortex."
111,0805078533,http://goodreads.com/user/show/66443200-william-levine,2,"Question begging and glosses over many of the concepts that would undermine his theory. Hawkins spends too much time bragging about his accomplishments in personal computers so that you'll believe him even when he provides little evidence for some of his claims. For example, he mentions that we should not fear artificial intelligence because people were scared of computers and nothing bad happened from the growth of computers. Many people would beg to differ with the latter part of that statement, but he does not acknowledge this and instead continues to say that artificial intelligence could not possibly result in any negative consequences. He also doesn't do a great job explaining consciousness or emotion, which are crucial aspects of intelligence and provide significant barriers to creating Turing-test-passing machines."
112,0805078533,http://goodreads.com/user/show/82891836-pradeep-kumar,4,"The book kept me interested throughout. Jeff Hawkins presents his theories around four attributes of ne0cortex handling inputs from external world through sequences, hierarchies, auto-association and invariant forms. He gives day to day examples and makes it simple for anyone to understand the theory he is proposing. He ends the book summarizing on how far we are from building the AI system that is more close to real intelligence.  Good read for someone who is interested in the area of AI. The ideas might help build a better AI system.  Probably adding example's of current AI system, then comparing their working with the human brain and highlighting in detail the missing parts would have kept me more interested in some of the pages in the middle."

Jeff Hawkins declares his theory in the following (as understood by me) postulates:The entire cortex is a memory system. The neocortex stores sequences of patterns. The neocortex recalls patterns auto-associatively.The neocortex stores patterns in an invariant form.The neocortex stores patterns in a hierarchy.Although brain scientists and neurobiology experts may find his theory or some parts of it controversial, being not a brain scientist I believe that intelligent machines, as described in a book including upcoming fixes, are the future if technology.Special thanks to mr. Hawkins for easy and understandable writing manner. Chapeau!"

Today, after much mulling over of the contents in the book, I sought to read any critiques or reviews of the book I could find online. After reading a couple of the reviews here, I have been deservedly brought down from my high horse. Passion for an idea is a great thing, except when it clouds the scientific method. Perhaps the merit in Mr. Hawkins book lies precisely in its ability to inspire passion for the first time in those that may then, so impassioned, commit themselves to these questions."

Further, he reiterates the point that understanding of brain is needed for designing intelligent (not humanlike) machines. His theory on neocortex and memory prediction framework is interesting. Memory prediction framework has been used in anomaly detection since the past two years. As he says, technology is changing and improving every second so the findings are not yet complete and it is updated with time.

Also gives predictions and insight into the future, some of which already turned out to be true.But all these are not that important and would not warrant the ratings given.

126,0805078533,http://goodreads.com/user/show/71935584-ben-zimmerman,4,"It's hard to rate ""On Intelligence"" now in 2020 because on the one hand, it seems remarkable to me that this was written in 2004, and I really wish I came across it then, but on the other hand, parts of it have not aged very well, particularly in regards to the limitations and potential of A.I.I was in high school in 2004, and now I am a neuroscientist almost 4 years out of obtaining my Ph.D. In that time period, I spent a lot of time thinking about a lot of the same questions that Jeff Hawkins presents in this book, and like him, I felt like it was often like being on a treasure hunt in the neuroscience literature to find the clues that point to some more overarching theory on cognition. Not once in this time did I hear about the existence of this book. At least in the academic literature, I think that better and more comprehensive accounts exist now for thinking about intelligence that include important mechanisms to intelligence and cognition are somewhat ignored in this book (primarily theories that incorporate attention and goal representation and more nuanced views of the mechanisms involved in the hippocampal learning). However, I found myself wishing SO BADLY that I read this when I was 16 instead of 32. I still don't think I've come across a better book for explaining basics about how the brain works to a lay audience.The framework is pretty correct from a modern perspective, but it's hard to tell from the book exactly which parts Jeff Hawkins believes are his original ideas and how much he believes are older ideas that he is explaining. I think that he might take credit for more than he should, although it's hard to think back to what was available in 2004 and to know the degree that others were thinking in a similar way. A really interesting part of reading this book now is how much A.I. research has changed from 2004. Hawkins says that he lived through the ""rise and fall"" of neural networks, and that only a cortex-like architecture of implementing intelligence has a chance of doing things like describing visual scenes, directing smart cars, or doing speech-to-text. Now that these exact sort of problems are either solved or on the verge of being solved by modern implementations of neural nets, I wonder how much his view has changed. He might say that neural nets adapted to incorporate some cortical features, and that's why they kind of work, or he might concede that neural nets do better with big data and big computational resources and novel engineering ideas (like the neural net engineers contended all along). He also is not worried in any way whatsoever about A.I. being dangerous, which seems absurd today. The later chapters, including those about A.I. and also about consciousness and creativity, leave a lot to be desired, but the beginning chapters represent some of the best descriptions of how the brain works for a lay audience that I've ever heard. I kept thinking as I was reading it, ""oh, this is a great way to explain this concept!"" I'm looking forward to reading his new book next year when it comes out, and maybe I'll be as obsessed with it as I'm sure I would have been with this book if I had read it in 2004."
127,0805078533,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3286533-jurij-fedorov,2,"ReviewIt's a book introducing the very basics of thinking. Now, I'm not sure what level you need to be at to enjoy this book. On one hand it's super simple and basic and easy to read/listen to if you love this topic. On the other hand it's so basic that it's mostly air. Any biological psychology textbook is endlessly deeper than this. It's basically taking 10% of a biological psychology textbook and making it into a very long philosophical argument.What I don't get is why I would need an introduction to the fact that the brain has memory and that the future will have some form of AI that we can't predict yet? It's so vague and fluffy that it's just basic stuff people think about at home. This expert doesn't know more about the brain than anyone else in the technology sector. It's not his fault it's just that there is not much to tell besides the basics unless you start talking about experiments which he doesn't do.At least comparative psychology could have told us more about the brain. Or just any brain scan experiments. What he has to say is either basic stuff like humans having a memory or his 5 layers of neocortex theory. The latter is something new to me but without any visual guide I don't really see how this all looks like. His theory would be endlessly better presented in a short visual YouTube video than in a book. It feels like he is trying to act smart in this book or something. But maybe he is just trying to introduce super focused intellectual laymen to his theories of thinking? Would they fall for this snake oil and think this is really the forefront of psychology? Vague philosophical ideas about neurons is all we know? Not really. This is not just a philosophical topic. It's a research area… for some people.ConclusionPersonally I didn't really learn anything new from this book. I also didn't quite refresh my knowledge on anything. It's a loose intro to thinking in the brain but it's stuff I don't really think anyone doesn't know already. Who doesn't know the brain uses memory to predict events? And then if he wanted to explain it in a deeper way why doesn't he use clear examples of the instinct failing in real life? Just thinking about how basic but yet complicated this book is makes me irritated. I'm not demanding super deep stuff. I just want something that's not stuff a 6th grade student could think up in a similar way but with less flashy language.I guess I'm not pro flashy simplified philosophy for the sake of it. I do need something I can actually think about.I still think it may be a good read for some readers as I have seen some people praise it. But I frankly don't understand it. One thing that's good about it is that it's actually fairly understandable English. Which is not a given for philosophy books. So 2 stars."
128,0805078533,http://goodreads.com/user/show/91261074-chris-esposo,4,"Although the book is dated with respect to it’s narrative on the technology (originally published in 2004 before the advent of web 2.0 and the deep learning movement -or even the broader movement of machine learning in enterprise/society that preclude the DNN trend), it’s still a worthwhile read, especially for those who want to gain a more biologically-driven understanding of how one may try engineer intelligence (artificial or otherwise). The author, who developed the Palm Pilot, a proto-tablet/mobile assistant device, in the 90s, came into the study of AI via biophysics, which though is unusual in the modern era, where most AI/ML researchers either have an explicit background in computing, or applied mathematics, in the decade of the 50-80s, the name of the game was to build AI via mimicking the structure of biological intelligence. For those who would like to know more about the history of this era with respect to AI/ML, I’d highly recommend the recently published “Deep Learning Revolution” by Terrance Sejnowski, there’s some overlap with the historical material covered in this book, but I view the two books as complementary. This background in biology manifests itself in the author’s central thesis, which is that the human mind is a “prediction machine”, and that the “hierarchical structures” of the neuronal network is what enables learning for the mind. Further, certain pathologies of this prediction-prone organ can be explained by the mind incorrectly predicting an event. This idea seems sound, and it makes sense that the mind is constantly making predictions, and if wasn’t the case, there would be a noticeable addition in latency to our internal operations that would prevent us from acting the way we do. A rough analog to this could be current “real-time” web apps like Uber, which is able to cut the process-time of you requesting a ride, and a ride being hailed to you, by constantly processing prediction scores on the likelihood of you hailing a ride at any given moment. I think one would get much more out of this book if they had studied brain structure prior (or came to the book with some rudimentary background). Though the author makes a good effort of explaining the hierarchical structures he discusses via diagrams and description, I never fully felt I understood the science behind that biology. Still, it’s a rare thing for a book to be hitting 15 years of age and still be somewhat relevant in a field like AI, and so this speaks well to the ideas and the way it was laid out by the author. Definitely a recommend for those who are studying this subject matter and/or working in industry."
129,0805078533,http://goodreads.com/user/show/47755613-scott,4,"“Intelligence” is a frequently used word, but it is a very difficult and complicated one to define. The author of this book makes what could be very complicated subject matter easy to understand for the lay person, but the topics can also be enjoyed by those in the field of artificial intelligence (AI). He uses common words to explain difficult subject matter, and warns the reader of the one or two chapters where things get very technical. I appreciated his use of understandable illustrations along with examples making it easier for me to comprehend and appreciate the subject matter.“On Intelligence”, written by Jeff Hawkins and Sandra Blakeslee, was a surprise find for me while doing research on the topic of AI. I was searching for books covering the subject from a primer level, however I was intrigued by the author’s premise from the book’s description. I wanted to note that the majority of the book is expertly and professionally narrated by Stefan Rudnicki with a few sections voiced by Jeff Hawkins himself. The author comes to the subject matter with a vast amount of knowledge and study in the field of intelligence. He also comes to the table with a large knowledge of technology and the technology industry. He was the inventor of the PalmPilot along with other software accomplishments under his name. The author quickly setups up the difficulties of defining the word “intelligence” because it would be hard to have an “AI” without first understanding what intelligence is. As stated earlier, this is a difficult word to define and it really depends on who you ask this question too. A technologist will tell you one thing, a biologist another, and a psychologist another, etc. Mr. Hawkins takes a different approach to how others have defined it, and the remaining chapters of the book lay out his arguments.I thought it humbling the author said that his own premise may be flawed in areas needing additional study, and he is willing to modify his beliefs based on new data or details. I will say that after listening to the book, I will not think of intelligence in the same way, and I’m sure while continuing my research on the subject of AI, I will be passing any new details thought the framework given in the book. Regarding the narration of the book, as I stated earlier, it was professionally done. The narrator currently has over 531 others titles he has participated in voicing. There were no audio artifacts or issues I detected while listening and I have listed to other books by this narrator which I have enjoyed very much."
130,0805078533,http://goodreads.com/user/show/215221-bria,2,"This has been on my to-read list after a recommendation something like a decade ago, so I figured I'd better go check it off, although I wasn't all that excited about it. A pop-sci book written by someone outside of their expertise - there's nothing I love more than reading about some dude's life story and how nobody recognized their genius! Not to mention the sloppiness - when trying to illustrate how his ideas were so much better than those of competing companies, he tells a story about a company that he wasn't impressed by, despite its grand claims, but ends with sentence ""I think Nestor went out of business"". You think so? You can't be bothered to check? Why do research when you can just write whatever fits your narrative?But I trudged on and once he shut the hell up about himself and about how brilliant and misunderstood he is and just actually talked about the brain, it really picked up. You get to actually learn a bit about some brain structure, as long as you're satisfied learning only through vague analogies, and honestly, his whole framework of how the brain works really sounded like the predictive coding theory, which I've mostly read about on SlateStarCodex - https://slatestarcodex.com/2017/09/05... - but have also seen various versions of other places I read about the brain and consciousness. So it seems plausible that this is the direction neuroscience has been moving in over the past 15 years, but I don't actually know - I tried to go search around to see what's happened since he wrote this book. I did like that he had specific predictions - many many points to you, sir! - but the wikipedia page on this book only mentioned any follow up at all for two of them. And what else I found about him and his work wasn't very promising - he's still riding the misunderstand genius wave, founding a company so he can do the research he wants without being bothered by people who don't get him. Well, let's hope what I learned about the brain from this book was more or less in the right direction, in which case it probably wasn't a waste of time."
131,0805078533,http://goodreads.com/user/show/11936064-djcb,4,"Jeff Hawkins, famous for creating the Palm Pilot and some other technology, is also deeply interested in neuro-science. Furthermore, he thinks that the most viable path to artificial intelligence is through understanding (parts of) the human brain, rather than through bottom-up programming (as in classical-AI) or various neural-network (NN) approaches (though inspired by early brain research, the NN approach took its own path with little regard for the advances in neurology).So, what's one to do then? Jeff Hawkins came up with his own theory about how the brain works, of which the core is that your brain works in hierarchically ordered memory, where each layer n abstracts the information from layer n-1 and involves layer n+1 when there's something unexpected. Crucially, layer n gives feedback to layer n-1 so the 'unexpected' becomes less so -- ""learning"". So from, say, the retina the next layers register movement, edges, and further up the hierarchy (hard to describe what each of these layer perceives in normal language) and depending on how ""unexpected"" the information is, it could bubble up to some concept (""dog"").Hawkins makes it sound plausible, but is true? Though Hawkins is a wealthy technologist outside academia but he is not a crank. He has seriously thought about this, and comes up with testable predictions; moreover, he tries to implement his model in a computer - through his company Numenta. The book is from 2005, but I don't think we can see to what extent his model is correct -- however, the Numenta software based on his model competes with software based on ""traditional"" NN-models -- the ""deep learning"" software of today, which is much stronger and useful than their 2005 predecessors against which Hawkins argues.Regardless, interesting read. Hawkins can come off as a tad... self-confident here and there... but on a scale of 1 to Wolfram/Taleb, it's not too bad. "
132,0805078533,http://goodreads.com/user/show/71924987-payel-kundu,3,"I read this book as part of my neuroscience book club. Hawkins’s perspective as an entrepreneur and computer expert differs from that of most popular neuroscience book authors, who tend to be either neuroscientists or journalists. He makes it clear from the outset that he’s always had a fascination with the workings of the brain. He begins by outlining why he thinks previous attempts to create truly intelligent machines have failed: mainly that computers don’t really learn new things, they just store information without the ability to use that information later. This is very different from the brain, which as sensory information comes in it is combined with existing memories so that the new information fits into an existing framework. The neocortex is made up of multiple layers, one on top of the other, and information from the senses travels through these layers, each adding increasingly detailed prior knowledge to the raw sensory information. Thus, Hawkins contends that to build truly intelligent machines, we have to first understand the human brain. While the brain (Hawkins thinks the neocortex is our real concern here and so uses these terms interchangeably) seems irreducibly complicated at first, Hawkins is encouraged by the fact that the neocortex is organized into consistent columns which all seem to use the same processing algorithm. So if we solve that algorithm once, it will unlock a great deal of understanding about how the brain processes information. Since this book was written in 2004, I’m not sure how much of the AI portion is still relevant. Hawkins has several predictions about machine intelligence, some of which turned out not to be true in light of innovations like neural networks and machine learning. I’d like to see an updated version of his thoughts on machine intelligence given the technology we have today. Luckily, he’s coming out with a new book in a few months, and I’m looking forward to reading it. "
133,0805078533,http://goodreads.com/user/show/27650260-anirudh,4,"I found this book fascinating with regards to the ideas it proposes regarding neuroscience, intelligence and intelligent machines. I have no background in this field and in that context, I found the theories contained within it to be worthy of consideration. The writing style was generally good and the author painstakingly ensures that this is accessible to the general public.Jeff Hawkins proposes a theory that he says is radical and has the potential to boost both neuroscience and AI. I dont have the qualifications or expertise to vet these claims, but considering that 10 years after the book's publication we still do not have 'intelligent' machines makes it at least a little suspect.That said, this book is certainly well-researched and Jeff Hawkins has certainly spent a great deal of time and effort into ensuring that he knows what he is talking about. Will be interested to see what a neuroscientist or researcher in the field has to say about the theory and its ramifications.My only complaint with the book itself was the fact that the author proceeds far too slowly and methodically. He puts forward a point or argument and after 2 analogies, I have a pretty clear idea as to what he is talking about. There are 3 or 4 more analogies for the same argument after that, which made me want to throw the book at the wall. This beating of the dead horse was my only crib with the book, which is why I give it 4 stars."
134,0805078533,http://goodreads.com/user/show/54514199-gaurav-chhaparwal,4,"It's surprising how far we are from understanding the workings of our brain and what is the source of human intelligence. Author rightfully brings out the concern that the current programs based on artificial intelligence / machine learning / neural nets are pre- disposed to be specialized for a specific task like understanding vision, language etc. by using specific understanding of humans or massive amount of pattern matching and are not a 'general purpose intelligence'. Author also very nicely brings out the definition of intelligence to be 'ability to predict' and not 'ability to demonstrate behavior similar to intelligent beings (humans)'. A general purpose intelligence', like humans, should be able to learn to predict by being exposed to patterns in the available sensory data. The author also builds up a good case for suggesting that the way our brain provides us intelligence is using a 'memory prediction framework' based on memories stored hierarchically in our neo cortex and not by doing massive amounts of computing the way most current machines are being tried to be made intelligent. While author tries to go get very deep into how human brains work, that part of the book seems to be unnecessary and a force-fit given the very limited verifiability or even need of it as a premise. The book is a good read overall primarily because like any good book, it makes you wonder and realize how little you know. In this case, something so core to us - our intelligence. "
135,0805078533,http://goodreads.com/user/show/41433998-mohamad-ahmad,3,"Jeff Hawkins proposes a theory centered around the neocortex about how the brain works. He argues that in order to build intelligent machines that work we should understand intelligence in the brain first.According to the theory, the brain is a prediction machine composed of a hierarchial system of memory and invariant representations of the world around us. The neocortex recieves sensory inputs through our five senses, these sensory information are processed identically in the brain no matter where they came from, they then enter the memory hierarchy that transfer these informations to higher parts in the hierarchy, which refine and give constant feedbacks to lower parts of the hierarchy,in an enless loop of error refinement,until finally, when the brain recieves the clearest picture of what is happening around it. Our neocortex predicts the future based on the analogies of the past( previous experiences and learnings). Jeff Hawkins wants us to think of intelligence not only in terms of external behaviour but rather, in terms of brain processes happening internally, which shouldn't necessarily be obvious in external human behaviours. Jeff Hawkins says that the potential to build intelligent machines that are way smarter than us humans is pretty high and would benefit us immensely if we understood first how we do it right."
136,0805078533,http://goodreads.com/user/show/21518138-paulynn-yu,4,"I've been interested in neurobiology lately as I delve into the field of machine learning and think about my past readings in psychology / emotional science. I was looking for a book that would give me some working model of how the cortex works and how it is comparable to how machine / deep learning is being practiced today. This book did a 1st class job in giving a working model of the cortex; I appreciate how there are large sections of just the biology part without being yet muddled with philosophical debates and applications. I am studying how the brain works generally, but it was great to have a focused book on the cortex, difficulties in understanding the brain, memory-prediction hypothesis of intelligence.He holds the Chinese Room Argument in the book. And while I appreciate and agree with the analogy, I was slightly taken aback about his claims on current inferiority of machine learning technology in many areas one of which is image recognition which I find is untrue. Additionally, I think his claims on human consciousness and whether humans have a soul or we die with our brain crosses the line on what you can claim scientifically about the spiritual realm. It's an educational book for sure, but do take some claims with a pinch of salt."
137,0805078533,http://goodreads.com/user/show/65204196-dan-riaz,4,"Great read for those interested in learning more about the brain, and theories of it's underlying structures. Note, this book is primarily focused on the neocortex, the thin layer resting atop the brain that scientists believe is responsible for so much of higher-level human thought (including consciousness and self-awareness). While the author discusses widely known concepts such as plasticity, the primary focus is on the anatomy of the neocortex, and a theory of the neural architecture that attempts to explain it's remarkable ability to create intelligence. While this may sound like a dull affair, the author is incredibly provocative. The general simplicity of his ideas elicits an intuitive understanding of his core theory. Without going into great depths, his key thesis is that intelligence is nothing more than memory, and more specifically our ability to leverage our memories to make predictions about the world around us. Definitely offers a new perspective on the value of experience. Not much else to say here other than go and buy it if you enjoy scientific theory, and are curious about the inner-workings of the human brain. Won't be disappointed."
138,0805078533,http://goodreads.com/user/show/69313297-jina,4,"I actually found this book incredibly fascinating. While I admittedly have a very basic understand of the brain, it’s interesting to think about the neocortex working the way Jeff Hawkins suggests. He goes into great detail on how the neocortex most likely behaves under certain circumstances ; explains things such as imagination, thought, creativity and stereotyping; and acknowledges that these are manifested in every one differently not only because the neocortex evolves according to our life experiences, but also because everyone has a slightly different brain for genetic reasons. We’re visually drawn to people with deformities because our neocortex has detected a prediction error. Once you start to try to break down your human experience and see the world the way he has described you are, it’s a bit mind boggling. While other scientists might find Jeff Hawkins overly obsessed (to the point of delusion) with the functions of the neocortex, I can’t say that I finished the book with the same impression. "
139,0805078533,http://goodreads.com/user/show/69150535-kyle,4,"This book explores a new model of intelligence. The book is fascinating, and presents a compelling solution to the intelligence problem. The book is easy to follow, and presents the author's theory in a concise manner. The theory explored makes a lot of sense and overall I would absolutely recommend this book to anyone who is interested in artificial intelligence and cognition in general.The reason I did not give this book 5 stars is the author's attitude. Throughout the book there is an air of condescension, the author views his intelligence model as the last word in the field, and seems to view other theoretical neuroscientists and the field as a whole as being ignorant for largely not recognizing his theory as ""fact"". Early on the author compares his theory to Einstein's theory of relativity, and while he may be correct, the self association comes off as self absorbed and egotistic.The author does not hold a doctorate in any neuroscience field."

A fascinating book and well presented (even if Hawkins is a little full of himself). Especially noteworthy because despite several neuroscience classes, I have yet to come across the importance of predictions or really the function of the neocortex beyond vision/language/memory. Wonder how much an impact this had on the field because it seems visionary but more or less grounded. The parts on AI are also interesting, especially the analysis of a field that focuses primarily on behavior and machines acting like humans as opposed to intelligent thought processes (which comes down to machines learning to predict and store memories and learn).Hard to believe this was published over 10 years ago, and a really interesting read about intelligence/AI/the neocortex."

Hawkins spends too much time bragging about his accomplishments in personal computers so that you'll believe him even when he provides little evidence for some of his claims. For example, he mentions that we should not fear artificial intelligence because people were scared of computers and nothing bad happened from the growth of computers. Many people would beg to differ with the latter part of that statement, but he does not acknowledge this and instead continues to say that artificial intelligence could not possibly result in any negative consequences. He also doesn't do a great job explaining consciousness or emotion, which are crucial aspects of intelligence and provide significant barriers to creating Turing-test-passing machines."

Jeff Hawkins presents his theories around four attributes of ne0cortex handling inputs from external world through sequences, hierarchies, auto-association and invariant forms. He gives day to day examples and makes it simple for anyone to understand the theory he is proposing. He ends the book summarizing on how far we are from building the AI system that is more close to real intelligence.  Good read for someone who is interested in the area of AI. The ideas might help build a better AI system.  Probably adding example's of current AI system, then comparing their working with the human brain and highlighting in detail the missing parts would have kept me more interested in some of the pages in the middle."

Jeff Hawkins declares his theory in the following (as understood by me) postulates:The entire cortex is a memory system. The neocortex stores sequences of patterns. The neocortex recalls patterns auto-associatively.The neocortex stores patterns in an invariant form.The neocortex stores patterns in a hierarchy.Although brain scientists and neurobiology experts may find his theory or some parts of it controversial, being not a brain scientist I believe that intelligent machines, as described in a book including upcoming fixes, are the future if technology.Special thanks to mr.

Today, after much mulling over of the contents in the book, I sought to read any critiques or reviews of the book I could find online. After reading a couple of the reviews here, I have been deservedly brought down from my high horse. Passion for an idea is a great thing, except when it clouds the scientific method. Perhaps the merit in Mr. Hawkins book lies precisely in its ability to inspire passion for the first time in those that may then, so impassioned, commit themselves to these questions."

156,0805078533,http://goodreads.com/user/show/71935584-ben-zimmerman,4,"It's hard to rate ""On Intelligence"" now in 2020 because on the one hand, it seems remarkable to me that this was written in 2004, and I really wish I came across it then, but on the other hand, parts of it have not aged very well, particularly in regards to the limitations and potential of A.I.I was in high school in 2004, and now I am a neuroscientist almost 4 years out of obtaining my Ph.D. In that time period, I spent a lot of time thinking about a lot of the same questions that Jeff Hawkins presents in this book, and like him, I felt like it was often like being on a treasure hunt in the neuroscience literature to find the clues that point to some more overarching theory on cognition. Not once in this time did I hear about the existence of this book. At least in the academic literature, I think that better and more comprehensive accounts exist now for thinking about intelligence that include important mechanisms to intelligence and cognition are somewhat ignored in this book (primarily theories that incorporate attention and goal representation and more nuanced views of the mechanisms involved in the hippocampal learning). However, I found myself wishing SO BADLY that I read this when I was 16 instead of 32. I still don't think I've come across a better book for explaining basics about how the brain works to a lay audience.The framework is pretty correct from a modern perspective, but it's hard to tell from the book exactly which parts Jeff Hawkins believes are his original ideas and how much he believes are older ideas that he is explaining. I think that he might take credit for more than he should, although it's hard to think back to what was available in 2004 and to know the degree that others were thinking in a similar way. A really interesting part of reading this book now is how much A.I. research has changed from 2004. Hawkins says that he lived through the ""rise and fall"" of neural networks, and that only a cortex-like architecture of implementing intelligence has a chance of doing things like describing visual scenes, directing smart cars, or doing speech-to-text. Now that these exact sort of problems are either solved or on the verge of being solved by modern implementations of neural nets, I wonder how much his view has changed. He might say that neural nets adapted to incorporate some cortical features, and that's why they kind of work, or he might concede that neural nets do better with big data and big computational resources and novel engineering ideas (like the neural net engineers contended all along). He also is not worried in any way whatsoever about A.I. being dangerous, which seems absurd today. The later chapters, including those about A.I. and also about consciousness and creativity, leave a lot to be desired, but the beginning chapters represent some of the best descriptions of how the brain works for a lay audience that I've ever heard. I kept thinking as I was reading it, ""oh, this is a great way to explain this concept!"" I'm looking forward to reading his new book next year when it comes out, and maybe I'll be as obsessed with it as I'm sure I would have been with this book if I had read it in 2004."
157,0805078533,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3286533-jurij-fedorov,2,"ReviewIt's a book introducing the very basics of thinking. Now, I'm not sure what level you need to be at to enjoy this book. On one hand it's super simple and basic and easy to read/listen to if you love this topic. On the other hand it's so basic that it's mostly air. Any biological psychology textbook is endlessly deeper than this. It's basically taking 10% of a biological psychology textbook and making it into a very long philosophical argument.What I don't get is why I would need an introduction to the fact that the brain has memory and that the future will have some form of AI that we can't predict yet? It's so vague and fluffy that it's just basic stuff people think about at home. This expert doesn't know more about the brain than anyone else in the technology sector. It's not his fault it's just that there is not much to tell besides the basics unless you start talking about experiments which he doesn't do.At least comparative psychology could have told us more about the brain. Or just any brain scan experiments. What he has to say is either basic stuff like humans having a memory or his 5 layers of neocortex theory. The latter is something new to me but without any visual guide I don't really see how this all looks like. His theory would be endlessly better presented in a short visual YouTube video than in a book. It feels like he is trying to act smart in this book or something. But maybe he is just trying to introduce super focused intellectual laymen to his theories of thinking? Would they fall for this snake oil and think this is really the forefront of psychology? Vague philosophical ideas about neurons is all we know? Not really. This is not just a philosophical topic. It's a research area… for some people.ConclusionPersonally I didn't really learn anything new from this book. I also didn't quite refresh my knowledge on anything. It's a loose intro to thinking in the brain but it's stuff I don't really think anyone doesn't know already. Who doesn't know the brain uses memory to predict events? And then if he wanted to explain it in a deeper way why doesn't he use clear examples of the instinct failing in real life? Just thinking about how basic but yet complicated this book is makes me irritated. I'm not demanding super deep stuff. I just want something that's not stuff a 6th grade student could think up in a similar way but with less flashy language.I guess I'm not pro flashy simplified philosophy for the sake of it. I do need something I can actually think about.I still think it may be a good read for some readers as I have seen some people praise it. But I frankly don't understand it. One thing that's good about it is that it's actually fairly understandable English. Which is not a given for philosophy books. So 2 stars."
158,0805078533,http://goodreads.com/user/show/91261074-chris-esposo,4,"Although the book is dated with respect to it’s narrative on the technology (originally published in 2004 before the advent of web 2.0 and the deep learning movement -or even the broader movement of machine learning in enterprise/society that preclude the DNN trend), it’s still a worthwhile read, especially for those who want to gain a more biologically-driven understanding of how one may try engineer intelligence (artificial or otherwise). The author, who developed the Palm Pilot, a proto-tablet/mobile assistant device, in the 90s, came into the study of AI via biophysics, which though is unusual in the modern era, where most AI/ML researchers either have an explicit background in computing, or applied mathematics, in the decade of the 50-80s, the name of the game was to build AI via mimicking the structure of biological intelligence. For those who would like to know more about the history of this era with respect to AI/ML, I’d highly recommend the recently published “Deep Learning Revolution” by Terrance Sejnowski, there’s some overlap with the historical material covered in this book, but I view the two books as complementary. This background in biology manifests itself in the author’s central thesis, which is that the human mind is a “prediction machine”, and that the “hierarchical structures” of the neuronal network is what enables learning for the mind. Further, certain pathologies of this prediction-prone organ can be explained by the mind incorrectly predicting an event. This idea seems sound, and it makes sense that the mind is constantly making predictions, and if wasn’t the case, there would be a noticeable addition in latency to our internal operations that would prevent us from acting the way we do. A rough analog to this could be current “real-time” web apps like Uber, which is able to cut the process-time of you requesting a ride, and a ride being hailed to you, by constantly processing prediction scores on the likelihood of you hailing a ride at any given moment. I think one would get much more out of this book if they had studied brain structure prior (or came to the book with some rudimentary background). Though the author makes a good effort of explaining the hierarchical structures he discusses via diagrams and description, I never fully felt I understood the science behind that biology. Still, it’s a rare thing for a book to be hitting 15 years of age and still be somewhat relevant in a field like AI, and so this speaks well to the ideas and the way it was laid out by the author. Definitely a recommend for those who are studying this subject matter and/or working in industry."
159,0805078533,http://goodreads.com/user/show/47755613-scott,4,"“Intelligence” is a frequently used word, but it is a very difficult and complicated one to define. The author of this book makes what could be very complicated subject matter easy to understand for the lay person, but the topics can also be enjoyed by those in the field of artificial intelligence (AI). He uses common words to explain difficult subject matter, and warns the reader of the one or two chapters where things get very technical. I appreciated his use of understandable illustrations along with examples making it easier for me to comprehend and appreciate the subject matter.“On Intelligence”, written by Jeff Hawkins and Sandra Blakeslee, was a surprise find for me while doing research on the topic of AI. I was searching for books covering the subject from a primer level, however I was intrigued by the author’s premise from the book’s description. I wanted to note that the majority of the book is expertly and professionally narrated by Stefan Rudnicki with a few sections voiced by Jeff Hawkins himself. The author comes to the subject matter with a vast amount of knowledge and study in the field of intelligence. He also comes to the table with a large knowledge of technology and the technology industry. He was the inventor of the PalmPilot along with other software accomplishments under his name. The author quickly setups up the difficulties of defining the word “intelligence” because it would be hard to have an “AI” without first understanding what intelligence is. As stated earlier, this is a difficult word to define and it really depends on who you ask this question too. A technologist will tell you one thing, a biologist another, and a psychologist another, etc. Mr. Hawkins takes a different approach to how others have defined it, and the remaining chapters of the book lay out his arguments.I thought it humbling the author said that his own premise may be flawed in areas needing additional study, and he is willing to modify his beliefs based on new data or details. I will say that after listening to the book, I will not think of intelligence in the same way, and I’m sure while continuing my research on the subject of AI, I will be passing any new details thought the framework given in the book. Regarding the narration of the book, as I stated earlier, it was professionally done. The narrator currently has over 531 others titles he has participated in voicing. There were no audio artifacts or issues I detected while listening and I have listed to other books by this narrator which I have enjoyed very much."
160,0805078533,http://goodreads.com/user/show/215221-bria,2,"This has been on my to-read list after a recommendation something like a decade ago, so I figured I'd better go check it off, although I wasn't all that excited about it. A pop-sci book written by someone outside of their expertise - there's nothing I love more than reading about some dude's life story and how nobody recognized their genius! Not to mention the sloppiness - when trying to illustrate how his ideas were so much better than those of competing companies, he tells a story about a company that he wasn't impressed by, despite its grand claims, but ends with sentence ""I think Nestor went out of business"". You think so? You can't be bothered to check? Why do research when you can just write whatever fits your narrative?But I trudged on and once he shut the hell up about himself and about how brilliant and misunderstood he is and just actually talked about the brain, it really picked up. You get to actually learn a bit about some brain structure, as long as you're satisfied learning only through vague analogies, and honestly, his whole framework of how the brain works really sounded like the predictive coding theory, which I've mostly read about on SlateStarCodex - https://slatestarcodex.com/2017/09/05... - but have also seen various versions of other places I read about the brain and consciousness. So it seems plausible that this is the direction neuroscience has been moving in over the past 15 years, but I don't actually know - I tried to go search around to see what's happened since he wrote this book. I did like that he had specific predictions - many many points to you, sir! - but the wikipedia page on this book only mentioned any follow up at all for two of them. And what else I found about him and his work wasn't very promising - he's still riding the misunderstand genius wave, founding a company so he can do the research he wants without being bothered by people who don't get him. Well, let's hope what I learned about the brain from this book was more or less in the right direction, in which case it probably wasn't a waste of time."
161,0805078533,http://goodreads.com/user/show/11936064-djcb,4,"Jeff Hawkins, famous for creating the Palm Pilot and some other technology, is also deeply interested in neuro-science. Furthermore, he thinks that the most viable path to artificial intelligence is through understanding (parts of) the human brain, rather than through bottom-up programming (as in classical-AI) or various neural-network (NN) approaches (though inspired by early brain research, the NN approach took its own path with little regard for the advances in neurology).So, what's one to do then? Jeff Hawkins came up with his own theory about how the brain works, of which the core is that your brain works in hierarchically ordered memory, where each layer n abstracts the information from layer n-1 and involves layer n+1 when there's something unexpected. Crucially, layer n gives feedback to layer n-1 so the 'unexpected' becomes less so -- ""learning"". So from, say, the retina the next layers register movement, edges, and further up the hierarchy (hard to describe what each of these layer perceives in normal language) and depending on how ""unexpected"" the information is, it could bubble up to some concept (""dog"").Hawkins makes it sound plausible, but is true? Though Hawkins is a wealthy technologist outside academia but he is not a crank. He has seriously thought about this, and comes up with testable predictions; moreover, he tries to implement his model in a computer - through his company Numenta. The book is from 2005, but I don't think we can see to what extent his model is correct -- however, the Numenta software based on his model competes with software based on ""traditional"" NN-models -- the ""deep learning"" software of today, which is much stronger and useful than their 2005 predecessors against which Hawkins argues.Regardless, interesting read. Hawkins can come off as a tad... self-confident here and there... but on a scale of 1 to Wolfram/Taleb, it's not too bad. "
162,0805078533,http://goodreads.com/user/show/71924987-payel-kundu,3,"I read this book as part of my neuroscience book club. Hawkins’s perspective as an entrepreneur and computer expert differs from that of most popular neuroscience book authors, who tend to be either neuroscientists or journalists. He makes it clear from the outset that he’s always had a fascination with the workings of the brain. He begins by outlining why he thinks previous attempts to create truly intelligent machines have failed: mainly that computers don’t really learn new things, they just store information without the ability to use that information later. This is very different from the brain, which as sensory information comes in it is combined with existing memories so that the new information fits into an existing framework. The neocortex is made up of multiple layers, one on top of the other, and information from the senses travels through these layers, each adding increasingly detailed prior knowledge to the raw sensory information. Thus, Hawkins contends that to build truly intelligent machines, we have to first understand the human brain. While the brain (Hawkins thinks the neocortex is our real concern here and so uses these terms interchangeably) seems irreducibly complicated at first, Hawkins is encouraged by the fact that the neocortex is organized into consistent columns which all seem to use the same processing algorithm. So if we solve that algorithm once, it will unlock a great deal of understanding about how the brain processes information. Since this book was written in 2004, I’m not sure how much of the AI portion is still relevant. Hawkins has several predictions about machine intelligence, some of which turned out not to be true in light of innovations like neural networks and machine learning. I’d like to see an updated version of his thoughts on machine intelligence given the technology we have today. Luckily, he’s coming out with a new book in a few months, and I’m looking forward to reading it. "
163,0805078533,http://goodreads.com/user/show/27650260-anirudh,4,"I found this book fascinating with regards to the ideas it proposes regarding neuroscience, intelligence and intelligent machines. I have no background in this field and in that context, I found the theories contained within it to be worthy of consideration. The writing style was generally good and the author painstakingly ensures that this is accessible to the general public.Jeff Hawkins proposes a theory that he says is radical and has the potential to boost both neuroscience and AI. I dont have the qualifications or expertise to vet these claims, but considering that 10 years after the book's publication we still do not have 'intelligent' machines makes it at least a little suspect.That said, this book is certainly well-researched and Jeff Hawkins has certainly spent a great deal of time and effort into ensuring that he knows what he is talking about. Will be interested to see what a neuroscientist or researcher in the field has to say about the theory and its ramifications.My only complaint with the book itself was the fact that the author proceeds far too slowly and methodically. He puts forward a point or argument and after 2 analogies, I have a pretty clear idea as to what he is talking about. There are 3 or 4 more analogies for the same argument after that, which made me want to throw the book at the wall. This beating of the dead horse was my only crib with the book, which is why I give it 4 stars."
164,0805078533,http://goodreads.com/user/show/54514199-gaurav-chhaparwal,4,"It's surprising how far we are from understanding the workings of our brain and what is the source of human intelligence. Author rightfully brings out the concern that the current programs based on artificial intelligence / machine learning / neural nets are pre- disposed to be specialized for a specific task like understanding vision, language etc. by using specific understanding of humans or massive amount of pattern matching and are not a 'general purpose intelligence'. Author also very nicely brings out the definition of intelligence to be 'ability to predict' and not 'ability to demonstrate behavior similar to intelligent beings (humans)'. A general purpose intelligence', like humans, should be able to learn to predict by being exposed to patterns in the available sensory data. The author also builds up a good case for suggesting that the way our brain provides us intelligence is using a 'memory prediction framework' based on memories stored hierarchically in our neo cortex and not by doing massive amounts of computing the way most current machines are being tried to be made intelligent. While author tries to go get very deep into how human brains work, that part of the book seems to be unnecessary and a force-fit given the very limited verifiability or even need of it as a premise. The book is a good read overall primarily because like any good book, it makes you wonder and realize how little you know. In this case, something so core to us - our intelligence. "
165,0805078533,http://goodreads.com/user/show/41433998-mohamad-ahmad,3,"Jeff Hawkins proposes a theory centered around the neocortex about how the brain works. He argues that in order to build intelligent machines that work we should understand intelligence in the brain first.According to the theory, the brain is a prediction machine composed of a hierarchial system of memory and invariant representations of the world around us. The neocortex recieves sensory inputs through our five senses, these sensory information are processed identically in the brain no matter where they came from, they then enter the memory hierarchy that transfer these informations to higher parts in the hierarchy, which refine and give constant feedbacks to lower parts of the hierarchy,in an enless loop of error refinement,until finally, when the brain recieves the clearest picture of what is happening around it. Our neocortex predicts the future based on the analogies of the past( previous experiences and learnings). Jeff Hawkins wants us to think of intelligence not only in terms of external behaviour but rather, in terms of brain processes happening internally, which shouldn't necessarily be obvious in external human behaviours. Jeff Hawkins says that the potential to build intelligent machines that are way smarter than us humans is pretty high and would benefit us immensely if we understood first how we do it right."

I was looking for a book that would give me some working model of how the cortex works and how it is comparable to how machine / deep learning is being practiced today. This book did a 1st class job in giving a working model of the cortex; I appreciate how there are large sections of just the biology part without being yet muddled with philosophical debates and applications. I am studying how the brain works generally, but it was great to have a focused book on the cortex, difficulties in understanding the brain, memory-prediction hypothesis of intelligence.He holds the Chinese Room Argument in the book. And while I appreciate and agree with the analogy, I was slightly taken aback about his claims on current inferiority of machine learning technology in many areas one of which is image recognition which I find is untrue. Additionally, I think his claims on human consciousness and whether humans have a soul or we die with our brain crosses the line on what you can claim scientifically about the spiritual realm. It's an educational book for sure, but do take some claims with a pinch of salt."
167,0805078533,http://goodreads.com/user/show/65204196-dan-riaz,4,"Great read for those interested in learning more about the brain, and theories of it's underlying structures. Note, this book is primarily focused on the neocortex, the thin layer resting atop the brain that scientists believe is responsible for so much of higher-level human thought (including consciousness and self-awareness). While the author discusses widely known concepts such as plasticity, the primary focus is on the anatomy of the neocortex, and a theory of the neural architecture that attempts to explain it's remarkable ability to create intelligence. While this may sound like a dull affair, the author is incredibly provocative. The general simplicity of his ideas elicits an intuitive understanding of his core theory. Without going into great depths, his key thesis is that intelligence is nothing more than memory, and more specifically our ability to leverage our memories to make predictions about the world around us. Definitely offers a new perspective on the value of experience. Not much else to say here other than go and buy it if you enjoy scientific theory, and are curious about the inner-workings of the human brain. Won't be disappointed."

While I admittedly have a very basic understand of the brain, it’s interesting to think about the neocortex working the way Jeff Hawkins suggests. He goes into great detail on how the neocortex most likely behaves under certain circumstances ; explains things such as imagination, thought, creativity and stereotyping; and acknowledges that these are manifested in every one differently not only because the neocortex evolves according to our life experiences, but also because everyone has a slightly different brain for genetic reasons. We’re visually drawn to people with deformities because our neocortex has detected a prediction error. Once you start to try to break down your human experience and see the world the way he has described you are, it’s a bit mind boggling. While other scientists might find Jeff Hawkins overly obsessed (to the point of delusion) with the functions of the neocortex, I can’t say that I finished the book with the same impression. "

The book is easy to follow, and presents the author's theory in a concise manner. The theory explored makes a lot of sense and overall I would absolutely recommend this book to anyone who is interested in artificial intelligence and cognition in general.The reason I did not give this book 5 stars is the author's attitude. Throughout the book there is an air of condescension, the author views his intelligence model as the last word in the field, and seems to view other theoretical neuroscientists and the field as a whole as being ignorant for largely not recognizing his theory as ""fact"". Early on the author compares his theory to Einstein's theory of relativity, and while he may be correct, the self association comes off as self absorbed and egotistic.The author does not hold a doctorate in any neuroscience field."

A fascinating book and well presented (even if Hawkins is a little full of himself). Especially noteworthy because despite several neuroscience classes, I have yet to come across the importance of predictions or really the function of the neocortex beyond vision/language/memory. Wonder how much an impact this had on the field because it seems visionary but more or less grounded. The parts on AI are also interesting, especially the analysis of a field that focuses primarily on behavior and machines acting like humans as opposed to intelligent thought processes (which comes down to machines learning to predict and store memories and learn).Hard to believe this was published over 10 years ago, and a really interesting read about intelligence/AI/the neocortex."

Hawkins spends too much time bragging about his accomplishments in personal computers so that you'll believe him even when he provides little evidence for some of his claims. For example, he mentions that we should not fear artificial intelligence because people were scared of computers and nothing bad happened from the growth of computers. Many people would beg to differ with the latter part of that statement, but he does not acknowledge this and instead continues to say that artificial intelligence could not possibly result in any negative consequences. He also doesn't do a great job explaining consciousness or emotion, which are crucial aspects of intelligence and provide significant barriers to creating Turing-test-passing machines."

He gives day to day examples and makes it simple for anyone to understand the theory he is proposing. He ends the book summarizing on how far we are from building the AI system that is more close to real intelligence.  Good read for someone who is interested in the area of AI. The ideas might help build a better AI system.  Probably adding example's of current AI system, then comparing their working with the human brain and highlighting in detail the missing parts would have kept me more interested in some of the pages in the middle."

The neocortex recalls patterns auto-associatively.The neocortex stores patterns in an invariant form.The neocortex stores patterns in a hierarchy.Although brain scientists and neurobiology experts may find his theory or some parts of it controversial, being not a brain scientist I believe that intelligent machines, as described in a book including upcoming fixes, are the future if technology.Special thanks to mr.

Today, after much mulling over of the contents in the book, I sought to read any critiques or reviews of the book I could find online. After reading a couple of the reviews here, I have been deservedly brought down from my high horse. Passion for an idea is a great thing, except when it clouds the scientific method. Perhaps the merit in Mr. Hawkins book lies precisely in its ability to inspire passion for the first time in those that may then, so impassioned, commit themselves to these questions."

Also gives predictions and insight into the future, some of which already turned out to be true.But all these are not that important and would not warrant the ratings given.

186,0805078533,http://goodreads.com/user/show/71935584-ben-zimmerman,4,"It's hard to rate ""On Intelligence"" now in 2020 because on the one hand, it seems remarkable to me that this was written in 2004, and I really wish I came across it then, but on the other hand, parts of it have not aged very well, particularly in regards to the limitations and potential of A.I.I was in high school in 2004, and now I am a neuroscientist almost 4 years out of obtaining my Ph.D. In that time period, I spent a lot of time thinking about a lot of the same questions that Jeff Hawkins presents in this book, and like him, I felt like it was often like being on a treasure hunt in the neuroscience literature to find the clues that point to some more overarching theory on cognition. Not once in this time did I hear about the existence of this book. At least in the academic literature, I think that better and more comprehensive accounts exist now for thinking about intelligence that include important mechanisms to intelligence and cognition are somewhat ignored in this book (primarily theories that incorporate attention and goal representation and more nuanced views of the mechanisms involved in the hippocampal learning). However, I found myself wishing SO BADLY that I read this when I was 16 instead of 32. I still don't think I've come across a better book for explaining basics about how the brain works to a lay audience.The framework is pretty correct from a modern perspective, but it's hard to tell from the book exactly which parts Jeff Hawkins believes are his original ideas and how much he believes are older ideas that he is explaining. I think that he might take credit for more than he should, although it's hard to think back to what was available in 2004 and to know the degree that others were thinking in a similar way. A really interesting part of reading this book now is how much A.I. research has changed from 2004. Hawkins says that he lived through the ""rise and fall"" of neural networks, and that only a cortex-like architecture of implementing intelligence has a chance of doing things like describing visual scenes, directing smart cars, or doing speech-to-text. Now that these exact sort of problems are either solved or on the verge of being solved by modern implementations of neural nets, I wonder how much his view has changed. He might say that neural nets adapted to incorporate some cortical features, and that's why they kind of work, or he might concede that neural nets do better with big data and big computational resources and novel engineering ideas (like the neural net engineers contended all along). He also is not worried in any way whatsoever about A.I. being dangerous, which seems absurd today. The later chapters, including those about A.I. and also about consciousness and creativity, leave a lot to be desired, but the beginning chapters represent some of the best descriptions of how the brain works for a lay audience that I've ever heard. I kept thinking as I was reading it, ""oh, this is a great way to explain this concept!"" I'm looking forward to reading his new book next year when it comes out, and maybe I'll be as obsessed with it as I'm sure I would have been with this book if I had read it in 2004."
187,0805078533,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3286533-jurij-fedorov,2,"ReviewIt's a book introducing the very basics of thinking. Now, I'm not sure what level you need to be at to enjoy this book. On one hand it's super simple and basic and easy to read/listen to if you love this topic. On the other hand it's so basic that it's mostly air. Any biological psychology textbook is endlessly deeper than this. It's basically taking 10% of a biological psychology textbook and making it into a very long philosophical argument.What I don't get is why I would need an introduction to the fact that the brain has memory and that the future will have some form of AI that we can't predict yet? It's so vague and fluffy that it's just basic stuff people think about at home. This expert doesn't know more about the brain than anyone else in the technology sector. It's not his fault it's just that there is not much to tell besides the basics unless you start talking about experiments which he doesn't do.At least comparative psychology could have told us more about the brain. Or just any brain scan experiments. What he has to say is either basic stuff like humans having a memory or his 5 layers of neocortex theory. The latter is something new to me but without any visual guide I don't really see how this all looks like. His theory would be endlessly better presented in a short visual YouTube video than in a book. It feels like he is trying to act smart in this book or something. But maybe he is just trying to introduce super focused intellectual laymen to his theories of thinking? Would they fall for this snake oil and think this is really the forefront of psychology? Vague philosophical ideas about neurons is all we know? Not really. This is not just a philosophical topic. It's a research area… for some people.ConclusionPersonally I didn't really learn anything new from this book. I also didn't quite refresh my knowledge on anything. It's a loose intro to thinking in the brain but it's stuff I don't really think anyone doesn't know already. Who doesn't know the brain uses memory to predict events? And then if he wanted to explain it in a deeper way why doesn't he use clear examples of the instinct failing in real life? Just thinking about how basic but yet complicated this book is makes me irritated. I'm not demanding super deep stuff. I just want something that's not stuff a 6th grade student could think up in a similar way but with less flashy language.I guess I'm not pro flashy simplified philosophy for the sake of it. I do need something I can actually think about.I still think it may be a good read for some readers as I have seen some people praise it. But I frankly don't understand it. One thing that's good about it is that it's actually fairly understandable English. Which is not a given for philosophy books. So 2 stars."
188,0805078533,http://goodreads.com/user/show/91261074-chris-esposo,4,"Although the book is dated with respect to it’s narrative on the technology (originally published in 2004 before the advent of web 2.0 and the deep learning movement -or even the broader movement of machine learning in enterprise/society that preclude the DNN trend), it’s still a worthwhile read, especially for those who want to gain a more biologically-driven understanding of how one may try engineer intelligence (artificial or otherwise). The author, who developed the Palm Pilot, a proto-tablet/mobile assistant device, in the 90s, came into the study of AI via biophysics, which though is unusual in the modern era, where most AI/ML researchers either have an explicit background in computing, or applied mathematics, in the decade of the 50-80s, the name of the game was to build AI via mimicking the structure of biological intelligence. For those who would like to know more about the history of this era with respect to AI/ML, I’d highly recommend the recently published “Deep Learning Revolution” by Terrance Sejnowski, there’s some overlap with the historical material covered in this book, but I view the two books as complementary. This background in biology manifests itself in the author’s central thesis, which is that the human mind is a “prediction machine”, and that the “hierarchical structures” of the neuronal network is what enables learning for the mind. Further, certain pathologies of this prediction-prone organ can be explained by the mind incorrectly predicting an event. This idea seems sound, and it makes sense that the mind is constantly making predictions, and if wasn’t the case, there would be a noticeable addition in latency to our internal operations that would prevent us from acting the way we do. A rough analog to this could be current “real-time” web apps like Uber, which is able to cut the process-time of you requesting a ride, and a ride being hailed to you, by constantly processing prediction scores on the likelihood of you hailing a ride at any given moment. I think one would get much more out of this book if they had studied brain structure prior (or came to the book with some rudimentary background). Though the author makes a good effort of explaining the hierarchical structures he discusses via diagrams and description, I never fully felt I understood the science behind that biology. Still, it’s a rare thing for a book to be hitting 15 years of age and still be somewhat relevant in a field like AI, and so this speaks well to the ideas and the way it was laid out by the author. Definitely a recommend for those who are studying this subject matter and/or working in industry."
189,0805078533,http://goodreads.com/user/show/47755613-scott,4,"“Intelligence” is a frequently used word, but it is a very difficult and complicated one to define. The author of this book makes what could be very complicated subject matter easy to understand for the lay person, but the topics can also be enjoyed by those in the field of artificial intelligence (AI). He uses common words to explain difficult subject matter, and warns the reader of the one or two chapters where things get very technical. I appreciated his use of understandable illustrations along with examples making it easier for me to comprehend and appreciate the subject matter.“On Intelligence”, written by Jeff Hawkins and Sandra Blakeslee, was a surprise find for me while doing research on the topic of AI. I was searching for books covering the subject from a primer level, however I was intrigued by the author’s premise from the book’s description. I wanted to note that the majority of the book is expertly and professionally narrated by Stefan Rudnicki with a few sections voiced by Jeff Hawkins himself. The author comes to the subject matter with a vast amount of knowledge and study in the field of intelligence. He also comes to the table with a large knowledge of technology and the technology industry. He was the inventor of the PalmPilot along with other software accomplishments under his name. The author quickly setups up the difficulties of defining the word “intelligence” because it would be hard to have an “AI” without first understanding what intelligence is. As stated earlier, this is a difficult word to define and it really depends on who you ask this question too. A technologist will tell you one thing, a biologist another, and a psychologist another, etc. Mr. Hawkins takes a different approach to how others have defined it, and the remaining chapters of the book lay out his arguments.I thought it humbling the author said that his own premise may be flawed in areas needing additional study, and he is willing to modify his beliefs based on new data or details. I will say that after listening to the book, I will not think of intelligence in the same way, and I’m sure while continuing my research on the subject of AI, I will be passing any new details thought the framework given in the book. Regarding the narration of the book, as I stated earlier, it was professionally done. The narrator currently has over 531 others titles he has participated in voicing. There were no audio artifacts or issues I detected while listening and I have listed to other books by this narrator which I have enjoyed very much."
190,0805078533,http://goodreads.com/user/show/215221-bria,2,"This has been on my to-read list after a recommendation something like a decade ago, so I figured I'd better go check it off, although I wasn't all that excited about it. A pop-sci book written by someone outside of their expertise - there's nothing I love more than reading about some dude's life story and how nobody recognized their genius! Not to mention the sloppiness - when trying to illustrate how his ideas were so much better than those of competing companies, he tells a story about a company that he wasn't impressed by, despite its grand claims, but ends with sentence ""I think Nestor went out of business"". You think so? You can't be bothered to check? Why do research when you can just write whatever fits your narrative?But I trudged on and once he shut the hell up about himself and about how brilliant and misunderstood he is and just actually talked about the brain, it really picked up. You get to actually learn a bit about some brain structure, as long as you're satisfied learning only through vague analogies, and honestly, his whole framework of how the brain works really sounded like the predictive coding theory, which I've mostly read about on SlateStarCodex - https://slatestarcodex.com/2017/09/05... - but have also seen various versions of other places I read about the brain and consciousness. So it seems plausible that this is the direction neuroscience has been moving in over the past 15 years, but I don't actually know - I tried to go search around to see what's happened since he wrote this book. I did like that he had specific predictions - many many points to you, sir! - but the wikipedia page on this book only mentioned any follow up at all for two of them. And what else I found about him and his work wasn't very promising - he's still riding the misunderstand genius wave, founding a company so he can do the research he wants without being bothered by people who don't get him. Well, let's hope what I learned about the brain from this book was more or less in the right direction, in which case it probably wasn't a waste of time."
191,0805078533,http://goodreads.com/user/show/11936064-djcb,4,"Jeff Hawkins, famous for creating the Palm Pilot and some other technology, is also deeply interested in neuro-science. Furthermore, he thinks that the most viable path to artificial intelligence is through understanding (parts of) the human brain, rather than through bottom-up programming (as in classical-AI) or various neural-network (NN) approaches (though inspired by early brain research, the NN approach took its own path with little regard for the advances in neurology).So, what's one to do then? Jeff Hawkins came up with his own theory about how the brain works, of which the core is that your brain works in hierarchically ordered memory, where each layer n abstracts the information from layer n-1 and involves layer n+1 when there's something unexpected. Crucially, layer n gives feedback to layer n-1 so the 'unexpected' becomes less so -- ""learning"". So from, say, the retina the next layers register movement, edges, and further up the hierarchy (hard to describe what each of these layer perceives in normal language) and depending on how ""unexpected"" the information is, it could bubble up to some concept (""dog"").Hawkins makes it sound plausible, but is true? Though Hawkins is a wealthy technologist outside academia but he is not a crank. He has seriously thought about this, and comes up with testable predictions; moreover, he tries to implement his model in a computer - through his company Numenta. The book is from 2005, but I don't think we can see to what extent his model is correct -- however, the Numenta software based on his model competes with software based on ""traditional"" NN-models -- the ""deep learning"" software of today, which is much stronger and useful than their 2005 predecessors against which Hawkins argues.Regardless, interesting read. Hawkins can come off as a tad... self-confident here and there... but on a scale of 1 to Wolfram/Taleb, it's not too bad. "
192,0805078533,http://goodreads.com/user/show/71924987-payel-kundu,3,"I read this book as part of my neuroscience book club. Hawkins’s perspective as an entrepreneur and computer expert differs from that of most popular neuroscience book authors, who tend to be either neuroscientists or journalists. He makes it clear from the outset that he’s always had a fascination with the workings of the brain. He begins by outlining why he thinks previous attempts to create truly intelligent machines have failed: mainly that computers don’t really learn new things, they just store information without the ability to use that information later. This is very different from the brain, which as sensory information comes in it is combined with existing memories so that the new information fits into an existing framework. The neocortex is made up of multiple layers, one on top of the other, and information from the senses travels through these layers, each adding increasingly detailed prior knowledge to the raw sensory information. Thus, Hawkins contends that to build truly intelligent machines, we have to first understand the human brain. While the brain (Hawkins thinks the neocortex is our real concern here and so uses these terms interchangeably) seems irreducibly complicated at first, Hawkins is encouraged by the fact that the neocortex is organized into consistent columns which all seem to use the same processing algorithm. So if we solve that algorithm once, it will unlock a great deal of understanding about how the brain processes information. Since this book was written in 2004, I’m not sure how much of the AI portion is still relevant. Hawkins has several predictions about machine intelligence, some of which turned out not to be true in light of innovations like neural networks and machine learning. I’d like to see an updated version of his thoughts on machine intelligence given the technology we have today. Luckily, he’s coming out with a new book in a few months, and I’m looking forward to reading it. "
193,0805078533,http://goodreads.com/user/show/27650260-anirudh,4,"I found this book fascinating with regards to the ideas it proposes regarding neuroscience, intelligence and intelligent machines. I have no background in this field and in that context, I found the theories contained within it to be worthy of consideration. The writing style was generally good and the author painstakingly ensures that this is accessible to the general public.Jeff Hawkins proposes a theory that he says is radical and has the potential to boost both neuroscience and AI. I dont have the qualifications or expertise to vet these claims, but considering that 10 years after the book's publication we still do not have 'intelligent' machines makes it at least a little suspect.That said, this book is certainly well-researched and Jeff Hawkins has certainly spent a great deal of time and effort into ensuring that he knows what he is talking about. Will be interested to see what a neuroscientist or researcher in the field has to say about the theory and its ramifications.My only complaint with the book itself was the fact that the author proceeds far too slowly and methodically. He puts forward a point or argument and after 2 analogies, I have a pretty clear idea as to what he is talking about. There are 3 or 4 more analogies for the same argument after that, which made me want to throw the book at the wall. This beating of the dead horse was my only crib with the book, which is why I give it 4 stars."
194,0805078533,http://goodreads.com/user/show/54514199-gaurav-chhaparwal,4,"It's surprising how far we are from understanding the workings of our brain and what is the source of human intelligence. Author rightfully brings out the concern that the current programs based on artificial intelligence / machine learning / neural nets are pre- disposed to be specialized for a specific task like understanding vision, language etc. by using specific understanding of humans or massive amount of pattern matching and are not a 'general purpose intelligence'. Author also very nicely brings out the definition of intelligence to be 'ability to predict' and not 'ability to demonstrate behavior similar to intelligent beings (humans)'. A general purpose intelligence', like humans, should be able to learn to predict by being exposed to patterns in the available sensory data. The author also builds up a good case for suggesting that the way our brain provides us intelligence is using a 'memory prediction framework' based on memories stored hierarchically in our neo cortex and not by doing massive amounts of computing the way most current machines are being tried to be made intelligent. While author tries to go get very deep into how human brains work, that part of the book seems to be unnecessary and a force-fit given the very limited verifiability or even need of it as a premise. The book is a good read overall primarily because like any good book, it makes you wonder and realize how little you know. In this case, something so core to us - our intelligence. "
195,0805078533,http://goodreads.com/user/show/41433998-mohamad-ahmad,3,"Jeff Hawkins proposes a theory centered around the neocortex about how the brain works. He argues that in order to build intelligent machines that work we should understand intelligence in the brain first.According to the theory, the brain is a prediction machine composed of a hierarchial system of memory and invariant representations of the world around us. The neocortex recieves sensory inputs through our five senses, these sensory information are processed identically in the brain no matter where they came from, they then enter the memory hierarchy that transfer these informations to higher parts in the hierarchy, which refine and give constant feedbacks to lower parts of the hierarchy,in an enless loop of error refinement,until finally, when the brain recieves the clearest picture of what is happening around it. Our neocortex predicts the future based on the analogies of the past( previous experiences and learnings). Jeff Hawkins wants us to think of intelligence not only in terms of external behaviour but rather, in terms of brain processes happening internally, which shouldn't necessarily be obvious in external human behaviours. Jeff Hawkins says that the potential to build intelligent machines that are way smarter than us humans is pretty high and would benefit us immensely if we understood first how we do it right."

This book did a 1st class job in giving a working model of the cortex; I appreciate how there are large sections of just the biology part without being yet muddled with philosophical debates and applications.

And while I appreciate and agree with the analogy, I was slightly taken aback about his claims on current inferiority of machine learning technology in many areas one of which is image recognition which I find is untrue. Additionally, I think his claims on human consciousness and whether humans have a soul or we die with our brain crosses the line on what you can claim scientifically about the spiritual realm. It's an educational book for sure, but do take some claims with a pinch of salt."
197,0805078533,http://goodreads.com/user/show/65204196-dan-riaz,4,"Great read for those interested in learning more about the brain, and theories of it's underlying structures. Note, this book is primarily focused on the neocortex, the thin layer resting atop the brain that scientists believe is responsible for so much of higher-level human thought (including consciousness and self-awareness). While the author discusses widely known concepts such as plasticity, the primary focus is on the anatomy of the neocortex, and a theory of the neural architecture that attempts to explain it's remarkable ability to create intelligence. While this may sound like a dull affair, the author is incredibly provocative. The general simplicity of his ideas elicits an intuitive understanding of his core theory. Without going into great depths, his key thesis is that intelligence is nothing more than memory, and more specifically our ability to leverage our memories to make predictions about the world around us. Definitely offers a new perspective on the value of experience. Not much else to say here other than go and buy it if you enjoy scientific theory, and are curious about the inner-workings of the human brain. Won't be disappointed."
198,0805078533,http://goodreads.com/user/show/69313297-jina,4,"I actually found this book incredibly fascinating. While I admittedly have a very basic understand of the brain, it’s interesting to think about the neocortex working the way Jeff Hawkins suggests. He goes into great detail on how the neocortex most likely behaves under certain circumstances ; explains things such as imagination, thought, creativity and stereotyping; and acknowledges that these are manifested in every one differently not only because the neocortex evolves according to our life experiences, but also because everyone has a slightly different brain for genetic reasons. We’re visually drawn to people with deformities because our neocortex has detected a prediction error. Once you start to try to break down your human experience and see the world the way he has described you are, it’s a bit mind boggling. While other scientists might find Jeff Hawkins overly obsessed (to the point of delusion) with the functions of the neocortex, I can’t say that I finished the book with the same impression. "
199,0805078533,http://goodreads.com/user/show/69150535-kyle,4,"This book explores a new model of intelligence. The book is fascinating, and presents a compelling solution to the intelligence problem. The book is easy to follow, and presents the author's theory in a concise manner. The theory explored makes a lot of sense and overall I would absolutely recommend this book to anyone who is interested in artificial intelligence and cognition in general.The reason I did not give this book 5 stars is the author's attitude. Throughout the book there is an air of condescension, the author views his intelligence model as the last word in the field, and seems to view other theoretical neuroscientists and the field as a whole as being ignorant for largely not recognizing his theory as ""fact"". Early on the author compares his theory to Einstein's theory of relativity, and while he may be correct, the self association comes off as self absorbed and egotistic.The author does not hold a doctorate in any neuroscience field."

A fascinating book and well presented (even if Hawkins is a little full of himself). Especially noteworthy because despite several neuroscience classes, I have yet to come across the importance of predictions or really the function of the neocortex beyond vision/language/memory. Wonder how much an impact this had on the field because it seems visionary but more or less grounded. The parts on AI are also interesting, especially the analysis of a field that focuses primarily on behavior and machines acting like humans as opposed to intelligent thought processes (which comes down to machines learning to predict and store memories and learn).Hard to believe this was published over 10 years ago, and a really interesting read about intelligence/AI/the neocortex."

Hawkins spends too much time bragging about his accomplishments in personal computers so that you'll believe him even when he provides little evidence for some of his claims. For example, he mentions that we should not fear artificial intelligence because people were scared of computers and nothing bad happened from the growth of computers. Many people would beg to differ with the latter part of that statement, but he does not acknowledge this and instead continues to say that artificial intelligence could not possibly result in any negative consequences. He also doesn't do a great job explaining consciousness or emotion, which are crucial aspects of intelligence and provide significant barriers to creating Turing-test-passing machines."

Jeff Hawkins presents his theories around four attributes of ne0cortex handling inputs from external world through sequences, hierarchies, auto-association and invariant forms. He gives day to day examples and makes it simple for anyone to understand the theory he is proposing. He ends the book summarizing on how far we are from building the AI system that is more close to real intelligence.  Good read for someone who is interested in the area of AI. The ideas might help build a better AI system.  Probably adding example's of current AI system, then comparing their working with the human brain and highlighting in detail the missing parts would have kept me more interested in some of the pages in the middle."

The neocortex recalls patterns auto-associatively.The neocortex stores patterns in an invariant form.The neocortex stores patterns in a hierarchy.Although brain scientists and neurobiology experts may find his theory or some parts of it controversial, being not a brain scientist I believe that intelligent machines, as described in a book including upcoming fixes, are the future if technology.Special thanks to mr.

Today, after much mulling over of the contents in the book, I sought to read any critiques or reviews of the book I could find online. After reading a couple of the reviews here, I have been deservedly brought down from my high horse. Passion for an idea is a great thing, except when it clouds the scientific method. Perhaps the merit in Mr. Hawkins book lies precisely in its ability to inspire passion for the first time in those that may then, so impassioned, commit themselves to these questions."

Further, he reiterates the point that understanding of brain is needed for designing intelligent (not humanlike) machines. His theory on neocortex and memory prediction framework is interesting. Memory prediction framework has been used in anomaly detection since the past two years. As he says, technology is changing and improving every second so the findings are not yet complete and it is updated with time.

Also gives predictions and insight into the future, some of which already turned out to be true.But all these are not that important and would not warrant the ratings given.

216,0805078533,http://goodreads.com/user/show/71935584-ben-zimmerman,4,"It's hard to rate ""On Intelligence"" now in 2020 because on the one hand, it seems remarkable to me that this was written in 2004, and I really wish I came across it then, but on the other hand, parts of it have not aged very well, particularly in regards to the limitations and potential of A.I.I was in high school in 2004, and now I am a neuroscientist almost 4 years out of obtaining my Ph.D. In that time period, I spent a lot of time thinking about a lot of the same questions that Jeff Hawkins presents in this book, and like him, I felt like it was often like being on a treasure hunt in the neuroscience literature to find the clues that point to some more overarching theory on cognition. Not once in this time did I hear about the existence of this book. At least in the academic literature, I think that better and more comprehensive accounts exist now for thinking about intelligence that include important mechanisms to intelligence and cognition are somewhat ignored in this book (primarily theories that incorporate attention and goal representation and more nuanced views of the mechanisms involved in the hippocampal learning). However, I found myself wishing SO BADLY that I read this when I was 16 instead of 32. I still don't think I've come across a better book for explaining basics about how the brain works to a lay audience.The framework is pretty correct from a modern perspective, but it's hard to tell from the book exactly which parts Jeff Hawkins believes are his original ideas and how much he believes are older ideas that he is explaining. I think that he might take credit for more than he should, although it's hard to think back to what was available in 2004 and to know the degree that others were thinking in a similar way. A really interesting part of reading this book now is how much A.I. research has changed from 2004. Hawkins says that he lived through the ""rise and fall"" of neural networks, and that only a cortex-like architecture of implementing intelligence has a chance of doing things like describing visual scenes, directing smart cars, or doing speech-to-text. Now that these exact sort of problems are either solved or on the verge of being solved by modern implementations of neural nets, I wonder how much his view has changed. He might say that neural nets adapted to incorporate some cortical features, and that's why they kind of work, or he might concede that neural nets do better with big data and big computational resources and novel engineering ideas (like the neural net engineers contended all along). He also is not worried in any way whatsoever about A.I. being dangerous, which seems absurd today. The later chapters, including those about A.I. and also about consciousness and creativity, leave a lot to be desired, but the beginning chapters represent some of the best descriptions of how the brain works for a lay audience that I've ever heard. I kept thinking as I was reading it, ""oh, this is a great way to explain this concept!"" I'm looking forward to reading his new book next year when it comes out, and maybe I'll be as obsessed with it as I'm sure I would have been with this book if I had read it in 2004."
217,0805078533,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3286533-jurij-fedorov,2,"ReviewIt's a book introducing the very basics of thinking. Now, I'm not sure what level you need to be at to enjoy this book. On one hand it's super simple and basic and easy to read/listen to if you love this topic. On the other hand it's so basic that it's mostly air. Any biological psychology textbook is endlessly deeper than this. It's basically taking 10% of a biological psychology textbook and making it into a very long philosophical argument.What I don't get is why I would need an introduction to the fact that the brain has memory and that the future will have some form of AI that we can't predict yet? It's so vague and fluffy that it's just basic stuff people think about at home. This expert doesn't know more about the brain than anyone else in the technology sector. It's not his fault it's just that there is not much to tell besides the basics unless you start talking about experiments which he doesn't do.At least comparative psychology could have told us more about the brain. Or just any brain scan experiments. What he has to say is either basic stuff like humans having a memory or his 5 layers of neocortex theory. The latter is something new to me but without any visual guide I don't really see how this all looks like. His theory would be endlessly better presented in a short visual YouTube video than in a book. It feels like he is trying to act smart in this book or something. But maybe he is just trying to introduce super focused intellectual laymen to his theories of thinking? Would they fall for this snake oil and think this is really the forefront of psychology? Vague philosophical ideas about neurons is all we know? Not really. This is not just a philosophical topic. It's a research area… for some people.ConclusionPersonally I didn't really learn anything new from this book. I also didn't quite refresh my knowledge on anything. It's a loose intro to thinking in the brain but it's stuff I don't really think anyone doesn't know already. Who doesn't know the brain uses memory to predict events? And then if he wanted to explain it in a deeper way why doesn't he use clear examples of the instinct failing in real life? Just thinking about how basic but yet complicated this book is makes me irritated. I'm not demanding super deep stuff. I just want something that's not stuff a 6th grade student could think up in a similar way but with less flashy language.I guess I'm not pro flashy simplified philosophy for the sake of it. I do need something I can actually think about.I still think it may be a good read for some readers as I have seen some people praise it. But I frankly don't understand it. One thing that's good about it is that it's actually fairly understandable English. Which is not a given for philosophy books. So 2 stars."
218,0805078533,http://goodreads.com/user/show/91261074-chris-esposo,4,"Although the book is dated with respect to it’s narrative on the technology (originally published in 2004 before the advent of web 2.0 and the deep learning movement -or even the broader movement of machine learning in enterprise/society that preclude the DNN trend), it’s still a worthwhile read, especially for those who want to gain a more biologically-driven understanding of how one may try engineer intelligence (artificial or otherwise). The author, who developed the Palm Pilot, a proto-tablet/mobile assistant device, in the 90s, came into the study of AI via biophysics, which though is unusual in the modern era, where most AI/ML researchers either have an explicit background in computing, or applied mathematics, in the decade of the 50-80s, the name of the game was to build AI via mimicking the structure of biological intelligence. For those who would like to know more about the history of this era with respect to AI/ML, I’d highly recommend the recently published “Deep Learning Revolution” by Terrance Sejnowski, there’s some overlap with the historical material covered in this book, but I view the two books as complementary. This background in biology manifests itself in the author’s central thesis, which is that the human mind is a “prediction machine”, and that the “hierarchical structures” of the neuronal network is what enables learning for the mind. Further, certain pathologies of this prediction-prone organ can be explained by the mind incorrectly predicting an event. This idea seems sound, and it makes sense that the mind is constantly making predictions, and if wasn’t the case, there would be a noticeable addition in latency to our internal operations that would prevent us from acting the way we do. A rough analog to this could be current “real-time” web apps like Uber, which is able to cut the process-time of you requesting a ride, and a ride being hailed to you, by constantly processing prediction scores on the likelihood of you hailing a ride at any given moment. I think one would get much more out of this book if they had studied brain structure prior (or came to the book with some rudimentary background). Though the author makes a good effort of explaining the hierarchical structures he discusses via diagrams and description, I never fully felt I understood the science behind that biology. Still, it’s a rare thing for a book to be hitting 15 years of age and still be somewhat relevant in a field like AI, and so this speaks well to the ideas and the way it was laid out by the author. Definitely a recommend for those who are studying this subject matter and/or working in industry."
219,0805078533,http://goodreads.com/user/show/47755613-scott,4,"“Intelligence” is a frequently used word, but it is a very difficult and complicated one to define. The author of this book makes what could be very complicated subject matter easy to understand for the lay person, but the topics can also be enjoyed by those in the field of artificial intelligence (AI). He uses common words to explain difficult subject matter, and warns the reader of the one or two chapters where things get very technical. I appreciated his use of understandable illustrations along with examples making it easier for me to comprehend and appreciate the subject matter.“On Intelligence”, written by Jeff Hawkins and Sandra Blakeslee, was a surprise find for me while doing research on the topic of AI. I was searching for books covering the subject from a primer level, however I was intrigued by the author’s premise from the book’s description. I wanted to note that the majority of the book is expertly and professionally narrated by Stefan Rudnicki with a few sections voiced by Jeff Hawkins himself. The author comes to the subject matter with a vast amount of knowledge and study in the field of intelligence. He also comes to the table with a large knowledge of technology and the technology industry. He was the inventor of the PalmPilot along with other software accomplishments under his name. The author quickly setups up the difficulties of defining the word “intelligence” because it would be hard to have an “AI” without first understanding what intelligence is. As stated earlier, this is a difficult word to define and it really depends on who you ask this question too. A technologist will tell you one thing, a biologist another, and a psychologist another, etc. Mr. Hawkins takes a different approach to how others have defined it, and the remaining chapters of the book lay out his arguments.I thought it humbling the author said that his own premise may be flawed in areas needing additional study, and he is willing to modify his beliefs based on new data or details. I will say that after listening to the book, I will not think of intelligence in the same way, and I’m sure while continuing my research on the subject of AI, I will be passing any new details thought the framework given in the book. Regarding the narration of the book, as I stated earlier, it was professionally done. The narrator currently has over 531 others titles he has participated in voicing. There were no audio artifacts or issues I detected while listening and I have listed to other books by this narrator which I have enjoyed very much."
220,0805078533,http://goodreads.com/user/show/215221-bria,2,"This has been on my to-read list after a recommendation something like a decade ago, so I figured I'd better go check it off, although I wasn't all that excited about it. A pop-sci book written by someone outside of their expertise - there's nothing I love more than reading about some dude's life story and how nobody recognized their genius! Not to mention the sloppiness - when trying to illustrate how his ideas were so much better than those of competing companies, he tells a story about a company that he wasn't impressed by, despite its grand claims, but ends with sentence ""I think Nestor went out of business"". You think so? You can't be bothered to check? Why do research when you can just write whatever fits your narrative?But I trudged on and once he shut the hell up about himself and about how brilliant and misunderstood he is and just actually talked about the brain, it really picked up. You get to actually learn a bit about some brain structure, as long as you're satisfied learning only through vague analogies, and honestly, his whole framework of how the brain works really sounded like the predictive coding theory, which I've mostly read about on SlateStarCodex - https://slatestarcodex.com/2017/09/05... - but have also seen various versions of other places I read about the brain and consciousness. So it seems plausible that this is the direction neuroscience has been moving in over the past 15 years, but I don't actually know - I tried to go search around to see what's happened since he wrote this book. I did like that he had specific predictions - many many points to you, sir! - but the wikipedia page on this book only mentioned any follow up at all for two of them. And what else I found about him and his work wasn't very promising - he's still riding the misunderstand genius wave, founding a company so he can do the research he wants without being bothered by people who don't get him. Well, let's hope what I learned about the brain from this book was more or less in the right direction, in which case it probably wasn't a waste of time."
221,0805078533,http://goodreads.com/user/show/11936064-djcb,4,"Jeff Hawkins, famous for creating the Palm Pilot and some other technology, is also deeply interested in neuro-science. Furthermore, he thinks that the most viable path to artificial intelligence is through understanding (parts of) the human brain, rather than through bottom-up programming (as in classical-AI) or various neural-network (NN) approaches (though inspired by early brain research, the NN approach took its own path with little regard for the advances in neurology).So, what's one to do then? Jeff Hawkins came up with his own theory about how the brain works, of which the core is that your brain works in hierarchically ordered memory, where each layer n abstracts the information from layer n-1 and involves layer n+1 when there's something unexpected. Crucially, layer n gives feedback to layer n-1 so the 'unexpected' becomes less so -- ""learning"". So from, say, the retina the next layers register movement, edges, and further up the hierarchy (hard to describe what each of these layer perceives in normal language) and depending on how ""unexpected"" the information is, it could bubble up to some concept (""dog"").Hawkins makes it sound plausible, but is true? Though Hawkins is a wealthy technologist outside academia but he is not a crank. He has seriously thought about this, and comes up with testable predictions; moreover, he tries to implement his model in a computer - through his company Numenta. The book is from 2005, but I don't think we can see to what extent his model is correct -- however, the Numenta software based on his model competes with software based on ""traditional"" NN-models -- the ""deep learning"" software of today, which is much stronger and useful than their 2005 predecessors against which Hawkins argues.Regardless, interesting read. Hawkins can come off as a tad... self-confident here and there... but on a scale of 1 to Wolfram/Taleb, it's not too bad. "
222,0805078533,http://goodreads.com/user/show/71924987-payel-kundu,3,"I read this book as part of my neuroscience book club. Hawkins’s perspective as an entrepreneur and computer expert differs from that of most popular neuroscience book authors, who tend to be either neuroscientists or journalists. He makes it clear from the outset that he’s always had a fascination with the workings of the brain. He begins by outlining why he thinks previous attempts to create truly intelligent machines have failed: mainly that computers don’t really learn new things, they just store information without the ability to use that information later. This is very different from the brain, which as sensory information comes in it is combined with existing memories so that the new information fits into an existing framework. The neocortex is made up of multiple layers, one on top of the other, and information from the senses travels through these layers, each adding increasingly detailed prior knowledge to the raw sensory information. Thus, Hawkins contends that to build truly intelligent machines, we have to first understand the human brain. While the brain (Hawkins thinks the neocortex is our real concern here and so uses these terms interchangeably) seems irreducibly complicated at first, Hawkins is encouraged by the fact that the neocortex is organized into consistent columns which all seem to use the same processing algorithm. So if we solve that algorithm once, it will unlock a great deal of understanding about how the brain processes information. Since this book was written in 2004, I’m not sure how much of the AI portion is still relevant. Hawkins has several predictions about machine intelligence, some of which turned out not to be true in light of innovations like neural networks and machine learning. I’d like to see an updated version of his thoughts on machine intelligence given the technology we have today. Luckily, he’s coming out with a new book in a few months, and I’m looking forward to reading it. "
223,0805078533,http://goodreads.com/user/show/27650260-anirudh,4,"I found this book fascinating with regards to the ideas it proposes regarding neuroscience, intelligence and intelligent machines. I have no background in this field and in that context, I found the theories contained within it to be worthy of consideration. The writing style was generally good and the author painstakingly ensures that this is accessible to the general public.Jeff Hawkins proposes a theory that he says is radical and has the potential to boost both neuroscience and AI. I dont have the qualifications or expertise to vet these claims, but considering that 10 years after the book's publication we still do not have 'intelligent' machines makes it at least a little suspect.That said, this book is certainly well-researched and Jeff Hawkins has certainly spent a great deal of time and effort into ensuring that he knows what he is talking about. Will be interested to see what a neuroscientist or researcher in the field has to say about the theory and its ramifications.My only complaint with the book itself was the fact that the author proceeds far too slowly and methodically. He puts forward a point or argument and after 2 analogies, I have a pretty clear idea as to what he is talking about. There are 3 or 4 more analogies for the same argument after that, which made me want to throw the book at the wall. This beating of the dead horse was my only crib with the book, which is why I give it 4 stars."
224,0805078533,http://goodreads.com/user/show/54514199-gaurav-chhaparwal,4,"It's surprising how far we are from understanding the workings of our brain and what is the source of human intelligence. Author rightfully brings out the concern that the current programs based on artificial intelligence / machine learning / neural nets are pre- disposed to be specialized for a specific task like understanding vision, language etc. by using specific understanding of humans or massive amount of pattern matching and are not a 'general purpose intelligence'. Author also very nicely brings out the definition of intelligence to be 'ability to predict' and not 'ability to demonstrate behavior similar to intelligent beings (humans)'. A general purpose intelligence', like humans, should be able to learn to predict by being exposed to patterns in the available sensory data. The author also builds up a good case for suggesting that the way our brain provides us intelligence is using a 'memory prediction framework' based on memories stored hierarchically in our neo cortex and not by doing massive amounts of computing the way most current machines are being tried to be made intelligent. While author tries to go get very deep into how human brains work, that part of the book seems to be unnecessary and a force-fit given the very limited verifiability or even need of it as a premise. The book is a good read overall primarily because like any good book, it makes you wonder and realize how little you know. In this case, something so core to us - our intelligence. "
225,0805078533,http://goodreads.com/user/show/41433998-mohamad-ahmad,3,"Jeff Hawkins proposes a theory centered around the neocortex about how the brain works. He argues that in order to build intelligent machines that work we should understand intelligence in the brain first.According to the theory, the brain is a prediction machine composed of a hierarchial system of memory and invariant representations of the world around us. The neocortex recieves sensory inputs through our five senses, these sensory information are processed identically in the brain no matter where they came from, they then enter the memory hierarchy that transfer these informations to higher parts in the hierarchy, which refine and give constant feedbacks to lower parts of the hierarchy,in an enless loop of error refinement,until finally, when the brain recieves the clearest picture of what is happening around it. Our neocortex predicts the future based on the analogies of the past( previous experiences and learnings). Jeff Hawkins wants us to think of intelligence not only in terms of external behaviour but rather, in terms of brain processes happening internally, which shouldn't necessarily be obvious in external human behaviours. Jeff Hawkins says that the potential to build intelligent machines that are way smarter than us humans is pretty high and would benefit us immensely if we understood first how we do it right."
226,0805078533,http://goodreads.com/user/show/21518138-paulynn-yu,4,"I've been interested in neurobiology lately as I delve into the field of machine learning and think about my past readings in psychology / emotional science. I was looking for a book that would give me some working model of how the cortex works and how it is comparable to how machine / deep learning is being practiced today. This book did a 1st class job in giving a working model of the cortex; I appreciate how there are large sections of just the biology part without being yet muddled with philosophical debates and applications. I am studying how the brain works generally, but it was great to have a focused book on the cortex, difficulties in understanding the brain, memory-prediction hypothesis of intelligence.He holds the Chinese Room Argument in the book. And while I appreciate and agree with the analogy, I was slightly taken aback about his claims on current inferiority of machine learning technology in many areas one of which is image recognition which I find is untrue. Additionally, I think his claims on human consciousness and whether humans have a soul or we die with our brain crosses the line on what you can claim scientifically about the spiritual realm. It's an educational book for sure, but do take some claims with a pinch of salt."
227,0805078533,http://goodreads.com/user/show/65204196-dan-riaz,4,"Great read for those interested in learning more about the brain, and theories of it's underlying structures. Note, this book is primarily focused on the neocortex, the thin layer resting atop the brain that scientists believe is responsible for so much of higher-level human thought (including consciousness and self-awareness). While the author discusses widely known concepts such as plasticity, the primary focus is on the anatomy of the neocortex, and a theory of the neural architecture that attempts to explain it's remarkable ability to create intelligence. While this may sound like a dull affair, the author is incredibly provocative. The general simplicity of his ideas elicits an intuitive understanding of his core theory. Without going into great depths, his key thesis is that intelligence is nothing more than memory, and more specifically our ability to leverage our memories to make predictions about the world around us. Definitely offers a new perspective on the value of experience. Not much else to say here other than go and buy it if you enjoy scientific theory, and are curious about the inner-workings of the human brain. Won't be disappointed."
228,0805078533,http://goodreads.com/user/show/69313297-jina,4,"I actually found this book incredibly fascinating. While I admittedly have a very basic understand of the brain, it’s interesting to think about the neocortex working the way Jeff Hawkins suggests. He goes into great detail on how the neocortex most likely behaves under certain circumstances ; explains things such as imagination, thought, creativity and stereotyping; and acknowledges that these are manifested in every one differently not only because the neocortex evolves according to our life experiences, but also because everyone has a slightly different brain for genetic reasons. We’re visually drawn to people with deformities because our neocortex has detected a prediction error. Once you start to try to break down your human experience and see the world the way he has described you are, it’s a bit mind boggling. While other scientists might find Jeff Hawkins overly obsessed (to the point of delusion) with the functions of the neocortex, I can’t say that I finished the book with the same impression. "
229,0805078533,http://goodreads.com/user/show/69150535-kyle,4,"This book explores a new model of intelligence. The book is fascinating, and presents a compelling solution to the intelligence problem. The book is easy to follow, and presents the author's theory in a concise manner. The theory explored makes a lot of sense and overall I would absolutely recommend this book to anyone who is interested in artificial intelligence and cognition in general.The reason I did not give this book 5 stars is the author's attitude. Throughout the book there is an air of condescension, the author views his intelligence model as the last word in the field, and seems to view other theoretical neuroscientists and the field as a whole as being ignorant for largely not recognizing his theory as ""fact"". Early on the author compares his theory to Einstein's theory of relativity, and while he may be correct, the self association comes off as self absorbed and egotistic.The author does not hold a doctorate in any neuroscience field."

A fascinating book and well presented (even if Hawkins is a little full of himself). Especially noteworthy because despite several neuroscience classes, I have yet to come across the importance of predictions or really the function of the neocortex beyond vision/language/memory. Wonder how much an impact this had on the field because it seems visionary but more or less grounded. The parts on AI are also interesting, especially the analysis of a field that focuses primarily on behavior and machines acting like humans as opposed to intelligent thought processes (which comes down to machines learning to predict and store memories and learn).Hard to believe this was published over 10 years ago, and a really interesting read about intelligence/AI/the neocortex."

Hawkins spends too much time bragging about his accomplishments in personal computers so that you'll believe him even when he provides little evidence for some of his claims. For example, he mentions that we should not fear artificial intelligence because people were scared of computers and nothing bad happened from the growth of computers. Many people would beg to differ with the latter part of that statement, but he does not acknowledge this and instead continues to say that artificial intelligence could not possibly result in any negative consequences. He also doesn't do a great job explaining consciousness or emotion, which are crucial aspects of intelligence and provide significant barriers to creating Turing-test-passing machines."

Jeff Hawkins presents his theories around four attributes of ne0cortex handling inputs from external world through sequences, hierarchies, auto-association and invariant forms. He gives day to day examples and makes it simple for anyone to understand the theory he is proposing. He ends the book summarizing on how far we are from building the AI system that is more close to real intelligence.  Good read for someone who is interested in the area of AI. The ideas might help build a better AI system.  Probably adding example's of current AI system, then comparing their working with the human brain and highlighting in detail the missing parts would have kept me more interested in some of the pages in the middle."

Jeff Hawkins declares his theory in the following (as understood by me) postulates:The entire cortex is a memory system. The neocortex stores sequences of patterns. The neocortex recalls patterns auto-associatively.The neocortex stores patterns in an invariant form.The neocortex stores patterns in a hierarchy.Although brain scientists and neurobiology experts may find his theory or some parts of it controversial, being not a brain scientist I believe that intelligent machines, as described in a book including upcoming fixes, are the future if technology.Special thanks to mr.

Today, after much mulling over of the contents in the book, I sought to read any critiques or reviews of the book I could find online. After reading a couple of the reviews here, I have been deservedly brought down from my high horse. Passion for an idea is a great thing, except when it clouds the scientific method. Perhaps the merit in Mr. Hawkins book lies precisely in its ability to inspire passion for the first time in those that may then, so impassioned, commit themselves to these questions."

Further, he reiterates the point that understanding of brain is needed for designing intelligent (not humanlike) machines. His theory on neocortex and memory prediction framework is interesting. Memory prediction framework has been used in anomaly detection since the past two years. As he says, technology is changing and improving every second so the findings are not yet complete and it is updated with time.

Also gives predictions and insight into the future, some of which already turned out to be true.But all these are not that important and would not warrant the ratings given.

That said, everyone today fundamentally understands that this is different in nature than human intelligence.

246,0805078533,http://goodreads.com/user/show/71935584-ben-zimmerman,4,"It's hard to rate ""On Intelligence"" now in 2020 because on the one hand, it seems remarkable to me that this was written in 2004, and I really wish I came across it then, but on the other hand, parts of it have not aged very well, particularly in regards to the limitations and potential of A.I.I was in high school in 2004, and now I am a neuroscientist almost 4 years out of obtaining my Ph.D. In that time period, I spent a lot of time thinking about a lot of the same questions that Jeff Hawkins presents in this book, and like him, I felt like it was often like being on a treasure hunt in the neuroscience literature to find the clues that point to some more overarching theory on cognition. Not once in this time did I hear about the existence of this book. At least in the academic literature, I think that better and more comprehensive accounts exist now for thinking about intelligence that include important mechanisms to intelligence and cognition are somewhat ignored in this book (primarily theories that incorporate attention and goal representation and more nuanced views of the mechanisms involved in the hippocampal learning). However, I found myself wishing SO BADLY that I read this when I was 16 instead of 32. I still don't think I've come across a better book for explaining basics about how the brain works to a lay audience.The framework is pretty correct from a modern perspective, but it's hard to tell from the book exactly which parts Jeff Hawkins believes are his original ideas and how much he believes are older ideas that he is explaining. I think that he might take credit for more than he should, although it's hard to think back to what was available in 2004 and to know the degree that others were thinking in a similar way. A really interesting part of reading this book now is how much A.I. research has changed from 2004. Hawkins says that he lived through the ""rise and fall"" of neural networks, and that only a cortex-like architecture of implementing intelligence has a chance of doing things like describing visual scenes, directing smart cars, or doing speech-to-text. Now that these exact sort of problems are either solved or on the verge of being solved by modern implementations of neural nets, I wonder how much his view has changed. He might say that neural nets adapted to incorporate some cortical features, and that's why they kind of work, or he might concede that neural nets do better with big data and big computational resources and novel engineering ideas (like the neural net engineers contended all along). He also is not worried in any way whatsoever about A.I. being dangerous, which seems absurd today. The later chapters, including those about A.I. and also about consciousness and creativity, leave a lot to be desired, but the beginning chapters represent some of the best descriptions of how the brain works for a lay audience that I've ever heard. I kept thinking as I was reading it, ""oh, this is a great way to explain this concept!"" I'm looking forward to reading his new book next year when it comes out, and maybe I'll be as obsessed with it as I'm sure I would have been with this book if I had read it in 2004."
247,0805078533,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3286533-jurij-fedorov,2,"ReviewIt's a book introducing the very basics of thinking. Now, I'm not sure what level you need to be at to enjoy this book. On one hand it's super simple and basic and easy to read/listen to if you love this topic. On the other hand it's so basic that it's mostly air. Any biological psychology textbook is endlessly deeper than this. It's basically taking 10% of a biological psychology textbook and making it into a very long philosophical argument.What I don't get is why I would need an introduction to the fact that the brain has memory and that the future will have some form of AI that we can't predict yet? It's so vague and fluffy that it's just basic stuff people think about at home. This expert doesn't know more about the brain than anyone else in the technology sector. It's not his fault it's just that there is not much to tell besides the basics unless you start talking about experiments which he doesn't do.At least comparative psychology could have told us more about the brain. Or just any brain scan experiments. What he has to say is either basic stuff like humans having a memory or his 5 layers of neocortex theory. The latter is something new to me but without any visual guide I don't really see how this all looks like. His theory would be endlessly better presented in a short visual YouTube video than in a book. It feels like he is trying to act smart in this book or something. But maybe he is just trying to introduce super focused intellectual laymen to his theories of thinking? Would they fall for this snake oil and think this is really the forefront of psychology? Vague philosophical ideas about neurons is all we know? Not really. This is not just a philosophical topic. It's a research area… for some people.ConclusionPersonally I didn't really learn anything new from this book. I also didn't quite refresh my knowledge on anything. It's a loose intro to thinking in the brain but it's stuff I don't really think anyone doesn't know already. Who doesn't know the brain uses memory to predict events? And then if he wanted to explain it in a deeper way why doesn't he use clear examples of the instinct failing in real life? Just thinking about how basic but yet complicated this book is makes me irritated. I'm not demanding super deep stuff. I just want something that's not stuff a 6th grade student could think up in a similar way but with less flashy language.I guess I'm not pro flashy simplified philosophy for the sake of it. I do need something I can actually think about.I still think it may be a good read for some readers as I have seen some people praise it. But I frankly don't understand it. One thing that's good about it is that it's actually fairly understandable English. Which is not a given for philosophy books. So 2 stars."
248,0805078533,http://goodreads.com/user/show/91261074-chris-esposo,4,"Although the book is dated with respect to it’s narrative on the technology (originally published in 2004 before the advent of web 2.0 and the deep learning movement -or even the broader movement of machine learning in enterprise/society that preclude the DNN trend), it’s still a worthwhile read, especially for those who want to gain a more biologically-driven understanding of how one may try engineer intelligence (artificial or otherwise). The author, who developed the Palm Pilot, a proto-tablet/mobile assistant device, in the 90s, came into the study of AI via biophysics, which though is unusual in the modern era, where most AI/ML researchers either have an explicit background in computing, or applied mathematics, in the decade of the 50-80s, the name of the game was to build AI via mimicking the structure of biological intelligence. For those who would like to know more about the history of this era with respect to AI/ML, I’d highly recommend the recently published “Deep Learning Revolution” by Terrance Sejnowski, there’s some overlap with the historical material covered in this book, but I view the two books as complementary. This background in biology manifests itself in the author’s central thesis, which is that the human mind is a “prediction machine”, and that the “hierarchical structures” of the neuronal network is what enables learning for the mind. Further, certain pathologies of this prediction-prone organ can be explained by the mind incorrectly predicting an event. This idea seems sound, and it makes sense that the mind is constantly making predictions, and if wasn’t the case, there would be a noticeable addition in latency to our internal operations that would prevent us from acting the way we do. A rough analog to this could be current “real-time” web apps like Uber, which is able to cut the process-time of you requesting a ride, and a ride being hailed to you, by constantly processing prediction scores on the likelihood of you hailing a ride at any given moment. I think one would get much more out of this book if they had studied brain structure prior (or came to the book with some rudimentary background). Though the author makes a good effort of explaining the hierarchical structures he discusses via diagrams and description, I never fully felt I understood the science behind that biology. Still, it’s a rare thing for a book to be hitting 15 years of age and still be somewhat relevant in a field like AI, and so this speaks well to the ideas and the way it was laid out by the author. Definitely a recommend for those who are studying this subject matter and/or working in industry."
249,0805078533,http://goodreads.com/user/show/47755613-scott,4,"“Intelligence” is a frequently used word, but it is a very difficult and complicated one to define. The author of this book makes what could be very complicated subject matter easy to understand for the lay person, but the topics can also be enjoyed by those in the field of artificial intelligence (AI). He uses common words to explain difficult subject matter, and warns the reader of the one or two chapters where things get very technical. I appreciated his use of understandable illustrations along with examples making it easier for me to comprehend and appreciate the subject matter.“On Intelligence”, written by Jeff Hawkins and Sandra Blakeslee, was a surprise find for me while doing research on the topic of AI. I was searching for books covering the subject from a primer level, however I was intrigued by the author’s premise from the book’s description. I wanted to note that the majority of the book is expertly and professionally narrated by Stefan Rudnicki with a few sections voiced by Jeff Hawkins himself. The author comes to the subject matter with a vast amount of knowledge and study in the field of intelligence. He also comes to the table with a large knowledge of technology and the technology industry. He was the inventor of the PalmPilot along with other software accomplishments under his name. The author quickly setups up the difficulties of defining the word “intelligence” because it would be hard to have an “AI” without first understanding what intelligence is. As stated earlier, this is a difficult word to define and it really depends on who you ask this question too. A technologist will tell you one thing, a biologist another, and a psychologist another, etc. Mr. Hawkins takes a different approach to how others have defined it, and the remaining chapters of the book lay out his arguments.I thought it humbling the author said that his own premise may be flawed in areas needing additional study, and he is willing to modify his beliefs based on new data or details. I will say that after listening to the book, I will not think of intelligence in the same way, and I’m sure while continuing my research on the subject of AI, I will be passing any new details thought the framework given in the book. Regarding the narration of the book, as I stated earlier, it was professionally done. The narrator currently has over 531 others titles he has participated in voicing. There were no audio artifacts or issues I detected while listening and I have listed to other books by this narrator which I have enjoyed very much."
250,0805078533,http://goodreads.com/user/show/215221-bria,2,"This has been on my to-read list after a recommendation something like a decade ago, so I figured I'd better go check it off, although I wasn't all that excited about it. A pop-sci book written by someone outside of their expertise - there's nothing I love more than reading about some dude's life story and how nobody recognized their genius! Not to mention the sloppiness - when trying to illustrate how his ideas were so much better than those of competing companies, he tells a story about a company that he wasn't impressed by, despite its grand claims, but ends with sentence ""I think Nestor went out of business"". You think so? You can't be bothered to check? Why do research when you can just write whatever fits your narrative?But I trudged on and once he shut the hell up about himself and about how brilliant and misunderstood he is and just actually talked about the brain, it really picked up. You get to actually learn a bit about some brain structure, as long as you're satisfied learning only through vague analogies, and honestly, his whole framework of how the brain works really sounded like the predictive coding theory, which I've mostly read about on SlateStarCodex - https://slatestarcodex.com/2017/09/05... - but have also seen various versions of other places I read about the brain and consciousness. So it seems plausible that this is the direction neuroscience has been moving in over the past 15 years, but I don't actually know - I tried to go search around to see what's happened since he wrote this book. I did like that he had specific predictions - many many points to you, sir! - but the wikipedia page on this book only mentioned any follow up at all for two of them. And what else I found about him and his work wasn't very promising - he's still riding the misunderstand genius wave, founding a company so he can do the research he wants without being bothered by people who don't get him. Well, let's hope what I learned about the brain from this book was more or less in the right direction, in which case it probably wasn't a waste of time."
251,0805078533,http://goodreads.com/user/show/11936064-djcb,4,"Jeff Hawkins, famous for creating the Palm Pilot and some other technology, is also deeply interested in neuro-science. Furthermore, he thinks that the most viable path to artificial intelligence is through understanding (parts of) the human brain, rather than through bottom-up programming (as in classical-AI) or various neural-network (NN) approaches (though inspired by early brain research, the NN approach took its own path with little regard for the advances in neurology).So, what's one to do then? Jeff Hawkins came up with his own theory about how the brain works, of which the core is that your brain works in hierarchically ordered memory, where each layer n abstracts the information from layer n-1 and involves layer n+1 when there's something unexpected. Crucially, layer n gives feedback to layer n-1 so the 'unexpected' becomes less so -- ""learning"". So from, say, the retina the next layers register movement, edges, and further up the hierarchy (hard to describe what each of these layer perceives in normal language) and depending on how ""unexpected"" the information is, it could bubble up to some concept (""dog"").Hawkins makes it sound plausible, but is true? Though Hawkins is a wealthy technologist outside academia but he is not a crank. He has seriously thought about this, and comes up with testable predictions; moreover, he tries to implement his model in a computer - through his company Numenta. The book is from 2005, but I don't think we can see to what extent his model is correct -- however, the Numenta software based on his model competes with software based on ""traditional"" NN-models -- the ""deep learning"" software of today, which is much stronger and useful than their 2005 predecessors against which Hawkins argues.Regardless, interesting read. Hawkins can come off as a tad... self-confident here and there... but on a scale of 1 to Wolfram/Taleb, it's not too bad. "
252,0805078533,http://goodreads.com/user/show/71924987-payel-kundu,3,"I read this book as part of my neuroscience book club. Hawkins’s perspective as an entrepreneur and computer expert differs from that of most popular neuroscience book authors, who tend to be either neuroscientists or journalists. He makes it clear from the outset that he’s always had a fascination with the workings of the brain. He begins by outlining why he thinks previous attempts to create truly intelligent machines have failed: mainly that computers don’t really learn new things, they just store information without the ability to use that information later. This is very different from the brain, which as sensory information comes in it is combined with existing memories so that the new information fits into an existing framework. The neocortex is made up of multiple layers, one on top of the other, and information from the senses travels through these layers, each adding increasingly detailed prior knowledge to the raw sensory information. Thus, Hawkins contends that to build truly intelligent machines, we have to first understand the human brain. While the brain (Hawkins thinks the neocortex is our real concern here and so uses these terms interchangeably) seems irreducibly complicated at first, Hawkins is encouraged by the fact that the neocortex is organized into consistent columns which all seem to use the same processing algorithm. So if we solve that algorithm once, it will unlock a great deal of understanding about how the brain processes information. Since this book was written in 2004, I’m not sure how much of the AI portion is still relevant. Hawkins has several predictions about machine intelligence, some of which turned out not to be true in light of innovations like neural networks and machine learning. I’d like to see an updated version of his thoughts on machine intelligence given the technology we have today. Luckily, he’s coming out with a new book in a few months, and I’m looking forward to reading it. "

I dont have the qualifications or expertise to vet these claims, but considering that 10 years after the book's publication we still do not have 'intelligent' machines makes it at least a little suspect.That said, this book is certainly well-researched and Jeff Hawkins has certainly spent a great deal of time and effort into ensuring that he knows what he is talking about. Will be interested to see what a neuroscientist or researcher in the field has to say about the theory and its ramifications.My only complaint with the book itself was the fact that the author proceeds far too slowly and methodically. He puts forward a point or argument and after 2 analogies, I have a pretty clear idea as to what he is talking about. There are 3 or 4 more analogies for the same argument after that, which made me want to throw the book at the wall. This beating of the dead horse was my only crib with the book, which is why I give it 4 stars."
254,0805078533,http://goodreads.com/user/show/54514199-gaurav-chhaparwal,4,"It's surprising how far we are from understanding the workings of our brain and what is the source of human intelligence. Author rightfully brings out the concern that the current programs based on artificial intelligence / machine learning / neural nets are pre- disposed to be specialized for a specific task like understanding vision, language etc. by using specific understanding of humans or massive amount of pattern matching and are not a 'general purpose intelligence'. Author also very nicely brings out the definition of intelligence to be 'ability to predict' and not 'ability to demonstrate behavior similar to intelligent beings (humans)'. A general purpose intelligence', like humans, should be able to learn to predict by being exposed to patterns in the available sensory data. The author also builds up a good case for suggesting that the way our brain provides us intelligence is using a 'memory prediction framework' based on memories stored hierarchically in our neo cortex and not by doing massive amounts of computing the way most current machines are being tried to be made intelligent. While author tries to go get very deep into how human brains work, that part of the book seems to be unnecessary and a force-fit given the very limited verifiability or even need of it as a premise. The book is a good read overall primarily because like any good book, it makes you wonder and realize how little you know. In this case, something so core to us - our intelligence. "
255,0805078533,http://goodreads.com/user/show/41433998-mohamad-ahmad,3,"Jeff Hawkins proposes a theory centered around the neocortex about how the brain works. He argues that in order to build intelligent machines that work we should understand intelligence in the brain first.According to the theory, the brain is a prediction machine composed of a hierarchial system of memory and invariant representations of the world around us. The neocortex recieves sensory inputs through our five senses, these sensory information are processed identically in the brain no matter where they came from, they then enter the memory hierarchy that transfer these informations to higher parts in the hierarchy, which refine and give constant feedbacks to lower parts of the hierarchy,in an enless loop of error refinement,until finally, when the brain recieves the clearest picture of what is happening around it. Our neocortex predicts the future based on the analogies of the past( previous experiences and learnings). Jeff Hawkins wants us to think of intelligence not only in terms of external behaviour but rather, in terms of brain processes happening internally, which shouldn't necessarily be obvious in external human behaviours. Jeff Hawkins says that the potential to build intelligent machines that are way smarter than us humans is pretty high and would benefit us immensely if we understood first how we do it right."

I was looking for a book that would give me some working model of how the cortex works and how it is comparable to how machine / deep learning is being practiced today. This book did a 1st class job in giving a working model of the cortex; I appreciate how there are large sections of just the biology part without being yet muddled with philosophical debates and applications. I am studying how the brain works generally, but it was great to have a focused book on the cortex, difficulties in understanding the brain, memory-prediction hypothesis of intelligence.He holds the Chinese Room Argument in the book. And while I appreciate and agree with the analogy, I was slightly taken aback about his claims on current inferiority of machine learning technology in many areas one of which is image recognition which I find is untrue. Additionally, I think his claims on human consciousness and whether humans have a soul or we die with our brain crosses the line on what you can claim scientifically about the spiritual realm. It's an educational book for sure, but do take some claims with a pinch of salt."

Note, this book is primarily focused on the neocortex, the thin layer resting atop the brain that scientists believe is responsible for so much of higher-level human thought (including consciousness and self-awareness). While the author discusses widely known concepts such as plasticity, the primary focus is on the anatomy of the neocortex, and a theory of the neural architecture that attempts to explain it's remarkable ability to create intelligence. While this may sound like a dull affair, the author is incredibly provocative. The general simplicity of his ideas elicits an intuitive understanding of his core theory. Without going into great depths, his key thesis is that intelligence is nothing more than memory, and more specifically our ability to leverage our memories to make predictions about the world around us. Definitely offers a new perspective on the value of experience. Not much else to say here other than go and buy it if you enjoy scientific theory, and are curious about the inner-workings of the human brain. Won't be disappointed."

While I admittedly have a very basic understand of the brain, it’s interesting to think about the neocortex working the way Jeff Hawkins suggests. He goes into great detail on how the neocortex most likely behaves under certain circumstances ; explains things such as imagination, thought, creativity and stereotyping; and acknowledges that these are manifested in every one differently not only because the neocortex evolves according to our life experiences, but also because everyone has a slightly different brain for genetic reasons. We’re visually drawn to people with deformities because our neocortex has detected a prediction error. Once you start to try to break down your human experience and see the world the way he has described you are, it’s a bit mind boggling. While other scientists might find Jeff Hawkins overly obsessed (to the point of delusion) with the functions of the neocortex, I can’t say that I finished the book with the same impression. "

The book is easy to follow, and presents the author's theory in a concise manner. The theory explored makes a lot of sense and overall I would absolutely recommend this book to anyone who is interested in artificial intelligence and cognition in general.The reason I did not give this book 5 stars is the author's attitude. Throughout the book there is an air of condescension, the author views his intelligence model as the last word in the field, and seems to view other theoretical neuroscientists and the field as a whole as being ignorant for largely not recognizing his theory as ""fact"". Early on the author compares his theory to Einstein's theory of relativity, and while he may be correct, the self association comes off as self absorbed and egotistic.The author does not hold a doctorate in any neuroscience field."

A fascinating book and well presented (even if Hawkins is a little full of himself). Especially noteworthy because despite several neuroscience classes, I have yet to come across the importance of predictions or really the function of the neocortex beyond vision/language/memory. Wonder how much an impact this had on the field because it seems visionary but more or less grounded. The parts on AI are also interesting, especially the analysis of a field that focuses primarily on behavior and machines acting like humans as opposed to intelligent thought processes (which comes down to machines learning to predict and store memories and learn).Hard to believe this was published over 10 years ago, and a really interesting read about intelligence/AI/the neocortex."

Hawkins spends too much time bragging about his accomplishments in personal computers so that you'll believe him even when he provides little evidence for some of his claims. For example, he mentions that we should not fear artificial intelligence because people were scared of computers and nothing bad happened from the growth of computers. Many people would beg to differ with the latter part of that statement, but he does not acknowledge this and instead continues to say that artificial intelligence could not possibly result in any negative consequences. He also doesn't do a great job explaining consciousness or emotion, which are crucial aspects of intelligence and provide significant barriers to creating Turing-test-passing machines."

Jeff Hawkins presents his theories around four attributes of ne0cortex handling inputs from external world through sequences, hierarchies, auto-association and invariant forms. He gives day to day examples and makes it simple for anyone to understand the theory he is proposing. He ends the book summarizing on how far we are from building the AI system that is more close to real intelligence.  Good read for someone who is interested in the area of AI. The ideas might help build a better AI system.  Probably adding example's of current AI system, then comparing their working with the human brain and highlighting in detail the missing parts would have kept me more interested in some of the pages in the middle."

The neocortex recalls patterns auto-associatively.The neocortex stores patterns in an invariant form.The neocortex stores patterns in a hierarchy.Although brain scientists and neurobiology experts may find his theory or some parts of it controversial, being not a brain scientist I believe that intelligent machines, as described in a book including upcoming fixes, are the future if technology.Special thanks to mr.

Today, after much mulling over of the contents in the book, I sought to read any critiques or reviews of the book I could find online. After reading a couple of the reviews here, I have been deservedly brought down from my high horse. Passion for an idea is a great thing, except when it clouds the scientific method. Perhaps the merit in Mr. Hawkins book lies precisely in its ability to inspire passion for the first time in those that may then, so impassioned, commit themselves to these questions."

Also gives predictions and insight into the future, some of which already turned out to be true.But all these are not that important and would not warrant the ratings given.

276,0805078533,http://goodreads.com/user/show/71935584-ben-zimmerman,4,"It's hard to rate ""On Intelligence"" now in 2020 because on the one hand, it seems remarkable to me that this was written in 2004, and I really wish I came across it then, but on the other hand, parts of it have not aged very well, particularly in regards to the limitations and potential of A.I.I was in high school in 2004, and now I am a neuroscientist almost 4 years out of obtaining my Ph.D. In that time period, I spent a lot of time thinking about a lot of the same questions that Jeff Hawkins presents in this book, and like him, I felt like it was often like being on a treasure hunt in the neuroscience literature to find the clues that point to some more overarching theory on cognition. Not once in this time did I hear about the existence of this book. At least in the academic literature, I think that better and more comprehensive accounts exist now for thinking about intelligence that include important mechanisms to intelligence and cognition are somewhat ignored in this book (primarily theories that incorporate attention and goal representation and more nuanced views of the mechanisms involved in the hippocampal learning). However, I found myself wishing SO BADLY that I read this when I was 16 instead of 32. I still don't think I've come across a better book for explaining basics about how the brain works to a lay audience.The framework is pretty correct from a modern perspective, but it's hard to tell from the book exactly which parts Jeff Hawkins believes are his original ideas and how much he believes are older ideas that he is explaining. I think that he might take credit for more than he should, although it's hard to think back to what was available in 2004 and to know the degree that others were thinking in a similar way. A really interesting part of reading this book now is how much A.I. research has changed from 2004. Hawkins says that he lived through the ""rise and fall"" of neural networks, and that only a cortex-like architecture of implementing intelligence has a chance of doing things like describing visual scenes, directing smart cars, or doing speech-to-text. Now that these exact sort of problems are either solved or on the verge of being solved by modern implementations of neural nets, I wonder how much his view has changed. He might say that neural nets adapted to incorporate some cortical features, and that's why they kind of work, or he might concede that neural nets do better with big data and big computational resources and novel engineering ideas (like the neural net engineers contended all along). He also is not worried in any way whatsoever about A.I. being dangerous, which seems absurd today. The later chapters, including those about A.I. and also about consciousness and creativity, leave a lot to be desired, but the beginning chapters represent some of the best descriptions of how the brain works for a lay audience that I've ever heard. I kept thinking as I was reading it, ""oh, this is a great way to explain this concept!"" I'm looking forward to reading his new book next year when it comes out, and maybe I'll be as obsessed with it as I'm sure I would have been with this book if I had read it in 2004."
277,0805078533,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3286533-jurij-fedorov,2,"ReviewIt's a book introducing the very basics of thinking. Now, I'm not sure what level you need to be at to enjoy this book. On one hand it's super simple and basic and easy to read/listen to if you love this topic. On the other hand it's so basic that it's mostly air. Any biological psychology textbook is endlessly deeper than this. It's basically taking 10% of a biological psychology textbook and making it into a very long philosophical argument.What I don't get is why I would need an introduction to the fact that the brain has memory and that the future will have some form of AI that we can't predict yet? It's so vague and fluffy that it's just basic stuff people think about at home. This expert doesn't know more about the brain than anyone else in the technology sector. It's not his fault it's just that there is not much to tell besides the basics unless you start talking about experiments which he doesn't do.At least comparative psychology could have told us more about the brain. Or just any brain scan experiments. What he has to say is either basic stuff like humans having a memory or his 5 layers of neocortex theory. The latter is something new to me but without any visual guide I don't really see how this all looks like. His theory would be endlessly better presented in a short visual YouTube video than in a book. It feels like he is trying to act smart in this book or something. But maybe he is just trying to introduce super focused intellectual laymen to his theories of thinking? Would they fall for this snake oil and think this is really the forefront of psychology? Vague philosophical ideas about neurons is all we know? Not really. This is not just a philosophical topic. It's a research area… for some people.ConclusionPersonally I didn't really learn anything new from this book. I also didn't quite refresh my knowledge on anything. It's a loose intro to thinking in the brain but it's stuff I don't really think anyone doesn't know already. Who doesn't know the brain uses memory to predict events? And then if he wanted to explain it in a deeper way why doesn't he use clear examples of the instinct failing in real life? Just thinking about how basic but yet complicated this book is makes me irritated. I'm not demanding super deep stuff. I just want something that's not stuff a 6th grade student could think up in a similar way but with less flashy language.I guess I'm not pro flashy simplified philosophy for the sake of it. I do need something I can actually think about.I still think it may be a good read for some readers as I have seen some people praise it. But I frankly don't understand it. One thing that's good about it is that it's actually fairly understandable English. Which is not a given for philosophy books. So 2 stars."
278,0805078533,http://goodreads.com/user/show/91261074-chris-esposo,4,"Although the book is dated with respect to it’s narrative on the technology (originally published in 2004 before the advent of web 2.0 and the deep learning movement -or even the broader movement of machine learning in enterprise/society that preclude the DNN trend), it’s still a worthwhile read, especially for those who want to gain a more biologically-driven understanding of how one may try engineer intelligence (artificial or otherwise). The author, who developed the Palm Pilot, a proto-tablet/mobile assistant device, in the 90s, came into the study of AI via biophysics, which though is unusual in the modern era, where most AI/ML researchers either have an explicit background in computing, or applied mathematics, in the decade of the 50-80s, the name of the game was to build AI via mimicking the structure of biological intelligence. For those who would like to know more about the history of this era with respect to AI/ML, I’d highly recommend the recently published “Deep Learning Revolution” by Terrance Sejnowski, there’s some overlap with the historical material covered in this book, but I view the two books as complementary. This background in biology manifests itself in the author’s central thesis, which is that the human mind is a “prediction machine”, and that the “hierarchical structures” of the neuronal network is what enables learning for the mind. Further, certain pathologies of this prediction-prone organ can be explained by the mind incorrectly predicting an event. This idea seems sound, and it makes sense that the mind is constantly making predictions, and if wasn’t the case, there would be a noticeable addition in latency to our internal operations that would prevent us from acting the way we do. A rough analog to this could be current “real-time” web apps like Uber, which is able to cut the process-time of you requesting a ride, and a ride being hailed to you, by constantly processing prediction scores on the likelihood of you hailing a ride at any given moment. I think one would get much more out of this book if they had studied brain structure prior (or came to the book with some rudimentary background). Though the author makes a good effort of explaining the hierarchical structures he discusses via diagrams and description, I never fully felt I understood the science behind that biology. Still, it’s a rare thing for a book to be hitting 15 years of age and still be somewhat relevant in a field like AI, and so this speaks well to the ideas and the way it was laid out by the author. Definitely a recommend for those who are studying this subject matter and/or working in industry."
279,0805078533,http://goodreads.com/user/show/47755613-scott,4,"“Intelligence” is a frequently used word, but it is a very difficult and complicated one to define. The author of this book makes what could be very complicated subject matter easy to understand for the lay person, but the topics can also be enjoyed by those in the field of artificial intelligence (AI). He uses common words to explain difficult subject matter, and warns the reader of the one or two chapters where things get very technical. I appreciated his use of understandable illustrations along with examples making it easier for me to comprehend and appreciate the subject matter.“On Intelligence”, written by Jeff Hawkins and Sandra Blakeslee, was a surprise find for me while doing research on the topic of AI. I was searching for books covering the subject from a primer level, however I was intrigued by the author’s premise from the book’s description. I wanted to note that the majority of the book is expertly and professionally narrated by Stefan Rudnicki with a few sections voiced by Jeff Hawkins himself. The author comes to the subject matter with a vast amount of knowledge and study in the field of intelligence. He also comes to the table with a large knowledge of technology and the technology industry. He was the inventor of the PalmPilot along with other software accomplishments under his name. The author quickly setups up the difficulties of defining the word “intelligence” because it would be hard to have an “AI” without first understanding what intelligence is. As stated earlier, this is a difficult word to define and it really depends on who you ask this question too. A technologist will tell you one thing, a biologist another, and a psychologist another, etc. Mr. Hawkins takes a different approach to how others have defined it, and the remaining chapters of the book lay out his arguments.I thought it humbling the author said that his own premise may be flawed in areas needing additional study, and he is willing to modify his beliefs based on new data or details. I will say that after listening to the book, I will not think of intelligence in the same way, and I’m sure while continuing my research on the subject of AI, I will be passing any new details thought the framework given in the book. Regarding the narration of the book, as I stated earlier, it was professionally done. The narrator currently has over 531 others titles he has participated in voicing. There were no audio artifacts or issues I detected while listening and I have listed to other books by this narrator which I have enjoyed very much."
280,0805078533,http://goodreads.com/user/show/215221-bria,2,"This has been on my to-read list after a recommendation something like a decade ago, so I figured I'd better go check it off, although I wasn't all that excited about it. A pop-sci book written by someone outside of their expertise - there's nothing I love more than reading about some dude's life story and how nobody recognized their genius! Not to mention the sloppiness - when trying to illustrate how his ideas were so much better than those of competing companies, he tells a story about a company that he wasn't impressed by, despite its grand claims, but ends with sentence ""I think Nestor went out of business"". You think so? You can't be bothered to check? Why do research when you can just write whatever fits your narrative?But I trudged on and once he shut the hell up about himself and about how brilliant and misunderstood he is and just actually talked about the brain, it really picked up. You get to actually learn a bit about some brain structure, as long as you're satisfied learning only through vague analogies, and honestly, his whole framework of how the brain works really sounded like the predictive coding theory, which I've mostly read about on SlateStarCodex - https://slatestarcodex.com/2017/09/05... - but have also seen various versions of other places I read about the brain and consciousness. So it seems plausible that this is the direction neuroscience has been moving in over the past 15 years, but I don't actually know - I tried to go search around to see what's happened since he wrote this book. I did like that he had specific predictions - many many points to you, sir! - but the wikipedia page on this book only mentioned any follow up at all for two of them. And what else I found about him and his work wasn't very promising - he's still riding the misunderstand genius wave, founding a company so he can do the research he wants without being bothered by people who don't get him. Well, let's hope what I learned about the brain from this book was more or less in the right direction, in which case it probably wasn't a waste of time."
281,0805078533,http://goodreads.com/user/show/11936064-djcb,4,"Jeff Hawkins, famous for creating the Palm Pilot and some other technology, is also deeply interested in neuro-science. Furthermore, he thinks that the most viable path to artificial intelligence is through understanding (parts of) the human brain, rather than through bottom-up programming (as in classical-AI) or various neural-network (NN) approaches (though inspired by early brain research, the NN approach took its own path with little regard for the advances in neurology).So, what's one to do then? Jeff Hawkins came up with his own theory about how the brain works, of which the core is that your brain works in hierarchically ordered memory, where each layer n abstracts the information from layer n-1 and involves layer n+1 when there's something unexpected. Crucially, layer n gives feedback to layer n-1 so the 'unexpected' becomes less so -- ""learning"". So from, say, the retina the next layers register movement, edges, and further up the hierarchy (hard to describe what each of these layer perceives in normal language) and depending on how ""unexpected"" the information is, it could bubble up to some concept (""dog"").Hawkins makes it sound plausible, but is true? Though Hawkins is a wealthy technologist outside academia but he is not a crank. He has seriously thought about this, and comes up with testable predictions; moreover, he tries to implement his model in a computer - through his company Numenta. The book is from 2005, but I don't think we can see to what extent his model is correct -- however, the Numenta software based on his model competes with software based on ""traditional"" NN-models -- the ""deep learning"" software of today, which is much stronger and useful than their 2005 predecessors against which Hawkins argues.Regardless, interesting read. Hawkins can come off as a tad... self-confident here and there... but on a scale of 1 to Wolfram/Taleb, it's not too bad. "
282,0805078533,http://goodreads.com/user/show/71924987-payel-kundu,3,"I read this book as part of my neuroscience book club. Hawkins’s perspective as an entrepreneur and computer expert differs from that of most popular neuroscience book authors, who tend to be either neuroscientists or journalists. He makes it clear from the outset that he’s always had a fascination with the workings of the brain. He begins by outlining why he thinks previous attempts to create truly intelligent machines have failed: mainly that computers don’t really learn new things, they just store information without the ability to use that information later. This is very different from the brain, which as sensory information comes in it is combined with existing memories so that the new information fits into an existing framework. The neocortex is made up of multiple layers, one on top of the other, and information from the senses travels through these layers, each adding increasingly detailed prior knowledge to the raw sensory information. Thus, Hawkins contends that to build truly intelligent machines, we have to first understand the human brain. While the brain (Hawkins thinks the neocortex is our real concern here and so uses these terms interchangeably) seems irreducibly complicated at first, Hawkins is encouraged by the fact that the neocortex is organized into consistent columns which all seem to use the same processing algorithm. So if we solve that algorithm once, it will unlock a great deal of understanding about how the brain processes information. Since this book was written in 2004, I’m not sure how much of the AI portion is still relevant. Hawkins has several predictions about machine intelligence, some of which turned out not to be true in light of innovations like neural networks and machine learning. I’d like to see an updated version of his thoughts on machine intelligence given the technology we have today. Luckily, he’s coming out with a new book in a few months, and I’m looking forward to reading it. "
283,0805078533,http://goodreads.com/user/show/27650260-anirudh,4,"I found this book fascinating with regards to the ideas it proposes regarding neuroscience, intelligence and intelligent machines. I have no background in this field and in that context, I found the theories contained within it to be worthy of consideration. The writing style was generally good and the author painstakingly ensures that this is accessible to the general public.Jeff Hawkins proposes a theory that he says is radical and has the potential to boost both neuroscience and AI. I dont have the qualifications or expertise to vet these claims, but considering that 10 years after the book's publication we still do not have 'intelligent' machines makes it at least a little suspect.That said, this book is certainly well-researched and Jeff Hawkins has certainly spent a great deal of time and effort into ensuring that he knows what he is talking about. Will be interested to see what a neuroscientist or researcher in the field has to say about the theory and its ramifications.My only complaint with the book itself was the fact that the author proceeds far too slowly and methodically. He puts forward a point or argument and after 2 analogies, I have a pretty clear idea as to what he is talking about. There are 3 or 4 more analogies for the same argument after that, which made me want to throw the book at the wall. This beating of the dead horse was my only crib with the book, which is why I give it 4 stars."
284,0805078533,http://goodreads.com/user/show/54514199-gaurav-chhaparwal,4,"It's surprising how far we are from understanding the workings of our brain and what is the source of human intelligence. Author rightfully brings out the concern that the current programs based on artificial intelligence / machine learning / neural nets are pre- disposed to be specialized for a specific task like understanding vision, language etc. by using specific understanding of humans or massive amount of pattern matching and are not a 'general purpose intelligence'. Author also very nicely brings out the definition of intelligence to be 'ability to predict' and not 'ability to demonstrate behavior similar to intelligent beings (humans)'. A general purpose intelligence', like humans, should be able to learn to predict by being exposed to patterns in the available sensory data. The author also builds up a good case for suggesting that the way our brain provides us intelligence is using a 'memory prediction framework' based on memories stored hierarchically in our neo cortex and not by doing massive amounts of computing the way most current machines are being tried to be made intelligent. While author tries to go get very deep into how human brains work, that part of the book seems to be unnecessary and a force-fit given the very limited verifiability or even need of it as a premise. The book is a good read overall primarily because like any good book, it makes you wonder and realize how little you know. In this case, something so core to us - our intelligence. "
285,0805078533,http://goodreads.com/user/show/41433998-mohamad-ahmad,3,"Jeff Hawkins proposes a theory centered around the neocortex about how the brain works. He argues that in order to build intelligent machines that work we should understand intelligence in the brain first.According to the theory, the brain is a prediction machine composed of a hierarchial system of memory and invariant representations of the world around us. The neocortex recieves sensory inputs through our five senses, these sensory information are processed identically in the brain no matter where they came from, they then enter the memory hierarchy that transfer these informations to higher parts in the hierarchy, which refine and give constant feedbacks to lower parts of the hierarchy,in an enless loop of error refinement,until finally, when the brain recieves the clearest picture of what is happening around it. Our neocortex predicts the future based on the analogies of the past( previous experiences and learnings). Jeff Hawkins wants us to think of intelligence not only in terms of external behaviour but rather, in terms of brain processes happening internally, which shouldn't necessarily be obvious in external human behaviours. Jeff Hawkins says that the potential to build intelligent machines that are way smarter than us humans is pretty high and would benefit us immensely if we understood first how we do it right."
286,0805078533,http://goodreads.com/user/show/21518138-paulynn-yu,4,"I've been interested in neurobiology lately as I delve into the field of machine learning and think about my past readings in psychology / emotional science. I was looking for a book that would give me some working model of how the cortex works and how it is comparable to how machine / deep learning is being practiced today. This book did a 1st class job in giving a working model of the cortex; I appreciate how there are large sections of just the biology part without being yet muddled with philosophical debates and applications. I am studying how the brain works generally, but it was great to have a focused book on the cortex, difficulties in understanding the brain, memory-prediction hypothesis of intelligence.He holds the Chinese Room Argument in the book. And while I appreciate and agree with the analogy, I was slightly taken aback about his claims on current inferiority of machine learning technology in many areas one of which is image recognition which I find is untrue. Additionally, I think his claims on human consciousness and whether humans have a soul or we die with our brain crosses the line on what you can claim scientifically about the spiritual realm. It's an educational book for sure, but do take some claims with a pinch of salt."
287,0805078533,http://goodreads.com/user/show/65204196-dan-riaz,4,"Great read for those interested in learning more about the brain, and theories of it's underlying structures. Note, this book is primarily focused on the neocortex, the thin layer resting atop the brain that scientists believe is responsible for so much of higher-level human thought (including consciousness and self-awareness). While the author discusses widely known concepts such as plasticity, the primary focus is on the anatomy of the neocortex, and a theory of the neural architecture that attempts to explain it's remarkable ability to create intelligence. While this may sound like a dull affair, the author is incredibly provocative. The general simplicity of his ideas elicits an intuitive understanding of his core theory. Without going into great depths, his key thesis is that intelligence is nothing more than memory, and more specifically our ability to leverage our memories to make predictions about the world around us. Definitely offers a new perspective on the value of experience. Not much else to say here other than go and buy it if you enjoy scientific theory, and are curious about the inner-workings of the human brain. Won't be disappointed."
288,0805078533,http://goodreads.com/user/show/69313297-jina,4,"I actually found this book incredibly fascinating. While I admittedly have a very basic understand of the brain, it’s interesting to think about the neocortex working the way Jeff Hawkins suggests. He goes into great detail on how the neocortex most likely behaves under certain circumstances ; explains things such as imagination, thought, creativity and stereotyping; and acknowledges that these are manifested in every one differently not only because the neocortex evolves according to our life experiences, but also because everyone has a slightly different brain for genetic reasons. We’re visually drawn to people with deformities because our neocortex has detected a prediction error. Once you start to try to break down your human experience and see the world the way he has described you are, it’s a bit mind boggling. While other scientists might find Jeff Hawkins overly obsessed (to the point of delusion) with the functions of the neocortex, I can’t say that I finished the book with the same impression. "
289,0805078533,http://goodreads.com/user/show/69150535-kyle,4,"This book explores a new model of intelligence. The book is fascinating, and presents a compelling solution to the intelligence problem. The book is easy to follow, and presents the author's theory in a concise manner. The theory explored makes a lot of sense and overall I would absolutely recommend this book to anyone who is interested in artificial intelligence and cognition in general.The reason I did not give this book 5 stars is the author's attitude. Throughout the book there is an air of condescension, the author views his intelligence model as the last word in the field, and seems to view other theoretical neuroscientists and the field as a whole as being ignorant for largely not recognizing his theory as ""fact"". Early on the author compares his theory to Einstein's theory of relativity, and while he may be correct, the self association comes off as self absorbed and egotistic.The author does not hold a doctorate in any neuroscience field."
290,0805078533,http://goodreads.com/user/show/54266689-christina,5," It is the ability to make predictions about the future that is the crux of intelligence.  A fascinating book and well presented (even if Hawkins is a little full of himself). Especially noteworthy because despite several neuroscience classes, I have yet to come across the importance of predictions or really the function of the neocortex beyond vision/language/memory. Wonder how much an impact this had on the field because it seems visionary but more or less grounded. The parts on AI are also interesting, especially the analysis of a field that focuses primarily on behavior and machines acting like humans as opposed to intelligent thought processes (which comes down to machines learning to predict and store memories and learn).Hard to believe this was published over 10 years ago, and a really interesting read about intelligence/AI/the neocortex."
291,0805078533,http://goodreads.com/user/show/66443200-william-levine,2,"Question begging and glosses over many of the concepts that would undermine his theory. Hawkins spends too much time bragging about his accomplishments in personal computers so that you'll believe him even when he provides little evidence for some of his claims. For example, he mentions that we should not fear artificial intelligence because people were scared of computers and nothing bad happened from the growth of computers. Many people would beg to differ with the latter part of that statement, but he does not acknowledge this and instead continues to say that artificial intelligence could not possibly result in any negative consequences. He also doesn't do a great job explaining consciousness or emotion, which are crucial aspects of intelligence and provide significant barriers to creating Turing-test-passing machines."
292,0805078533,http://goodreads.com/user/show/82891836-pradeep-kumar,4,"The book kept me interested throughout. Jeff Hawkins presents his theories around four attributes of ne0cortex handling inputs from external world through sequences, hierarchies, auto-association and invariant forms. He gives day to day examples and makes it simple for anyone to understand the theory he is proposing. He ends the book summarizing on how far we are from building the AI system that is more close to real intelligence.  Good read for someone who is interested in the area of AI. The ideas might help build a better AI system.  Probably adding example's of current AI system, then comparing their working with the human brain and highlighting in detail the missing parts would have kept me more interested in some of the pages in the middle."
293,0805078533,http://goodreads.com/user/show/31839390-alex-glagolev,5,"I wish I read it earlier. Darwins theory was defined by four postulates. Jeff Hawkins declares his theory in the following (as understood by me) postulates:The entire cortex is a memory system. The neocortex stores sequences of patterns. The neocortex recalls patterns auto-associatively.The neocortex stores patterns in an invariant form.The neocortex stores patterns in a hierarchy.Although brain scientists and neurobiology experts may find his theory or some parts of it controversial, being not a brain scientist I believe that intelligent machines, as described in a book including upcoming fixes, are the future if technology.Special thanks to mr. Hawkins for easy and understandable writing manner. Chapeau!"
294,0805078533,http://goodreads.com/user/show/77528455-imran-rizvi,4,"I had been a daze ever since I had read this book, thinking that me and Mr. Hawkins, were perhaps some of the few who had figured out the key to intelligence. Today, after much mulling over of the contents in the book, I sought to read any critiques or reviews of the book I could find online. After reading a couple of the reviews here, I have been deservedly brought down from my high horse. Passion for an idea is a great thing, except when it clouds the scientific method. Perhaps the merit in Mr. Hawkins book lies precisely in its ability to inspire passion for the first time in those that may then, so impassioned, commit themselves to these questions."
295,0805078533,http://goodreads.com/user/show/44561235-dhanya-jothimani,4,"Motivated by lack of Neuroscience research on how exactly our brains work, Hawkins has tried to give a simple theory. Further, he reiterates the point that understanding of brain is needed for designing intelligent (not humanlike) machines. His theory on neocortex and memory prediction framework is interesting. Memory prediction framework has been used in anomaly detection since the past two years. As he says, technology is changing and improving every second so the findings are not yet complete and it is updated with time. P.S.: References to appropriate Neuroscience literature at few places would have been helpful. "

297,0805078533,http://goodreads.com/user/show/51732576-tomos-walter,5,"Part of a massive haul of books I purchased in order to improve my understanding on consciousness, the human brain and the current state and coming invasion of super intelligent AI that will destroy us all - hopefully before climate change, but who knows..This book is fantastic. You'll understand everything you need to know about how the brain works and why scientists are trying to recreate in order to build our own intelligent machines. Unforunately, we still have no idea how consciousness works - the ultimate problem. We have no idea how to even approach such a problem.Still, everything else - this is the book that brings everything we know into focus."
298,0805078533,http://goodreads.com/user/show/31677006-kaio,5,"Has some ideas that turned out to be wrong on neutral nets. There is also quite a bit of speculation on the precise inner workings of the brain mechanisms described (but the author also properly identifies this as such). Gives out opinion on theory of mind and properly identifies qualia as a problem to his view, and does not try to explain them away. Also gives predictions and insight into the future, some of which already turned out to be true.But all these are not that important and would not warrant the ratings given. That belongs to the idea of the hierarchical structure, and the role of prediction in the functioning of intelligence. These alone are in themselves are worth the read."
299,0805078533,http://goodreads.com/user/show/74510321-matt,3,"Some of the technology references (e.g. smart cars) are a bit dated, but the opposition to the efficacy and philosophy of neural networks is very dated. We've proven that we can do a lot of great things with neural networks, and even teach machines to learn and build ""memories"" (in a sense). That said, everyone today fundamentally understands that this is different in nature than human intelligence. Overall an interesting theory of the human mind, though I do question his credibility on the subject.A side note is that the drive by treatment of the ethics of artificial intelligence is not well thought out or demonstrated. That's a real problem that will need solving."
