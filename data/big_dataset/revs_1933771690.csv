But I zipped right through this book which leads me to believe that I am already on the path, or I totally don't get it. The book quotes a Zen saying, ""Name the color, blind the eye,"" and perhaps putting a label to consciousness does the same to awareness. But the book addresses questions I have now. What was there before the Big Bang? What is the universe expanding into? Quantum physics doesn't answer. The answer cannot be nothing, because nothing is not model-based reality. Quantum physics is working on finding a Grand Unified Theory (GUT) that wraps all this up nicely. In waves or strings, or M-theory, or vintage jacquard ribbon? Superposition experiments now underway might reveal something. But what if, the authors of Biocentrism query, what if consciousness is what created it all? Suppose that external and internal are just language distinctions. Suppose time and space are constructs of our consciousness?"

2,1933771690,http://goodreads.com/user/show/26188-jafar,2,"This book is a bunch of baloney. When I read The Master and His Emissary a few weeks ago, I complained that McGilchrist had written such a large tome to support his claim that I got lost putting it together. Lanza has gone to the other extreme. He’s making pretty much the biggest claim that anyone can make, i.e., explaining existence itself, and he’s put together a few chapters of hogwash to prove it. Lanza is not only sloppy in every aspect, he comes off totally smug and arrogant. You can almost read “Look, aren’t I a genius” between the lines. He’s inserted a few stories from his own personal life for no apparent reason but self-infatuation.Lanza explicitly denies the reality of time and space. Implicitly, he also denies the existence of an objective reality outside ourselves. Nothing exists out there if there is no “consciousness” to observe it. He stays clear of defining this consciousness and explaining how it came about if nothing existed prior to it. What he offers in term of “scientific proof” is: a) the infamous double-slit experiment of quantum mechanics; b) the amazing fact that the constants of physics appear as if they’d been fine-tuned for the eventual emergence of starts and planets and life. As puzzling and inexplicable these two may be (there are theories and explanations), none of them can support Lanza’s claim by any stretch of imagination. The only chapter worth reading in the book is the one about the double-slit experiment and its different ingenious variations.I should have taken Deepak Chopra’s endorsement of this book as a bad sign. Lanza plays defensive in the introduction and says that he’s not trying to prove any New Age philosophies (I have to give him credit for realizing that this would be quite bad for a book that claims to be scientific), but in the end what he says is not more than some New Age mumbo-jumbo about the universe being a single and continuous consciousness, etc. – all with the pretense of being scientific.

Everything that they started to approach seemed common sense and to be already proven with psychology and philosophy which in my mind are not to be considered a ""science"". I decided it would be best to actually read the whole book before making a proper judgement. As I read I realized the point. If you rated this book a low rating it's probably because you didn't get it. Trust me it took me a few times to read this just to grasp the concept fully. I have always been on the side of science and never believed perception or consciousness were relevant when discussing the matters of the universe. I love science because there is always an answer and there are very few exceptions to the laws and theories we have developed over the course of human history. What makes this book special is it's ability to force the reader to realize their place. The only reason why anything exists is because we exist to perceive it. I hate to admit it but psychology and philosophy may actually have a place in the world of science, something you would never catch me saying out loud. "
5,1933771690,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3256977-steve,5,"Before reading this book, I had always thought of time as somehow real. But now I know it isn't. Whey you look at a distant star, you think you are seeing light millions of years old. This is only because the science, in the last hundred years or so, has told us so. But, quantum entanglement means that if I am on that distant star, and I am quantumly entangled with you, the reader, then things happen simultaneously. These two principles seem to violate each other. How can things be millions of light years apart but acting simultaneously? Here is a quote from Wikipedia:""Like Einstein, Schrödinger was dissatisfied with the concept of entanglement, because it seemed to violate the speed limit on the transmission of information implicit in the theory of relativity.[16] Einstein later famously derided entanglement as ""spukhafte Fernwirkung""[17] or ""spooky action at a distance.""""But, as the observer knows, they are seeing the light from the stars now, as you look at that star, in the evening, in the sky, and hear the trees rustle around you. The time is now, not millions of years ago.It is all a very clever illusion, and we are creating it with our completely lost-from-source minds. And we believe it to be ""real"" and out of our control. But it is we, the observer, who are out of control.We need to become better observers. This book helps."
6,1933771690,http://goodreads.com/user/show/13074245-joshua-wulf,5,"After reading a lot on relativity, quantum mechanics, and consciousness, this is the first book where I felt that the author had a solid grasp of all three and was able to bring something to the conversation.The Western scientific revolution was predicated on an ontology of objective things that had an existence independent of observers. The periodic table we encountered in high school science is a good example. It exists independent of the reader of the table or the observer of the elements. The observer is an afterthought, and superfluous to the elements, which have their own concrete existence.However, this view of the world - though utilitarian in that it produces technology such as the computer I am using to write this review - ignores that the entire ontological structure is in fact built through the very observation of the observer that it ignores.The book begins by examining the Zen-koan-like question ""If a tree falls in the woods and there is no-one there to hear it, does it make a sound?""The authors approach this question in a way that distinguishes sense perception from the phenomena it perceives. ""Sound"" is a perception - it requires an observer. Things do not make sound - we perceive certain phenomena as sound. Sound is an emergent phenomenon at the intersection of consciousness, senses, and stimulus. The author uses this to show how closely, and transparently, consciousness and observing are bound to our observations; and how difficult it is for us to reason about the world with this distinction.This is by no means the first time I'd encountered the question of the tree in the woods, but before reading this, it had never occurred to me that the language of ""sound"" intrinsically implies an observer. Otherwise the ""what happened"" is merely pressure waves in air. These only become ""sound"" when perceived through the ear of an observer that processes this phenomenon as sound. No observer = no ""sound""; merely pressure waves.Observation is invisibly embedded in our language and the ideal of objectivity promoted by classical science is an illusion. Lanza uses this example to cause the observer to show up in classical physics.This is just the beginning, though.The discoveries of Quantum Mechanics, beginning in the 20th century, turned the ontological basis of science on its head. It turns out that the universe does not exist in the concrete fashion depicted in the periodic table when no-one is looking at it. Ignoring the consciousness of the tree for the moment - if there is no observer present, not only does the tree not make a sound when it falls - it doesn't even exist!Not only the existence of concrete elements beginning from atoms, but even the phenomenon of time and space themselves are dependent on observation.In other words, time and space are not an objective background against which reality takes place, but rather they emerge from the interaction of the universe and our experience. Consciousness really is at the centre of everything that we know about the world. Time and space, and even concrete matter do not appear unless consciousness is present. Quantum mechanical experiments have given us knowledge of what the universe ""looks like"" when no-one is looking: it is an uncollapsed wave function - a state of undetermined probability.Relativity was the first clue that experience dictates the nature of reality - with changes to space and time taking place depending on the observer - and quantum mechanics has shown that it is not merely a late-stage artifact of reality, but at its very core.Lanza then takes us further, to show how the primacy of consciousness not only explains both relativity and quantum mechanics, but reconciles the two.Having personally spent over a decade studying yoga and Eastern philosophy, in addition to my western scientific and engineering education and career, I found this book to come the closest of any I have read to date in presenting an accurate synthesis of the two.I've read many books that misrepresented either, and sometimes both, in their efforts. Having given the author credit for presenting a synthesis, in some respects his original material represents a more accurate presentation of ancient ideas than when he is explicitly presenting ""Eastern religion"" or philosophy. Those parts are a superficial presentation, dwelling on the popularly-known aspects like unified consciousness (Advaita) or reincarnation.There are other aspects of Vedic cosmology that are more interesting in light of the findings of relativity and quantum mechanics and the desire of the author to explain these things in light of consciousness. In a discourse on the nature of the material world (a section of Eastern philosophy known as ""Sankhya"" or ""Distinction""), material nature is described in the Srimad Bhagavatam as ""pradhana"" - an undifferentiated state of potential:""The unmanifested eternal combination of the three modes is the cause of the manifest state and is called pradhana. It is called prakriti when in the manifested stage of existence."" SB. 3.26.10The discussion continues to describe the various object of sense perception (""sound"", ""sight"", etc), the sense organs (""ears"", ""eyes""), which are material, and then the senses (""hearing"", ""vision"") and mental apparatus, which are of a subtle material nature, through which consciousness experiences the world (SB. 3.26.11-14), and then explains that both time and the appearance of space of variegated experience arise from the undifferentiated material potentiality through the injection of consciousness (SB.3.26.15-19). This is, in fact, the argument being made by Lanza in this book. Quantum mechanical experiments reveal that the world exists as a cloud of undifferentiated, unmanifested ""probability"" until experienced by consciousness through senses, at which point it ""collapses"" into a deterministic state.The author of this book comes down against the Many Worlds interpretation of QM. Personally, I find the Many Worlds interpretation of QM to be more in line with the descriptions given in Bhagavatam, which - in addition to the consciousness-first nature of reality, and sensory-driven wave form collapse - deals with karma - fate and freewill.An Einsteinian block universe is experienced by living entities as a sequence of events. However, the sequence is ""predetermined"" in that time is a subjective experience - not an objective reality. This gives us a universe in which past, present, and future are already written, and are merely experienced sequentially. (Don't worry if you don't get that immediately - it took me a lot of reading about the implications of the physics arrow of time to get that).However, QM demonstrates that quantum uncertainty exists. This is one of the issues in reconciling Newtonian/Einsteinian physics of the macro-world with the Quantum Mechanical nature of the microscopic.The Many Worlds interpretation of QM allows that an unlimited number of static, predetermined Einsteinian block universes exist, but which universe you are in can change at every moment.Exactly this scenario is described in Bhagavad-gita, where Arjuna is shown ""the Universal Form"" - a vision of the Einsteinian block universe in which past, present, and future are all present and visible. He is told that the fate of his enemies is already sealed, but he has the free will to become the agent of that fate. The stage is set, the script is written, but the casting is open. In this model predetermination and free will co-exist, as they do in a Choose-Your-Own-Adventure. All the paths are there, already written; but which one you are on can change.The factors that influence the flow of a living entity through different paths (different universes == different fates) are discussed in Srimad Bhagavatam, Bhagavad-gita, and many other texts of Buddhist and Vedic-derivation. I'm looking forward to the book that builds on Lanza's offering with a more detailed exposition of the relationship between relativity, QM, and consciousness; the insights available in Eastern philosophies, and the issues of fate and free will. In some universes there will be a Joshua Wulf reading it. In others Joshua Wulf will be the writer. I wonder which one I will experience?"
7,1933771690,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3990512-wayne,5,"This book of biocentrism is a scientific book. It is one of the best books I have ever read. Not that it was entertaining. It wasn't. What this book did was introduce me to some of the most amazing experimental accomplished in the realm of quantum physics and some conclusions that can be drawn. There is not any argument in the scientific community about much of the results of experiments in quantum physics but it has become clear that quantum physic is ill equipped to explain many things. Thus came along biocentrism. The concepts in biocentrism has its roots in quantum physic testing but a great deal of thought and reflection is required to objectively delve into this exciting new field.One of the quantum physics experiments that is astounding is the two photons that go through a slit and are divided by space. Observing one photon which is a subatomic particle causes it to change and exhibit wave characteristics with vertical polarization. The twin photon separated by considerable space immediately changes from a particle to a wave with horizontal polarization. This leads to a conclusion that philosophers for years have speculated upon. Space and time do not exist in the real universe but are only fabrications of the human mind to enable us to sort things out. Another concept is that if you could travel at the speed of light you could be everywhere in the universe at the same time. Putting it another way if you were in a space ship approaching the speed of light the cosmos would look like a basketball in front of you.For engineers, philosophers, and scientist this is a must read book. I think everybody should read this book. This book gets as close to religion as science has ever done. I love reading science books that explain complex ideas in a way that can be easy visualized. This book does this. The more I learn the more the reality of a supreme being and eternal life are manifested. The body dies but the spirit lives on. As the scientists will say energy never is destroyed it only changes form. And science shows we are energy. It can be measure as equivalent to a 100 watt light bulb.So read this book and let your mind be stretched. You will find it fascinating."
8,1933771690,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2442229-richard-pinnell,1,"The central theme of this book is that life creates the universe and that consciousness lies at the center of existence. This is not a new idea and there is absolutely nothing new in this book. Lanza draws on two main sources to back up this idea. The first is that consciousness appears to cause the wave function to collapse in the famous double slit experiment. The second concerns the anthropic principle and how it seems that universe is uncannily just right for life. Both of these 'proofs' are open to various interpretations including the possibility that consciousness does indeed lie at the center of creation. However, that is only one possible conclusion that can be drawn and Lanza adds absolutely zero to the debate. He uses his book to lambaste physics and physicists for such like as not being able to tell us what came before the big bang, whilst at the same time declaring consciousness to be the be all and end all of everything without actually defining what consciousness is or offering any sort of explanation of how it came into existence or how it creates the physical universe. On top of that much of the book contains sections that have absolutely nothing to do with the subject matter and concern nothing more than Lanza's own life experiences. He uses these chapters to butter his own biscuit, blast his own trumpet and bang his own drum interspersed with a bit of name dropping. The worst book I've read all year!"
9,1933771690,http://goodreads.com/user/show/145727-clark-knowles,4,"Some folks didn't like this book, but I really found it thought provoking. The writing is mostly crisp and clear and the the author's theory (that he calls Biocentrism) seems firmly grounded--at least as far as he can take it. He writes of quantum mechanics, relativity, and numerous experiments and related theories without allowing the mathematics to overwhelm the prose. His main idea is that our universe is not external, but inexorably linked to our conscious selves--we are the observers that make the universe as it is, not the other way around. I'm not well versed in the different facets of physics, but the book impressed me in its academic rigor, even as the author used an autobiographical structure to get his points across. He cites numerous other scientists to back up his claims and has several appendixes that include a more mathematical approach. He definitively distances himself from the Intelligent Design school of thought (he is a well respected biologist, medical doctor, and leading stem cell researcher, not a spiritualist or philosopher) and also quasi-scientific films like ""What the Bleep do we Know."" His theory does not come out of nowhere--he is quick to point out all the scientists that came before him that provided clues and building blocks of his theory. He is also quick to point out what so many physicists can't explain--how our observation of particle movement shapes that particle movement. Without our consciousness, the universe does not exist. I'm no scientist, but the mathematical proofs he provides are at the very least intriguing. And at the most, life altering. I found the entire book fascinating--and it has made me want to read more about the physics of the universe--and my place in it. "
10,1933771690,http://goodreads.com/user/show/949191-julie,5,"This book must be read twice! I am into my second read and the clarity is overwhelming. Lanza points out and illustrates the flaws in majorly accepted scientific theory about the universe and how it is, and offers up the only possible alternative in his theory of Biocentrism -- a universe that springs from life (the observer), instead of a universe that exists independently of life."
11,1933771690,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7701175-alison,4,"This is a trippy, wild and ultimately enjoyable ride of a book, one that makes a mockery of Goodreads star system, as I could have easily given it 2 stars or 5 stars - it's a collection of ideas thrown out surrounded by anecdote and with passion, and often without systematisation or thorough refutation of critics.Reading it, I kept being reminded of the writings of medieval scholars like Giordano Bruno - it has that feel of heady mix of philosophy and science that defies any attempts to keep religion apart, and is driven by a passion to look at the world through a different lens.All of this is one way to say I have no idea if Lanza is a genius or a madman, the-only-one-who-sees or the-one-who-cant-see-the-obvious - but I think if you are trying to work that out, then you are denying yourself a treat. The book demands you consider the impossible, and in doing so, you can step to Lanza's side for a moment, and glimpse this pulsating world as he sees it, inextricably entertwined with our conciousness, not for us, but by us. It's a fascinating shift to make.The book's thesis is actually pretty simple - it's padded out with outrage about the direction of modern theoretical physics and wonderfully written if frequently-too-perfect-to-be-true anecdotes about Lanza's life. (The stories are important, they are both illustrative and representative of how Lanza draws his worldview from all inputs around him, refusing the typical 'objectivity' or isolation of science.) Anyway, his thesis: that the reason physics tells us that the world doesn't exist until observed is because, well, it doesn't exist until observed, by a never-defined 'consciousness', which may be one or many. Until then, it simply remains a series of possibilities, which is to say, it doesn't exist. Lanza views existence as created through interaction, without a conscious being to interact with, there is simply nothing there.Lanza spends a fair bit of time explaining the evidence for this in quantum physics, and is not above criticising the greats in doing so, but really his basic contention is that Science has found this so unbelievable that it has gone to enormous lengths to come up with alternate suggestions, ones which preserve an 'objectively existing' universe.I kinda loved reading the book, and not really because I think Lanza is right. I distrust any grand theory, and this is absolutely in that category. The evidence is also a little thinner than the enthusiasm, although Lanza's strongest ground is that physics is actually pretty crazy, and no-one's theories really make much sense outside mathematical modelling. But I loved the book simply for Lanza's courage to seek a worldview in a holistic sense, barging through philosophy, religion and the basic tenets of capital-S-science to do so, and even drawing simply on the way the world feels on a still morning near a lake. I am highly skeptical these days of the lines, the rules, that are drawn around science, as if it exists in a vacuum from the world we live in, as if peer review eliminates human bias and perception, and as if religious/philosophical ideas can be isolated somehow from paleontology or evolutionary biology, or even theoretical physics. By denying the assumptions, the worldviews, the concern over implications of this, we denude science, make it weaker, than if we acknowledged that our understanding of the world has many inputs, and they all impact each other.In short, I admire the Brunos, the Abelards, the al-Farghanis not because they challenged 'religion' but because they argued for the right to draw on all the tools at their disposal to understand the world and how it worked. There are moments when Lanza, drawing on biology and physics, and in demanding that taken together, they insist we look at the world through a different lens, invokes this spirit of pushing orthodoxy back so we can *see* differently. That's a kind of science we could use a little more of, even if I'd like it with a little more detail and a little less skimming over the contradictory bits"
12,1933771690,http://goodreads.com/user/show/974210-erik-graff,4,"Lanza' Biocentrism constitues the take of two scientists, one a cell biologist, the other an astronomer, on the old mind/body ""problem"", attacking it not from the perspective of philosophy but from that of physics. Lanza, the primary author, being scientifically educated but not a physicist, explains elements of microphysics with accessible clarity and astrophysics and cosmology, with the help of his co-author, similarly.As someone trained in philosophy, much of what Lanza has to say was reminiscent of what some philosophers, most notably Spinoza and Kant, have been maintaining for centuries. Lanza states it (p. 159) as the proposition that ""there is no separate physical universe outside of life and consciousness."" What he should have written was that we cannot know whether there is a ""separate physical universe outside of life and consciousness"", but then he is not a philosopher and not, apparently, much aware of history of epistemological or ontological thought within the discipline. Still, for those with more of a science than a philosophical background, the basic point gets across.For me, the best parts of this book were the autobiographical portions, many of which I found quite moving."
13,1933771690,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4453896-jeffrey-sylvester,5,"“Biocentrism” by Robert Lanza and Robert Berman is excellent. Lanza is an M.D., and advanced cell scientist, and Berman a famous astronomer. They propose that life creates the universe and not the other way around, and that biology should be the discipline used to develop a “theory of everything” that accounts for life and consciousness to better understand reality, being and the cosmos. According to Lanza the physics model that Western science has employed has reached its limits in attempting to explain the age-old questions raised by philosophers and theologians regarding the cosmos, the origin of existence and consciousness.Lanza challenges readers to question the claims of contemporary science such as where the Big Bang came from, the probability of our existence, and how consciousness arose from matter. Essentially Lanza makes the case that the more we know, the less we understand, and that answering the aforesaid questions requires a fundamental shift away from physics and toward biology. By extension, Lanza suggests the theory he proposes, Biocentrism, provides the answers physics cannot answer. Beyond offering the basis for a complete paradigm shift that opens new lines of investigation in physics and cosmology, Lanza suggests other researchers conduct “quantum superposition” experiments to either confirm or refute the theory. Like any decent resource, Lanza spends much of his time declaring the limitations of what we know before proceeding with his proposed theory that could help close those gaps. For example, we now know that 96% of the universe is dark energy and dark matter but we have little idea of what those are or how they operate. We understand and guide our lives based on animal conceptions of time and space but both are illusory. We have academic fleets dedicated to brain science but the holes in the methodologies used to explain consciousness is never discussed (a problem particularly rife in behavioral ‘science’). We suggest that life was an incredibly improbable chance event when it is more probable the universe was fine-tuned to support life. We operate within the confines of human language and logic, and due to these limitations, are “constitutional materialists, hard-wired, designed, to think linearly”, always seeking sociological and scientific certainty upon which to base the order of our lives. Much of biocentrism is explained through Lanza and Berman’s understandings of quantum theory and the bizarre relationships between subatomic particles. I have read several breakdowns of this theory by different scholars and felt Lanza’s was well explained. He also uses variations of the Anthropic Principle to support his arguments and ultimately concludes that consciousness must exist beyond our terrestrial realm, and that the content of our minds constitute “reality”, as humans throughout history have always suspected. Structurally Lanza’s book is user-friendly, particularly at the end where Lanza breaks down “Answers to Basic Questions” and the different ways in which Classical Science, Western Religions and advocates of Biocentrism would respond. The dialogue he sets forth helps exemplify what Western science cannot know and what Biocentrism can provide in consideration of the gaps exposed. I have also found fascinating how many scholars, building upon recent theoretical findings in physics, have concluded that these new theories increasingly support multi-universe, BiosLogos, and the Anthropic theories, the tenets of which line up with various aspects of millennia old Eastern religions. 5 stars out of 5 for Lanza and Berman!

14,1933771690,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2331518-stacey,5,"I want all of my friends to read this so we can talk about it for hours. My only problem with this book was some questions he left answered (which did not compromise my rating because questions are not the same as criticism.) His premise is logically viable, it works very well with Bohm's hypothesis; however I would have enjoyed him exploring more of the various states of consciousness or even more of the neuroscience behind consciousness. I think it would have strengthened his argument if he was able to elaborate, for consciousness is not a static entity. Brain waves, for example: alpha, beta, theta, and delta, sleep, dreaming & altered states of consciousness that can come about through psychoactive drugs or meditation. Anyway, this was an amazing, horizon-expanding altered view of the universe. It annoyed me to read in some of the reviews that this was a philosophy book when he clearly used experiments and data from the literature to prove every point he made. It's like people skipped the intro, skimmed the first view paragraphs in each chapter and wrote it off as a new-age concept book written by a hippie. If life exists because consciousness exists, that could be the ""theory of everything"" that physicists & philosophers alike have been looking for since man could ""think, therefore I am."""

19,1933771690,http://goodreads.com/user/show/17447272-john-spiri,5,"I was enthralled reading Lanza’s Biocentrism but now, after reading so many negative reviews, I ask myself why more critically than my initial reaction. Admittedly, the book stated what I wanted to read. As a reader with a steadfast interest in Eastern religions I found much of what I read to be confirmations for a take on reality that I find appealing and compelling: consciousness is primary and actually creates the physical world which is ultimately illusory. From the start I didn’t expect, nor did I get (nor would I have understood), hardcore scientific proofs for biocentric claims. Instead, Lanza reinterpreted experiments like the double slit and boldly offered a vision that makes sense given the mind-boggling results. The book is a call, an invitation, for people to view the world in a very different way. The question to me is, does biocentrism provide a more feasible explanation for the nature of the universe than science given the nature of the evidence? One of the most compelling criticisms of the book that I read was the fact that biocentrism is just one possible explanation for phenomena such as photons behaving as both wave and particle. Fair enough. No matter the degree of Lanza’s certainty, this is a proposal that will take far more evidence for scientific community to take seriously. But I loved the fact that a respected scientist would propose something so revolutionary (and again, something sages have essentially been saying for millennia). Another reasonable criticism is Lanza’s unwillingness to put tough questions to his own theory. For example, in the comparison at the end he listed extremely difficult questions for science such as ‘What was before the Big Bang’ and noted traditional science’s answer is “unknown” but merely put a few easy questions to biocentrism. One criticism that several reviewers noted was the author’s perceived arrogance. I suppose the perception of arrogance is going to depend a lot on how impressed we are with the writer’s message and writing style. When Lanza wrote about working with Skinner I took it as a statement of fact rather than an arrogant ‘Look at me!’ Anyway, I’d rather not play the game of trying to discern an author’s character defects. Without a doubt the switching to personal experiences that were only marginally related was questionable, probably more so for readers who work in science fields. But they held my interest well enough, and most of the time I could glean a bit of relevance in the passage. My hope is that readers, and scientists, will give this book a careful look despite its apparent drawbacks."

In Biocentrism, he elucidates an extremely challenging concept for the reader bound to the status quo to grasp: that the universe is actually a perception of consciousness, not a static ""out there"" reality. Lanza explains step-by-step how this is so, using known and quantified laws of physics and other sciences, and explains his claim in an exquisite, elegant yet easy-to-understand language so that any lay person can easily grasp what he is saying. He also has a wonderful sense of humor that pops through at the most unexpected times that brings a lightheartedness to the weight of his subject. I highly recommend this book to everyone who enjoys exploring the age-old quandary of the origin of the universe. "
21,1933771690,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6651563-matt,1,"Robert Lanza writes a book about his theory of everything, biocentrism, and makes it clear from the start that this is not just some new age fooey, he has real science backing him up. Well, he was lying. He points out every trapping that can happen to a theory of such magnitude and strangeness, then he proceeds to fall into every. single. one. If this wasn't bad enough, the writing itself just screams arrogance. It has some of the worst, most out of place purple passages that I've ever had the misfortune of reading. This may have been forgivable if the prose was actually good but it's not, it's sloppy and down right laughable. At one point, he uses the same analogy about feeling like he was some sort of herald standing between past and present, life and death while standing in the hospital room while his best friend was in a coma and then goes on to use THE SAME EXACT WORDS to describe how he felt during the death of his sister. I thought for sure he meant to, but then he never linked the two usages, he just kept going on about something else, I had to do a double take.It may seem like I'm being harsh on this guy's writing, but let me make it clear that I believe him to be one of the worst kind of people and here's why. He is arrogant. He is a special little genius and wants you to know it, he worked with BF Skinner and he will remind you often so you don't forget it (even though his work with Skinner was very minor compared to what Skinner did earlier in his life). When he isn't name dropping every famous scientist he so much as served coffee to, he is actively disrespecting every discipline he can think of. He does a disservice to physics and philosophy, as well as both eastern and western religions regarding all of them with equal parts contempt and ignorance.His theory isn't even novel. John Wheeler had been saying the same thing for the later half of his life. The tenants of biocentrism are a jumbled repeating mess. The evidence he has isn't evidence so much as misinterpretation and manipulation of data. For a guy who claims to hate untestable theories, biocentricism sure is hard to test... Biocentricism also has about as much practicality as solipsism.But then again, it doesn't matter whether the theory is shit or if the man is also shit, he already has my money and that's a shame. This is pretty much the only book I regret not stealing."
22,1933771690,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6423134-bernie-gourley,3,"This book argues for an understanding of the universe in which consciousness is key – the sine qua non of reality, i.e. without which there’s nothing. While Lanza emphasizes biocentrism is a scientifically-based conception, his argument will likely find more immediate traction with people of faith than with the scientific community. Skepticism is likely to arise among the scientific community because the history of science from the Copernican Revolution onward has indicated that we are a bi-product of the universe in action, and not the reason for its existence. Humanity, with our brilliant brains that are the most complex systems we know of in the universe, is neither the geographic center of the universe nor are we its center of meaning or purpose either. Looking at it another way, our annihilation wouldn’t even register as a blip to the universe. Lanza (along with his co-author Bob Berman), fairly uniquely among men of science, argues otherwise. Lanza and Berman present seven principles of biocentrism over the course of the book. I won’t list these, but they essentially say that in the absence of an observer the world exists only as an unresolved probability function, and that time and space are meaningless in the absence of consciousness. Not to oversimplify the authors’ case, but the heart of their biocentric argument is that it’s consistent with, and could arguably solve, two of the biggest mysteries in science. The first mystery is the nature of quantum weirdness that has been shown true repeatedly through experiments such as the double slit experiment (which the authors discuss in some detail, but I will not.) I will mention a thought experiment designed make this subatomic strangeness clear in the world at our scale. It’s called Schrödinger's cat. The idea is that a cat is in a box with a vile of poison that is released by a radioactive trigger. One can’t know when the radioactive decay will release the poison. (This is a bit of subatomic strangeness that can only be reconciled in the face of an observer.) It’s said that the cat would have to be thought of as being in a superposition, simultaneously both alive and dead, until the observer enters the picture. The reader also may have heard of Heisenberg’s Uncertainty principle, which states one can’t know both of a pair of measurements (e.g. position and momentum) with perfect accuracy. All of this says that at the infinitesimally tiny scale of the quantum, particle behavior seems erratic, baffling, and is influenced by observation. While it’s hard to relate to through the lens of our macroscopic experience of the world, it’s a notion that is completely accepted by physicists because it’s been validated by countless experimental observations. The second truth that science struggles to make sense of that biocentrism presumes to eradicate is the conundrum of the “Goldilock’s universe.” Taken from the fable of finding the porridge that was “just right.” We live in a universe whose actions comply with a series of equations and constants that – were they slightly different – would make life in all the forms we can fathom completely impossible. Starting from the fact that our universe is so mathematically consistent (a feature that it’s commonly argued needn’t be) to the fact that turning the dials a little would make intelligent life impossible, it’s easy to start wondering whether the creationists aren’t on to something. Religion doesn’t have a problem with the Goldilock’s Universe because it presumes the universe was made this way purposefully. Biocentrism doesn’t have a problem because the universe can only exist where there are conscious beings. Of course, science hypothesizes its own solutions to the conundrum. These varied solutions generally revolve around the anthropic principle (we exist in a universe capable of supporting life because if we didn’t we couldn’t) and a multiverse of parallel universes (because the anthropic principle applied to a single universe isn’t intuitively superior to assuming a god, goddess, or gods magically “poofed” us into existence.) Under this idea, which appeals to the Copernican Revolutionary mindset, there will be many more universes where life doesn’t exist, and perhaps even ephemeral bubble universes that can’t even exist as a universe – let alone as a life supporting universe. There’s a major challenge to biocentrism that results from the fact that we are fairly certain that the universe is 13+ billion years old and our planet didn’t come into existence until about 9 billion years after that (i.e. Earth is about 4.5 billion-years-old.) Even if one assumes the conscious life grew up elsewhere before us, it’s hard to imagine it having happened instantaneously with the beginning of the universe. Lanza’s end run around this can be found in his sixth and seventh principles of biocentrism which state that time and space are illusory in the absence of an observer. Of course, this raises questions of how this could be so and why we might believe it is so -- because “it’s essential to my case” isn’t a good reason to believe anything. To be fair, there are all sorts of theories out there – many more mainstream than Lanza’s – that propose time and space aren’t what they seem – starting with Einstein’s well-proven idea that time and space are relative.  This book is oddly composed. It describes the principles of biocentrism largely in the first half to two-thirds of the book, with a few random digressions, and then it really goes off the rails. Most of the digressions are little biographical stories about Robert Lanza, many of which are interesting but completely irrelevant to the book’s proposed topic. I’m unsure which of three competing explanations account for these erratic digressions: a.) the publisher said, “this manuscript must be 200 pages or we aren’t publishing it.” b.) the author is getting up there in age, realizes there is no market for his memoirs, and thinks he can sneak the highlights into this book which is sure to have a following if a controversial one. c.) the author was concerned about being taken for a kook and wanted to establish his bona fides (note: many of the biographical digressions consist of name-dropping.) I should point out that these digressions are the main reason for my mediocre rating of this book, and not disenchantment with the case for biocentrism. (I think we know too little about consciousness and about it’s odd interactions at the quantum level to draw any firm conclusions in that regard.) I found this book to be fascinating – even some of the digressions were interesting, though not helpful to discussion of the topic at hand. It’s a thought-provoking work. I have no idea whether it will prove to have merit as a description of how the world works. I’ll leave it to readers to determine whether they think it is a sound interpretation of observed reality or a physics-envy based attack on the stronghold of physics as the heart of science or an attempt to reduce the fear of death in a way consistent with science (i.e. time as we perceive it being an illusion makes us all immortal.) If you are interested in the big questions of why the universe exists and what is the nature of reality, you may want to give this book a read – not that it’ll answer all your questions, but it will provide an alternative to mainstream views that you may find useful.

23,1933771690,http://goodreads.com/user/show/12977113-denise-hutchins,5,"I purchased this book when I saw it mentioned on an episode of Through the Wormhole with Morgan Freeman. It was presented there as an alternative to the preeminent string theory and I was enchanted by the idea. However, what I learned from this book ended up being so much more than that.Not only does Biocentrism, the theory, do more than simply explain the strange behavior of quantum particles, Biocentrism, the book, was an excellent starting point for all kinds of scientific knowledge. I didn’t just learn about a new theory, I learned about the various scientific experiments and scientific theories that lead the authors to come to the Biocentrism conclusion. If ever I so choose, I can find my way to all that additional science through this book’s bibliography and expand my scientific knowledge even further. I think this is the main reason I LOVED reading this book: it didn’t just shove a new idea in my face and say, “There! Accept it!”, it took the time to explain itself and teach me new things along the way. The two main facets, learning the tenets of a new and wildly different scientific theory and learning about all the solid evidence that supports that theory, worked in harmony to make the whole book extremely readable and eternally fascinating.Whether or not you end up convinced about this idea’s validity (I certainly am!), this is still an excellent book that sparks new ideas, can elicit extreme emotional response in its reader, is written in an easy style sprinkled with dry humor, and leads the reader to even more avenues of scientific exploration. My view of life and existence has been wholly altered by this book and I’m extremely glad I read it."
24,1933771690,http://goodreads.com/user/show/11788211-gladiatrix,4,"Many seem to either love or hate this book, or rather to either embrace it or harshly criticize it. Myself I have a more moderate opinion, I agree with the critics that it's not really a science book, and neither are the ideas in it completely new for the most part. If you're looking for hard scientific facts and don't have the patience for an author telling much of his life story in between chapters this book is definitely not for you. On the other hand if you yourself have given much thought to the questions about the true nature of the universe and the mystery of consciousness you might enjoy reading Robert Lanza's thoughts on them. He won't provide a final conclusion - which couldn't be expected since it's about the ultimate question, after all - but he'll rather relate some very personal life events on the way that guided him to the perspective he takes. Not groundbreaking but well written."
25,1933771690,http://goodreads.com/user/show/11516573-delta,5,"This is one of those books that I will always believe changed my life. It's also going to be one of the few books I read more than once. Biocentrism helped me understand how I am not alone in this universe, but a part of it, and realize that I do matter in the grand scheme of things, if only to create the world around me. I came across this theory after reading James Rollins' ""The Eye of God"" and it was nothing like I expected. Since reading this book I have felt much closer to the universe and more aware of the world around me. I have comforted friends who suffer from bouts of depression and loneliness, including myself.Don't get me wrong, this is a difficult read; possibly the most difficult I have ever read. But if you put the time into it and really apply the concepts, it could open you up to a world you never knew was around you."
26,1933771690,http://goodreads.com/user/show/41277003-neil-hayes,5,"The central point of this book is that consciousness creates the universe, not the other way round. Although not a new insight, this compelling book is the best I have read to bring home the importance of this phenomenon, and the simplest explanation of the quantum physics behind it. Interweaved with the science is a charmingly personal account of some defining experiences in Lanza's life. A wonderful book, and to me a must-read for any student of the mind, the universe, or indeed practically anything."
27,1933771690,http://goodreads.com/user/show/20897955-dan-mickle,4,"I really enjoyed this book. I was worried that it would go a little too deep into QT and other sciences. I felt the author did a great job of explaining the theories, but also incorporating his personal history that helped shape his views and put him on his path. I also felt he did a very good job incorporating other sciences and even religion, without dismissing them or treating them like they had no value. My only negative on the book is the ending felt rush for the last two chapters. The flow felt different and like it didn't belong in the book."
28,1933771690,http://goodreads.com/user/show/23150910-yusif-adel,3,"This book is a good one, you can look at the world from another possible perspective as Lanza proposed. However, Lanza went very extreme in claiming against some equations, theories and scientists. He should remove some chapters as he was trying to show some of the personnel difficulties he faced. Which was not relevant.The best written chapter was the double slit experiment chapter. "
29,1933771690,http://goodreads.com/user/show/8327230-mihai,3,"The concept of consciousness fabricating reality is a very interesting one, however I think this book leaves you with more questions than it attempts to answer. It makes for a good philosophy read, but as a science book it seems to lack the experimentation and proof of the theory it attempts to present."
30,1933771690,http://goodreads.com/user/show/40314981-donald-laplante,5,I found this information quite enlightening. I especially like the metaphors he used to teach concepts that are sometimes difficult to wrap one's mind around. I found that it synchronizes well with other teachings i have discovered as well as some new concepts that I was unaware of until reading this book. I especially like his story telling of his own life and the syncronicities that happened.

Wish I could have given it 5 stars, but Lanza's arrogant writerly voice (he is no doubt a medical doctor) and constant--usually irrelevant name-dropping-- was irksome. However, the ideas and arguments he presents are fascinating and well-explained. An incredibly exciting read. "
32,1933771690,http://goodreads.com/user/show/14377177-mrityunja-singh,5,"Bob Lanza is knocking on the right door. Consciousness is the key to any definition of life, its about time science addressed/acknowledged the fact and examined this fundamental through a multi disciplinary approach. The book points to a meeting of science and wisdom, and makes an easy read."

34,1933771690,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6539564-lance-schonberg,1,"This is a book with the purpose of putting the human species back at the centre of the universe, where the author seems to believe we clearly belong.I selected this book as part of this year's Reading Journey specifically to challenge my preconceptions. Controversy is good for making you think and rexamine what you think you know. Going in, the idea of Biocentrism seemed like just another restatement of the Anthropic Principle to me, albeit in grander, more scientific-sounding terms.As an aside, the Anthropic Principle is basically a philosophical statement, sometimes dressed up with some science-y words, that the universe is too fine-tuned for life and this means it has to be compatible with not just life, but conscious, sapient life to observe it. In other words, the universe is tailor made to produce us or at least the parts of it that we can observe are. It’s had a number of different statements and restatements from reasonable-sounding to ridiculous.I’m not fond of the anthropic principle. It seems to smack of human arrogance to me. The universe is how it is because it has eventually to produce us, or any observers, really. So the universe exists just to produce us. We’re the centre of and the reason for everything. Sorry, doesn’t work for me. While I agree that abiogenesis (life arising from non-living matter) is not currently understood, and probably incredibly rare, Star Trek notwithstanding, even the visible universe is a pretty damned big place. Very improbable things will eventually happen.Back to the book. The first six chapters of the book seem to be written to illustrate that, “See? You’ve got no way to know that something is happening or even exists unless you’re there to observe it. Therefore, if no one observes it, that thing doesn’t happen, doesn’t even exist.”Then the author starts trying to pull science in, starting with Quantum Theory. Apparently no one in the world actually understands QT, at least in his opinion, but it doesn’t seem to occur to the author that maybe that’s because it’s not complete yet, even if that is true. We obviously have some understanding as a species, since we use it for advanced lasers and we’re working towards quantum computing, but that’s just playing in the sandbox, after all. And he does admit that.At the beginning of chapter 8, the author actually admits that Quantum Theory has become a pat phrase for people “proving” new age nonsense. But don’t let that fool you. It supports Biocentrism. We never find out why the author, a biologist, has the expertise in QT to tell us no one else understands it either. The presentation of it he gives is less comprehensive than the bits and pieces I got in high school or in first year university physics. I feel like he’s taken a bare surface understanding of some basic Quantum principles and shaken them until they say what he wants them to.You may guess I have a lot of problems with this book. You guess right. I’m not going to list them all, but I think it’s worth pointing out the big ones, at least.After the first section, a large part of the book seems dedicated to holding things up and saying, “See this thing/experiment/result? It’s weird and Science can’t explain it completely. Therefore, Biocentrism!” He’s basically pulling a page from the young earth creationist playbook: science can’t explain it (yet), therefore God. So now we have Biocentrism of the Gaps to hold hands with God of the Gaps.Remember how I mentioned the Anthropic Principle at the beginning of this? The author actually introduces it in chapter 9, but doesn’t really provide an explanation, much less a convincing one, of how Biocentrism is anything other than a restatement of it with additional “scientific” trappings and wishful thinking. The author does admit his preferred version of the AP is the Participatory Anthropic Principle, which requires observers for the universe to exist. So the universe didn’t actually exist until someone was around to observe it. How perfect for Biocentrism.We get what seems to be a deliberate misrepresentation or misstatement of certain aspects of Relativity to support the author’s view.He discusses peculiarities of language, particularly when it comes to expressions of logic, as support to his argument that physics is obviously the wrong tool for the job to explain the universe. Therefore, Biocentrism. Because you know we (the human species) are mostly too lazy to go looking for the right tool, anyway, so here it is laid out for you.And if you get to the point where your mind reaches “a blank wall beyond which lie contradictions or – worse – nothingness”, don’t worry. That doesn’t mean Biocentrism is false, it’s just a mystery and Biocentrism still offers the best explanation of why things are the way they are. This reminds me a lot of George Carlin telling stories of how the priests used to answer hard questions about God when he was young (and probably still do): “Well, it’s a mystery.” It’s an easy answer that skilfully allows the person answering to avoid thinking.I spent a big chunk of the book waiting for the author to tell me that Biocentrism would make it possible for me to live forever because, just like space, time, reality, and everything else, death is just a perceptual flaw on my part. I’m still disappointed when he finally asks if consciousness can ever truly be extinguished. And even more so when he tells us that consciousness is eternal without any reason or justification, even under biocentrism.And I’m not really going to address the limited view and analysis he has of Science Fiction, since it seems to be based purely on blockbuster movies and huge budget television shows, and not always good ones, with a few authors’ names someone has thrown at him mixed in. It seems unlikely he watches or reads the genres himself, but that’s speculation on my part.And, in spite of being a career biologist, the author seems to have a problem with conventional science, mainly its failure to explain consciousness. Somehow, and it’s never made clear how, biocentrism explains it, or at least supports it, or something. But, you know, Biocentrism.There are seven principles of Biocentrism. They take a whole page of text to state, and most of a book to not explain very well (or at all) but they boil down to a fairly simple statement: nothing is real unless someone is looking at it.How Zen.Well no, actually. Not only did the tree not make a sound because no one heard it fall, it didn’t actually fall, at least not until someone sees it lying on the ground. Then, obviously it did fall and the observation altered the past to make it match the fallen tree in the present.Right.Overall rating: 1 star.I’ve had to re-categorize the subject area for this book. I can’t call it cosmology, which is how it was originally represented. Honestly, the only subject area I think I can place this is in is new age philosophy, and it bothers me to use “philosophy” as part of that description. Sure, it has some bits of cherry-picked science that with sufficient obfuscation or misrepresentation seem to support the author’s view that we’re the centre of the universe, but this is an opinion book, not a science book.I like things that challenge my preconceptions and make me think. This book tried to challenge my preconceptions, but not by making me think. Instead, it dressed up some mystical woo with a science-y mask and cloak and asked me to believe that the universe didn’t exist until we were around to look at it.To my reading, this book represents the height of human arrogance outside of religion. Don’t waste your time."
35,1933771690,http://goodreads.com/user/show/68610628-anotherfungurl,4,"It was a knowledgeable and useful book, that was not hard to understand and kept the flow of words. I am not gonna say I agree with all of the points discussed in the book, nor disagree, but the existence of time and space makes perfect sense with biocentrism. However, to reach a conclusion, I need to read about opposing views and different perspectives first. First Principle of Biocentrism: What we perceive as reality is a process that involves our consciousness. An 'external' reality, if it existed, would-by definition-have to exist in space. But this is meaningless because space and time are not absolute realities but rather tools of the human and animal mind.Second Principle of Biocentrism: Our external and internal perceptions are inextricably intertwined. They are different sides of the same coin and cannot be divorced from one another.Third Principle of Biocentrism: The behavior of subatomic particles-indeed all particles and objects- are inextricably linked to the presence of an observer. Without the presence of a conscious observer, they at best exist in an undetermined state of probability waves.Fourth Principle of Biocentrism: Without consciousness, 'matter' dwells in an undetermined state of probability. Any universe that could have preceded consciousness only existed in a probability state.Fifth Principle of Biocentrism: The structure of the universe is explainable only through biocentrism. The universe is fine-tuned for life, which makes perfect sense as life creates the universe, not the other way around. The 'universe' is simply the complete spatiotemporal logic of the self.Sixth Principle of Biocentrism: Time does not have a real existence outside of animal-sense perception. It is the process by which we perceive changes in the universe.Seventh Principle of Biocentrism: Space, like time, is not an object or a thing. SPace is another form of our animal understanding and does not have an independent reality. We carry space and time around with us like turtles with shells. Thus, there is no absolute self-existing matrix in which physical events occur independently of life."

Biocentrism is scientific theory mixed in with some philosophy and metaphysics. Lanza does a good balancing act, and his theories are compelling. The idea that physicists have had it exactly backward the past hundred-plus years, that the universe is in fact a construct of our own minds and cannot exist without us, not the other way around, is mindblowing. I think Lanza is onto something"

41,1933771690,http://goodreads.com/user/show/21941335-an-nguyen,3,"When I was a child I would close my eyes and the world would disappear. I'd open them and *poof* it would reappear.As I got older I learned that the world was still there it was only my perception of it that was changing. The world was not being created and destroyed as I moved about my surroundings. It was simply was.Biocentrism is a way at looking at our universe with consciousness at the very center. It proposes that things, may in fact, spring into existence once observed by a conscious being.Quantum theory contends that events exist as a wave function that, once observed, collapses into reality. Until it is observed, it exists as pure probability. For some reason, particles seem to be capable of ""knowing"" when they observed.The book says that a universe with no consciousness can not exist and in a way it makes some sort of sense. How can something exist if nothing can perceive it? In what manner can we prove its existence? If all consciouness is wiped from the universe, will the universe continue to exist? I am reminded of a quote from House of Leaves:""Why did god create a dual universe?So he might say'Be not like me. I am alone.'And it might be heard.""Perhaps the meaning of life is to perceieve, to be aware, to be conscious of things. What purpose could a universe void of consciousness have? Are movies not made to be watched? Books to be read, and food to be eaten?Another interesting perspective from the book is that life is entirely perception. We feel solid objects but all matter is nearly entirely empty space. Richard Feynman talks about the vibration of atoms and how incredible it is we perceive things as solid when everything is just a shimmering mass.In our common sense we intuitively believe in ""absolute"" time and space. A lightning strikes a tower 120 meters tall at exactly 11:43 on a Sunday afternoon for an observer standing directly next to the tower. However, it could strike at a slightly different time for an observer on a train away from the tower. Here's the catch. No one observer is correct. There is no one correct answer, both observers' perceptions is the truth because there is no ""one"" truth. The tower could appear 120 meters tall to anyone that tries to measure it. But to a creature moving 99% of the speed of light, it could appear 3 inches tall. That's the catch. Everything is relative. This was Einstein's great contribution to science. The next? Consciousness.Now that we've realized that not even time or space is absolute but merely relative. Could it also be that there is no absolute being at all? Our entire universe is constructed in our brains based on sensory inputs. A ball is not red nor round. It merely *looks* red through your eyes and *feels* round in your hands. Everything is a projection. How does a blind man perceive day-to-day life? In a pre-quantum theory view of the world one could make a strong argument against the existence of free-will. In a Newtonion world, a finger presses a button which fires an arrow through the air. It's all mechanical and with absolute information you can not only predict the future but also trace the past. Introduce statistical probability, polar opposite spins, the uncertainty principle and suddenly you realize how complicated things can really get. Perhaps we are free after all. Maybe the real purpose of life it to simply exist. The universe is just a show for us to experience"
42,1933771690,http://goodreads.com/user/show/32275932-tyler-thompson,5,"Short yet succinct, “Biocentrism” by famed stem-cell researcher Robert Lanza is an inquiry into the oft-asked question of the origin and nature of the cosmos. While science has sought to answer these questions through the lens of modern physics, seeing the universe as a something in and of itself inanimate and unalive that life eventually sprang out of, here Lanza makes the argument that the opposite is true: that it is out of life that the universe originated. Using quantum theory, philosophy of mind, and neurobiology, this book claims that reality as we perceive it is only processes of the mind, and therefore that beyond observation space and time are necessarily nonexistent. While such a claim teeters on absolute solipsism, Lanza himself neither speak in support or opposition of the solipsistic viewpoint, instead opting to fortify his thesis in process philosophy, arguing that the universe is “an active, life-based process.”Perhaps it is because of how predisposed to Transcendentalism I am (and how often Lanza quotes Thoreau and Emerson), but for me this book was a revelation in how I understand the world, aptly couching my Transcendentalist ideals in factual scientific inquiry. Understanding that I may have some bias in favor of this book beforehand, I made the effort while reading to find as many flaws with Lanza’s hypothesis as I could so as to not just be reading into the text only what I wanted to see. And there are issues and disagreements in this book, claims that are unsubstantiated or unverifiable, Lanza himself many times reiterates that his book should be seen not as an end-all-be-all, but as the starting point for a new and revolutionary scientific paradigm, to be elaborated on and refined.The conveyance of these far outClaims is helped by how clear and direct the writing is. While at certain points Lanza discusses complex concepts without putting them into layman’s terms (this is especially bad in the chapter on quantum physics), for the most part he excels at conveying to the reader the abstract concepts of time and space and philosophy in a way that is educational yet still digestible. It was through this sort of writing that I, with little to know understanding of astronomy or quantum physics, was able to understand the points Lanza was trying to make. Furthermore, unlike psuedo-intellectuals such as Deepak Chopra, who profit off of people’s misunderstanding of quantum mechanics to peddle a wholly incorrect pop-philosophy, Lanza actually seems to know what he’s talking about, and knows the limits of his own knowledge on the subjects discussed. And being one of the most renowned figures in the scientific community, the authority he assumes on the subject of the universe is one very much warranted. Ultimately, this is a book I’d recommend to most anyone: to the scientifically-inclined, to the philosophically-inclined, to anyone that’s ever had a big transcendent experience or even at a bare minimum wonders from time to time about what it is that the universe actually “is.” Even if one disagrees with Biocentrism, in this book Lanza time and time again warrants that his hypothesis is one that deserves looking into, and learning from. "
43,1933771690,http://goodreads.com/user/show/13459886-yhc,5,"I bought this book for more than 1 year, but never feel the right time to read it until yesterday. On the contrary of what Physicist Lawrence Krauss pointed out: Our universe is from nothing, a totally free lunch!. Lanza thinks our universe is such fine tuned for life because our consciousness comes before universe was created. Without us/observers, this universe means nothing. Our perception / our vision through the light created this whole universe. This idea is very different from what i have accepted before. I don't think we/ humans/ our consciousness is that big deal that this universe needs to make sense to us. Actually it doesn't make sense to us because we are just scratching the surface of this whole knowledge of how this universe was created. Religions try to convince us that intelligent design theory is true because everything of this universe condition is so perfect for life. However we ignore that our existence is merely the small fracture of time in this whole universe. We thought we are the fine tuned creature in the right time of right moment that is just the arrogance of human beings. The majority of the forming process of this cosmos is in chaos. we are just lucky to have enough brain power to think our existence with what we think we have as consciousness. who knows? Biological form might just a process of universe. Not everything goes material? would we involved into pure energy, light, thoughts, or eventually just the consciousness itself without a physically form? who knows?In my opinion, ""Life is one huge lottery where only the winning tickets are visible.""－－ The Solitaire Mystery by Jostein Gaarder Secker. The universe we live in right now is exactly a lottery winner, we can stand here to think, to discuss simply because we are the winner out of all these other failed-tuned universe. I say winner, means right now, in this space and time. (back to 5 million years ago, the winner might be something else.) The tragedy of being a thinking animal like us could be a bliss and curse at the same time. We are so primitive to need to eat to survive, life is after all too short to build up more meaningful things. We seems to be doomed to be able to observe all other animal purely enjoy the moment, the present without thinking about future and the past. We are doomed to be trapped by searching for the meaning of life on such a tiny planet, trying to find the place where we are not granted one on the scale of the whole universe.Yes..one day we might sort out quantum physics and even find the GUT. But where our consciousness/ mind is from might still remain a big mystery. I am not sure if consciousness still lives on after that person dies. We could hope one day when the science advances enough to upload our mind into computer like movie ""Transcendent"". Then we can say, mind is eternal. Again I give high review for this book not because i totally agree with what the author wrote, but the point is this book pushes me to think and think and that is what makes me happy!"
44,1933771690,http://goodreads.com/user/show/42186076-colin-o-shea,4,"The most intriguing book I've read in a long time, probably because of the radical nature of the ideas; though whether or not he makes a leap too far from the science to each of the seven principles of Biocentrism (in a nutshell: that consciousness is the basis of all reality and not a by-product of the physical world) I don't know, but I like it; I do think that real progress is made by the opening up of new and expansive ideas. It is simply written, though I did have to re-read the odd sentence due to a confusing sentence structure. And of course the theories he derives from scientific observations are sometimes difficult to get your head around, like space and time being essentially devoid of any concrete existence external to the observer. It is obviously difficult to comprehend this, especially when you don't completely grasp all the science behind it, like relativity, time dilation at fast speeds, etc. But it's all explained clearly and will sink in with a couple of reads and some rumination, I hope. He makes some good points about our preconceptions derived from Sci-fi and other sources that embed the idea that space-time is some sort of tangible thing rather than an abstract concept that accurately describes and predicts the movement of things in the physical world; For him, 'The ""Universe"" is simply the complete spatio-temporal logic of the self.' Biocentric, or what!?Another reviewer thought that the inclusion of Lanza's own experiences in childhood and adulthood was a sign of a big ego, but I thought the personal touch worked well. Since it is a book about how integral the observer is in the creation of reality, then to use his own life observations and insights, some of which informed his theory, makes sense to me. After all, the idea is that one's inner and outer world are inseparable and correlative, no matter how much we try to isolate the two. It also gave the book an intimate feel and provided a breather from the heavier stuff.The odd Thoreau and Emerson quote were used to lend some poetry that resonated with the themes; someone could argue transcendentalists don't belong anywhere near a scientific theory, but again, that's the beautiful thing about Biocentrism - it takes the human being and all the wonderful ways of expressing the human experience into account. If you're open-minded and interested in the question 'what is life?' then read it."
45,1933771690,http://goodreads.com/user/show/11041240-zarathustra-goertzel,2,"Well, the book was thought provoking and hints at a point.Don't expect much time to be spent on actually talking about 'Biocentrism.' The seven principles of biocentrism are primarily built up negatively by bashing more standard views of the universe, and then throwing in biocentrism. Of course, he makes many good points along the way. They do not often necessarily lead to the conclusions he makes though.Take, for example, the start of principle five: ""The structure of the universe is explainable only through biocentrism."" Yeah, if the physics of the universe were a bit different, life as we know it may not be possible. We don't and can't really know yet. No, we can't jump from this to the conclusion that the only answer is biocentrism. The simulation argument, that we live in a simulation, is a good explanation for ""why biocentrism,"" which must be asked.The claim that 'space' and 'time' don't exist outside of animals is similar. He rightly points out that strict, absolute views of 'time' and 'space' don't really hold up, but this again doesn't mean they don't exist outside us. Ultimately, it almost feels like a straw-hat argument. Nor is there much attempt to distinguish between perceptions and the reality that is being perceived; it gets shoved under the carpet.Later biocentrism is briefly summarized in the chapter comparing how modern science, big religions and biocentrism answer the big questions about the universe. Of course, he asks modern science a bunch of questions and just answers with 'unknown' and doesn't give biocentrism many hard questions.It also comes up a bit in the section on consciousness.I have to say the book wasn't very well written. Perhaps someone else will take up the case better later :)?A more constructive description of biocentrism, and a more thorough exploration of what physics and the world would look like through biocentrism, taking consciousness as fundamental property of the universe."
46,1933771690,http://goodreads.com/user/show/25816074-thomas,5,"This book is fantastic. It presents a worldview entirely new to me, rooted in science and very exciting. Some of the science blew my mind. The only thing I still struggle with is other consciousness. Does reality exist where not you as the individual, but someone else sees it? How is consciousness tied to the individual? It probably isn't, because the book makes clear there are clear hints to a single consciousness (and no free will), but regardless, I'm still struggling with those questions."
47,1933771690,http://goodreads.com/user/show/17464834-jakub-ferencik,5,"Biocentrism is the term for describing a reality that is consciousness centered. That reality is not separate from our consciousness but essential in understanding everything that is in the world. Robert Lanza in his book, ""Biocentrism"" makes the claims that there is no death, time, space, that we all (the physical reality) are not individualistic entities but a collective consciousness. Sounds like a mouthful, but this book is definitely not in the style of Stephen Hawking's ""A Brief History of Time,"" where Ph.D. mathematicians have difficulty understanding what Hawking is getting at. It is dumbed down for the rest of us ""laypeople"" so to speak. The book is deeply based in research and has little to do with theoretical physics, even though it tends to talk about theories that are in the theoretical world: string theory, big bang theory, etc. When you read this - because I think it is a must for everyone - you need to be ready to reconsider everything you think about this reality to be true. It is honestly my favorite book of the last year. I will definitely re-read it again.If you want to read more of my reviews please be sure to check out my blog where I talk about meditation, effective altruism, efficiency, philosophy, and religion. All the good stuff :) medium.com/@jakubferencik "
48,1933771690,http://goodreads.com/user/show/54334405-dean-zochert,5,"I purchased the audio version of this book and really enjoyed listening. The hard copy probably would have been better so I could re-read at will. Lanza offers an alternative explanation to the creation of the universe than what most scientific theories provide these days. He has a great sense of humor and explains things quite well (as well as the double slit experiment can be explained). The universe not stupid, and it is not dead. The basic question one must ask is, “How did life evolve from a lifeless universe?” “Or, did the universe evolve from life itself?,” which is a premise of Biocentrism. Of course, those with religious beliefs of the origin will cling to that explanation, which truly is no explanation at all. Lanza also touches on basic reality...basic things such as time and space that we all take for granted as being constant, and they’re really not. They are highly affected by velocity, altitude, mass, and gravity. If you read this book you may just find yourself questioning what is real and what is not. You will be surprised! I’m presently reading Beyond Biocentrism, and Lanza is true to form in that one also."
49,1933771690,http://goodreads.com/user/show/12971754-adebayo-oyagbola,4,"This book puts us at the centre of everything. It postulates that rather than continue the endless debate about the origins not only of the universe but of existence itself we should understand that everything is actually coloured by how we see things. This, the author explains, is why the universe appears to have been created within very narrow and precise physical parameters that has our existence as its end point.The theory neatly explains certain known physics laws and principles such as Heisenberg's uncertainty principle. What it fails to grapple with is why from time to time we encounter phenomena in nature that are counter intuitive such as the postulated existence of dark matter. Perhaps, however, surprises of that nature are part of the things that our consciousness throw up.Ultimately, it is a well written book that requires a certain modicum of knowledge of physics and biology but that can be read by anybody who has ever questioned the nature of existence. It avoids turgidity and aims to convince the reader rather than to feed him dogma."
50,1933771690,http://goodreads.com/user/show/22546604-lucia,5,"I loved reading this book. I was curious about the topic of biocentrism explained, but I didn't expect it to be supported by so many experiments. There is everything in this book - physics, biology, philosophy, religion. I especially loved to read about my favorite double slit experiment, the quantum entanglement, the quantum physics and the theory of relativity. This was maybe the first time that I read about all these and another topics in one book and in one theory. Lanza also answered a lot of the questions that I have been thinking about for some time, like how would a photon perceive the time, as it is traveling at the speed of light, it should not perceive the time at all, etc.Lanza's theory of biocentrism seems to me to really have a support in the science, especially in the physics and quantum physics and maybe it can be the base of the long searched theory of everything.I recommend this book to everyone. All is well explained here, maybe better than I have ever read, but if you already have some previous knowledge of physics, you will enjoy it even more."
51,1933771690,http://goodreads.com/user/show/20071317-alexandra-pederson,4,"As a thoroughly indoctrinated evolutionist with a degree in life sciences and years of work as a naturalist, I approached this book curious and skeptical. I was floored. Though I rarely stop after a chapter when reading to digest, this was a book that required it. Each chapter was more profound than the next, and yet with the consistent accessible language, I rarely felt lost. In addition, each concept built upon the next and it wasn't until mid-way through the book when explaining to my partner that time AND space are human constructs did I realize how deep into the rabbit hole I'd fallen. Talk about mind-bending!My main critique of this book is that the author glazes over the application to practical life. At times he discusses the loss of people dear to him with astounding peace because, in accordance with the philosophy, those people are both dead and alive at the same time. That said, it's a profound read that introduces a novel concept in a rarely challenged field. Strongly recommend. "
52,1933771690,http://goodreads.com/user/show/575417-jim-foley,5,"Here indeed is a provocative book! Written by two eminent scientists who propose that finding a ""Theory of Everything"" will never succeed until consciousness is taken into account. Starting with Quantum Theory, which contains many counter-intuitive facts that scientists usually ignore, such as the observations that space and time do not seem to exist at the quantum level, and particles do not seem to exist until they are observed, the authors suggest that maybe Quantum Theory represents the true state of affairs, and that space, time, and reality are just constructs of the conscious mind!This book does not contain a new Theory of Everything. Rather it is a summation of all the many features of the world around us that we know to be true but do not understand. It urges us to step outside our normal way of thinking to see the world in a new way. It is a clarion call to scientists to include the existence of consciousness in the search to understand how the world really works."
53,1933771690,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2658964-sher,5,"This is a fascinating book about the idea that life creates the universe, not the other way around. It is interesting to me that scientists can swear to you that such-and-thus theory HAS to be correct because there just is no other way it can be. Then a number of years later, they discover that they didn't know about this or that which makes such-and-thus impossible. I love that! But the thing I loved most about this book was the fact that the theories the author postulates come closer and closer to my understanding of the universe as proposed by an obscure, unlearned boy-prophet in the 1820s and '30s. It stays constant while scientific findings orbit around it, and now and then hits something right on. Wow, my testimony of the restored gospel of Jesus Christ just shot through the roof!"
54,1933771690,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5231835-brett,5,"This book was thoroughly fascinating. Dr. Lanza possesses that rare ability to explain profoundly abstract and complex ideas in language that is completely accessible by the lay-person. I would be tempted to compare his gift for language to Brian Greene (The Elegant Universe) if not for Lanza's clear dislike for String Theory.Lanza's prose is nearly conversational, and he deftly interjects personal anecdotes at just the moment the complexity of his topic is about to overwhelm the reader. But cleverly, while these interjections allow us a breather to digest what we've just learned, they gently guide us toward his next topic.I simply can't praise this book enough. For anyone with the casual lay-person's interest in Quantum Physics this book will not fail to enthrall!"
55,1933771690,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5750739-jon-marc-smith,4,"This is a good book, but I can't go all the way with Lanza. My guess is the problematic nature of reality he talks about is not a sign of the power of consciousness, but is a problem with our measuring tools or our ability to understand reality. I just can't believe that the world goes away if we're not seeing it -- I don't care what the math or even the particle experiments say.Really, none of what Lanza says is more persuasive to me than the weak anthropic principle. However, I'm certainly willing to entertain the ideas and think about how consciousness may be tangled up with the origins of the universe. We are all tangled and connected to everything else -- the big bang and the origins of carbon show us this. But I'm too materialistic to believe consciousness is more than just an organic phenomenon (possibly even an epiphenomenon). A fun read, nevertheless."
56,1933771690,http://goodreads.com/user/show/33508993-read-it,5,"Good Job Dr. Lanza. Five Star review on his book. Great great book on Time Magazine most important people in the world. Dr. Lanza used his knowledge of Stems cells, Biotechnology, biology and explores the world of physics and explains in detail on how the human brain works and how the Human consciousness creates the reality when observed. Talks about the history of consciousness and how it affects everyday living and tried to explain how consciousness lives and how is carries around Space-time with it wherever it goes like a turtle with a shell. Every creature is within its reality bubbles. Good Job and I hope Dr. Lanza produces more books. I have become a big fan of his works on explaining the consciousness better than anybody has before.

And if you’ve already read a low review, disregard that and read it anyways. But as with any new and unconventional idea, empty your cup before you dive in, or your dogma and previous belief systems will interfere with your perceptions and learning processes. That includes your scientific knowledge. This book thinks outside the box, and you should too when you read it. Science has already proven that particles behave differently when they are observed and when they are not. Quantum physics is getting closer and closer to a unified field theory—or a theory of everything which will explain how the entire universe interacts and behaves. This book simply takes those ideas a step further. Just read it!"

This is one of those books.Much of it is a tease.....I'm NOT a scientist.....but I don't care. Lanza does an incredible job in making most of the content relatable and understandable to a lay person. And yet, I have read some of the recently published books on new veins appearing in the world of cosmology, physics and neuroscience. Then there was ""Finding God in Physics,"" about 8 years ago, which kicked off the discussion for me. In short, there's a LOT going on with those guys in the white coats who are trying to dissect the Universe, it's creation and....most importantly, according to Lanza, the key to understanding it all...Consciousness."
59,1933771690,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5580942-martin,1,"What a terrible, terrible book. It's written well enough, if you set aside Lanza's inability to tell the difference between semantics and philosophy. Or his painfully obvious and apparently genuinely deep bias against establishment science (which is odd considering his normal vocation).I wanted to read this book because, while the idea, even on the surface, is absurd, I wanted to understand how he came to it. Ultimately, I didn't finish it, because his biases and conspiratorial bent are frustratingly naive and get in the way of him telling the actual story of Biocentrism.In all...not even worthy of one star, but the Goodread's system won't allow a zero-star review."

It explains how important it is to incorporate the observer (you or me) into all aspects of physics, cosmology, and biology. The book has a few interesting personal stories told by Robert himself. If you get lost as I do on some detailed scientific verbiage. Be patient or skim threw a few pages. A few physics experiments I looked up videos online to better understand visually.

Written by an MD and astronomer, Biocentrism explores the view that rather than the univers creating consciousness, consciousness, in fact, created the universe. Don't be fooled, there's no talk of God here. Lanza and Berman back up this theory with hard science, and in the process, explain how physics works. This is definitley a book for anyone pondering the meaning of life, the universe and everything."

Biocentrism says space and time are just tools of the mind as opposed to independent, absolute realities existing ""out there"". We brand and label with such ferocity and conviction in our everyday perceptions, we may be renouncing lucid experiential flow for discrete, contorted avatars of reality. ""There is something more elusive to life than the succession of shapes we see frozen into matter"". "

Then I remembered that Dr. Lanza is a scientific genius in many fields, who has always been ahead of his time.

I can get down with small stuff like 'No, a tree doesn't make a noise if there's no one to hear it', but not sure about 'The universe ceases to be if there are no observers'.
