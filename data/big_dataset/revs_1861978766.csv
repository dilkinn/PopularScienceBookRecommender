0,1861978766,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1237196-petra-x,3,"I've finished the book and have discovered one gem above all others, but it's too late for me :-( Conkers. If you are British you would almost certainly have played conkers when you were in primary school. Every Autumn term you would pick up the fallen horse chestnuts and applied your chosen treatment to harden it, threaded it up and hoped you'd got the hardest one, a real champion, a ten-er maybe. I never got more than a six-er, but I pickled mine and as it turns out this was not the best treatment. Everyone had their own method of hardening their conkers. Pickling, baking and even varnishing which was semi-illegal, were the favourites. But this book says that conkers from previous years would have dried out and been harder. The older the conker the harder it would be but they wouldn't be pretty and shiny but just a dull brown.So that's a good tip. But something tells me old conkers weren't legal. I'm too old to remember though, is there anyone here young enough to know? LOL________Gem. Ants being able to run around in a microwave without being toasted. This is because they can sense where the current is and evade it. If you put a plate of marshmallows in the microwave they will cook unevenly (take out the turntable) and you will see the unevenness.Gem. Hot water in a shallow or ice cube tray will freeze faster than cold water if places on a cold, frosty surface. The surface of the water will cool faster because of accelerated heat exchange and the bottom will melt the frost underneath slightly which will then refreeze and provide a bigger, colder surface to turn the water into ice. The bit that the book left out is that the ice cube tray is now stuck to the bottom of the freezer so you can't get it out and use the ice cubes anyway.______Not really a good book for reading but kind of ok for being stuck in queues where you expect to be called at any minute and can't really concentrate. Three stars is generous but that's me!"
1,1861978766,http://goodreads.com/user/show/23633001-roz-anthi,3,"It's a nicely organised book, offering lots of answers to questions you'd never expect to have. The content was funny and witty, and most of the times, a person with minimal understanding of the physical world would get the general idea behind the given explanations. However, I found the absense of explanatory diagrammes and schemes quite disturbing. You can't describe experiments only with words or explain phenomena without some sort of visual help."
2,1861978766,http://goodreads.com/user/show/223837-nicky,3,"Pretty much like any of the other New Scientist books: full of information, some of it more interesting to me, some of it less. Some of the chosen answers are quite funny, and quite a few of the questions are quite weird. Some of the answers are very similar to principles in the other books, but for the most part there's a good spread of different information here. Well categorised, too: a section on human bodies, on food, on domestic science...Also noticed that it works as a flipbook with a fishing penguin. Ha."
3,1861978766,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1889618-karen-heart,4,"A good book for anyone would like to hear possible explanations to those things that we ponder in our everyday lives. I say ""possible"" because the answers come from those who have written in with their own views and studies on it, some having several possible (or conflicting) answers.I think it was put together very well and very amusing but someone looking for solid facts or not interested in hearing from random individuals could possibly find it disappointing. Otherwise, fun for all ages."

5,1861978766,http://goodreads.com/user/show/28368477-alatea,3,"Some things were more interesting, some things were less interesting. A nice change after all that fiction that I've read recently :)"
6,1861978766,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4901611-john,3,"The book answered many questions across the science fields. Overall, it was very quick, interesting read. The questions and answers come from a column in the magazine New Scientist. The only drawback, in my opinion, is that the qualifications of those answering are seldom listed. Once in a while, someone lists that they are a professor at such-and-such university, or work at a company that directly relates to the question, so they can give a unique insight into the product/process being asked about, but for the most part, it is just a name, giving me more reason to doubt their qualifications vs those who specify why they know the answer."
7,1861978766,http://goodreads.com/user/show/46538050-lance,3,"""The question has certainly made me reluctant to take accepted wisdom for granted when it comes to observations which do not fit preconceived notions of what is correct.""There are some really fun, interesting questions in this book. I enjoy the Last Word section of New Scientist, as the questioners often take something so familiar that I can often take for granted and make me think more methodically about phenomena I encounter every day. Reading the collection in this book was fun as a trivia collection, and also as a puzzle book, as I tried to come up with an explanation for each question before reading the contributors' submissions. A light work out for my brain and well-suited to bright teenagers.My favourite question posed was: Two people lose each other while wandering through the isles of a large supermarket. Should one person stop moving, or would they encounter each other sooner if both were moving through the isles? My intuition was that the friends would be reunited faster if both were actively looking, but I couldn't back this up. I started thinking about two independent random walks and the probability of their intersecting in a finite time versus the probability of a single random walk intersecting a given point. This led to an interesting conversation with my mathematician husband Baby Adam about the 'coupling' of random walks being used to generate probabilities for these moving closer together or further apart. It's amazing how much there is to think about in these simple everyday problems!Other stand-out questions included: Why is it when I walk home from the pub after a few beers, I always stumble to the left? As a neuroscientist, I immediately focuses on the dominant eye, but others wrote about the dominant leg, or the more muscular leg, and it got me wondering what happens for people whose dominant eye and leg are on the opposite side of their body? (I am all left-sided.) Is there any connection between being cold and catching a cold? This is a favourite old-wives' tale of my mother's, so it was interesting to see people write in about the initial chill that comes before the cold fever as reverse causality, but nothing about being cold lowering peoples' immune systems? Why do sheep always run in a straight line in front of cars and not to the side? Basically, sheep want to avoid exposing their throat to fast, manoeuvrable predators such as wolves and big cats. But why don't the sheep learn that cars are nowhere near as lithe as wolves and in fact have huge turning circles? They have a folded cerebral cortex after all! If Polar bears were transferred to Antarctica would they survive? And would penguins survive in the Arctic? Thankfully for the beautiful Emperor penguin, no one has put polar bears in Antarctica, but I was amazed to learn that in 1936, penguins were introduced to Norway to replace the extinct great auk, but suffered the same predation by man. Why is an image in a mirror inverted left to right and not top to bottom? This was one of those questions that seemed simple, just because it is so familiar and effect. It was interesting to think about the human psychological bias to understand this effect in terms of rotation rather than reflection, but I will still need to think about this a little longer before I am sure I have it understood. What time is it at the North Pole? There was only really cool answer which gave a method for making a star or sun based 24-hour clock to track the passage of hours in 6-month darkness or light. We have tried the experiment taught by science teachers in which a candle immersed in water is covered by an upturned glass. This question, which was the source of the pull-quote at the beginning of my review, debunked the common explanation that the candle will only go out once all the oxygen in the air is used up by showing that the volume of air left in the jar is less when more candles are present. It was interesting to question the status-quo and find that the traditional explanation had omitted the simple phenomenon that the air will expand when being heated by the candles and that part of the reduction in volume is due to decreased temperature of the air under the jar.And I liked finding out once and for all why Rock the Boat bottled ale is better than Budweiser!Not all of the questions were interesting to me, there were a few about gun accidents that just made me sad, and several about wines which I am simply too working-class to claim to understand. But overall the questions were fun, the most entertaining being the ones that had an abstract component that could be contemplated from several different angles."

9,1861978766,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1331517-jessica,2,"A few of the questions asked in this book where interesting and there were even a couple of humorous responses, but the vast majority didn't really capture my attention. In many cases the questions had several answers provided, which would have been fine if they all added something new to the discussion, but most of the time they just regurgitated the same sort of responses. I also wasn't a fan of the complicated scientific jargon... I love to learn new things, but a lot of this either a.) went over my head, or b.) made my eyes start to glaze over."
10,1861978766,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4223286-ken,2,This book is a series of questions that have been answered by readers of the New Scientist magazine. Most of the questions were interesting but others I did not care about at all. The questions are grouped under themes that makes up the chapters of this book. I feel that some of the answers can be further filtered so you do not end up with questions with 3 or 4 different answers. This is one of those books that you pick up and read a question from time to time.
11,1861978766,http://goodreads.com/user/show/27252466-mehmet-yildirim,2,I found myself struggling to finish this book. Some answers to questions are unreasonably long which makes the reader bored.
12,1861978766,http://goodreads.com/user/show/10741552-shriya,3,Questions sent in by readers of New Scientist are answered.Personally only few questions where in there for me. Some rather humorous.
13,1861978766,http://goodreads.com/user/show/643332-graceann,3,"This book, from the New Scientist Last Word Editors, does just what it says on the cover. There are 114 questions that were asked and answered in the magazine's pages. Many of them made me say ""hey, now that's a good question, and I never thought of why that would be.""Unfortunately, though I can see why this would occur, given that the book is already only 230 or so pages long to begin with, there is a fair amount of repetition. One question might get the same answer written three or more different ways, which gets monotonous after a while. There are also the answers that strive (and fail) to be amusing, such as the wag who answered the question of why we veer to the left when we're drunk by stating that we've spent all our money and thus our right-hand pocket is emptier by the end of the night. Yawn.This is the kind of book that my Dad might have called a ""bathroom reader;"" it's perfect to dip in and out of for a few minutes at a time. I don't suggest that you attempt reading it as I did, as a dedicated, beginning-to-end read, because that just induced the question of ""how many pages are left to read in this thing?"""
14,1861978766,http://goodreads.com/user/show/66084460-kirsty,4,"I learnt some interesting things, and found I could read this book either in long stints (e.g. on a long train ride) or by the occasional peruse. This is because the layout was based on the questions and answers. So if you only have a few minutes (e.g. in the doctor's waiting room), you could just read one question and the provided answers.One thing I did find a little annoying was that for some of the questions, there were several answers that provided the exact same explanation, the additional answers provided did not reveal anything new. I found myself skipping a few pages because of this. However, there were many times were the extra answers provided were interesting. They either sparked debate, provided additional information, or purely comedic value.If I was given the remaining books as a present, I would certainly read them."
15,1861978766,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3315638-jaki,3,"Small tidbits of information about a lot of different and random topics. It sort of feels like a bartender has written this as bartenders know a little about a lot of things, but not a lot about many things. The title drags you in because who doesn't want to know why penguins' feet don't freeze?! Then it takes you on a random journey or facts. Like being on a trivia show. I liked that the book was narrated by many different people, which assisted in the question and answer format, but especially since the answers were provided by not only scientists from around the world but anyone who knew the answer and wrote it with it. Sometimes there were multiple answers, and even contradicting answers when a definitive answer has not been reached by consensus in the scientific community. There was even a very descriptive and informative answer given by a primary school student. "
16,1861978766,http://goodreads.com/user/show/52737534-callum-soukup-croy,1,"I don't get the point of this book at all. If it was accurate answers to often pondered questions that would be interesting and worth reading but the answers are useless. Because they are submitted by readers of the New Scientist, there are often multiple answers saying the same thing. Bizarrely the person who collated the book includes all of them so you end up reading the same explanation several times. Or worse, someone else contradicts the first person and both answers are shown with no clarification as to which is correct. Failing either of those two, the answer is some supposedly witty response which is usually not funny and not interesting. This is just a terrible book and was clearly only published to be a money spinner for the New Scientist."
17,1861978766,http://goodreads.com/user/show/86401602-aiden-forbes,3,"This book was pretty mediocre. Half of it was pretty facinating, answering a bunch of questions that I think we’ve all asked. Stuff like “why does a tea kettle whistle” or “how does a gun silencer work,” which is pretty interesting. The other half of the book was hearing the same answer, just reworded in a different way. Some times they didn’t even answer the question. It felt like they just tried to say I “don’t know” in the most complicated way possible. Other then this, the answers that were given were pretty good and easy to understand. I feel like the author could have sorted out the answers to the questions a little bit more, but other then that, this book was pretty good."
18,1861978766,http://goodreads.com/user/show/31403872-trung-nguyen-dang,3,"A very short book which is a compilation of Q&A in the 'Last Word' column of New Scientist, a weekly publication. The questions are submitted by the readers and the answers are also contributed by other people/readers. Thus, the quality of answers vary. Sometimes there are multiple answers to the same question. Thus, it is much better to read book written by one author for consistency/quality of writing and answers, in my view. For example, I much prefer ""Storm in a Teacup: The Physics of Everyday Life"" by Helen Czerski. "
19,1861978766,http://goodreads.com/user/show/11592622-matt,1,"Just not what I was expecting, I've certainly better and more stimulating books that often add humour to their answers whilst not detracting from a fact book.I defiantly wouldn't read it again or recommend it. Flatly written and boring from start to finish. Would rate it 0⭐️ if I could."
20,1861978766,http://goodreads.com/user/show/71745236-chloe-c,4,This was a pretty good book in general. It was a little confusing especially if you do not have past experience in what the author is talking about in the short stories. A great book though since it explains scenarios very thoroughly. 
21,1861978766,http://goodreads.com/user/show/27755070-shorouk-abd-elhamid,4,This was a good read. I think the second half is better than the first one.I loved the collection of the questions. They were in different fields and that kept me reading. I think I will reread it to absorb all this information.
22,1861978766,http://goodreads.com/user/show/86727506-icyjester,4,This book was very interesting. I found questions I have asked myself and finally had them answered. Not everyday questions but questions that you have asked yourself at least once in your life. I found this book very fun to read.
23,1861978766,http://goodreads.com/user/show/17523118-kevin,3,"Harmless quick read of ""factoids"". Interestingly some of the questions are left with only suggestions and no clear answer. What time IS it at the North Pole?!"

Some questions were really funny, others made me think and try to come up with an answer (as a Science student, I'm quite disappointed with myself; I couldn't answer most of these!) and some were just plain weird.It was a fun break from the mediocre book-spring I was having in the beginning of the year and I enjoyed my time reading it, for sure."
30,1861978766,http://goodreads.com/user/show/19488649-andy-phillips,4,"This book is a collection of questions asked, and answered, by readers of 'New Scientist' magazine. If you've never read the magazine, the questions are fairly light-hearted and vary a lot in content. Paraphrasing, examples are 'Why are windows in ships round?', 'What is the diameter of a lightning bolt?', 'Do the living outnumber the dead?' and 'Would polar bears and penguins survived if they swapped poles?'.The answers are often quite detailed in their replies, or require some level of scientific knowledge, but can be quite entertaining. I've got a reasonable scientific background and got the idea most of the time, but I certainly didn't understand everything as some of the answers contain a lot of jargon and specialised knowledge can help. Obviously the editor has picked some good examples, so the quality of the book is generally pretty good. My only real complaint has been raised by other reviewers - some of the replies aren't really answers, they're more like educated guesses, and sometimes they contradict one another. In a way that adds to the charm as the book doesn't take itself too seriously.A good book if you want to learn something but don't want to think to hard while you're doing it."
31,1861978766,http://goodreads.com/user/show/54212445-justin,3,"How do you get transparent ice? What's the chemiscal formula for a human being? Is there any connection to being cold and catching a cold? Why do areoplanes have such small windows? Is it a coincidence a human finger fits exactly into a human nostril?These questions and more are asked in NewScientist's follow-up to the No.1 bestseller 'Does Anything Eat Wasps?'. I guess the real question is this: do we really care? The truth is that while there were some interesting facts presented in this compilation of questions and answers, I ended up skipping quite a few for lack of interest in what the answer was. Also, many of the questions weren't answered by experts in the fields and the follow-up answers pointed out that previous answers were slightly or completely incorrect. I would have preferred one detailed, understandable, and factual answer than three, four, or even five answers in which the writer was sometimes incorrect. However, where the questions and answers were interesting it was enjoyable. If you like random trivia then I recommend this book, but I do think that there are better question and answer books out there."
32,1861978766,http://goodreads.com/user/show/39316937-vlad,3,"This was entertaining, for the most part. Some of the questions got significantly more answers than others (and frankly the answers were very repetitive sometimes). I understand that they wanted to preserve the answers in their entirety but I think editing and cutting sections out of them would have made for a more entertaining read.To be honest I found only about half of the questions entertaining as a science nerd, since I haven't read the previous books, I don't know if these were really the most interesting questions in the series, I sometimes struggled to believe that though. This was just an OK read, especially good for plane, train or car rides but that's about it really. Also don't read this to kids some of the answers go heavy on the science."
33,1861978766,http://goodreads.com/user/show/64078-richard,4,"Science strives ever onwards in search of the answers to the big questions. Is there a grand unifying theory (GUT) of everything, is the Higgs Boson the key to this theory etc.But day to day the questions that people want to know the answers to are things like 'why is the sky blue?' and 'does hot water freeze more quickly than cold water?'.And this is the book to find answers to lots of questions that you really want to know. The questions and answers all come from a column called 'The last word' in the New Scientist magazine, and this book is a follow up to an earlier book in a very similar vein.Interesting and funny."

You don't have to be a genius to understand most of the content of the book but some of the more in depth answers do take a lot of concentration to follow. A good factual book which I feel is at its best when you dip in and out of it when you have a few spare minutes rather than attempting the whole thing in one go.

Well worth reading whatever your age or ability and knowledge of science in general. "
47,1861978766,http://goodreads.com/user/show/26002872-elias-jabbour,4,"Despite its ridiculous title this book has actually answered most of my childhood wonderings. What kept me from giving this book a 5 stars-rating is its multiple presented analysis and perspectives on questions where one answer would've been more than enough. Some of the asked questions left me dubious about the limits a person's curiosity can reach, for some people are pathetic enough to linger on meaningless ponderings such as "" why is snot green? ""."
48,1861978766,http://goodreads.com/user/show/100826-matt,2,"The key part of the title is ""114 other questions"" This is a collection of questions posed by readers to newscientist magazine, and a collection of answers also posed by the readers. I would have appreciated a little research on the part of the editor to supply the actual answers, as many of the readers of newscientist are stupid."
49,1861978766,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5518007-amanda,3,"This was our bathroom book. It's perfect for that kind of reading: you can read one or two questions and answers in a short time, and you don't have to read from page 1 to the end. I learned many interesting things through this book. In general it is written for non-scientists to be able to understand, yet at times, some answers were still fairly technical. "
50,1861978766,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2175967-kristina,4,"Loved it and learnt lots from this book about things I've always wondered about but never knew how to ask! Glad to know I'm not the only one in this world that thinks and wonders about such eclectic things as ""why juice doesn't pour properly but runs down the outside of the carton"" to ""why the keypads to phones and calculators are arranged differently"""
51,1861978766,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6192290-shahrun,4,"This book answers many random questions that the reader may or may not have ever thought about. I like to have a guess at the answers before reading them (just for my own amusement). I love the format of the books and the flick animation down the side of the pages. Some answers are a bit to technical for me, but there are some very funny answers too!"
52,1861978766,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5580415-jenn,3,"Not nearly as humorous as the cover would have you believe. The questions are reminiscent of David Feldman's Imponderables & Bill McLain, but since they are opened up by New Scientist for anyone too answer, many of the responses are completely inscrutable for someone who hasn't sat in a physics class for 20 years. "
53,1861978766,http://goodreads.com/user/show/48859032-jamie-macdonald-jones,3,"There were some moderately interesting bits and pieces in this book that don't often get answered. It was a little unclear whether all of the answers were fact-checked beforehand with only occasional comments from the editor and sometimes fractious responses. Interspersed with some dry humour, it was an appreciable quick read."
54,1861978766,http://goodreads.com/user/show/565673-nicholas-whyte,0,"http://nhw.livejournal.com/813964.html[return][return]The sequel to Does Anything Eat Wasps?, with again loads of scientific trivia. Though I'm not completely sure I believe what it says about snot."
55,1861978766,http://goodreads.com/user/show/684825-eric,3,"This was another good science trivia book. They seemed to really over explain things at times but, obviously, I learned a lot. The questions it answers were interesting too although most were not practical to everyday use. Still, if you love science like I do, this is a good read."
56,1861978766,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1118787-deb,2,"Eeeh. There are some interesting facts in here. The format is Question, then a series of answers from different sources. I'd prefer a compilation of the answers, making ONE; and possibly a Short Answer/Long Answer format. And I found the layout to be drab and uninteresting. "
57,1861978766,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1318024-bryce,4,"I enjoyed this book because for people like me who have a million and one questions that hardly anyone else cares to hear, this book offered a fountain of information for me. Who can argue with that?"
58,1861978766,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1509851-ashley,3,This was another book that answers many questions that most of us have asked ourselves but never really sought the answers. A surprising amount of actual fact mixed with some urban legends and old wives' tales. 
59,1861978766,http://goodreads.com/user/show/382536-kerry,3,"I do enjoy these books. I admit my brain can't always follow the explanations, but they are all interesting. I'm sorry that I've finished all three and will now have to wait for another one to be published. Maybe I need to check out the New Scientist website."
60,1861978766,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4142908-void-lon-ixaarii,4,"This book is full of fascinating, often childlike questions about the world... and then all sorts of experts answer them. Really interesting stuff ranging from the time at the north pole to things that influence the taste of foods."
61,1861978766,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4141635-mark-warner,4,An interesting collection of questions and answers which can be dipped in and out of. Lots of answers are provided for each question... which sometimes contradict each other and at others are hilarious! A perfect book to pick up when you have a few spare minutes.
62,1861978766,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1468182-mathematical-cats,3,I enjoyed this book but found that on the Kindle the reply letters seem to last forever on some of the questions raised. I would get another of the New Scientist books but I wont be rushing to Amazon to get them.
63,1861978766,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5976331-neil-denham,3,"A good collection of questions and answers, although some have been asked a few too many times in my experience! Sometimes gets bogged down in detail which may leave the casual reader bored or confused, or both."
64,1861978766,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6591885-tommyboy,4,"Very intersting. Had a lot of random facts. Good for a Science Teacher(which I am). My only complaint was that the book was either written in England or Australia, so it had a lot of facts that didn't really apply to the US. A lot of references to tea!"
65,1861978766,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2943734-steven,2,Not bad when you have a spare minute although the fact that answers where provided in the form of multiple reader submissions meant that sometimes conflicting answers where given. In addition to this some of the answers where huge and several where provided meaning it got a little boring at times. 
66,1861978766,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7051363-aloysius,2,"A book of trivia in the form of Q&A. Some questions are more interesting than others, and although the information is given in a succinct and understandable way, this is not the most enlightening or most interesting book I've ever read. "
67,1861978766,http://goodreads.com/user/show/17330988-james,3,"This compendium of questions taken from the columns of the New Scientist magazine cover all sorts of scientific topics in an engaging manner. A quick and easy read, with minimum scientific jargon, this book will entertain and educate its readers. "
68,1861978766,http://goodreads.com/user/show/30269734-kayla,4,A very interesting book that answered the questions you never even thought of. Was interesting to read the conflicting comments and there were many occassions when you decided yourself what answer you thought was best.
69,1861978766,http://goodreads.com/user/show/8575263-melissa,3,Its interesting. If you are a science person or liked the previous books it could be a good coffee table book. This book is full of questions with answers from a variety of folks. Most questions are answered by multiple people.
70,1861978766,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7464033-eleanor,3,"It was a delight to read those questions we've maybe had on the back of your heads but have never quite gotten to formulate, as well as those varied, detailed answers. I didn't read them all but the ones I did were certainly thorough. "
71,1861978766,http://goodreads.com/user/show/29293888-helena,3,"This wasn't what I expected - I thought it has something to do with humor, but actually this was a scientific book. I learned many new things, although some topics were interesting, some weren't. Loved to read some parts aloud to my family members :)"

73,1861978766,http://goodreads.com/user/show/721053-sai-thein-than,4,funny. those who love science should definitely check this out. 
74,1861978766,http://goodreads.com/user/show/742135-emma,0,Penguins. They're good.
75,1861978766,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1086435-cat,2,"just a dabble book, but a few interesting posers answered"
76,1861978766,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1768003-sam,4,"This book has the answers to even more of those questions that many have asked (especially kids) without getting an answer. Enjoyable and informative, you can't help but enjoy this book"
77,1861978766,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4081494-georgina-ball,2,"Wasn't overly impressed to be honest. Most the questions were pretty dull, as in I don't really care what the answer is, and some of the answers go on and on unneccessarily."
78,1861978766,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2147949-victoria,3,Some interesting answers to questions that often crop up. This book is good for filling those ten minute gaps!
79,1861978766,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1308512-lindsay,4,"A nice book of facts and information. It was interesting how some of the questions had multiple answers, sometimes disagreeing, which did give a sense of how science is still answering questions. "
80,1861978766,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5870191-mark-jones,3,"Interesting, but occasionally too didactic, too specific... Too, well, scientific. The conflicting answers sometimes struck me as a little counter-intuitive, but such is the way of science."

83,1861978766,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6021253-chris,2,"A nice enough book to dip in and out of. However, I found that many of the responses to the questions posed were very repetitive when one answer would have been sufficient. "
84,1861978766,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5634004-mark,4,Answered why bird sh*t is white :-) - good one!

89,1861978766,http://goodreads.com/user/show/9646919-jireh,3,"Shall reread it soon. There's so much of the world we need to notice, really. "
