1,0641587716,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3655942-rakhi-dalal,4,"An artist's sketch of a black hole's event horizonSometimes when we look at the evening sky, observe a shooting star far away or admire the beauty of moon, we are overpowered by this idea of our seemingly insignificant existence in the Universe. For if we compare our very own presence, that of our world or our country, even of our planet or our galaxy with the Universe, it is bewildering that we seem to occupy not even a speck of dust as compared to the vastness of the Universe. Many of us are then tempted to delve into the mysteries of this existence to make out some meaning, some significance. Whereas philosophy seems to correspond to our inner being in relation to world around, we need to turn to science in order to understand our relation with the Universe. The attempt thus taken, even though neither Science nor Philosophy seems to offer an absolute explanation, may bring about a more modest outlook towards our existence and empathy towards fellow beings. But since most of the scientific theories and their explanation are available theoretically in a technical manner, not many of us make an attempt to understand them. In this work, Hawking not only suggests making scientific knowledge simpler enough for everyone so that more people can understand and benefit from it but also presents to us scientific theories in very simple way. The work is a compilation of seven lectures delivered by Hawking in which he discusses various theories like Theory of relativity, Big Bang, Black Hole, Quantum theory, Quantum Gravity and String theory to finally propose a ‘unified theory’ which might one day be able to take every known theory into account and give us an explanation of the existence of Universe. Hawking is so lucid at explaining these theories and then presenting reasons as to why certain theories may not hold that even a naïve science reader like me can understand them. Moreover he is also quite witty at certain places, which makes the work an enjoyable read e.g.“In other words, the singularities produced by gravitational collapse occur only in places like black holes, where they are decently hidden from outside view by an event horizon. Strictly, this is what is known as the weak cosmic censorship hypothesis: protect observers who remain outside the black hole from the consequences of the breakdown of predictability that occurs at the singularity. But it does nothing at all for the poor unfortunate astronaut who falls into the hole. Shouldn’t God protect his modesty as well?”“However, in the end most people, including John Taylor, have come to the conclusion that black holes must radiate like hot bodies if our other ideas about general relativity and quantum mechanics are correct. Thus even though we have not yet managed to find a primordial black hole, there is fairly general agreement that if we did, it would have to be emitting a lot of gamma and X rays. If we do find one, I will get the Nobel Prize.”Some concepts like Black hole radiation, arrows of time and quantum theory of gravity are very interesting. The idea of ‘reverse arrow of time’ made my head spin in a good way. Towards the end, when Hawking discusses the need of a unified theory and the question why such a theory may not be possible, he ends his lecture in the following manner:However, if we do discover a complete theory, it should in time be understandable in broad principle by everyone, not just a few scientists. Then we shall all be able to take part in the discussion of why the universe exists. If we find the answer to that, it would be the ultimate triumph of human reason. For then we would know the mind of God.I will recommend this book to all those who want a have an idea about the Universe in terms of theories developed so far."

He kept language simple and easily understandable. The author mixes science with philosophy. It exhibits a subtle sense of humor in the book. It's a short read. Stephen Hawking poses interesting questions about God. All in all, a recommended reading.Read full review - Books Charming"
3,0641587716,http://goodreads.com/user/show/54103953-archit-ojha,4,"After reading A Brief History of Time, I wanted to read Stephen Hawking's other books immediately.The Theory of Everything consists of lectures and notes by Prof. Hawking. His writing still amazes me whenever I get to have a look at his books."
4,0641587716,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4099020-carla-ren,5,"I wasn't sure what to expect when I approached this book. Being such a huge Einstein fan and knowing how he struggled in his own, final quest for the Theory of Everything just before he died, well, I didn't know what to think. Had Hawking finally cracked that elusive nut?I was originally homeless when I first discovered this book, and living in my car with my 2 cats. I would head to the library on special days to kill time, and immediately go to this book and throw myself into its pages. I'd always been a sort of Hawking/Penrose fan up to this point, but really got into the details of the theories seriously when I decided to return to college to study math and theoretical physics.I was pleasantly surprised at the amount of levity and wit Hawking used to approach his topical essays! And he made a successful, conscious choice to remove most of the superfluous ""professor-speak"" and attempt to keep it on a level that most non-scientists could understand. I commend him for that. This book was a bit of an eye-opener for me. My favourite essays were of those on black holes. The interesting thing, is that since reading this book, we have discovered the existence of hyper-giants, which weren't around when Chandresekhar devised his now famous, ""Chandresekhar limit"" when calculating at what conditions an imploding star would finally fold under the mass of itself and become a black hole. It makes me wonder what this now does to his limit calculations.All in all, a superb book for the scientist and non-scientist alike. Highly recommend. "
5,0641587716,http://goodreads.com/user/show/26837471-swati,4,"Language is lucid. However, at times theories are quite complex and simple pictorial illustrations if incorporated might have had been useful. The book starts off with the ancient theories on universe evolution and gradually explains reasons for non-feasibility of the same in a structured manner. It is followed by explaining that why universe is non-static, future of stars, different evolutionary models, flaws in them, the paradox which is created if we assume singularity to be existent at the time of bing bang, concepts of quantum gravity and imaginary time to find solutions for fundamental limitations arising because of singularity assumption, possible histories of universe and ultimately capability of string theory to resolve unsolved mysteries. At the end author has explained that why unified theory is not possible presently but might be possible in future.Author does tried to add light humour in some parts. Fascinating read!"
6,0641587716,http://goodreads.com/user/show/8673311-kaustubh,5,"Not a novel per se but a collection of lectures by Mr Hawking, which explores the origins of the universe and tries to find the answer to ""Why does the Universe exist, anyway?"". Stephen Hawking tries to explain the origin of the Universe or The Big Bang without going into the technicalities and also gives a brief overview of various theories present that try to explain the state of the Universe (even the String theory). The writing is simple but still multiple readings will be required to completely understand the full book (for me atleast). Hawking's witty propositions and his subtle doubts at the existence of THE CREATOR makes it a very enjoyable experience.A must read for anyone interested in cosmology5/5"
7,0641587716,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6595648-bam-the-bibliomaniac,3,"Audiobook was not the smart choice for this for me. I'm not an auditory learner and didn't take this into account. So I don't think I retained any of this information. However, while I listened I was completely enthralled. He really does a great job of simplifying deluxe principles. Thermodynamics seem to be the focus here. "
8,0641587716,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3568752-larissa-fauber,4,"Black holes, stars, the beauty of a supernova and the universe. Take these together and mix them with a scientist: Boom! An explosion! A Big Bang! The theory of almost everything we are eager to understand about the beginning of the times. This review will include a brief history of this book [PUN]!Not only did Stephen Hawking describe those concepts easily in this book, but he also made us have free access to his deep studies. He was born exactly 300 years after Galileo's death and became one of the most influential people in the area of Cosmology. Don't you feel a little bit scary to get his work to read? Don't you have the idea that it'll be tough and appalling? I'm here to demystify your wrong judgements towards this book!  First, is it paid off to read the analysis of a scientist who is not always right? Sure it is! For someone who admits having made a mistake in his first theory of black holes, Hawking deserves more than the knighthood offered by the Queen Elizabeth, which he declined by the way. The term black hole was coined in 1969 by the American scientist John Wheeler. I would rather grant you an excerpt from the book than trying to explain it to you: ""... a star that was sufficiently massive and compact would have such a strong gravitational field that light could not escape. Any light emitted from the surface of the star would be dragged back by the star's gravitational attraction before it could get very far. Although we would not be able to see them because the light from them would not reach us, we would still feel their gravitational attraction. Such objects are what we now call black holes, because that is what they are—black voids in space."" (Page 37)""To understand how a black hole might be formed, we first need an understanding of the life cycle of a star. A star is formed when a large amount of gas, mostly hydrogen, starts to collapse in on itself due to its gravitational attraction. As it contracts, the atoms of the gas collide with each other more and more frequently and at greater and greater speeds—the gas heats up. Eventually the gas will be so hot that when the hydrogen atoms collide they no longer bounce off each other but instead merge with each other to form helium atoms. The heat released in this reaction, which is like a controlled hydrogen bomb, is what makes the stars shine. This additional heat also increases the pressure of the gas until it is sufficient to balance the gravitational attraction, and the gas stops contracting. It is a bit like a balloon where there is a balance between the pressure of the air inside, which is trying to make the balloon expand, and the tension in the rubber, which is trying to make the balloon smaller."" (Pages 38-39). ""According to the theory of relativity, nothing can travel faster than light. Thus, if light cannot escape, neither can anything else. Everything is dragged back by the gravitational field. So one has a set of events, a region of space–time, from which it is not possible to escape to reach a distant observer. This region is what we now call a black hole."" (Page 44)Yes, black holes are not black and Stephen was humble enough to carry on studies to correct his thoughts and publicly announce his misunderstanding regarding his set of principles in print. Einstein had the guts to confirm that his cosmological constant was an incorrect belief, Stephen followed his steps and it may be one of the reasons we look up to them both. I do, wouldn't you? Having said that, many may think that Hawking does not believe in God, yet what we see here is that he discourses about the Big Bang Theory and gives God the credit for this event. Along the pages you also read how the Catholic Church admits in 1951 that the Big Bang is in accordance with the Bible. The Catholic Church misperceived Copernicus and Galileo regarding their theory of the Earth being the centre of the universe and it invited some experts to advise it on cosmology in the Vatican in 1981. It was when Hawking attended this conference that his interest in the origin of the universe was reawakened. The pope told the scientist that it was okay to study the evolution of the universe after the big bang, but they ""should not inquire into the big bang itself because that was the moment of creation and therefore the work of God"".From my point of view, Stephen's search for the theory of everything is his inner search to meet and understand a real God. His fascination with the universe leads his thoughts to the Hands of a creator that has put forward the laws that rule the cosmos. So as to justify my idea for that, just take a look at his last words on this book: ""if we do discover a complete theory... we would know the mind of God.""So, what's the ""Theory of Everything""? Well, this is only a simple review and I don't like spoilers! Do you really think I would give you ""everything""? [PUN]. Read the book, I strongly recommend it and I guarantee it'll be BRIEF ;)Larissa Fauber Click here to check Larissa Fauber's profile on Goodreads. Click here to read Larissa Fauber's reviews.

9,0641587716,http://goodreads.com/user/show/15403498-jerecho,4,"This book is about theories of everything, really? No, but nearly. It tell us about theories in the universe, important scientific discoveries, facts and future development. It's nice to read something like this. It adds something to the general knowledge we know about the world and the universe we live in."
10,0641587716,http://goodreads.com/user/show/18918586-arash,3,"Excellent start, very comprehensible and enjoyable to read. The first three chapters are marvelous. Towards the end, either it reaches my horizon limits in physics, or the author is too occupied to justify his own theories to care about the reader's understanding. I was lost in the end. All in all, a recommended reading. "
11,0641587716,http://goodreads.com/user/show/82007298-hazel,3,"60%~Insightful, but I didn't really enjoy the writing format and the writing itself. I am so into Astronomy and kind of Stephen Hawking books, but sorry, the writing of this book didn't make me inspired to learn from here. "
12,0641587716,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3633211-vikas,4,"This book is a collection of lectures by Prof. Hawking many years ago. I read it immediately after ""A Brief history of Time"" so the content was basically same in this one too as these were the lectures given by Prof. Hawking. But it again is very well presented so in all liked it too as the information provided is good though ubiquitous now. Hope to read more books by Prof. Hawking.People who don't read generally ask me my reasons for reading. Simply put I just love reading and so to that end I have made it my motto to just Keep on Reading. I love to read everything except for Self Help books but even those once in a while. I read almost all the genre but YA, Fantasy, Biographies are the most. My favorite series is, of course, Harry Potter but then there are many more books that I just adore. I have bookcases filled with books which are waiting to be read so can't stay and spend more time in this review, so remember I loved reading this and love reading more, you should also read what you love and then just Keep on Reading."
13,0641587716,http://goodreads.com/user/show/54353853-lakpa-tashi-bhutia,3,"Typically this book is for people who is inclined towards science(Physics in particular). But if want to read, you can go on your own. Most of the non-science people will not find this book pleasing. But author tries his best to make this book for everyone. By keeping mathematical equations away."

15,0641587716,http://goodreads.com/user/show/113217872-danyal-talpur,5,"*Book review by Danyal Talpur*  The book the ""theory of everything"" is written by Stephen Hawking. This book is mostly about Cosmology. This book is comprised of seven lectures, these lectures are on the creation and the fate of the universe, Black holes, direction of time, and the theory of everything. The writing style of Stephen Hawking is very simple and easy, he illustrates very complex ideas with daily life examples. In the first lecture, Stephen Hawking gives an outline of the history of the history of the universe, he gave a review of past ideas about the universe. He started his lecture from Aristotle's ideas and end it at our present belief about the universe.  In the second and the fifth Chapter, Stephen Hawking talked about expanding, origin, and the fate of the universe. In these chapters, he deals with questions like will the universe eventually stop expanding and start contracting? Will it expand forever? In these chapters, he also describes how time had begun at Big Bang? Stephen Hawking applies Quantum mechanics, the law of gravitation, and Einstein's relativity to prove that the universe must have a beginning and the universe could not be statistics. In the third and fourth lectures, Stephen Hawking talked about black holes. He described how black holes are formed? What is inside the black holes? Will people be able to come out of black holes? The author proves his ideas with physics laws.  In the sixth lecture, Stephen Hawking discusses the direction of time. He described that does time travel is possible? Can we predict the future? In the seventh and last chapter, Stephen Hawking described the ideas about the theory of everything. Actually, the theory of everything is not still given by anyone. There are some theories of science that are not unified with each other like Quantum mechanics and general relativity. However, one would hope to find a complete, consistent, unified theory that would include all these partial theories as approximations. The quest for such a theory is known as "" the unification of physics."" Einstein spends much of his latter time to unified all the theories but he refused to believe in Quantum mechanics. When all the theories will be unified, we shall really understand the universe and our position in it.  The theory of everything is one of the must-read books for science and cosmology lovers. Stephen Hawking illustrates highly complex ideas in a very easy way. I highly recommend every bookworm to read this book."

17,0641587716,http://goodreads.com/user/show/82596342-iman-shabani,5,"This definitely was a nice read. After reading it for a second time, I can say, all-in-all it's a good starter book for most people that are not much familiar with physics. After all Stephen Hawking was not only a scientist, but also a science communicator, maybe not as much as people like Carl Sagan, or Neil Tyson, but considering his disability, a pretty good one I'd say.Some of my friends think for one to understand such a book, you need to have some understanding in concepts like general relativity, or quantum physics. While that will definitely help you have an easier time reading such a book, but the way Stephen wrote this, helped me, as someone not versed in those concepts, understand most of the topics to some extent; and so I think it can help most of you as well.One other good thing about this book, is the fact that it's a quick read, and might motivate some people to give it a shot, whom will avoid it otherwise. This could even give you enough inertia to move to more-in-depth books on the subject.Bottom-line, I recommend this book for you. Have a good time reading it in case you decided to. :)"
18,0641587716,http://goodreads.com/user/show/65522073-trisha,4,"I’m spellbound post reading this one. A wonderful amalgamation of lectures written in layman’s language for the average Physics lover or anyone just as curious as me. Hawking tries to summarise all possible theories beginning from the General relativity through Quantum Mechanics and leaves us wanting for more. I’d have appreciated the book more had there been some pictorial depictions to simplify the lectures. Though, all in all, this book is an adventure in itself."
19,0641587716,http://goodreads.com/user/show/30673216-rashmi-basant,4,Read this buddy. You will find yourself into the another level. You will find the all these are men who are fighting for each other are just meaning less.

22,0641587716,http://goodreads.com/user/show/51920759-vinicius-carvalho,4,"By a lucky coincidence, I picked up to read/listen Stephen Hawing's last book, written and narrated by himself when still alive, a few days before the first picture taken of a black hole was disclosed by the Event Horizon Telescope Project, reinforcing the validity of Einstein's and Hawking's theories. This breakthrough event was even a bigger deal for me, as the subject was fresh on my mind.This is another great but short Hawking's book which helps a layman like me to understand a little better the edge of Physics theories and research.Although I'm not well versed and intelligent enough to comprehend all that is explained, it is so exciting to be able to think about the grandiosity of the universe compared to how tiny, and at the same time complex and hugely improbable are life on earth, human life and everything we developed up to now."
23,0641587716,http://goodreads.com/user/show/55881076-robert-cox,3,"Ok moral of the story is you really don't need to read like all of these Stephen Hawkings books. In fact just one (""A Briefer History of Time"" would be my recommendation) is sufficient. And if someone is so inclined to continue our unofficial, unlicensed and uncensored lesson in Physics I'd spread the love, check out Rovelli or Tyson. As a stand alone book ""The Theory of Everything"" is a good, broad strokes lesson of astrophysics with a little more time spent explaining prevailing theories of the past that have been disproved as well as contemporary theories put forth that will probably be disproved. "
24,0641587716,http://goodreads.com/user/show/108519141-miriam-neves,5,"After reading this book, my mind is among the stars. I truly believe that S. H. had the power to teach such difficult concepts to everyone and still share his passion about astrophysics.Is a book that talks a little bit about the big questions,""why are we here?"", ""what was big bang?"", ""is it a place to God?"".If you really want to find the answers to some of the most important questions, this book is right for you.I can say, that when I finished this book, I was very sad, because I just wanted to read more.

The first lecture is the outline of history of the universe from the big bang to black holes. He briefly describes the previous ideas about the universe. The second lecture he describes theories of gravity of Newton and Einstein that the universe is either expanding or contracting but not be static. A detailed explanation of the big bang in layman's language finds place in the lecture.The 3rd lecture the author talks about black holes. How a black hole is formed and some information on the singularity and quantum mechanics.The 4th lecture is about black holes are not black holes and elaborates on the quantum mechanics of energy leaking out of black holes. In the 5th lecture the author applies his quantum mechanical ideas to the big bang and the origin of the universe, and he proposes that the space-time is finite and its extent is without boundary. (Needs second time reading to understand).In the 6th lecture he questions why the laws of physics is time symmetric and why the past is so different from the future. I find it little bit difficult to grasp at first. If some one posts a video for this principle it will be much appreciated. In the 7th and final lecture is about the most famed Unified Theory. He closes that lecture with an optimistic view of science which I quote below.""However, if we do discover a complete theory, it should in time be understandable in broad principle by everyone, not just a few scientists.

28,0641587716,http://goodreads.com/user/show/999171-anita,3,"This book is 6 lectures by Stephen Hawking, read by him--his electronic voice. I could hold on and understand the 1st one, but by the end I was really struggling with imaginary time, string theory, and quantum mechanics. I did learn a lot, but I only have scratched the surface. I do know now that black holes are not black, the second law of thermodynamics, and can understand that the universe is finite with no boundaries. Hawking has a way of explaining some difficult concepts with analogies that I could sort of grasp. He has a great sense of humor and a gift for teaching. I wish I had a better gift for learning. I was very interested n the history of theories of the origin of the universe, including the singularity that began it (much more scientific term than ""big bang""). He poses interesting questions on God and how none of these theories preclude God. Not for everyone, but you will feel both smarter and dumber for reading it."
29,0641587716,http://goodreads.com/user/show/46913324-angela-joves,4,"THE THEORY OF EVERYTHING by Stephen Hawkings explains that scientists are trying to unify a single theory to explain our world. They empasize more on why? rather than how? (ex:how is the process of electromagnetism? , Why is the process the way it is? YES) In actuality, two fields are combined to explain this, and those are Quantum Physics and Astrophysics, because QP explains the tiny and the small, while Astrophysics focuses on the giant of our outer space. Stephen also wrote that all of Albert Einstein's theories that are in his work, have been proved except one. Ans since the moment I read that (2 weeks ago) until now (July, 28,2018) there have been news of Gravitational Waves being found!!! and Einstein's theory yet to prove is involved with this new discovery of GW. I don't know if it now has been proven, but I must research (I think it has, with the GW found). :)"
30,0641587716,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4596610-nicola,4,"Superb. It wasn't nearly as intimating as I'd feared as Hawkings renders his theory's down to simple language that even I can understand, although I think my many readings of A Short History Of Nearly Everything helped a great deal. I'll give it a week and then I'll read it again a little more slowly."
31,0641587716,http://goodreads.com/user/show/51235242-divya-dutt,5,The whole quest of Physics has been explained beautifully by Mr. Hawking. Why does the Universe exist anyway ? For then we would know the mind of GOD .
32,0641587716,http://goodreads.com/user/show/15388765-emanuel,4,"I came to this book with just very basic notions of relativity, so I can't say I completely grasped all of the concepts and theories that Hawking explains. What I did enjoy was his style of writing and the way he compiled and deconstructed the different theories, opting for less mathematical language and academic terminology and using mundane examples so that an average reader like me could still follow.The book is a great introduction to the topic and poses several insightful problems and questions that instigate the reader to go out and find more about it. Overall it made me way more interested in cosmology and physics. Also, if you're into cinema, try watching (or re-watching) Interstellar just after you finished the book. I promise you some stuff will make way more sense, and you'll feel like you're ""in the know"" with the astronauts or certain scenes. "
33,0641587716,http://goodreads.com/user/show/39701006-amrendra,5,"Brilliant book. It is a compilation of 7 lectures by Hawking. These include his ideas about the Universe, it's origins and it's expanding model, Black Holes, the direction of time and finally the quest for the Theory of Everything. These lectures infact are the source on which his famous book 'A Brief History of Time' is based. Anyone with an interest in the Universe or plain Physics must read this text as a beginner's material on which further reading can be built up. The style is easy, making complicated things simple to understand. How Quantum Physics is so important and how the Uncertainty Principle plays a big role are just some of the fabulous questions these lectures posit for the curious reader and the student of Physics alike."
34,0641587716,http://goodreads.com/user/show/9381082-sana,5,Stephen Hawking continues to be my hero. He is obviously a brilliant mind but he is also great at explaining his theories. he starts the book so simply- with how man came to understand the earth was round- the slowly complicates it til its peak in the theory of everything (the last chapter). I love that when he speaks of God he explain everything and the possibilities and what one might make of them and doesnt impose his ideas. he is a a man who seeks knowledge and truth lacing of everything with wit and sarcasm makes this book quite awesome actually. and as a muslim this actually renewed my faith.
35,0641587716,http://goodreads.com/user/show/32209505-nandha-kumar,4,"Now I am going to take up a side of people who are saying Earth is flat. that is easy right? to say God created the world and that is it. sun revolves around Earth and that is it. if you took Stephen's way, man that is complicated to the core. In this book Stephen Hawking went his infinity level to make us understand how are we here. The English and the explanation was so simple anyone can understand apart from some theories. But who knows these theories maybe wrong like the author himself said. we just have to wait to know about the universe if they found the secret before the end of our time or the universe's."
36,0641587716,http://goodreads.com/user/show/37650802-kara,4,"This short collection of lectures covers an incredibly wide range of complex topics. Hawking's explanations are relatively straightforward and not overly technical, though he doesn't recap background information. I wish I had refreshed my brain on basic physics principles (the four forces of the universe, general relativity, quantum mechanics, etc.) before sitting down to read this, as I think I would have absorbed a lot more had I done that. These theories, especially the ones in later chapters, are inherently very complex, and I found myself struggling to understand them at times — but I chalk that up to the fact that I am not a theoretical physicist, and not to any shortcomings of the book itself. I have a feeling this is probably a book that it's helpful to read multiple times over so you can really absorb the content, so I might return to it at some point."

Michael York was excellent narrator on audio book - brief look at how the universe began with research and theories given, not too deep or wordy, but balanced well for the lay science reader. Hawking offers knowledge of Milky Way and black hole evolution as well as challenges much thought on the universe expanding and how it will move through time after we’re gone from it. I especially appreciated the presence and time given to God and how His main part in its creation was included and not dismissed. "

But we can understand the universe, especially when the difficult mathematical concepts of origin and the plausible end of the universe are explained to us in 7 simplified and easy to comprehend lectures.These seven lectures are the history of history of the cosmos and our place in it, including the contributions of all the scientists of the world who tried to explain the universe, be it Chandrasekhar defining his Chandrasekhar limit or Einstein’s classical theory of relativity, from the big bang (expanding universe beginning with a singularity) to the black holes and cosmic censorship hypothesis ( God abhors singularity) and finally ending up with a quest of unification of physics to a complete,consistent and unified theory that would include all the partial theories (to combine general relativity with the uncertainty principle) as approximation to give you a proper grasp of a small proportion of scientific theories.The heavy laden mathematical concepts which we dread to even talk about is explained in such an uncomplicated yet cleverly amusing language, that I can proudly say that if I were to explain to you the concept of black hole, the arrows of time and string theory, I can do so in broad strokes to your understanding.

Will he turns into a spaghetti because of strong gravitational fields; what will happen if there were 2 dimensional people living in a 1 dimensional earth, so do they have to climb over each other in order to get past each other? Most importantly if you ever meet your antiself, don’t shake hands!The theory of everything does not give us an understanding of everything but it rather provides us an idea that there exists a unified theory to explain the existence of the universe and beyond, if we are smart and economically funded enough to seek answers.He gave the 3 possibilities that might help us in discovering the ultimate truth of life which we wonder about while gazing at the night sky thinking what is up there,how it came to be and where do we come from?"

56,0641587716,http://goodreads.com/user/show/9281381-kerri-f,3,"It therefore became natural to suppose that the fixed stars were objects like our sun but much farther away. This raised a problem. Newton realized that, according to his theory of gravity, the stars should attract each other; so, it seemed they could not remain essentially motionless. Would they not all fall together at some point? In a letter in 1691 to Richard Bentley, another leading thinker of his day, Newton argued that this would indeed happen if there were only a finite number of stars. But he reasoned that if, on the other hand, there were an infinite number of stars distributed more or less uniformly over infinite space, this would not happen because there would not be any central point for them to fall to. This argument is an instance of the pitfalls that one can encounter when one talks about infinity.In an infinite universe, every point can be regarded as the center because every point has an infinite number of stars on each side of it.We now know it is impossible to have an infinite static model of the universe in which gravity is always attractive.It is an interesting reflection on the general climate of thought before the twentieth century that no one had suggested that the universe was expanding or contracting. It was generally accepted that either the universe had existed forever in an unchanging state or that it had been created at a finite time in the past, more or less as we observe it today. In part, this may have been due to people’s tendency to believe in eternal truths as well as the comfort they found in the thought that even though they may grow old and die, the universe is unchanging.The only way of avoiding the conclusion that the whole of the night sky should be as bright as the surface of the sun would be if the stars had not been shining forever, but had turned on at some finite time in the past. In that case, the absorbing matter might not have heated up yet, or the light from distant stars might not yet have reached us. And that brings us to the question of what could have caused the stars to have turned on in the first place. THE BEGINNING OF THE UNIVERSEAristotle and most of the other Greek philosophers, on the otherhand, did not like the idea of a creation because it made too much of divineintervention. They believed, therefore, that the human race and the worldaround it had existed, and would exist, forever. They had already consideredthe argument about progress, described earlier, and answered it by saying thatthere had been periodic floods or other disasters that repeatedly set the humanrace right back to the beginning of civilization.When most people believed in an essentially static and unchanging universe,the question of whether or not it had a beginning was really one of meta-physics or theology. One could account for what was observed either way.Either the universe had existed forever, or it was set in motion at some finitetime in such a manner as to look as though it had existed forever. But in 1929,Edwin Hubble made the landmark observation that wherever you look, distantstars are moving rapidly away from us. In other words, the universe is expand-ing. This means that at earlier times objects would have been closer together.In fact, it seemed that there was a time about ten or twenty thousand millionyears ago when they were all at exactly the same place.Different stars have different spectra, but the relativebrightness of the different colors is always exactly what one would expect tofind in the light emitted by an object that is glowing red hot. This means thatwe can tell a star's temperature from the spectrum of its light. Moreover, wefind that certain very specific colors are missing from stars’ spectra, and thesemissing colors may vary from star to star. We know that each chemical element absorbs the characteristic set of very specific colors. Thus, by matching each ofthose which are missing from a star’s spectrum, we can determine exactlywhich elements are present in the star’s atmosphere.Friedmann made two very simple assumptions about the universe:that the universe looks identical in whichever direction we look, and thatthis would also be true if we were observing the universe from anywhere else.In 1965, two American physicists, ArnoPenzias and Robert Wilson, were working at the Bell Labs in New Jersey onthe design of a very sensitive microwave detector for communicating withorbiting satellites. They were worried when they found that their detector was picking up more noise than it ought to, and that the noise did not appear tobe coming from any particular direction. First they looked for bird droppingson their detector and checked for other possible malfunctions, but soon ruledthese out. They knew that any noise from within the atmosphere would bestronger when the detector is not pointing straight up than when it is, becausethe atmosphere appears thicker when looking at an angle to the vertical.The extra noise was the same whichever direction the detector pointed, so itmust have come from outside the atmosphere. It was also the same day andnight throughout the year, even though the Earth was rotating on its axis andorbiting around the sun. This showed that the radiation must come frombeyond the solar system, and even from beyond the galaxy, as otherwise itwould vary as the Earth pointed the detector in different directions.In fact, we know that the radiation must have traveled to us across most ofthe observable universe. Since it appears to be the same in different directions, the universe must also be the same in every direction, at least on a largescale. We now know that whichever direction we look in, this noise nevervaries by more than one part in ten thousand. So Penzias and Wilson hadunwittingly stumbled across a remarkably accurate confirmation ofFriedmann’s first assumption.Dicke and Peebles argued that weshould still be able to see this glowing, because light from very distant partsof the early universe would only just be reaching us now. However, theexpansion of the universe meant that this light should be so greatly red-shift-ed that it would appear to us now as microwave radiation. Dicke and Peebleswere looking for this radiation when Penzias and Wilson heard about theirwork and realized that they had already found it. All this evidence that the universe looks the same whichev-er direction we look in might seem to suggest there is something special aboutour place in the universe. In particular, it might seem that if we observe allother galaxies to be moving away from us, then we must be at the center of theuniverse.In Friedmann’s model, all the galaxies are moving directly awayfrom each other. The situation is rather like steadily blowing up a balloonwhich has a number of spots painted on it. As the balloon expands, the dis-tance between any two spots increases, but there is no spot that can be said tobe the center of the expansion. Moreover, the farther apart the spots are, thefaster they will be moving apart.The fourth dimension—time—is also finite in extent, but it is like aline with two ends or boundaries, a beginning and an end. We shall see laterthat when one combines general relativity with the uncertainty principle ofquantum mechanics, it is possible for both space and time to be finite withoutany edges or boundaries.The present evidence, therefore, suggests that the universe will probably expand forever. But don’t bank on it. All we can really be sure of is that evenif the universe is going to recollapse, it won’t do so for at least another ten thousand million years, since it has already been expanding for at least that long. This should not unduly worry us since by that time, unless we havecolonies beyond the solar system, mankind will long since have died out, extinguished along with the death of our sun.All our theories of science are formulated on the assumption that space–time is smooth and nearly flat, so they would all break down at the big bang singu-larity, where the curvature of space–time is infinite. This means that even ifthere were events before the big bang, one could not use them to determinewhat would happen afterward, because predictability would break down at thebig bang. Correspondingly, if we know only what has happened since the big bang, we could not determine what happened beforehand. As far as we areconcerned, events before the big bang can have no consequences, so theyshould not form part of a scientific model of the universe. We should thereforecut them out of the model and say that time had a beginning at the big bang.British physicist, Roger Penrose, in 1965. He used the way light conesbehave in general relativity, and the fact that gravity is always attractive, toshow that a star that collapses under its own gravity is trapped in a region whoseboundary eventually shrinks to zero size. This means that all the matter in thestar will be compressed into a region of zero volume, so the density of matterand the curvature of space-time become infinite. In other words, one has a sin-gularity contained within a region of space-time known as a black hole.Under the theory that light was made up of waves, it was not clear how it would respond to gravity. But if light were composed of parti-cles, one might expect them to be affected by gravity in the same way that cannonballs, rockets, and planets are.In it, he point-ed out that a star that was sufficiently massive and compact would have sucha strong gravitational field that light could not escape. Any light emittedfrom the surface of the star would be dragged back by the star's gravitationalattraction before it could get very far.In fact, it is not really consistent to treat light like cannon-balls in Newton's theory of gravity because the speed of light is fixed. A can-nonball fired upward from the Earth will be slowed down by gravity and willeventually stop and fall back. A photon, however, must continue upward at aconstant speed.In quantum theory, particles can be created out of energy in the form of particle/antiparticle pairs.In his book, The Go Between, L. P. Hartley wrote, “The past is a foreign country. They do things differently there–but why is the past so different from the future? Why do we remember the past, but not the future?” In otherwords, why does time go forward? Is this connected with the fact that the uni- verse is expanding?"

In physicist Stephen Hawking's brilliant opus, A Brief History of Time, he presented us with a bold new look at our universe, how it began, and how our old views of physics and tired theories about the creation of the universe were no longer relevant. In other words, Hawking gave us a new look at our world, our universe, and ourselves. Now, available for the first time in trade paperback, Hawking presents an even more comprehensive look at our universe, its creation, and how we see ourselves within it. Imagine sitting in a comfortable room listening to Hawking discuss his latest theories and place them in historical context with science's other great achievements--it would be like hearing Christopher Columbus deliver the news about the new world. Hawking presents a series of seven lectures in which he describes, more clearly than ever, the history of the universe as we know it. He begins with the history of ideas about the universe, from Aristotle's idea that the Earth is round to Hubble's discovery two millennium later that our universe is growing. Using this history as a launching pad, Hawking takes us on a fascinating journey through the telescopic lens of modern physics to gain a new glimpse of the universe--the nature of black holes, the space-time continuum, and new information about the origin of the universe. He uses this scientific basis to come up with a ""unified theory of everything"" that the author claims will be ""the ultimate triumph of human reason.""
   Amazon.com Review 
  With a title inspired as much by Douglas Adams' Hitchhiker series as Einstein, The Theory of Everything delivers almost as much as it promises. Transcribed from Stephen Hawking's Cambridge Lectures, the slim volume may not present a single theory unifying gravity with the other fundamental forces, but it does carefully explain the state of late 20th-century physics with the great scientist's characteristic humility and charm. Explicitly shunning math, Hawking explains the fruits of 100 years of heavy thinking with metaphors that are simple but never condescending--he compares the settling of the newborn universe into symmetry to the formation of ice crystals in a glass of water, for example. While he explores his own work (especially when speaking about black holes), he also discusses the important milestones achieved by others like Richard Feynman. Though occasionally an impenetrably obscure phrase does slip by, the reader will find the bulk of the text enlightening and engaging. The material, from the nature of time to the possibility that the universe has no beginning or end, is rich and deep and inevitably ignites metaphysical thinking. After all, Hawking is famous for his ""we would know the mind of God"" remark, which ends the final lecture herein. --Rob Lightner
