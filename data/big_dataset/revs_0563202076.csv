0,0563202076,http://goodreads.com/user/show/37107782-pramod-nair,5,"Written by ‘David Attenborough’, ‘The Living Planet: A Portrait of the Earth’, is the companion volume to his incredibly successful BBC nature documentary series from 1984, which portrays the diverse history of life on our planet in staggering detail. This documentary series and the book is a follow up to his own much acclaimed series ‘Life on Earth’ from 1979 - which investigated the story of evolution - and carries on with his in-depth study in to the intricate and amazing ways in which animal life – and often human beings - adapts to their surroundings. This is a great way to get acquainted with the various habitats and the life that surround them on our planet. The main focus of the book is to closely inspect the changes that are happening on our planet on a constant basis - the physical changes like mountains getting worn down by rivers and glaciers, rivers altering their courses, Lakes getting filled up with sediments converting them to marsh lands and even plain lands, continental drifts etc – and study how the animal and plant life respond to these changes. 
“The story of the building of the Himalayas and their subsequent colonization by animals and plants is only one example of the many changes that are proceeding continuously all over our planet… Each of these physical changes demands a response from the community of plants and animals undergoing it. Some organisms will adapt and survive. Others will fail to do so and disappear.Similar environments will call for similar adaptations and produce animals in different parts of the world which comes from quiet different ancestors, but which bear a marked resemblance to one another. So almost every corner of the planet has acquired its population of interdependent plants and animals. It is the nature of these adaptations, that have enabled living organisms to spread so widely through our varied planet, that is the theme of this book.”Attenborough doesn’t limit this search to any specific geographical spot on our planet; instead he inspects a wide variety of environments across the globe and explains to us the ways in which the living forms adapt to these physical changes with microscopic detail. The book is segmented into chapters based on the varied environments that Attenborough inspects for these evidences of adaptation.In the chapter titled ‘The furnaces of the Earth’ we see a world that is in constant upheaval and undergoing physical changes due to volcanic activities and instances of life sustaining in such ‘fountains of hell’. Hydrothermal vent tubewormsAttenborough takes the reader to the Galapagos Islands and introduces the curious ecosystem that is thriving in a sea floor that is boiling with the hot chemical jets formed by the underwater volcanoes that form a ridge south of these Islands. In these seemingly non-hospitable conditions great concentrations of bacteria’s, immense tubeworms, huge clams and strange ‘blind white crabs’ form colonies of life. In another curious case of living forms utilizing the physical changes in their habitat, we meet the Maleo birds in the Indonesian island of Sulawesi, which utilize the black volcanic sands – which remain heated both through volcanic steam and sunshine - at the beaches as artificial incubators for hatching their eggs. The maleo [Source]The reader will get familiarized with a number of such instances where life thrives in volcanic or extreme hot conditions in this chapter.In the chapter titled ‘The seas of grass’, the reader gets a ringside seat to life forms, which live, in harmony with the vast open habitats provided by open plains covered with grass. In these unique habitats, which are formed by the tangled roots, matted stems and clumps of growing leaves we meet a variety of small inhabitants like termites, ants, worms, grass hopers etc and a variety of other bigger animals which thrive either on the grass and roots or on these small inhabitants. Leafcutter ant While ‘leaf-cutter ants’ - the largest and most complex animal societies on Earth, next to humans - make use of the grass and leaves for their survival, other animals like anteaters, thrive on these ants and insects. Then there are life forms, which burrow into these grasslands like ‘burrowing owls’. A family of burrowing owls. [Source]In the rich grasslands of North American Prairies we meet the magnificent Bison and the amazing story of them making a strong come back after getting almost extinct. Bison herd grazing at the National Bison Range in MontanaIn the savannahs of Africa, Attenborough introduces us to some great instances of large herds of animals migrating from one location to another based on seasonal changes. One of the examples that he refer is the case of a million strength herd of wildebeests that migrate across the Serengeti.Wildebeest in Masai Mara during the Great Migration. [Source]The book composes of ten more chapters like these two, which we sampled, and the clarity and great detail with which they are drafted makes this a worthy volume to pursue.Attenborough with his comprehensive knowledge, keen observation, eagerness and unlimited curiosity is a huge success even while presenting complex topics and he avoids technical scientific terms whenever possible and try to make what he is narrating crystal clear for his audience. This is definitely one of the best natural history titles I have come across and is an excellent introductory volume, which will get the reader familiar with a lot of details. If you are a nature enthusiast, then this well researched, clean and crisp narrative with its selection of superb photographs will captivate you as a reader. "
1,0563202076,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5876945-ryan,4,"David Attenborough is as accomplished a writer as he is a TV presenter, having always written books to accompany the documentary series that he creates and presents. The Living Planet followed on the back of the series most responsible for his fame - Life on Earth. It surveys the Earth ecologically, describing the major biomes and explaining how their respective plants and animals are adapted to the specific habitats. The author is truly one of the great naturalists of 20th century, having a broad yet comprehensive knowledge of nature in a time where biologists are increasingly specialized in narrow fields. As we head further into the Anthropocene, such a holistic view is necessary to address the global problems of human ecology. Today's high definition BBC series such as Planet Earth and Life may look better and slicker, but I would say these two landmark series produced in the 70s/80s had already set the high mark for nature documentaries, arguably with a lot more substance than today's productions."
2,0563202076,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2658964-sher,4,I learned so much about the earth from this book. I recommend it to everyone.
3,0563202076,http://goodreads.com/user/show/12805820-suzy,5,"Wonderful book, been looking at this book with my 9 year old son. He found it very fascinating."
4,0563202076,http://goodreads.com/user/show/62648627-nick,5,"Really good general history of the geology, geography, biology and botany of the planet we live on. It accompanies the BBC television series, made in the early 1980's."
5,0563202076,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4308405-sweepea888,5,"I was so impressed with how straightforward this book was written. The chapters are broken down nicely: The Furnace of the Earth, The Sky Above, The Baking Deserts, etc. The overall takeaway here is this: despite the illusion of things remaining much the same the earth is always, absolutely always changing. And the flora and fauna is always adapting as well. Some examples I already knew as I'm interested in this stuff and have read about it before. Yet I learned so much new material reading this. A few favorite tidbits I picked up include: tricks some birds use to protect their young. The woodpecker drills little holes above and below their nests within trees. It does this to let sap seep down the trunks and thus deter snakes from entering the nest. Wily little suckers! They also post guards outside the holes too as other animals who cannot bore holes in wood (like squirrels or owls) are only all too eager to steal a great pre made home!The Galapagos islands remain a wonderland for studying animals and how they adapt to their habitats. I was especially fascinated by the famous finches of the Galapagos; the islands have a vast ecosystem and thus finches adapted to fit into each and every one. The finches are all have great variations in beaks in particularto best harvest food/resources. This sort of thing takes time to evolve but the book described this in detail. I have always loved nature and marveled at its beauty. But after reading this you truly know that everything has it's place. Not one genetic adaptation or crature is extraneous; even the (seeming) pests. Unfortunately the encroachment of mankind has thinned the numbers of many species or exterminated them altogether (like the dodo, passenger pigeon, etc). New Zealand remained largely pristine and ripe with natural resources until a little over a thousand years ago. The Maori first settled there and brought some of their own animals. This started the decline of certain species. The Maori brought a Ploynesian rat (kiori) that ate much of the eggs of the animals on the island. Maori also hunted the large flightless birds, the moa as well , diminishing their number. Moa were flightless because they had no natural predators before the settlers. The europeans showed up things later on and made it worse by brining another species of rat. Europeans also brought deer, cats and ducks with them in order to 'feel at home'. Of course those idiots didn't consider that this would totally mess up the eco system. Perhaps I'm being harsh here; we know much more about that thing now after years of scientific study. I was amazed to learn that the Sahara was once fertile thousands of years ago. Rock paintings from the Tassili (herders once lived there) show a very different place than it is now. The desert might seem to be a wasteland with little signs of life but nothing could be further from the truth. Even after a brief rain fall certains organisims spring to life. Many creatures are hidden until such a rainfall. Others are hidden until the night and they can forage for food without the oppresive heat. Every plant and animal is specifically designed to adapt to extremes in weather and predators. Most every animal and plant also have a trick to thwart natural predators. The book lists many from the absurd to the mind boggling. Did you know trees even have such defenses? If under attack by an unusually large amount of insects the tree makes tannin to make the leaves taste bitter? This doesn't kill the vermin directly. Instead the insects scutter to another part of the tree to find better tasting leaves. In the process they are picked off and eaten by animals or birds looking for a good meal. Fascinating. This process is only done when needed; the tree uses much energy to create tannin and to do so all the time would inhibit growth and be a terrible use of resources. So the lesson we can learn from nature (well there are many I think) : Use your energy/resources wisely:) Trees can even alert neighboring trees of an impending attack from insects and those tress will hastily manufacture tannin in anticipation of being eaten. That's pretty incredible. There is so much more but I recommend this book. A bonus is that now I have a lot of information to share with my kids and it inspires a lot of interest in biology and nature. This is definitely something I want to foster. Fantastic book and I am glad I own this one too. I'll refer to it again no doubt."
6,0563202076,http://goodreads.com/user/show/45758588-peter,3,"A disclaimer, I have never seen the 1984 film series, The Living Planet, which was presented by the zoologist David Attenborough and in which Attenborough's book, The Living Planet is a companion book too. The book, The Living Planet, is also over thirty years old. That being said since the book is basically an introduction to ecology, which the broad outline of has not changed that much since 1984. I thought that Attenborough's introduction to the book, The Living Planet, which is set in the Kali Gandaki Valley in Nepal was effective. The Kali Gandaki Valley seem to include most of the ecosystems that are mention in the book. Ecology also involves human-nature interaction, which the Kali Gandaki Valley also illustrates. Humans in the Kali Gandaki Valley also adapted to the environment along with the living organisms of that environment. The first chapter of the book is called “the Furnaces of the Earth.” This chapter covers how the lava from volcanoes builds land. Attenborough uses Iceland and other places to illustrate how volcanoes build land. Attenborough's book is a good introduction to different ecosystems from “The Frozen World” to “The Open Ocean.” Attenborough writes in his book, The Living Planet, “living organisms are extraordinarily adaptable. Species, far from being fixed and immutable, evolve with a speed that is well able to match most geological and climatic change.”"

While some things certainly dated this book - like the Sears Tower being the tallest building in the world at the time - I was surprised at how much I actually learned from the text - details that had either become too mundane or just not fascinating enough for the viewers and readers of later Attenborough/Life on this Planet type series, so fell to the wayside before I first became a viewer."
8,0563202076,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5877880-jamie-barringer-ravenmount,5,"Science has advanced since this book was written, but it still provides a lot of great information. Many of the creatures and science facts do show up in the films Attenborough appeared in, but this is not just a transcript of the films. It's well written, with some good photos, and not too jargon-laden for most readers to understand the text."
9,0563202076,http://goodreads.com/user/show/329996-david-ward,3,"The Living Planet: A Portrait of the Earth by David Attenborough (Little, Brown and Company 1984) (575). This book was made to accompany the beautiful PBS television series of the same name. It's sort of a “history of the natural world” for non-scientists. My rating: 7/10, finished 10/25/14. "
10,0563202076,http://goodreads.com/user/show/33964258-gabriel-iqbal,5,The book and the film are my favourite companions. I grew up with David's documentaries and so are my kids... We just love the man and the soulful relationship that he sparks vis-a-vis our existence on a Living Planet.
11,0563202076,http://goodreads.com/user/show/63367511-lenny,5,"Typically informative, straight-spoken David Attenborough."
12,0563202076,http://goodreads.com/user/show/34815680-carolyn,5,One of my first Sir David books. Excellent!

14,0563202076,http://goodreads.com/user/show/906085-ian,3,No one communicates enthusiastic fascination in the natural world like Attenbourough. Still own it after all these years
15,0563202076,http://goodreads.com/user/show/57521234-vinayak-hegde,5,"A beautiful book with 12 different chapters covering different parts of the earth's ecosystem. This is written by Sir David Attenborough and is rich with details of different ecosystems and forces that shape the land and oceans on earth. This is a companion to the television series ""Life on Earth"".There are several fascinating stories of different flora and fauna. I loved the life of Emperor penguins, the rise and fall of interconnected ecosystems due to geological phenomenon or man-made changes, the stories of how trees protect themselves and harness / reward different animals to co-evolve with them. The last chapter on how Man himself has evolved first shaping and adapting to forces of nature and then eventually shaping the ecology of the earth was the best note to end it on. The last lines of the book show this brilliantly - ""As far as we can tell, our planet is the only place in the black immensities of the universe where life exists. We are alone in space. And the continued existence of life now rests in our hands.""This has shades of the pale blue dot speech by Carl Sagan which is famous. Last but not the least the extensive full-page photographs of different flora/fauna and natural phenomena give a different dimension to the book. Definitely, a must-read to anyone interested in nature. "
16,0563202076,http://goodreads.com/user/show/113600886-bernardo-fajardo,5,"As seen on TV!I've always been a fanatic of documentaries, David Attenborough, Steve Irwin, Jane Goodall and Carl Sagan are just some of the names of the people I used to watch during my childhood and that made me choose my career as a scientist that I've been following and hopw to continue.I don't remember how many documentaries I've watched hosted by David Attenborough, but while reading this book I had the same feeling, I almost could hear his voice (or at least the voice of the actor that doubled his voice for Latin America) and every single page was magnificently written, not to talk about the photos included. It doesn't matter that the book is from the '80s, reading it it's an incredible experience and as the book says, it's not just an adaptation of the documentary series, but an extra material to complement it. Thanks to this website I discovered it's part of a trilogy, I don't know if my father has the other two; if not, I'm definitely searching them!As the documentaries, David Attenborough invites us to know more about our planet, the wonders there are around the globe and may give some facts that were new for me and that amazed me. Sadly, he also shows how the human has altered the world, and how, even after that many decades, we haven't learned the damage we cause even though we could change into a sustainable society."
17,0563202076,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5949552-andrew-ives,5,"Last year, I read Life On Earth (1979) which is quite brilliant. The Living Planet (1984) is, as one might expect, more of the same. The format is identical and Sir Dave's style of writing is just as enjoyable to read, with his occasional unusual word and poetic turn of phrase, all impeccably proofread. The photos while good, are not fantastic, nor glossy, and I wish I had known there was a map at the back before I finished. I found some of the chapters, such as that about trees, surprisingly interesting and educational, whereas others about deep sea creatures and mangrove swamps were a little lacklustre. I think I learned more from Life On Earth where I was actually astounded by some of the revelations, whereas that didn't happen so much with The Living Planet. That said, this is still a very worthwhile book indeed. 4.5/5 "
18,0563202076,http://goodreads.com/user/show/80346806-gareth,5,"Great, informative read. Something about David's style is very easy to read, but even though each topic is covered ultimately quite briefly, it passes a lot of information across. Most of the information is still quite relevant / accurate today, and the warnings unfortunately still hold true. The photos that accompany the text are always interesting, and some quite stunning, just a shame that can't fit photos of all entities named in the text in the volume. "
19,0563202076,http://goodreads.com/user/show/33773190-lady-lavin,5,It really is brilliant
20,0563202076,http://goodreads.com/user/show/104166703-zack-m,4,Attenborough's politics are a bit wack - malthusianism etc - but the pictures in this book are great as is the nature stuff.
21,0563202076,http://goodreads.com/user/show/23975701-lizzy,3,Bit outdated in places (like the black death wasn't carried by rats) but on the whole a nice rounded read. especially liked the deep sea section
22,0563202076,http://goodreads.com/user/show/111166501-rubyred4398,5,very informative 
23,0563202076,http://goodreads.com/user/show/119303030-book-collector,5,"The book of the tv series. Brilliant. There's not much to say and I'm going to put this review on most of the other books in the series. Why? Well because the books follow a simple pattern. They are all fascinating to read, filled with gorgeous photos and brilliantly written by one of the most fascinating and influential people of our lives. The wonderful David attenborough. With the reprint of life on earth I'm so hoping they reprint more of his books as I'd love to have new copies of these well thumbed natural history volumes."
24,0563202076,http://goodreads.com/user/show/40179779-maneet,4,Amazing non-fiction book full of travel writing.'The Living Planet' is based on a series of programmes made for BBC Television. This is a sequel of 'Life on Earth'.Written in 2nd person about the portrait of the Earth.Describing all parts of the world from the frozen to the warm. Experiences are expressed using a range of metaphorical vocabulary.This book interests me through its meaningful use of words which create clear and beautiful visual imagery.I think the book needed to be more spacial with its context with less or smaller pictures. I did not like how the pages were full of words and hard to read through its compacted font.Yet still an exciting book full of adventures waiting to be encountered once again.These fascinating events give me a personal practical knowledge of our surroundings.I recommend this book to those who are keen to discover and learn about extraordinary locations and life then this is a book you would like.
25,0563202076,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6854780-kend,3,"Dated, but fun to revisit every now and then, especially in a world post PLANET EARTH and all its worthy fellow documentary series."
