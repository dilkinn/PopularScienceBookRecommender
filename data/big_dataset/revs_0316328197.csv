Be warned, there are very few kittens in this book, and the two that are present are being constantly mortally threatened by physics.I’ve recently been on a “science books for lay persons” kick. I started with “The Elegant Universe” and then moved on to (the somewhat less rigorous) “A Short History of Nearly Everything” by Bill Bryson. Now, with “Schrodinger’s Kittens,” I feel like maybe I’m started to get a grasp on some of these physics theories. When reading a book about physics don’t try too hard to understand everything. I just pour the words over my brain and see if anything sticks. I leave feeling slightly more enlightened than I started, which is enough of an accomplishment for anyone who is not a physicist by training."

Okay, so it started off talking about light, and the study of it, and the history of the study of it, and I didn't quite get where Gribbin was going with all this, but y'know, it had hope. And then I kept reading.Oh, god, it was dry. Really slow, really dry, and in the end, I don't think even Gribbin knew what he was talking about. It could have been good. I would have even been happy if he just kept talking about light. But there's talking in circles to explain something, and then there's talking in circles, and Gribbin did a lot of the latter. It reminded me a lot of really boring oral presentations back at school. Somebody would start off with lots of fun and everybody would be sitting there thinking, 'yeah, this is good!' but five minutes in and it's nothing. The promise of fun was not lived up to. And then the presenter would give a weird remark at the end, as though remembering that hey, this is meant to be engaging, but it was too late.It was too late, Gribbin."
2,0316328197,http://goodreads.com/user/show/23888196-rama,5,"An excellent review of quantum physics and realityThis is one of the best books I have read that reviews both classical and quantum physics to explain the nature of physical reality. Although somewhat outdated, it describes all major schools of thoughts (interpretations) of quantum reality in layman's terms with comparisons and numerous references to the work of other authors. Although this is written for a general reader; it requires some knowledge of undergraduate level physics. The physics of reality revealed by the quantum physics centers on two facts; wave - particle duality of matter, and the results of Thomas Young's double slit experiments. Several schools of thought originated to interpret reality based on this observation; most notable is the Copenhagen interpretation. According to this interpretation, the particle wave spreads throughout the universe, and it could appear anywhere in the universe until it is observed. The very act of observing the wave make wave functions to collapse as a particle at the point of observation (detection), and it will be observed at that location with certainty. But as soon as we stop looking at the wave, then probability wave leaks from that location and spreads to the universe, hence we are unable to predict the path of the wave from one point of detection to the next moment in time. The particles know more about the world than just the immediate locality, which is strange in terms of human perception of day-to-day reality dictated by classical laws of physics. The main contention is the human observer determines if the particle behaves like wave or particle and it is impossible to determine the physical state (wave or particle) prior to the measurements. In essence, matter at the most fundamental level is unreal until it is observed by a human being. The Copenhagen school of thought offers a holistic view of quantum world. Another feature of the quantum world is that wave and particle states are complimentary properties; that is both states can not exist at the same time but matter could be either in one or the other state. This is due to the Heisenberg's uncertainty principle which states that the momentum of a quantum object and its position can not be measured at the same time. This is not measurement problem but due to quantum uncertainty because the position refers to the particle nature as it will have a definite existence, but the momentum is a measure of wave nature of the object moving in a certain direction at a definite speed. Thus complementarities results directly from this principle. John Gribbin explores the absurdity of Copenhagen interpretation to explain the outcome of a thought (Schrodinger's kittens) experiment to explain quantum entanglement, and whether a human observer is essential to crystallize quantum reality. Bell's inequality and Aspect's experiment show that entangled quantum entities behave as one system no matter which interpretation is used. The instantaneous nature of feedback in the entanglement of quantum particles is explained by Wheeler - Feynman model of electromagnetic radiation, which has two sets of solutions to Maxwell's equations. One set of solutions, the common sense solution describes waves moving outward from an accelerated charged particle and forward in time. The second set of waves describes waves travelling backwards in time and converging on to the charged particle. When proper allowance is made for both sets of waves interacting with all charged particles in the universe most of the complexity cancels out leaving only the familiar common sense (retarded) waves to carry electromagnetic influences from one particle to another. As a result of these interactions each individual charged particle is instantaneously aware of its position in relation to all other charged particles in the universe. The waves must also move backwards in time (advanced waves) so that they provide feedback at the source of wave production so that every particle in the universe is an integral part of the whole electromagnetic web. Wheeler - Feynman theory provides for particle here and now to know about the past and future states of the universe. John Cramer extended these equations to Schrodinger's wave equations. John Cramer's transactional interpretation states this; when an electron vibrates it attempts to radiate by producing a field which is a time-symmetric mixture of retarded wave propagating into the future, and advanced wave going into the past atemporally. In Cramer's words the emitter can be considered to produce an offer wave travelling to the absorber, this in turn returns a confirmation wave backwards to the emitter and the transaction is compete with a handshake. In reality this sequence of events is atemporal it all happens at once. In this, there is no need to assign a special status to the observer. The dramatic success in resolving the puzzles of quantum physics is at the expense of accepting just one idea that the quantum wave can travel backwards through time. On the positive note that it doesn't violate cause-effect reality because cause can not exist if there is no effect in the transactional interpretation. In addition, the freedom of will prevails in physical reality without being bogged down technicality of quantum laws. "
3,0316328197,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7702916-cheyenne-blue,3,"For all that I adore science fiction, I'm not a natural scientist. Physics ties my brain in knots and anything much past Boyle's Law is an incomprehensible morass. You can explain until you're puce how airplanes stay up, but I just don't get it.However, I WANT to get it. Specifically, I want to ""get"" the exciting parts of science, like time travel and ""Beam me up, Scotty"". I want to know how the universe was formed and what dark matter is. And I especially want to know how Schrodinger's cat is both dead and alive.I started this book for the first time one year and two months ago, when I found it on a shelf in a housesit. I think I made it to about page 50. One year later, repeat housesit later, and the book is still on the shelf.It took me a while, but I finished it.It was difficult, but I finished it.I had to read some parts twice, but I finished it. Do I understand the quantum mysteries? Um... Not really. But I do understand more than I did, and I'm happy with that. And, for the most part, I enjoyed the journey. "
4,0316328197,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4738528-chris-simmons,3,"Hefty material - if you're not comfortable with in-depth discussion of advanced physics topics, you won't like it. I liked it, but I found that the enthusiasm I had in the first half of the book didn't carry through to the end. This is more likely due to my lack of stamina in digesting books with advanced topics outside of my normal areas of expertise."
5,0316328197,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4527541-glenn,4,"Gribbin is a better than average science writer, with a Ph.D. in astrophysics. This book covers the remarkable quantum physics experiments and more since the publication of ""In Search of Schrodingers Cat"". It's a good read, but too many pages are devoted to going over the many variations of double-slit experiments, and I found a number of places where the explanations lack a crucial phrase or perhaps a better diagram.Even though the book was published in 1996, the major experiments in the field had already been done: quantum entanglement with apparently instantaneous transmission and quantum teleportation. The big message of quantum mechanics is that there are phenomena that are ""non-local"" (i.e., what happens at one point is in some sense instantaneously connected to other points in the universe). I appreciate that Gribbin emphasizes that although these peculiar phenomena have now been extensively observed, most physicists still would have to say that they don't fully understand HOW it works.Gribbin steps out on a limb by presenting the ""transactional interpretation"" of Prof. John Cramer as the solution to ""non-locality"". That he springs this on the reader at the end of the book doesn't seem fair - it's what you expect in a novel, not in a science book. I wonder if he wrote the book without knowing how it was going to end?Despite some misgivings, you can learn a lot about the great quantum mechanics debates and mysteries from this book, and I like Gribbin's style. Also, unlike many other layman science books, this one does not contain a great deal of the biographies of the scientists involved - you may be relieved or you may miss these omissions.Note: this is my second time reading it. Gribbin suggests that knowledgeable readers may wish to skip directly to the end and I did that the first time! The second time I discovered that there was not much new to me in the center, but the presentation is good."
6,0316328197,http://goodreads.com/user/show/42361-john,5,"Pretty good lay explanation of quantum mechanics, although some general science education would be helpful in understanding it.What I liked most was the author's observation that when we speak of science, we are not really speaking about absolute truths- rather, we are defining a model that can accurately explain and predict the universe. The author shows how more than one model can be used, and how the very human aspects of the scientists lead to ""trends"" in the development of scientific theories."
7,0316328197,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5934952-david-williamson,4,"Schrödinger’s Kittens takes you through a tour de force of Quantum theory, specifically theory, as in not actual, but analogy. Gribbin uses models to explain reality, or at least Quantum reality. Using whichever model works best intuitively to describe what could be going on. I mean the guy references Kuhn and Heidegger, and then goes onto refer to Kreiger, a physicist by trade, who goes even further stating there is no such thing as a correct model, period. I mean this is the kind of science I can dig."
8,0316328197,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2426947-josh-barkey,2,"I'm rating this book a two, but just because I couldn't really understand it, so the whole time I read it my brain hurt. I rate these things largely on the basis of my subjective experience anyways, rather than by some objective criterion. It was cool, though, and exposed me to some nifty ideas about the universe. "
9,0316328197,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3415949-costacoralito,4,"I almost did not read this book as Gribbin's previous book, In search of Schroedinger's Cat, was a little difficult to get through. I'm very glad I went ahead and read it as it was eye-opening in several respects with clear and concise thinking and writing about the possibilities of going faster than light and backwards in time. I enjoyed it."
10,0316328197,http://goodreads.com/user/show/23926449-liz-hundy,4,The only thing I have against this book is the number of times the Nobel prize is mentioned.
11,0316328197,http://goodreads.com/user/show/19419942-kevin-leung,3,"For the uninitiated like me, this book is a difficult but probably worthwhile read. Gribbin starts out in the prologue with some of the classic studies and experiments in quantum physics, then immediately jumps back through history back to Newton to explore the progression of our understanding of light. This section can be a bit confusing since he explores different models and theories that are now outdated and can conflict with what you know to be fact from high school physics. Although it can be dry at times, it is written clearly and is pretty insightful.I think the best part of the book is towards the end. He talks about different interpretations of quantum physics and diving a bit into the philosophy of science with what models mean and how we should approach thinking about ""solutions"". He promises a big solution in the epilogue, but I guess his very convincing presentation up until then about the importance of a solution made that less meaningful for me. Also, the book is about 20 years old now, and I assume that there has been more progress."
12,0316328197,http://goodreads.com/user/show/49038107-vince-zyrence,5,"Again, quantum physics explained by Gribbin in a language so lucid without compromising its crucial concepts and interpretations. Another must read for a non-physicist who is in a constant and relentless search for the possible transcendental philosophy of science."
13,0316328197,http://goodreads.com/user/show/62352876-richard,5,"Fantastic follow-up to The Quantum Mystery. Gribbin does a great job of presenting many different theories, even ones he disagrees with, in a path toward a unified concept of Quantum Physics."
14,0316328197,http://goodreads.com/user/show/70621991-bradley-davis,4,Very interesting and mind blowing but hard to understand
15,0316328197,http://goodreads.com/user/show/66086616-fanie-oosthuysen,4,As good as the first book but totally different. Here John Gribbin tackles the endless interpretation debate head on and provides a meta understanding of why there is never ending explosion of interpretations on quantum theory. This book also provides a much deeper historical view on the fathers and contributers of quantum theory. And again John Gribben uses that unique power he has of simplifying hard concepts and making it entertaining along the way.
16,0316328197,http://goodreads.com/user/show/87368714-jack,5,"The limitations of the Copenhagen interepretation for quantum theory are outlined, and further theories are suggested and explored, such as pilot wave theory and the Everett interpretation. It goes as far as discussing the implications of quantum experiments on views on consciousness. Furthermore the possible future uses of research into quantum mechanics are discussed and explained in detail; importantly teleportation, quantum cryptography and quantum computing are included.This book is an enjoyable, qualititative, thought provoking read, which explores many of the current problems and future possibilities of quantum mechanics."

18,0316328197,http://goodreads.com/user/show/64471544-michael-garcia,4,"In Search of Schrödinger's cat, by John Gribbin, is a book about quantum physics. For those of you still reading at this point, yes I know that's a scary topic, with all its common sense-defying weirdness. But that's why this book was written. It serves as a great introduction to today's most fundamental field of scientific research. I would highly recommend it to anyone willing to spend their free time learning about something for which they'll be ridiculed about later. In the book, Gribbin explains the basics of the field; things like superposition, entanglement, the uncertainty principle, wave-particle duality, the nature of atoms, the Pauli exclusion principle, the Copenhagen and Many Worlds interpretations, and several experimental results that led to those ideas. These are strange and often highly counterintuitive concepts. I mean really quantum mechanics makes about as much sense to normal human intuition as Japan does to western society. However this is where the book shines. It explains things in a way that are understandable, without completely reducing it to analogies that fog your idea of what really goes on with these processes. ""Bohr talked of the electrons as being in 'shells' around the nucleus, with 'new' electrons going into the next shell, and so on."" Moreover, Gribbin talks about the history, development and key figures of the field. This helps to understand the ideas better by gaining insight into how scientists came up with them. It also illustrates just how absurd those ideas seemed at the time of thier inception, and its messy but interesting developmental path. ""Wolfgang Pauli was one of the most remarkable of the remarkable body of scientists who founded quantum theory.""There is only one reason that I wouldn't recommend this book (assuming you actually want to read a book about quantum physics): it's outdated. It was published 32 years ago in 1984. That doesn't mean there anything outstandingly wrong in the book, however if you really want to learn about this subject, something more up to date with more recent discoveries and theories would be better. ""Although it sounds neat and tidy from the perspective of the 1980s, by 1925 quantum theory was in a mess."" However, even withou the new research, it is a highly informative and well written book that is worth your time should you be a gigantic nerd who actually likes this stuff. "
19,0316328197,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3246379-j-d,5,"I came to this book while doing research in some aspects of Quantum Physics (for a SF novel). I’m sorry that I didn’t read it when it came up (1995) because it’s amazing and holds incredibly well after two decades.Gribbin manages to make easy to understand some of the most difficult aspects in the quantum world—the dual-slit experiment, all the way to teleportation; the subtle points of Feyman’s view about quantum processes; how some miscalculations confused the best experts and perpetuated an incorrect view of the Copenhagen interpretation of QM.With the exception of a few topics like string theory, the book doesn’t feel dated (and we don’t really know now much more experimentally about strings). Quantum computers, teleportation, and even more modern ideas about quantum pots, they are all here. And by an effort that I can only qualify as beautiful teaching and didactics, it feels we’re reading a 2015 offering.No reader goes back anymore to read 20 year-old, science-oriented non-fiction And we see, over and over, new books, all with their abridged stories of the field, and with a few showy papers of the last two years. And always with Einstein’s not-dice-playing God and Schrodinger’s captive cat, returning over and over.But by looking at the flavor-of-the-month Physics book (I have a hundred polluting my shelves) we miss the gems that persist over time, the Tolman’s, the Dirac’s and the Feyman’s. This book should be so highly considered. I’ve said that it would’ve been nice to have read this book twenty years ago, but I’m glad I had read it now. I can appreciate here something that’s disappearing from our culture. True effort. True scholarship. Something, especially an idea, that’s permanent.May be I should tweet about this…"
20,0316328197,http://goodreads.com/user/show/51819604-steve-o-donnell,4,"Generally a very readable book, I don't understand the ""dry"" comments in other reviews. There's a whole bunch of lovely biographical/human interest asides which are the bits which I do understand. Being of an moderately advanced age I have put ""understand quantum theory"" on my bucket list. If Dick Feynman is right (and if you read his ""popular"" books he had an almost pathological desire to be right) I may be on a hiding to nothing. Certainly after reading this book I can say I still don't understand quantum theory. To be honest I can't even get my head around particle/wave duality. Or more specifically wave behaviour. I keep picturing this little photon whizzing along through space and going up and down at the same time...and I'm fairly sure that's wrong...it's clear from reading the book that something seriously weird is going on with light. One gets the impression that somewhere we've gone wrong...we have an invalid assumption somewhere...and we just need someone really smart to stop following the crowd and come up with some really clever idea and things will fall into place....I am not that person. In the meantime even though Dr Gribbin's book is quite old it appears to be worth reading...he lost me in many places, particularly in the concluding parts...but I still think I got something from following his tour...I think I'll probably read it again after a bit of a rest to see if I can get my head any further round the concepts. In the meantime I'll try something else...got to to understand quantum theory...time is running out..."

22,0316328197,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4142763-jim-kennedy,4,"Another excellent book from John Gribbin. Once again he is visiting quantum mechanics (QM) and discussing how far it has come since his previous book on the subject (In Search of Schrodinger's Cat). He gives a much briefer history here - he presumes you have read the previous book. Then he gets in to the meat of modern interpretations / models of QM. Tough going at times, but he really does have a knack for explaining things as well as is probably possible. The last few chapters tie things together nicely where he points out that all interpretations are just that - interpretations, and they are all equally valid from a mathematical and experimental viewpoint. He sells his preferred model - Cramer's transactional interpretation- very well as an antidote to the philosophical issues that exist with many of the others (especially the Copenhagen interpretation and the notion of an observer). He has me convinced, though I also liked Dirac's sea. So ... Highly Recommended!"
23,0316328197,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2742743-brian,4,"This is a nicely written and easy to follow book on QM...it stays light on the underlying mathematics and formulae...thankfully. It stays true to it's goal (so far at least) to be a fairly accessible wading into the swamp of QM. The author nicely lays out the problems and simplifies (not dumbing down) mind experiments that help to visualize the problems, possibilities and weirdness of quantum particles. I'd recommend this to anyone interested in the subject as a nicely written history and examination of this topic.One day...one day I *will* grasp QM.(updated upon completion)The last few chapters got a little hairy as the author delved into the myriad of competing interpretations of QED. The final proposed interpretation was quite interesting and I plan to look into it further (this book was released in the 1990's so of course everything that the author proposed may be obsolete by this time). A very good book on the subject however and well recommended."
24,0316328197,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4018608-thadd,4,"An interesting title about quantum mechanics, a book that takes a long time to get through. I, a layman, will read it again, slowly. I've read several other books on this topic, one that is mind boggling.Merged review:Extremely dry. At the same time, it raises a lot of fascinating questions.Dr. Gribbin says he has doubts about David Deutsche's ideas regarding parallel universes. Sometime in the future, I would like to read some of DD's books.IMHO as a layman, this book should be read slowly because there is a lot technical information regarding light refraction to think about. The second time around, my guess is that this book will be more interesting. I wish the diagrams were bigger.By the way, I probably won't ever finish this book. Every once in a while, I'll read a paragraph or two, and think about the ideas."

On my Marie-Kondo Hall of Fame bookshelf, this is book number 2 in the list of ""Books that have given me the absolute most to think about and probably changed my life."" It's the only book that has ever given me an interpretation of quantum mechanics that I can accept (no spoilers, though I'd love to say more) and that in turn completely influenced the part of me that has always struggled with the question of whether we have free will or not. And he actually does talk about that at one point. Anyway, I found it really well explained, really well written, and really worth reading. I am grateful for John Gribbin doing the hard work of understanding and then making accessible things that I couldn't otherwise master.

His previous books have explored the history of physics and cosmology and here his mission is to bring the lay reader up to date on the latest theories and speculations in the quantum world. The new large hadron collider at the CERN may give proof or may refute some of these unknowns so that some may say that science has provided yet more deep and subtle truths, adn others will say that it discloses the greater grandeur of God's plans. Either way, one cannot have sufficient knowledge to understand without conquering works like Gibbons."
