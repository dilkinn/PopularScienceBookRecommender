0,0340752122,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1237196-petra-x,0,"Update (This is very funny, but sadly true). The Monday Morning Moan Ritual. 'English work-moaning is a highly predictable, regular, choreographed ritual. It is universally understood that everyone hates Mondays; that we all had trouble dragging ourselves out of bed; that we really could have done with an extra day to get over the weekend; that the traffic/tube/trains/buses just seem to be getting worse and worse; that we have far too much to do this week, as per bloody usual; that we are already tired and our back/head/feet are hurting, and the week’s only just started, for God’s sake; and, look, now the photocopier is on the blink again, just for a change, typical!"" This takes place in every workplace from factory to boardroom every Monday morning.There are endless variations on this Monday-morning-moan, and no two such moans are ever exactly alike – but, like the infinitely variable snowflake they are all nonetheless remarkably similar. Most of them start and sometimes end with a bit of weather-speak: ‘Bloody cold,’ or ‘Raining again,’ we grumble and triggers another complaint, either about the weather or the traffic, trains, etc. At the end of the first morning-moan ritual, someone may close the proceedings with ‘And it’s still raining,’ or ‘Well,’ stoical sigh, ‘at least it’s stopped raining.’ This is the cue for everyone to shift from their habitual moan-position and start reluctantly getting on with the day’s work, muttering ‘Right, well, s’pose we’d better make a start,’ or ‘Back to the grind, then,’ or, if in a position of authority, ‘All right, c’mon, you lot, let’s get some work done.’""This is English humour. No one is really serious about moaning and everyone is enjoying the morning moan ritual. This is not the time or place or people for serious complaints.____________________The author is a very astute study and extremely likeable having admitted that she is lazy and tells lies.Why do the English talk about the weather when they meet? It's a way of saying hello.What should you reply to any talk about the weather? Just agree. If you don't agree say Yes. Then put your perspective.What is the reply to How do you do? It's How do you do? It's another way of saying hello.What do you say to ""How are you?"", you say, ""Fine thank you and how are you."" It's yet another...What do you say if someone comes up to you and says, ""Hi, I'm Harry and I'm staying here too"" (or similar). You reply with a half smile, ""Hello"" and nod your head. It's his way of saying hello. If you are English it's not yours. That was embarrassing.What do you do if someone says, ""Hi I'm Jane and I'm a doctor here. You?"" You reply, with extreme surprise, ""Hello Jane."" At no point do you give your name or occupation. It's for you to know and them to find out. And that is just about the key to English interactions. Everything is private, everything has to be wheedled out bit by bit. Unless it's gossip.And the book says men gossip as much as women but call it 'exchanging information""."
1,0340752122,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1085095-guy,5," If only there were a book like this for every country and people! It has been a long time since I have laughed as much while reading a book... and I'm not sure that I have ever read so many excerpts of a book out loud to my wife. If you have ever wondered why the English behave the way they do, then run (do not walk) to buy this book.Kate Fox is an anthropologist after my own heart (when I went on an expedition, it was through the Alps rather than the Himalayas) -- uninterested in the ""macho"" obsessions of her colleagues who are forever rushing off to suffer in jungles and deserts in order to elucidate the obscure beliefs and rituals of minor tribes, she has chosen to focus on the much larger but just as bizarre tribe that lives outside (and inside) her house: the English. And they (we) really are bizarre, when you really pay close attention to them (us).Her method is that of the participant observer, forever eavesdropping in pubs, trains, buses, cafes, and wherever else she can, formulating theories about rules that would explain the strange behaviour she witnesses, and then testing them by clever questioning of, and ingenious experiments on, mostly unsuspecting ""informants"".Her writing is brilliant: acutely intelligent and ferociously funny. And in my opinion she succeeds in her goal -- identifying the cultural ""genome"" of the English. After reading ""Watching the English"" I feel like I understand both my countrymen and myself much better than I did before. I can't recommend this wonderful book highly enough."
2,0340752122,http://goodreads.com/user/show/67701697-toni,4,"I'm a big fan of BBC Radio 4 and this is how I first heard of Kate Fox's work on social anthropology.If you are interested, listen to her talk on social and cultural aspects of alcohol. Her ideas were so thought-provoking and engaging, that I couldn't have passed this book. The task of working out a basic formula of what makes up a national character seems incredibly complex, if not impossible. Luckily, Kate is a trained anthropologist who is more interested in discovering the unwritten rules governing the behaviour of her compatriots than in faraway exotic countries. I was fascinated by her thorough analysis of English weather speak, shipping news, universal moaning ('Typical!'), ever-present politeness, class indicators, 'Come off it' (I call it 'Yeah, right...') and 'Wrong kind of leaves' comments. The book is clever and ironic. It just wouln't do to take yourself too seriously. At least, if you are English."
3,0340752122,http://goodreads.com/user/show/8785310-terry,2,"I'm struggling to finish this book. It could be a brilliant book but it is just simply boring. The book methodically attempts to analyse the character of the English and observe rules of social interaction etc. It is profoundly middle-class London-centric, unnecessarily wordy, attempting to be partly research and partly humourous. It's all been done before. It misses out great swathes of the population who don't talk about the weather or say ""pleased to meet you"", namely most people under 40. The authors view seems very much of a 1950's Britain! No mention of the 30% of the English who have a distinctly working class notion of interaction, who don't get offended at being asked their name and who say what they think and feel without too much reserve. This book is just annoying and appears as if written by someone who's never really interacted with the less privileged and more worldly English. This is an image of an England, I only remember from TV sitcoms in 1970's. Not relevent anymore in modern Britain."
4,0340752122,http://goodreads.com/user/show/42080115-elizabeth-george,4,"This book was sent to me by my English publisher, and it took me a while to read as I made it my daily breakfast reading instead of my leisure reading. For anyone who has traveled in England and experienced some of the unusual aspects of the English ""character"" -- such as never, upon pain of death, make eye contact with someone on the Tube--this is an amusing read as the author, a social anthropologist, tries to work out why her fellow countrymen are as they are. Great fun to read. "
5,0340752122,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2222319-jill-hutchinson,4,"It is hard to really rate this book as some portions are extremely humorous, while others are dry as dust. Basically, this is a look at the English (not British) people from a sociological point of view and an explanation as to why they behave the way they behave. If you take this book too seriously, the English will appear to be an alien race, put upon this earth while you weren't looking; the author, an anthropologist by profession, gives the reader room to take some of the information lightly as does she. (She is English, btw.)She touches on everyday situations and how the English have ""rules"" which govern how one should act......and she lists these rules by class without being demeaning. She covers such things as talking about the weather, pub talk, rules of the road, excessive privacy and much more. I have actually observed some of these rules in action while in England but obviously was unaware of others and acted ""inappropriately"" which may have caused my English companions to react with the typical English sign of disfavor, the raised eyebrow!If you are an Anglophile or are going to England any time soon, you might want to read this book. It is entertaining despite some of the boring sections."
6,0340752122,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6257531-caroline,3,"I think this would be an excellent book for any foreigners coming to live or work in England, (even Americans, who might think we share a similar culture). The author’s introduction sets the stage well, describing her aims and methodology, and her final chapter is a thorough synopsis of the ideas she expands upon in the book. I think one definitely needs to read the whole thing though. It offers the reader a chance to really wallow in our ways of living, and ways of presenting ourselves to the world. Gauche, snobbish, polite and hypocritical.... private, self-deprecating and humerous..... DIY, gardening and animal crazy - Kate Fox prizes open our tightly clamped shells and exposes our habits and eccentricities to the light of the anthropologist's gaze.I skim read a bit in parts – mainly because I was so familiar with the idiosyncrasies and ‘ways of being’ that she describes. I also laughed on several occasions.....we have some really ridiculous foibles, and the author describes them well.Herewith a few tasters for anyone interested, mostly just taken straight from the book. (view spoiler)[Conversation about the weather:We use it for social interaction....to groom one another, like monkeys’ grooming one another physically.The Shipping Forecast: (a weather programme on BBC’s Radio 4) This is profoundly reassuring, even for non-believers. It’s a ritual which illustrates a deep need for a sense of safety, security and continuity.Ethnic minorities: Some ethnic minority groups have adopted more English customs than others. Englishness is rather more a matter of choice for the ethnic minorities in this country that it is for the rest of us. Individuals quite consciously, deliberately, cleverly and even mockingly pick and choose among the behaviours and customs of their host culture.But of all people the English are historically surely the least qualified to preach about the importance of adopting the host-culture manners and mores. Our own track record on this is abysmal. We not only create pockets of utterly insular Englishness (when we go abroad), but also often attempt to impose our cultural norms and habits onto the local population.We are gossips: Recent research shows that 2/3rds of our conversation time is entirely devoted to social topics, such as who is doing what with whom…… who is ‘in’ and who is ‘out’, and why. ….how to deal with difficult social situations….our problems with friends, family, colleagues and neighbours.Gossip about soap operas and celebrities is almost identical to the above.Men have been shown to gossip just as much as women.The English are reserved: Privacy is a huge issue for us. George Orwell said the biggest insult you can give an Englishman is to call him a “Nosey parker”. We also say things like “Mind your own business”, “Don’t pry”, “Keep ourselves to ourselves”, “Don’t make a scene” and “Don’t wash your dirty linen in public.”Because we are so private our gossip has a particularly high value. “Private” information is not given away to all and sundry. It is valuable.The English are much more outspoken in print and on the media than they are when you talk to them face-to-face. Confessional journalism is fine. Talking personally about your private life to someone you meet at a party is not.Humour: The English place a very high value on humour, and in general conversation there is usually an undercurrent of humour. We dislike earnestness: We would never tolerate the gushing earnestness and pompous, Bible-thumping solemnity favoured by almost all American politicians. Most of all it is their earnestness that makes us wince.We like irony, understatement and self-deprecation.Class: Phew, our concerns about this are endless, especially amongst the aspirational middle classes. Class in England has little to do with money or occupationWe love words, and words are our preferred medium. Speech is therefore our main way of signalling status. Other ways include taste in clothes, furniture, decoration , cars, pets, books, hobbies and food and drink .The mobile phone: This has enabled us to return to the easy, spontaneous, casual style of conversation that would have characterized the small communities for which we are adapted by evolution. It has become the modern equivalent of chatting over the garden fence, or at the village green.An Englishman’s home is his castle: The more desirable your residence the more you must emphasis the troubles and inconveniences involved in its acquisition and improvement. Done well, this air of long-suffering humour will successfully deflect envy and even arouse sympathy.We have a mania for nest-building. Jeremy Paxman says “Home is what the English have instead of a fatherland”. We are neurotically obsessive about our homes. Gardening and DIY are major hobbies here.We read a lot: 100,000 books a year are published, and we print more newspapers per head than practically any other country.Pets: We adore and exalt them.Parents boasting about their children: This must never be done overtly. It is far better to criticise them, whilst at the same time slipping in that they are a genius, brilliant at sport, fantastically popular or whatever.The synopsis:Our main problems …….Social dis-ease. (Inept communication with others)Secondary things that stem from this........HumourModerationHypocrisy (We are incredibly polite, and thus often hypocritical. We tell people what they want to hear).Fair playCourtesyModestyEmpiricism (Down to earth and matter-of-fact. Pragmatic)Eeyorishness (We do like bonding over a good moan).Class-consciousness (We have an acute sense of people’s class and background). (hide spoiler)]"

Now
 I understand why I'm such an anglophile; I'm a quirky English soul stuck in an American body! If I ever get across the pond, I think I'll fit in better then not.Would love to read a similar book on other nationalities:Dissecting the Danish?Judging the Japanese?Analysing the Australians?Surveying the Swedish?:D "
8,0340752122,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5617661-jan-maat,0,"Anthropology practised on the English. The author claims that this was to just avoid the discomfort involved in studying peoples in obscure and isolated parts of the world - but she also tells us that humour is the default mode of the English and that modesty is one of our values. Having put us at our easy with a friendly joke and a humility topos she is able to smuggle her research past the reader and show us just how alien the English are. Which is a nice way of demonstrating the value of her work.I had flicked through the book in the past. You see a brief mention of class, read it, sniff haughtily and say to your self - I could have told you that. However reading from cover to cover, starting with Fox's core idea of English social unease (or dis-ease as she calls it throughout) is a different matter and she builds up a solid case.I would have liked to have seen more on the differences between different regions - or to have my belief that regionalism is significant disproved. A nod to how far her argument could or could not be extended to the Scots, Welsh and Irish would also have been interesting. But on the whole I'm taken with her notion of reserve as the flip side of loutishness and both as symptomatic of social uneasiness.There's a lot here to make it a worth while read for the non-English obliged to live in England or work with the English, and there's a lot to be said for being able ""To see oursels as ithers see us!"" "
9,0340752122,http://goodreads.com/user/show/113980-trin,4,"A really amusing anthropological look at the English by an Englishwoman. Fox’s sense of humor is what really makes this book; it’s a bit long and repetitive at parts—skewing too much toward being an academic text when what I want (need) it to be is a work of popular science—but Fox’s own innate “Oh, come off it!” reaction always pulls through in the end. Somewhat frightening: how much of Fox’s “grammar of Englishness” I find applicable to myself—social awkwardness, humor, cynicism, belief in fair play… Bloody hell! Sodding, blimey, shagging, knickers, bollocks… Oh, God! I’m English!"
10,0340752122,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4235397-sarah-clement,2,"I am the type of person that likes to learn everything about whatever new endeavour I've taken up, so the intended purpose of reading this book was to learn more about my new country. Although the book had its moments - discussions of queuing, pub etiquette, social dis-ease food, and the weather were among the highlights - I found the obsession with class deeply off-putting. Fox is clearly from the upper-middle or upper class, and most of her discussions of 'distinctive' English characteristics are broken down by class. She tries to play the role of participant and objective observer, but clearly shows her own biases across the book (and a disdain for the working classes). Honestly...if English people pay as much attention to class as she says they do (still), then I find it incredibly depressing. I've walked away from this book feeling very fortunate that I've never given a thought to my class, and frustrated that this sort of nonsense lives on.While the book is over 400 pages of an anthropologists observations on Englishness, and begins with a rather good discussion of the strengths and weaknesses of participant observation, I am highly skeptical of most of Fox's conclusions. There are many problems, but the chief one is that you cannot define what it is that makes the English *distinct* without comparing it to other cultures. She makes a half-hearted attempt in some places, but mainly she just resorts to the lazy approach of comparing the English to Americans. Most of what she said about American culture didn't ring true to me either, and I am not sure how living there for 4 years as a child can make her an expert. Surely there was more scientific research she could have used to really tease out what characteristics were just human or maybe just Western - and which were truly, quintessentially English. The other problem is that she simply tries to cover too much, without any evidence to back it up. There's little information on her methods, other than the introduction on participant observation, and very few references. It's hard to believe this is anything more than a summation of her view of the country in which she's grown up. Sure she's commissioned to do this sort of research, but would it be so difficult to give a bit more information about how you know your observations are accurate, reliable, and - perhaps most importantly - meaningful?I would like to throw a tea party for Fox, complete with coasters, napkin rings, and chip butties...just so she can judge me and tell me what my class is. As for the rest of her countrymen and women, I suspect they are not nearly as class-obsessed as she is, and I've walked away still feeling like she got lost in the 'ethnographic dazzle' (her own term) of class distinctions, while failing to capture what it really means to be English. I felt Notes from a Small Island did a much better job than this book, and I would much sooner recommend that, which has no illusions of being an academic study of the English yet more successfully summarises the essence of Englishness. I'd also have liked an exploration of regional differences. Her observations seem to be squarely centred on the south (with a few snobbish references to the North). Working class northerners are a friendly bunch, and not nearly as socially awkward as the portrait of the English she paints. "
11,0340752122,http://goodreads.com/user/show/159587-kelly-vincent,5,"I really loved this book. First of all, it's hilarious--not because she's writing humor, but simply because it turns out that it is surprising and amusing to have basic human behaviors picked apart. Second, she is very accurate and the information could actually be useful in future interactions with English people. I feel that Fox is very skilled as an anthropologist to have been able to identify these traits in any culture, much less in her own culture. But she still keeps the book's style very casual so it is quite readable, not academic at all. It almost feels like a conversation. The key facets of English culture that she discusses are: social dis-ease (chronic social inhibitions/handicaps), humor reflex (there is always an undercurrent of humor), moderation reflex (avoidance of extremes, excess and intensity), hypocrisy (unconscious, collective self-deception, really), empiricist outlook (preference for the factual, concrete and common-sense), Eeyorishness (moaning and chronic pessimism, such as with the catchphrase, ""Typical!"" when something goes wrong), class-consciousness, a sense of fair play, courtesy and politeness, and modesty (prohibitions on boasting and rules prescribing self-deprecation). If that sounds vaguely interesting to you, check it out."
12,0340752122,http://goodreads.com/user/show/745423-simon,3,"This started well enough, with some amusing and perceptive points about how the English greet each other (or rather, don't) and converse. But it soon falls into the typical trap for this kind of book, and one which Fox herself warns against in her own introduction: generalisations. Time after time she'd assert that English people do X, to which I'd reply in my head ""Well, no, I don't"".She's also obsessed with class. She claims that all the English are, but she seems to think about it an awful lot more than I ever did. I skimmed whole chuncks of the chapters on houses and cars because, rather than analyse what we do with them and why, she's content to produce long lists of terms, products and brand names and then assign them to particular classes. I couldn't really care less whether she considers a certain model of car to be lower class, lower-middle, middle-middle- upper-middle or upper class.Things pick up again towards the end: the chapter on religion is very funny, and her final diagram of English defining characteristics, while reductive, is fairly accurate. I just wish she'd edited a bit more and dropped the faux-matey tone."
13,0340752122,http://goodreads.com/user/show/22189348-adina,3,Read it around 10 years ago after my first visit to UK. Maybe I should read it again and try to find an explanation for what happened last week. 
14,0340752122,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5649720-rebecca,5,"At its worst, anthropology can be extremely condescending, analyzing other cultures as if they were animals. But at its best, the discipline explains the very meaning of what it is to be human and live in human society. Fox neatly sidesteps the first to embrace the second by turning her trained gaze on her own culture.And so we get an examination of why one doesn't speak to fellow commuters, the English substitution of home pride for social skills, the liminality of the pub, and pea-eating's role as a shibboleth. She narrows down on the English view of the world, an attitude that assumes everything will turn out poorly but one mustn't complain, in which humor and not appearing to take anything too seriously are of paramount importance. And because she herself is English and cannot help herself, she writes the entire thing with a self-depricating wit that is delightful.Some of her insights have helped me finally figure out some puzzling interactions I've had with British coworkers. Others merely articulate things that I myself do without quite thinking about it. As has been noted by others, New Yorkers and the English (and the Japanese) share the concept of negative politeness--that pretending you're alone on the subway car and not meeting the eyes of fellow pedestrians is not an indication of rudeness or aloofness, but an entirely different set of manners created by people who live on a very crowded island, so that they can handle being surrounded by people all the time without flipping out and killing them all. The Midwesterner who tries to strike up a conversation with strangers on the subway is being actively rude in the environment. (One should not hold that against them, anymore than one should take seriously an inadvertantly crude hand gesture made by a foreigner where it's obvious that no harm was meant, but it's still rude. Hopefully, the New Yorker accosted with inappropriate friendliness and the Brazilian who's just had an American make an OK sign will be tolerant and confine themselves to a private eyeroll.)There are breakdowns of the class meanings of what time someone eats dinner, what they call a meal in the later part of the day that has tea involved, and what specific departments someone buys things from in Marks & Spencer. Given that American culture has some parallels but fewer strong definitions for class, it's a fascinating comparison. In the end, she is able to codify English behavior, but not explain it. I wish she had been a bit braver--I think that England's history as having been repeatedly invaded, having several layers of class composed of foreigners, being considered a cultural backwater for quite some time before suddenly finding themselves in command of the world stage only to lose it once more, and the aforementioned fact of being a small, crowded island does much to explain some of the national character traits. Unfortunately, only the last is discussed. Nevertheless, it's a deeply insightful book that sheds a lot of light not only on the English, but also by comparison on some of their cousins. "
15,0340752122,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1122151-jasmine,5,"I read this book because an english person came into the store and bought it, and I figured, I wouldn't buy a book like this on america so it must be good. Now it certainly didn't hurt that John is also English and that Barsby yelled at me for commenting that he sounds like Ringo star (I hold fast he does, this is not a british thing on the basis that I do not think any other people sound particularly like Ringo star,only Barsby). Moving on, basically I read this book and I was vindicated, the book is hilarious, the author spends a good deal of time making fun of bill bryson, which I'm sure he would appreciate and just generally making fun of British people while still managing to sound pompous when discussing how the colonies do it. I thought the depiction of America was commonly very flawed, but it was a small part of the book a contrast not a topic and she has not spent nearly as much time studying it, although her sister is ""American"" so I forgive her. Just as Bryson cannot get inside the British mind she seems inherently unable to get inside the American mind. Things I have learned from this book:British teenage girls are much better (or worse depending who you ask) at losing their virginity than Americans. England has the highest teen pregnancy rate in Europe. ""come off it""Growing up in rural New England is a bit like growing up in england sans the class structure and possibly with a slightly less developed sense of humor. English people are always lying liars. Upper class english people eat peas in the most inefficient manner possible. honestly chopsticks would be easier. English men think being born male is a possible sign of homosexuality (okay that is an exaggeration, but basically the only things that appear not to be signs of homosexuality are buying rounds and swearing). British people do not tend to watch too much TV. British people like the internet because it allows them to interact with people without interacting with people. Things not included in this book that perhaps should be: the british women's obsession with Bingo. Why it is insulting to be compared to Ringo star. Pop Idol. Pop culture generally (sub cultures were included but not mainstream except to say people avoid it. they can't all be avoiding it)why upper class children have stupid names. Some of the names are included but no explanation of why a parent would name a child Saskia. all in all worth a sit down. "
16,0340752122,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6116051-kirsty,3,"I feel I have something of a love-hate relationship with this book. It's clever, insightful and funny, and yet I couldn't help feeling frustrated the further into the book I got. At one point, Kate Fox mentions that she's never criticised for being overly negative, only for being deemed to be too complimentary to the English. However, in an obvious attempt to avoid being `too complimentary', it seems she's gone too far in the other direction. I feel she's excessively critical of the English, referring to what she calls our ""social dis-ease"" as a ""condition"" that ""infects"" various parts of our lives, and over the course of the book, this negativity began to seriously grate on my nerves. She also refers to this `dis-ease' as an inability to be like normal people, with her barometer of normality being Romance language countries such as France, Spain and Italy. What about the rest of the world? The author frequently makes sweeping generalisations, apparently basing these on research predominantly in the south of England and involving small groups of participants. Many of her observations seem inaccurate or out-dated, and the author's class snobbishness also became rather irritating over time. All in all, there are some positives to this book but they're outweighed by a rather lopsided view of England and English society."
17,0340752122,http://goodreads.com/user/show/38875619-geraldine,2,"This was obviously a good idea formulated in a pub. I will go so far as to say it would have made a fascinating 'long read' magazine feature. Or perhaps a *short* book. But it went on too long and the joke wore thin, and then ran out of steam.In fairness, she did caveat several of her observations, and did remark at length on class differences - too much length.Sure I recognised the characteristics she described. But there were so many broad brushed generalities that didn't really stand up. Or assumptions. for example, you can't write at great length about pub behaviour without noting that large numbers of people never or seldom go to any pubs, or that there are different types of pubs (city centre, estate, village etc) and many people who frequently go to one type often avoid totally another type.In other cases I just feel there are so many exceptions that the generality doesn't even hold. All the rubbish about politeness and queues doesn't really hold any water.She failed to notice that England is a diverse society and increasingly so. As far as she is concerned, English people 'do' religion by being agnostically signed up to the Church of England. Well, that may be the case for some, but a great many more are Catholics, fervent non-conformists/Evangelicals, atheists (or utterly unengaged), or members (fervent or nominally) of non-Christian religions. This symptomises the book - there are elements of truth, but there are in all sweeping generalisations. I struggled on to 85%, and logically, from there, should have finished it. But it kept crashing on my Kindle. I could have obeyed the error message to delete it, and re download it from the Cloud, but then I thought 'Can I actually be bothered?' and the answer was a resounding no, defeated by devoting yet another hour to this long winded book."
18,0340752122,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7226831-josh-friedlander,3,"I'm South African, meaning warmer than the English and nicer than the Australians, or so I always thought. Reducing whole nations to a few characteristics is a dangerous game, but never feels more right than when done by Kate Fox, an anthropologist whose keen intellect shines through this book, despite her commendable repudiation of academic jargon and pretension. With typically English humour and modesty (or so her book would have it) she explains her project, an anthropological survey of domestic English life, as merely the laziest and safest option available.In short, she sees the single defining core of the English as ""social dis-ease"", in response to which they have developed a number of coping mechanisms - primarily an all-pervasive sense of humour, and a strong belief in courtesy (often manifested 'negatively', i.e leaving people alone). She identifies English values such as common sense, a tendency to 'Eeyorish' gloominess (the ""typical!"" syndrome), and a powerful class-consciousness (though it isn't acceptable to talk about this last one publicly).Occasionally Fox's obvious fondness for her subject can take away from her objectivity - she has quite a few fuzzy rationalisations or jokey excuses for things of which an objective observer of a faraway tribe might take a more jaundiced view. But of course, this is something of an insider's book - for either English people, or those keenly familiar with them. I found plenty of myself in this book: my tendency to apologise too much, my need for privacy, my moderate and reasonably common-sensical outlook on life (what Fox dubs ""Empiricism""). To name something is to know it better; this guide is a valuable contribution to unraveling the mystery that is the English race."
19,0340752122,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5696453-sarah,4,"I found this fascinating. Full disclaimer -- though I think I pretty much read the whole thing, I absolutely did not read it in the order that it is written, but rather in chunks over a few days. As someone who grew up raised in Canada by English parents, with regular-ish trips to the UK to visit family, I found this indispensable. It explained and put words to so much that I have observed and felt over my lifetime. It also helped me to understand the madness that is the English class system much better than I ever had before. I knew that it existed, but I realize now that I really didn't grasp the extent of it at ALL, because it makes little sense to anyone who wasn't raised in the UK. This book also helped me to understand a little better why American (and often Canadian) habits and manners are so often excruciating to the English, and helped me to realize how many faux pas I've made over the years! Ha! My parents taught me decent table manners (upper-middle manners, I'd say), but they neglected to pass along a lot of other pieces of information. Not that I really care to follow all the rules... but it's good to at least know that i'm breaking them. I also finally understood some things about myself that always made me feel like a bit of an oddball in Canada. Turns out that I was just being English all along... I'm fascinated by this stuff and have spent a lot of time reflecting on how being raised (sort of) English has shaped who I am. So, not everyone will likely be as into this book as I was. But if you have close friends who are English, or you're in a relationship with a Brit, or you've spent some time in the UK and have been puzzled, then you may love it too! "
20,0340752122,http://goodreads.com/user/show/26188-jafar,4,"I probably should have read this book sooner. I learned a lot about the Englishness from this book that I hadn’t noticed personally – but that just could be because of my lack of real immersion in the English culture. If you work for a high-tech company and live in London, you won’t necessarily see many English people around . In spite of my limited interaction with the English, this book should still be very useful to me. Next time that an English coworker of mine takes off a week from work to redo his kitchen and then for the next few months bitches (or moans, as they say here) about what a nightmare it was, I know that I’m seeing a typical English behavior(u)r. (I still use the American spelling of English. English spelling is confusing as it is, without any need to write behaviour and cheque and programme.) I have to say that Fox is incredibly observant. The sheer power of her observation of the details of the English way of life makes this book a very entertaining read and makes up for her lack of (the well-advertised) English wit and humor (she tries, though). Obviously, anything that she says about the English is just an over-generalization and can be contested by many contrary examples – but that’s just an unavoidable part of doing anthropology. She lays out a few basic rules of Englishness, and then tries to explain different aspects of the English life according to those rules. And it works rather well. You feel like you’re reading a scientific theory of the Englishness that is well-supported by the evidence.There are things about the English that I personally like and they suit me well. I have no problem with their stereotype of being reserved and buttoned-up. While there’s some truth to this stereotype, it’s not as bad as others make it out to be. I find the English “reservation” more tolerable than the forced smiles and affected friendliness of Southern California. The English have the good sense of considering any gushing outpouring of sentimentality to be embarrassing and uncomfortable. No one is allowed to take themselves too seriously here – I’ve noticed this fact myself and very much like it. The serious and self-important tone of American business executives and the hand-on-heart speeches of American politicians who act like they really believe themselves will only make people roll their eyes here. And then there are things that I like less, but I’ll be a good guest and keep quiet for now.Overall, this is a really great and amusing book for anyone who lives in England (including the English themselves) or is interested in the English people. The introduction about the theory of doing anthropological research was very interesting to me as well."
21,0340752122,http://goodreads.com/user/show/41878643-anna,5,"I have a confession to make - am an anglophile, and on top of that, an anthropologist at heart, so I could have given this book five stars only for the title…But it has so much more to offer then the title.The author, Kate Fox, started her professional training earlier than most. In her own words: ‘My father - Robin Fox, a much more eminent anthropologist - had been training me for this role since I was a baby (...). I was only five, but he generously overlooked this slight handicap: I might be somewhat shorter than his other students, but that shouldn’t prevent me from grasping the basic principle of ethnographic research methodology. Among the most important of these, I learned, was the search for rules. When we arrived in any unfamiliar culture, I was to look for regularities and consistent patterns in the natives’ behaviour, and try to work out the hidden rules - the conventions or collective understandings - governing these behaviour patterns.’Once grown up and anthropologist herself, she chose to observe her own culture, rather than foreign and far-away tribes in the amazon jungle. After a number or research project investigating behaviours in pubs, horse races and clubs, full of disorder, violence and aggression, she decided to turn to good and positive behaviors instead. Her aim in ‘Watching the English’ was to provide a ‘grammar’ of English behavior and write a book for a so called ‘intelligent layman’. Since as I already confessed, I am only a wannabe in both fields, I cannot judge if her observations were well executed and conclusions correct, I cannot judge her objectivity either. I can only express my enjoyment and my absolute delight with this book.The unwritten rules are everywhere and through Kate Foxes mercilessly humorous eye we receive an analysis of rules of how to talk, what to talk about, what words to use, how to behave at home, at work, on public transport,how to interact, what to wear and how to wear it, how the rules differ among the different social classes and not the least, the role of irony and how important it is to never lose your sense of humor.I learned a lot and I laughed a lot and I wish I knew all that when I actually lived in England.Perhaps an unintended side effect is that she has produced the best possible ‘manual’ for anyone who would like to take a scientific approach to passing for being English :-)So I would like to highly recommended it, if your are anglophile, if you are English, or if you are not, but would like some help with passing for one….."
22,0340752122,http://goodreads.com/user/show/22308947-dimitri,3,"A charming yet misfigured look at English social codes.The peculiarities of English behaviour are so greatly extrapolated that the other side of the Channel sounds almost like a different planet. In practice, a basically well-mannered & polite foreigner with an erudite dash of Anglophilia feels welcome. Some sections are hard to follow unless you are English. Many habits come off as small town/suburb ideals that don't hold up in the inner big city. And just as many are unfortunate reminders of a still very class-based society, more so than the mainland."
23,0340752122,http://goodreads.com/user/show/21856003-samantha,4,"jesus, who am I that it takes me nearly a month to read a book? my reading habits have changed considerably this year. anyway, one of those weeks I was on vacation, mostly staying in a hotel, with a tv, and my daughter made us watch cooking competition shows and catfished, so I did very little reading. despite my slow progress, 20 minutes at a time at lunch, I loved this book. I am a displaced english person who was brought up by english parents in the US, so I have read several books about english culture and behavior and this was by far my favorite. the author is an anthropologist, daughter of an anthropologist, and english, with years and years of studying english behavior under her belt. she basically examines the reflexes, outlooks, and core beliefs of english culture as revealed in all sorts of behavior - dating, drinking, working, celebrating, talking, etc. she's also funny. the takeaway for me is a curiosity about how much of my antisocial introverted personality is actually a function of being raised by english parents. my boyfriend is always saying, but you're not antisocial, you're perfectly capable of being social - maybe that's where the US upbringing comes in. it's interesting though, would I see myself as so introverted and antisocial had I grown up in england where people in general are less outgoing in their interactions with friends and acquaintances? it was also good in general just to get a read on cultural values. what looks from the outside like ""coldness"" may actually have much more to do with a high value on privacy. you don't ask people questions about themselves not because you don't give a damn, but because you're respecting their privacy. always good to think about the values behind our differences and lessen the judgement.the other interesting thing was that the author pointed out the similarity between the british and the japanese, which may in part be due to living on overcrowded small islands, hence the need for privacy and politeness, orderly queuing, etc. lot to think about. so, if you want to read a book about the english and how they are, I would recommend this over jeremy paxman's the english: a portrait of a people (she mentions him frequently, admires him, but I would say improves upon his points just by virtue of her more rigorous anthropology), and rules, britannia: an insider's guide to life in the uk.my daughter also remarked, ""wow, how did they find a picture of the two most english looking people ever for the cover?!"""
24,0340752122,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7737229-lizzy,5,"I've read this book first of all as an anthropologist and a follower of New Ethnography paradigm. But the hidden reason for reading this book was that I really love english people and I wanted an insider opinion of their culture and manners. Fox's attempt to free anthropology form Academia is a successful enterprise of humor and professional behavior and skills, well managed in the midst of collateral damages due to her position of 'native' as well as 'outsider ethnographer'. I really enjoyed the reading, especially the wonderful explanation of the 'understatement philosophy & ethology' so hard to understand for non-english people. It's an amusing ethnographer adventure in her own world at her own risks... and it's ridicolusly funny especially if you know the anthropological domain and code of behaviour. The sarcastic approach to the profession is greatly appreciated.Last but not least, being myself in the final year of a PHD in Anthropology, studying my own community here in Italy, the foreword pages illustrating the risks and collateral effects of the 'native' field and the poetics & politics of a final dissertation if you have not gone to the other part of the world to make your research, have been of precious support to me: as a phd student, as a native ethnographer, and as a woman.MCM"
25,0340752122,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5870882-sunny,5,"I thought this was excellent. The book is about the English and some of the foibles you may have taken for granted. It really helps to understand why you may act in a certain way in certain situations and say things in a certain way. It explains why the English tend to be slightly reserved and lots of other peculiarities. It’s a must read for anyone new to the country who will be working here or living here for a certain period of time. Some of the areas it talks about are: conversation codes, codes in behaviours, the weather, English humour, class system, pubs, home and house rules, road rules, a work, how to play, dress codes, food and rites of passage (death birth etc). This book is literally hilarious in parts also. A must read. "
26,0340752122,http://goodreads.com/user/show/808220-alexander-temerev,5,"This is an excellent and comprehensive work of a brilliant anthropologist; it is both immensely and immediately useful, depicting a method of dissecting and presenting cultural codes in general, and entertaining as it provides a beautiful reference and observation point for the world of Englishness. I had been somewhat an Anglophobe before that book; now I understand the English better and learned to love the culture."
27,0340752122,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2880025-florin-pitea,5,"I loved every page of this book and I whole-heartedly recommend it. It is thoroughly documented, well written, nicely divided into sections and subsections, witty, clear and to the point. It does a wonderful job of covering its object of study thoroughly, informing readers and keeping them entertained at the same time. Do yourselves a favour, buy it and read it."
28,0340752122,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2567355-april,4,A great book to pick up and put down during my first months abroad. Much of being English seems to have to do with a fair amount of bumbling around and apologizing. No wonder I'm fitting in so beautifully.
29,0340752122,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3816075-redfox5,4,"If you read this, and you are English, you will recognise yourself in many times in this book. From the forever saying sorry, even when it’s not your fault. Or like me, if you’ve just started a new job and say sorry a million times before you ask a question. To adding humour into everything, I didn’t realise we did this quite so much but just listen to the people around you for a day. You will soon notice that it’s almost constant. And not haha funny but mainly playful banter. This book has also made me realise that I wear my working class uniform wherever I go! There have been a few times in my life where I’ve really felt my class, mainly when I used to be around my ex boyfriends middle class parents but I didn’t realise how much I projected it before this book. And who doesn’t want really colourful flowers in there garden!? Some of the things I read in the book made me sad as they seem slightly outdated now, it makes me worry that we are losing our culture. Something I’ve been thinking about alot, given the current political climate. Kate mentions that 1984 is unlikely to happen in England due to our ‘Oh, Come off it’s attitude. Unfortunately it feels more like 1984 everyday. But then I have been spending to much time on Twitter, which I have to keep reminding myself is not based in reality. This is a pretty good read. I think the English will get more pleasure from reading it, as it does hold a mirror up to us but it may be of interest to foreigners who want to know what makes as tick. If there are any left out there who still like the English!"
30,0340752122,http://goodreads.com/user/show/63320702-fraigee,4,"Part one was an entertaining, illuminating and insightful read.Some chapters seemed outdated, espesially the one on dress codes, which is hardly a sin though for a book first published in 2004.Some notions seemed a bit exaggerated or hard to believe, like the chronic inability of the English people to talk shop even when in business meetings. One begins to wonder how they ever came to build the economy they have. One the other hand, those just may be the exaggerations necessary to better grasp the concept.Part two seemed a bit repetitive, mostly making and remaking the same points already explained in part one, at times literally repeating passages from it. It's because of part two that it took me more than two months to finish this book. It just dragged on, obviously could do with some editing.Overall solid 4 stars, I'll definitely return to this book the next time I'm in the UK."
31,0340752122,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6611285-natasha-chowdory,5,"Brilliant. This has been on my to-read pile for a very very long time, since I was an undergraduate about 6 years ago to be exact. I'm glad I've waited. My knowledge of people and the world is exponentially more varied than it was then but also, I appreciate (more) the style of the prose that Kate Fox has chosen to use. It's a major point for me, in that what is technically an ethnography into 'Englishness' where Fox has immersed herself in as many aspects of English culture she never once makes me feel uneducated of 'below' her in terms of the language she uses and indeed how she uses it. In fact one could point out that the very lack of class in the way she writes in indicative of her higher class status :p (haha point from the novel, English people, myself included are obsessed with status and class). My favourite chapters would have to be the one queueing. Mainly because I spend and have spent a lot of time in queues and the unspoken rules of the English style of queueing is something I have carried with me wherever I have lived. The fact that each queue is a microcosm of Englishness is spot on. I experience this pretty much every morning when I get on the bus. And Fox is right when she says, that English person even as just one person will queue at a bus stop, stood facing the direction in which the vehicle is likely to be coming. Our obsession with alcohol was another one I found interesting. Mainly because I know so many people (myself included) that use alcohol as a buffer before embarking on a social event - meeting new people? Have a quick drink to make it easier. Oh! we're at party, lets get some drinks so we have something to hold. And so on. These are just a few of the gems. I've grown up with most of these, I do (have done) most of these. When people walk into me, I say sorry. I judge people on their accents and sorry to say that yes, some people do sound more common than others and in England you are judged for it. It's not right and it shouldn't happen but it is a fact of life.I guess I would peg myself as lower-middle or middle-middle? Education puts me at upper middle, but the way I live my life puts me at middle middle but my many eccentricities and lack of care for certain standards and customs would either put me at working class or upper class. See? It's almost too fascinating :p And I feel so cringey that I've written that in a review, so now I'm doing that very English thing of apologising for my (perceived) transgression. "
32,0340752122,http://goodreads.com/user/show/121445-n,3,"I was immediately charmed by Watching the English, wherein anthropologist Kate Fox turns an academic eye to why the English talk about the weather obsessively; use irony so rampantly; and otherwise indulge in other quirks that tend to baffle outsiders. The resulting book is very funny and, for the most part, quite a revelatory look at the unexamined social ‘rules’ that govern the English.I saw a meme circulating on tumblr recently. It was entitled ‘How to have a lovely day’ and it included advice like ‘smile at everyone you meet’ and ‘compliment strangers’. I literally recoiled in horror. As I have learned from Kate Fox, it’s because I’m English, you see. To do such things would: (a) be overly earnest (we hate being earnest); (b) break the privacy bubble (we love our privacy); (c) involve being social in an unstructured way (quelle horreur!).I heartily recommend this book to both English people and, particularly, non-English people. I also think it makes a pretty neat writing companion. For instance, it’s easy to fail to register that, while I have a settee in my lounge, an upper-class person has a sofa in their sitting room. The book is filled with lots of yummy class-distinctions to make you chortle and then realise you’re far more working/middle/upper class than you’d thought.Although I enjoyed the book, it’s not without its flaws. Presumably as a result of a lifetime spent writing reports and academic papers, Fox chooses to finish each chapter by summing up what “we” have learned over the last few pages. It’s completely redundant, and I began automatically skipping the end of each chapter once I noticed this stylistic oddity. It’s no exaggeration to say you could cut 20% of the volume of this book and scarcely notice the difference.I also don’t quite know what to make of Fox’s decision to continually quote Jilly Cooper(!) as a source of infinite wisdom about what it is to be English. I get that Fox was trying to make the book lighthearted in tone in order to boost crossover appeal, but it’s really quite silly to quote a low-brow novelist in an anthropology book. Similarly, she quotes Jeremy Paxman an awful lot, too. Another thing I began automatically skipping.A judicious editor could have bumped this up to a four-star read. As it is, it’s a bit too lumpy for me to heap unqualified praise upon. Still an enjoyable read that I got a lot out of, though."
33,0340752122,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7240015-stephen,4,"Kate Fox's Watching the English takes a more serious tack than Bill Bryson's exploration of Britain, slightly so. The author has a earnest endeavor -- scrutinizing English culture with an anthropologist's eye -- but she offers a spirited analysis. Although her intent is to discern the rules governing English behavior by watching how Britons act, she's no passive observer, instead turning her fellow Brits into lab rats and experimenting on them. She devotes afternoons to jumping queues (cutting into lines) and bumping into people on purpose, noting how many of them automatically apologize. As she studies one area of English life after another -- work, hobbies, sex, shopping -- patterns emerge, rules which interact with one another, and eventually the patterns create a cohesive analysis of English culture. Fox declares that the English are fundamentally socially anxious, and that many English behaviors act to counter that awkwardness. The weather, for instance, is not actually all that interesting to English folk, regardless how how incessantly they speak of it: instead, talking about the weather is a way to be social without being impolite, to make a human connection without seeming weird. Fox sees her countrymen and women as being desperate for fellowship, but denied it by a culture that encourages emotional coolness -- reserve, moderation, and the respect of privacy. Other aspects of English culture she touches on are the prevalence of class consciousness (which is ubiquitous, being expressed and betrayed not just by the word you use to describe household furniture, but which items you are willing to buy from a Mark's and Spencer), English humor, and a fundamental belief in fair play. While I can't judge her book against personal experience (not yet having traveled to England's green and pleasant land), I found it utterly engaging and entertainingly written"
34,0340752122,http://goodreads.com/user/show/565673-nicholas-whyte,5,"https://nwhyte.livejournal.com/2962509.htmlFox wittily dissects the behaviour of the English in 400 pages of anthropology, concluding that it all comes down to social dis-ease, with reflexes of humour, moderation, and hypocrisy, an outlook based on empiricism, Eeyorishness and class-consciousness, and values including fair play, courtesy and modesty. She enlarges on her concept of social dis-ease:""It is our lack of ease, discomfort and incompetence in the field (minefield) of social interaction; our embarrassment, insularity, awkwardness, perverse obliqueness, emotional constipation, fear of intimacy and general inability to engage in a normal and straightforward fashion with other human beings.""Since the author herself is English, the book falls firmly into the acceptable discourse of being self-deprecatingly funny. The most enjoyable chapters are perhaps those on pets and hobbies - I now begin to understand DIY. She is even self-deprecating about her own discipline: ""social science can sometimes almost be as insightful as good stand-up comedy.""Of course, I am not English myself, but I am not unfamiliar with them (having married one), and as a close observer for several decades, I think Fox has nailed a number of characteristic behaviours beautifully. "
35,0340752122,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5858970-candy-wood,0,"Enjoyable analysis of what Fox calls “the hidden rules of English behaviour.” As an American spending time in England, I’ve observed many of the kinds of behavior she describes. She warns at the end that “Englishness can be rather contagious,” and I can testify to that as well, myself saying “Sorry” to someone who has just bashed into me with an oversized backpack on the Tube (“Englishness means always having to say you’re sorry,” Fox proclaims). Humor is another defining English characteristic, and the book amply illustrates it: as Fox observes, “social science can sometimes be almost as insightful as good stand-up comedy.” That last pronouncement can also be seen as typically English modesty or understatement, showing how Fox sees her role as participant as well as observer. For American readers, the importance she places on class awareness may be most surprising. "
36,0340752122,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4272284-kristina,4,"This isn't the type of book you read straight through. My American friend living in England loaned it for me to flip through while I was staying with her. She said she found it helpful to understand the culture and people of her temporary home. I found some of the chapters more interesting than others, some rather funny. I enjoyed the chapter on English humor; it completely explains why just about every English person I've met so far absolutely despises Trump--other than the fact that any sensible person really should find him despicable and alarming. However, I did not read this all the way thru so I will not count it as ""finished."" "
37,0340752122,http://goodreads.com/user/show/893768-barbara,4,"When I started reading this, I was expecting something along the lines of a Bill Bryson book. Instead, it was a anthropological study of Englishness, with footnotes and references. However, there was also a good deal of humor in the book and I wound up really enjoying it. Although I'm American, so many of the traits described were just like me and my family, that I concluded that I'm spiritually English. I do have to wonder if the English would agree with Fox's assessments?"

41,0340752122,http://goodreads.com/user/show/21566627-kitty-jay,2,"In this thorough study of the English, anthropologist Kate Fox studies social rules regarding every aspect of life you can think of - rites of passage, work, play, dating, etc. - to uncover unwritten social standards and from there deduce what defines English culture. (Curiously absent was child-rearing, with nothing more than a cursory review of what parents say to each other, not much to say about the philosophy of child-rearing in general). At the end of each section, she has a brief discussion of the inferences one can draw from these unwritten rules. Fox interprets the importance given to the weather to mean that English people are more reserved and have a hard time broaching strangers with conversation – unless, of course, there is a socially acceptable way of doing so (in this case, the weather). I am reminded of a quote from Cabin Pressure: “Anyone with a dog is allowed to talk to anyone else with a dog. It’s like a-a secret loophole for allowing the English to talk to strangers"" (""Limerick""). Some of the conclusions she draws, however, both in these sections and elsewhere, are somewhat baffling. Take, for instance, the rules of mobile phones. She notes that young women often use mobile phones as protection against unwanted attention from others: “…many women use their mobiles as ‘barrier signals’ when on their own in coffee bars and other public places, as an alternative to the traditional use of a newspaper or magazine to signal unavailability – particularly to any potentially predatory males – and mark personal ‘territory’. Even when not in use, the mobile acts as a kind of symbolic bodyguard, a protector against unwanted social contact: women will touch the phone or pick it up when a potential ‘intruder’ approaches” (119). Fair enough, I’ve both seen and done this myself. However, from this she concludes: “The idea of one’s social support network of friends and family being somehow ‘inside’ the mobile phone means that even just touching or holding it gives a sense of being protected” (119).Perhaps this is something intrinsically English, and if so, then I humbly apologize – but at least in my own experience and that of my friends, pretending – or even actually – texting someone or preparing to call relies more on the belief that most people find interrupting someone in the middle of something else is rude and would not do it. A person who is waiting for the bus has no excuse not to respond to someone talking to them; a person who is reading, texting, or otherwise engaged has a ready excuse – and it would be extremely rude to interrupt that person, just as it would be rude to interrupt someone talking in real life to someone else. The phone is a symbol of protection, but if I could paint a brick convincingly enough to resemble a phone, that would work just as well. Or, in her section on rites of passage, she mentions that lower-class people will often throw more lavish weddings than middle to upper-class. She concludes that this is because, “Even if one is struggling financially, it is important to look as though one has spent money and ‘pushed the boat out’ “ (540). Again, this might be different in England, but if the same scenario occurred here, the more charitable – and equally valid – conclusion would be that because it is a rare event, lower-class people may be willing to spend more on a wedding (or Christmas, or what-have-you) to make up for the rest of the time. If going out to eat is a rare treat, rather than a weekly thing, then everyone gets dressed up and is on their best behavior, because of its rarity. These are just a few examples where I found myself raising an eyebrow and thinking, “Really? That’s what you get from that?” as I was reading.You might also notice in the text quoted a habit that I found myself growing more and more annoyed by throughout the book. Every other word had to have ‘quotations’ around it, some of them ‘needed’ and others ‘absolutely unnecessary’. I realize that the book is relating a scientific field to laymen, and some terms may be unfamiliar, but anyone with an ounce of intelligence can figure some of this out without having to constantly be told via punctuation that this is ‘technical jargon’ that only anthropologists understand. For instance, did barrier signals really need quotations in the above example? Does it really impede our understanding if they were taken out? Is this so technical that the average person would not understand what she meant by this if she had not helpfully marked it?Additionally, she makes assumptions about other countries that are suspect at best. This is, by its nature, a comparative study; there is no way to define what is Englishness without first deciphering what is universal and what is distinct to the English. Obviously it is not feasible to study every single culture with the laser focus she shows here. That said, the constant “Americans are…” is somewhat grating, particularly when it tends to be … wrong, or at the very least, probably regional. America is by no means homogenous, and the North and the South are very different (to say nothing of East coast versus West coast and so on). For instance, at one point she is conversing with two English gentlemen, one of whom lived in America for some time. When she asked him what was most surprising, he professed his shock at how “willing Americans are to ask people what they earn, and to reveal their own incomes” (291). My kneejerk reaction to this was, “Absolutely not!”. Before I was even old enough for a job, I understood without ever being told that it would be unconscionably rude to ask someone’s income. Out of curiosity, I polled 20 or so colleagues, friends, and family members – all of them agreed that it would never be appropriate to ask or talk about such things. My brother even added, “I don’t even know what you make, and you’re my sister.” (Granted, this is clearly a biased – not to mention laughably small – study, but you see my point). Or take the “Americanism” “klutzing out”, which I have never heard or read before, and I am a pretty prolific reader. Asking around, none of my friends had heard the expression either. I have no doubt that somewhere someone uses it – but that only makes it more evident that there should be some distinction between “East Coast Americans” or “Southern Americans”, otherwise the comparison seems false. (She does, at parts, talk about the differences in her idea of ‘Englishness’ in regards to, for instance, Yorkshire, but I also have to wonder if there are not a great deal of regional differences within England that she disregards). There are some things, also, that I have to question whether are truly distinct. In her work section, she mentions that “foreigners not invariably assume that the speaker respects them or their views” when someone says, “With all due respect” (282). With all due respect, those are some truly naïve foreigners. Just as someone who starts anything with “No offense, but…” is about to say something gallingly offensive, we all know what “all due respect” means. In her rites of passage section, she tells the story of an American woman giving a soppy emotional speech at a birthday party (558). I would argue that this is the exception that proves the rule, again. While there are some “accepted” times for emotional speeches (and I would grant these occasions are much more than in England), the times that aren’t tend to be the exception that proves the rule. For every one woman giving the outpourings of effusive emotion, there are ten sitting with forced smiles on their faces fighting intense discomfort, politely praying for the person to stop speaking or a natural disaster to put us out of our misery. Perhaps these emotional outbursts are only more strongly sanctioned in England – with scandalized tones to one’s neighbor, if not directly. (In short: we hate those people, too.)My point with this is not that I am arguing that Americans are less emotional or anything – I think that’s a moot point – but a recurring problem in that the things she singles out as ‘distinctly’ English are often a matter of degree and often not well-explained. The work section is a particularly good example of this. She talks about how people moan about work, particularly meetings and Monday mornings and the one coffeemaker that never works, but no one likes a real shirker, and then concludes that “English work-culture is a mess of contradictions” (310). If you take off the first word of that sentence, it is very true. Every workplace seems to sound the same – it was both heartening and very depressing to see the same exact jokes that I hear every Monday morning/meeting time are heard in workplaces around England. There are three constants, apparently: death, taxes, and workplace jokes. But maybe there’s something qualitatively different about the English jokes – perhaps they emphasize the second syllable in “coffee” or something. How do you go about explaining that? Ordinarily I would be more generous and admit that you can’t, not really, without deep immersion into that culture to find that ineffable quality. However, my generosity disappeared when Fox took another author to task for the exact same thing: “… and, on the part of those trying to explain Englishness, a bit of a typically English cop-out” (387). Then it behooves you to explain the difference, which I just don’t think she accomplished satisfactorily. There were a number of differences throughout the book; tangible ones, things that definitely set the English apart, but they were so mired down by things that I think are fairly universal or at least strikingly similar if not told in different accents, that my goodwill faded somewhat. Finally, as mentioned, the chapters are an exercise in redundancy. I fully recognize the technique of showing the same evidence over and over in order to prove a point, but I have to question whether or not it was the best play in a book this length. It came across as somewhat condescending to the reader, particularly when it would have been so much easier to have her deductions compiled into the single, final concluding chapter that referred back to the individual chapters (“We can see by the pub rules and the racetrack rules that X holds true…”). Or, ideally, assume that the reader is capable of making some intuitive leaps of their own based on the evidence given. This goes even beyond something that I have noted before, which is that American non-fiction writing tends to have a much more straight-forward, direct tone where the thesis is generally stated in the introduction, whereas British authors tend to hedge and provide a preponderance of evidence that leads naturally to the thesis statement, usually located in the conclusion. Even attuned to these differences, however, Fox’s repetition seemed gratuitous. I also had some fun in diagnosing her writing under the observations she was making about her own culture. For instance, she writes about the complicated rules dictating class differences regarding table manners and says exasperatedly, “The class rules in this chapter expose, perhaps even more than the previous ones, the truly mind-boggling silliness of the English class system. I mean, really. How many peas can dance on the back of a fork? I’m ashamed to write this stuff. I’m ashamed to know this stuff, even though it is my job to observe and describe and try to understand it… the English do seem to take [cultural systems of eating] to the most utterly ludicrous extremes” (450). And here we can see the Importance of Not Being Earnest Rule (for someone who argues that sincerity is the eighth deadly sin in English culture, she identifies some quite sincere unspoken rules) and the avoidance of bringing any attention to class dividers. I mostly jest, but she does have a habit of quite purposefully being falsely modest or mock-derogatory about the English, presumably to avoid anyone accusing her of taking her profession too seriously. This is fine, except it is aggravatingly transparent at some points. Despite all my complaints, this book was well-written, often funny and insightful, and mostly well-reasoned. And yet I just did not like it. It was a miserable slog, one I dreaded coming to each night. I can’t pinpoint exactly why, and I feel like I am doing a great disservice to Fox, but for all the book’s shining qualities, it was singularly difficult for me to actually summon the willpower necessary to finish this book. What ordinarily would have taken me six hours to read took me over a month - enough said.ETA: This is also a growing pet peeve of mine: American TV is not accurate to life. In the section on the growing popularity of American proms in England, she notes these ""glamorous"" events and even designates the ""cheap"" proms as those who ""club together to squeeze a dozen girls into a hired limo"" (510). I believe I went to prom in my friend's Taurus, and I was certainly not in the minority. High school as portrayed in American television is especially susceptible to this unreality; I have yet to meet anyone who had full lockers in high school, which was a source of great disgruntlement to me when I first transitioned into high school. She admits that, ""our proms have indeed been largely inspired by American films and television series"" and then says that some argue against the ""Americanism"" of the custom (511) - these complainers would do well to remember that they are arguing against Hollywoodization, not Americanization."

IN DUE COURSE!”There is obviously no shortage of books out there on the peculiar habits of the English. The over eager anglophile, Bill Bryson has dedicated at least two books to it, and although nowhere near as bad as Woody Allen’s clunky and reckless attempts in “Match Point” Bryson still doesn’t really get it. I’ve read a number of these books now and I would say that A.A. Gill’s “The Angry Island” and Joe Bennett’s “Mustn’t Grumble” were my favourites, but that was before I picked this up. Fox has a quirky, eccentric way about her which is easy to warm to. Her lack of pretentiousness is refreshing as it pleasing. She is deliciously irreverent and painfully accurate throughout her examination. This often felt like going on a random but hilarious journey with an eccentric lecturer. We are spoiled by one clever or cutting observation after another. “The lower ranks may drop their consonants, but the upper class are equally guilty of dropping their vowels. If you ask them the time, for example, the lower classes may tell you it is ‘‘alf past ten’ but the upper class will say ‘hpstn’.”We meet and greet a whole panoply of delightful terms to describe the many aspects of the English personality, like the eccentricity clause, barrier signals, modesty rules, deflecting envy. Then there are women with their competitive compliments and men with their one upmanship/ downmanship. The description of the long, drawn out saga of the English ‘saying their goodbyes’, was priceless in its accuracy. She was spot on with the linguistic class codes, naming the 7 deadly sins, which are sure to reveal who you are or who you are trying to be. These revolve around the words, (sweet, lounge, settee, dinner, serviette, pardon and toilet).Fox is also priceless around the awkward trilogy of minor infringements, which are, asking how much someone paid for their house, bumping into people in public, but by far the worst offence is…queue jumping. She says, “Try it yourself if you don’t believe me. I had to, so I don’t see why you shouldn’t suffer as well.” “When talking about your house-move, it must always be described as traumatic, fraught with difficulty and disruption, even if in fact the process was completed smoothly and without notable stress.” She later adds, “The more grand or desirable your new residence, the more you must emphasize the troubles.”There are so many times when she captures the truth and essence of her subject matter so expertly. The clarity of her perception routinely feels like she has trapped it in glass and it is just right there, where you can turn it over in your hands and see every complicated nuance and facet that makes up the complex and fascinating specimen that is the English.“The pub argument allows them to achieve intimacy under the macho camouflage of competition.”She goes into the huge value and importance of the legitimised deviance of 'pub time'. The pantomime rule of getting served bordered on comic genius and really highlights the byzantine nature of English people and how incredibly difficult it must be for outsiders to try and get their head around it.“If an English person’s dog bites you, you must have provoked it; and even if the attack was clearly unprovoked-if the animal just took a sudden irrational dislike to you- the owners will assume that there must be something suspect about you. The English firmly believe that our dogs (and cats, guinea pigs, ponies, parrots, etc) are shrewd judges of character. If our pet takes against someone, even if we have no reason at all to dislike the person, we trust the animal’s superior insight and become wary and suspicious. People who object to being jumped on, climbed over, kicked, scratched and generally mauled by English animals who are ‘just being friendly’ also clearly have something wrong with them.”This was published fifteen years ago and yet it still retains a fresh potency about it today, and it is as spot on as it was back in 2004. There is always the undercurrent of humour, understatement and irony running quietly along. Some of the most enjoyable elements of this book are the blatant breaches of etiquette committed by the author (all in the name of research of course!) which deliver some deliciously awkward and revealing results. “The English have a habit of inventing ‘tradition’ out of thin air, to suit the spirit of the times, and then almost immediately waxing mournfully nostalgic about them, as though they were a vital and now tragically dying part of our cultural heritage.”This is an exceptionally funny, smart and accessible piece of work and easily the best examination I have read of the English so far. I lost count of the times I laughed aloud, especially in cringe worthy recognition as Fox triggers countless episodes of “I do that as well!” and “I hate it when people do that!”. So often this reads like some wonderfully off-beat story of class tensions and social faux pas that show the English in all their stiff, charming and arrogant ridiculousness."
43,0340752122,http://goodreads.com/user/show/836802-hamish,3,"I haven't been able to shut up about this book since I started reading it. Every conversation I have, I somehow bring this into it. Hell, I was watching James Bond movies with a friend the other day and I started pointing out all the English-isms. Like the scene in You Only Live Twice where Bond breaks into an office and cold clocks a security guard with a small statue, breaking the top off in the process, then carefully puts the broken statue back in its place. And in On Her Majesty's Secret Service when he's sneaking into Blofeld's base by posing as a genealogist and the villainous henchman picks him up from the train station and asks how his trip was, he complains that he doesn't travel well. It's all in the book.It also reminded me a lot of myself. While neither of my parents are British, they both lived in London for many years and I wonder if they did so well there because their temperaments matched the locale, and then they passed those traits on to me. The social awkwardness, the distaste for strangers talking to you, the insistence on having orderly lines, the uncomfortableness when complimented, the incredulity at politicians who talk a big game, the love for politeness, the dislike for flashy patriotism, it all hit pretty close to home. Part of me wanted to jump up and move there ASAP, but I'm sure I'm also very American in many ways and would still find myself feeling out of place there (the way I often do here). Which then made me wonder what are the essential American-isms that I possess, and how they differ from the British. I'm pretty sure the big one would be class; that English obsession would drive me insane. Though I've long argued that the American equivalent of the English class obsession is race. Seriously, imagine trying to explain our race relations to a foreigner. Like for example why you can't say the N word but black people can and why you even have to call it ""the N word"". It makes sense to us, but I imagine it leaves non-natives baffled.Despite this book taking up an enormous amount of my mental energy for a week or so, it's a bit too flawed for me to give it more than three stars. There's a certain feeling of back-patting when the author (frequently) refers to herself, and the humor feels a bit on the self-satisfied side. And her methods often seemed a little arbitrary/unscientific. Also those summaries that end every section, as well as the larger one at the end of the book were rather repetitive and irritating. I also got the feeling that she was writing for a British audience and wouldn't define terms that foreigners were unlikely to know. Also she seemed to miss the mark when talking about musical subcultures and made gross generalizations that seemed to betray a lack of understanding of these subcultures. In fact (and I'm sure she's aware of this problem), the whole book is essentially one gigantic generalization, an unfortunate but necessary side-effect of writing about such a broad subject. But flaws aside, an entertaining and thought-provoking read.Appendix: My sister was born in England (my parents moved to the states a few months after she was born), and she moved back there a few years ago. But despite the fact that she's lived a large majority of her life in the US, I still like to call her a limey, insist that she is English and not American, and rib her about her nationality. Not because I have any problem with the English (or any particular pride in being American), but because I'm an obnoxious younger brother. In response, she lent me this book. The other day she emailed me with a link to an bawdy catalogue card she wrote as a joke for an exhibit at the museum she works at. Here is my obnoxious younger brother response, inspired by Watching the English:hi imy,sure is cold, eh? there we go, good ice breaker, now we can speak. i hope this email finds out well, probably as you sit down to eat the meal you cooked using ingredients you purchased from M&S. a bit dear perhaps, but worth it! maybe a bit of toast to go with your tea and dinner? with oxford or dundee marmalade of course, not like those plebs who use golden shred. i hope receiving this email hasn't interrupted you working on your front garden. it looks great. the back one is a bit of a mess, but the walls are high and no one can see. what's that, you weren't busy gardening or eating? probably you were doing a bit of DIY. got to keep that home looking nice. not that you'd ever brag about it. yes, yes, of course you've made a right mess of things while putting in the new carpet. you'll forgive me if i don't attempt to one-down you. unlike yourself, i'm a brash american and i love bragging. i just put in a new book case and it looks great.no, the main reason i've emailed is to respond to your message, which i'll get to in a moment. first i need to talk about money. i'm sorry, i'm sorry, i know the subject makes you uncomfortable. but once again, here i am, a brash american breaking the taboo. but as this is email, i feel it will help you to overcome your customary social inhibitions (if the alcohol hasn't done that already) and we could briefly discuss paying for mom and dad's christmas present, which they've finally consented to let us give them. no, i can see i've made you uncomfortable. we'll talk about it later. probably you've been home for a while, and all the alcohol you drank at the local pub (celebrating the transition from work to home) has worn off. i hope you didn't skip out on paying for a round. boy would you be a pariah. oh no, of course you got your round. good 'ol charlie the barkeep is a wonder, isn't he? always knows which order to serve everyone in, even when they're not standing in queue!oh, that reminds me, did you watch the cricket match last week? we both know you're a brit (it's where you were born and where you currently reside!), but perhaps the locals still view you as a lowly, uncultured american who has not allowed herself to become fully english. their mistake. i hope you demonstrated this error by rooting for england (what with the cricket rule and all) against philadelphia united. they were the underdog and all, so i imagine it was tempting to support them, but i hope you resisted the urge.well anyways, i seem to have taken some time to get to my point. it's about your catalogue card. while i understand you need to joke about sex, as it's a very uncomfortable subject for you, as a puritanical, prude american i was sickened by it. you disgust me.love,hamish"
44,0340752122,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3690073-melanie,3,"Starting off, I loved this book. It was generally well-written, easy to read, insightful and funny. Yes, I was mainly laughing at all the things I recognised that I did myself, but it was still funny. These were things I didn't even really notice, or rather didn't realise were peculiarly English (I almost wrote British there, but the book is exclusively about the English!The Scots, Welsh and Irish would probably hate to be lumped in with us).But then the chapters started getting longer. And longer.And the time it took me to read each one got longer. And longer.Even though each chapter has subsections, it is still rather disheartening to have been reading for half an hour and still only be half-way through a 50-page chapter. I think this book would have benefited from being broken down into more bite-sized chunks. The early chapter were easy to wizz through in a sitting, and I enjoyed them a lot more like that.There was also rather a lot of repetition. I understand that she's looking for the commonalities of English-ness in various aspects of everyday life and therefore the same things will keep cropping up, but 'social dis-ease' and 'props and facilitators' came up so often it began to annoy me a little. Similarly when it came to class and the endless lists and repetitions of what the lower/lower-middle/middle-middle/upper-middle/upper class would do in each circumstance, call each thing. Towards the end even the author made a joke about how often these had been referenced, and couldn't we work it out for ourselves by now?In all honesty I skipped over the conclusion section. I'd read the little summary at the end of each chapter and figured this would just be a general gathering of everything said there. I scanned and skipped bits, but nothing more. Because I couldn't be bothered reading the same things all over again.This book was quite interesting in places, but could have been written more concisely I think. Being English, I appreciated it, but I doubt people from other nationalities would unless they had spent a lot of time in England or around the English.----Some of my favourite quotes from the book:""Formality is embarrassing. But then, informality is embarrassing. Everything is embarrassing.""

46,0340752122,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2074414-christopher-litsinger,3,"Fox does an interesting thing here: she combines a dry, academic, anthropological style with a funny, irreverent look at her own people. As an American reading this book, I sometimes felt a bit too ""outside"". I'd like to read a U.S. equivalent.Here's a reasonable sample of what you'll get:When the fork is being held in your left hand and used in conjunction with a knife or spoon, the prongs of the fork should always point downwards, not upwards. ‘Well-brought-up’ English people must therefore eat peas by spearing two or three peas with the downturned prongs of their fork, using their knife to hold the peas still while spearing, then pushing a few more peas on to the convex back of the fork with their knife, using the speared peas on the prongs as a sort of little ledge to help stop the slightly squashed, pushed peas on the back of the fork from sliding straight off. It is actually much easier than it sounds, and, when one describes the procedure in proper detail, marginally less idiotic than all the jokes about English pea-eating would suggest. Although it must be said that the lower-class pea-eating methods — turning the fork over and using the knife to push a larger quantity of peas onto the concave side of the fork, or even abandoning the knife, transferring the fork to your right hand, and shovelling up peas with it as though it were a spoon — are clearly rather more sensible, or at least more ergonomic, in that more peas per forkful are transported from plate to mouth. The socially superior spear-and-squash system carries no more than about eight peas at a time, at best, while the prongs-up, scoop-and-shovel technique can hold up to about thirteen, by my calculations — depending on the size of the fork, and the size of the peas, of course. (I really should get a life.) There is obviously, then, no practical reason for Debrett’s and other etiquette guides to insist on the prongs-down method of pea eating. And again, it is hard to see how adopting the lower-class prongs-up practice could possibly have any adverse effects on one’s eating companions, so the consideration-for-others argument doesn’t wash either. We are forced to conclude that, like the knife-holding rule, the pea-eating rule is a class indicator and nothing more.This was a good read, but not a great one. Probably would have been better left to pick up occasionally rather than to read cover to cover."

Being middle class, and worse yet middle-middle class, is inescapably pathetic in every respect. People really do hang out in pubs unironically and 'upper class poor' isn't an oxymoron. Who knew? At the same time, exotic as all this is, i'm not entirely convinced there is such a thing as a national character at all now. I'm from a country who's shorthand attributes are diametrically opposed to the English - intensely opinionated, direct, classless, warm, rude, familial, informal, etc. Nevertheless, talking about money is poor taste, interactions with service workers are self consciously awkward, bragging is obnoxious, and so on. I'm reasonably sure these are human universals and every culture attempts to peg the good implications to itself.On the other hand...reading this book on a bus at 7 am, filled with loud, pushy religeous fanatics with no sense of private space (ie, your cross section of the Jerusalem population,) could occassionaly be wonderfully soothing.

Kate Fox examines the main areas of modern life and boils Englishness down to ten essential elements, though mostly it comes down to ‘social dis-ease’. Humour, politeness, ‘reserve’ — it’s all about either preserving our need for privacy or desperately trying to overcome it.I have to admit, however much I found the observations spot-on, I skim-read a lot of this book. I can’t help wondering if, armed with her definition of Englishness, Fox tried to write in a way designed to be English, right down to the humour and the attempt not to sound as though she’s taking herself too seriously. But, really, the rules of Englishness she discusses don’t necessarily apply to literature, particularly in an academic (even pop-academic) book. So, the humour came across as a bit laboured (the observations themselves were funny enough, without any need to butter them up), while the passages of embarrassment at sounding too academic were just a bit irritating.

I’ll have to take the author’s word on some aspects that I’m unfamiliar with (such as the class system) but considering the accuracy of the other observations I have no reservations doing that.What annoyed me slightly was the repetition throughout the book. Although I liked how the author distills rules and shows examples throughout the different parts of her research (from pub talk to weddings), the summaries at the end of the chapters quickly got boring. Also, at times the author reflected on herself a bit too much for my tastes.Another thing a reader has to watch out for a bit is that the author wrote in a very English fashion, often involving lots of understatements and irony. Thereby the book itself is a great example of its contents, but at times it makes the book a bit tiring to read.Don’t let this all deter you from reading this excellent book though, I wouldn’t have given it 4 stars if it wasn’t a great read.

Her chapter on sport and games should be required reading for anyone in games studies, and her approach to ethnographic work within her own culture could generate insights for the academia/fandom struggle. This is simply one of the best contemporary anthropological works I've read.As a popular read, the book is hilarious, warm, inviting, vivid, sensible, insightful - and *helpful* to the cultural outsider. Fox draws the reader through a variety of settings and themes to tease out the core aspects of English culture in a manner that's both persuasive and compulsive: you just want to stay with her on her journey through the English social world. For anyone outside the culture with English friends or colleagues, this is an essential read, a decoder ring for cultural signifiers baffling or incomprehensible to the outsider.

I think though what makes the book truly good is that I see myself in what she is saying. She picks up on the absurdities of being English, our social dis-ease, our mustn't grumble attitude. So often have I said many of the phrases we are supposed to say at any given situation. She really captures what it is to be English. I also find her analysis of the class system fascinating. I never realised how it applies to myself, how what I took to be personal choices were actually a result of something much more entrenched. If you are thinking of visiting England, read this first.

There are a few quite strange comments, such as when she asserts that all tabloid newspapers are conservative - a bit of a slap in the face for the staunchly socialist Daily Mirror. and some of us might disagree with her assertion that pets ""get far more attention, appreciation, encouragement and 'quality time' than our children, and often better food"". Nevertheless a quite entertaining book."

It takes a bit of guts, patience and some mighty spirit!This is one piece of anthropology that I would recommend to my banker and engineering friends because its so 'normal', engaging and interesting to just about anyone interested in people. So to sum it up, and keeping in the spirit of typical 'english praise', pretty neat, innit!"

(hereby breaking one of the rules of Englishness, that of not going over the top)I found it in a B&B and then had to get it on Kindle so I could carry on reading on the train home. Very interesting and very reassuring because so many of the rules are ones that I break and I thought it was just me being peculiar. But I am not English at all, even with Scottish and Irish similarities it means that I can now understand that feeling of not fitting in. I also discovered that I missed my calling - I would have liked to be an anthropologist if only we had had career advice in my day. When I lived in Catalunya what I found endlessly fascinating were the cultural norms and where they were different to mine. recommended to anyone who likes people watching. "

There were so many things I read and thought ""SO TRUE"", and others I read an thought ""so THAT'S why they do that""! I thought I was pretty British, but the book made me realize ways in which I am still a bit Russian. I only gave it 4 and nor 5 stars because the comparisons to other cultures are poorly researched, and the summaries at the end of each chapter are really repetitive - I ended up skipping them.

Its writing is so informal, but scientific at the same time, that the reader is compelled to read more and more. Getting to know the English people from an English anthropologist's view is a privilege! As a foreigner who is studying the English culture and who will travel to England in a few months, I think Fox's book is a very useful guide to know what to expect from this peculiar people.Maybe this book is too big to be read straight from the beginning until the end, without pausing or trying out other books, but at least it allows us to learn while having fun from time to time."

A bit negative, if I'm honest.Also, I don't think anybody I know actually thinks about class as much as she seems to make it out that we do.Finally, for an academic, she really should actually be completely accurate in her book. About 300-odd pages into the book, Fox tries to be funny by inserting your typical Tourette's Syndrome joke but the fact is, it shines through how little she knows about the subject. Fair enough if she was an uneducated individual, but no, she claims to be a social scientist. Whoops.Apart from that though, interesting. "

Unforntunately, as an Englishman I rather felt the prick of that skewer. So often during the reading of Fox's book I commented to my wife (one of those obnoxious American's mentioned throughout) that she absolutely had to read the book to understand me: it's not me that's weird, it's simply that I'm English. To be fair - I gave the book 5 stars, in large part because it resonated so strongly with me. However, it does drag a bit in places and could have done with being perhaps 2/3 it actual length. "

However, as the author has about three points that she keeps repeating to show how they relate to any social situation, it quickly becomes repetitive. It also doesn't help that the author's ego gets it the way and it turns into a guide of how to become upper (middle) class, as written by an upper middle class female (as she reminds us at every opportunity). I e eventually gave up after about 100 pages."

88,0340752122,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5878530-passive-apathetic,0,"At some point I dropped quoting since there were too many passages to quote. Simply hilarious.""Size, we sniffily point out, isn’t everything, and the English weather requires an appreciation of subtle changes and understated nuances, rather than a vulgar obsession with mere volume and magnitude.Indeed, the weather may be one of the few things about which the English are still unselfconsciously and unashamedly patriotic. During my participant-observation research on Englishness, which naturally involved many conversations about the weather, I came across this prickly defensiveness about our weather again and again,among people of all classes and social backgrounds. Contempt for American size-fixation was widespread – one outspoken informant (a publican) expressed the feelings of many when he told me: ‘Oh, with Americans it’s always “mine’s bigger than yours”, with the weather or anything else. They’re so crass. Bigger steaks, bigger buildings, bigger snowstorms, more heat, more hurricanes, whatever. No fucking subtlety, that’s their problem.’Jeremy Paxman, rather more elegantly, but equally patriotically, dismisses all Bill Bryson’s monsoons, ragingblizzards, tornadoes and hailstorms as ‘histrionics’. A very English put-down."" (p. 15)-------------""The ‘brash American’ approach: ‘Hi, I’m Bill from Iowa,’ particularly if accompanied by an outstretched hand and beaming smile, makes the English wince and cringe. The American tourists and visitors I spoke to during my research had been both baffled and hurt by this reaction. ‘I just don’t get it,’ said one woman. ‘You say your name and they sort of wrinkle their noses, like you’ve told them something a bit too personal and embarrassing.’‘That’s right,’ her husband added. ‘And then they give you this tight little smile and say “Hello” – kind of pointedly not giving their name, to let you know you’ve made this big social booboo. What the hell is so private about a person’s name, for God’s sake?’I ended up explaining, as kindly as I could, that the English do not want to know your name, or tell you theirs, until a much greater degree of intimacy has been established – like maybe when you marry their daughter. Rather than giving your name, I suggested, you should strike up a conversation by making a vaguely interrogative comment about the weather (or the party or pub or wherever you happen to be). This must not be done too loudly, and the tone should be light and informal, not earnest or intense. The object is to ‘drift’ casually into conversation, as though by accident. Even if the other person seems happy enough to chat, it is still customary to curb any urges to introduce yourself.Eventually, there may be an opportunity to exchange names, providing this can be achieved in a casual, unforced manner, although it is always best to wait for the other person to take the initiative. Should you reach the end of a long, friendly evening without having introduced yourself, you may say, on parting, ‘Goodbye, nice to meet you, er, oh – I didn’t catch your name?’ as though you have only just noticed the omission. Your new acquaintance should then divulge his or her name, and you may now, at last, introduce yourself – but in an offhand way, as though it is not a matter of any importance: ‘I’m Bill, by the way.’One perceptive Dutch tourist, after listening attentively to my explanation of this procedure, commented: ‘Oh, I see. It is like Alice Through the Looking Glass: you do everything the wrong way round.’ I had not thought of recommending Alice as a guide to English etiquette, but on reflection it seems like quite a good idea."" (p.18)------------------Formality is embarrassing. But then, informality is embarrassing. Everything is embarrassing.The Embarrassment RuleIn fact, the only rule one can identify with any certainty in all this confusion over introductions and greetings is that, to be impeccably English, one must perform these rituals badly. One must appear self-conscious, ill-atease, stiff, awkward and, above all, embarrassed. Smoothness, glibness and confidence are inappropriate and un-English. Hesitation, dithering and ineptness are, surprising as it may seem, correct behaviour. Introductions should be performed as hurriedly as possible, but also with maximum inefficiency. If disclosed at all, names must be mumbled; hands should be tentatively half-proffered and then clumsily withdrawn; the approved greeting is something like ‘Er, how, um, plstm-, er, hello?’If you are socially skilled, or come from a country where these matters are handled in a more reasonable, straightforward manner (such as anywhere else on the planet), you may need a bit of practice to achieve the required degree of embarrassed, stilted incompetence. (p.19)-------------------""The guessing-game rituals allow us, eventually, to elicit this kind of rudimentary census-form information, but the English privacy rules ensure that any more interesting details about our lives and relationships are reserved for close friends and family. This is ‘privileged’ information, not to be bandied about indiscriminately. The English take a certain pride in this trait, and sneer at the stereotyped Americans who ‘tell you all about their divorce, their hysterectomy and their therapist within five minutes of meeting you’. This cliché, although not entirely without foundation, probably tells us more about the English and our privacy rules than it does about the Americans."" (p.20)--------------Seriousness is acceptable, solemnity is prohibited. Sincerity is allowed, earnestness is strictly forbidden. Pomposity and self-importance are outlawed. Serious matters can be spoken of seriously, but one must never take oneself too seriously. The ability to laugh at ourselves, although it may be rooted in a form of arrogance, is one of the more endearing characteristics of the English. (At least, I hope I am right about this: if I have overestimated our ability to laugh at ourselves, this book will be rather unpopular.) To take a deliberately extreme example, the kind of hand-on-heart, gushing earnestness and pompous, Biblethumping solemnity favoured by almost all American politicians would never win a single vote in this country – we watch these speeches on our news programmes with a kind of smugly detached amusement, wondering how the cheering crowds can possibly be so credulous as to fall for this sort of nonsense. When we are not feeling smugly amused, we are cringing with vicarious embarrassment: how can these politicians bring themselves to utter such shamefully earnest platitudes, in such ludicrously solemn tones? We expect politicians to speak largely in platitudes, of course – ours are no different in this respect – it is the earnestness that makes us wince. The same goes for the gushy, tearful acceptance speeches of American actors at the Oscars and other awards ceremonies, to which English television viewers across the country all respond with the same finger-down-throat ‘I’m going to be sick’ gesture. You will rarely see English Oscar-winners indulging in these heart-on-sleeve displays – their speeches tend to be either short and dignified or self deprecatingly humorous, and even so they nearly always manage to look uncomfortable and embarrassed. Any English thespian who dares to break these unwritten rules is ridiculed and dismissed as a ‘luvvie’.---------------""The understatement rule means that a debilitating and painful chronic illness must be described as ‘a bit of a nuisance’; a truly horrific experience is ‘well, not exactly what I would have chosen’; a sight of breathtaking beauty is ‘quite pretty’; an outstanding performance or achievement is ‘not bad’; an act of abominable cruelty is ‘not very friendly’, and an unforgivably stupid misjudgement is ‘not very clever’; the Antarctic is ‘rather cold’ and the Sahara ‘a bit too hot for my taste’; and any exceptionally delightful object, person or event, which in other cultures would warrant streams of superlatives, is pretty much covered by ‘nice’, or, if we wish to express more ardent approval, ‘very nice’.""-------------But I would maintain that the armchair cynicism of ‘Oh, come off it!’ is more truly representative of the English psyche than the belligerent activism suggested by ‘I know my rights’. This may be why, as someone once said, the English have satire instead of revolutions.--------------""The understatement is also difficult for foreigners to ‘get’ because it is, in effect, an in-joke about our own unwritten rules of humour. When we describe, say, a horrendous, traumatic and painful experience as ‘not very pleasant’, we are acknowledging the taboo on earnestness and the rules of irony, but at the same making fun of our ludicrously rigid obedience to these codes. We are exercising restraint, but in such an exaggerated manner that we are also (quietly) laughing at ourselves for doing so. We are parodying ourselves. Every understatement is a little private joke about Englishness."" (p.28)"
89,0340752122,http://goodreads.com/user/show/29257231-neil-cake,3,"ah, finished at last. I had thought that this would make a fun book to read before bed, but it really didn't. It was caught, and never really chose, between being anthropological humour and serious academic study, trying to interject humorous anecdotes, while retaining a detached demeanour - which is a problem, because the anecdotes aren't that humourous, and the writer is English. Being English does afford her a special insight, but it also means her own prejudices aren't fully divorced from the study.So what is it? It is presented as a guide to the strangeness of English behaviour, and it tries really hard to that end, breaking down any kind of human interaction you can think of and describing how we do it, and how it accords to the class we are in. Class is a pretty big thing, so there are lot of passages that go, ""if you do this, you are working class. If you do that, upper-working class"", etc, etc. It turns out there are many more classes than most people probably realise - lower-middle, middle-middle, upper-middle, and upper for instance. That might sound amusing, but it gets pretty tiresome, pretty quickly.Apparently class isn't determined by wealth or profession, which traditionally it would be. No, it is determined by what words you use, whether you use coasters, whether you have garden gnomes and whether you display them ironically or not... again, stuff that sounds amusing, but after 416 pages of small type of this stuff, it really isn't amusing. I kept turning to the back to see how many pages were left, and consistently couldn't believe it was taking so long. But, like I say; small type.So, let's continue with some of the problems I have with this book. First, there are a few observations that are inaccurate:1. English people abbreviate ""thank you"" frequently to ""anks"". Now, I'm not saying that no English people do this, but I am English, and I have literally never heard anyone say ""anks"". Maybe in Oxfordshire where the writer lives, but nowhere else I'm aware of. ""Thanks"", ""ta"" and ""cheers"" are much more er... typical - to reference a recurring observation within the text. [Clever].2. Fox reckons it is normal to tip in pubs by ordering your drinks and instructing the barman; ""and one for yourself"". Again, I'm not saying this doesn't happen in certain small villages, but I am 38 and I have literally never done this, nor have I seen it done by anyone outside of a soap opera setting. It is much more common to over pay and say ""keep the change"". And even doing that means the people either side of you will think, ""bellend"".You might think I'm being picky, but I would justify my viewpoint by saying it's all very well to provide examples of behaviour, but to supply behaviour that isn't typical in a ""guide"" format and suggest it is typical behaviour is misleading to anyone who might be relying on the information during a visit.Those are all I can think of right now, so I'll move on to another problem, which is that Fox frequently ascribes patterns of behaviour to English people, which are not uncommon among other societies in the world. Most pressing of these, is the observation that commuters don't tend to talk to each other - in fact, that they can share the same journey with each other for many years without entering into any kind of familiar relationship. This of course, is very true. But I suspect it is true of commuters throughout the world. If it wasn't, the world would be chaos! No one would get on the train because the platform would be locked with people swapping pleasantries with each other every day. You'd have to have another night out at Christmas, this time with your 'commuting friends'.Fox does go on to demonstrate that there are situations in which a commuter will talk to another commuter which, again, is valid, and I don't know under what circumstances commuters in say, New York, would be allowed to speak to each other, but the validity of this doesn't make the previous statement applicable only to the English.Then you've got clubs. Apparently English people join clubs because they don't know how to meet other people, so they have to almost pretend to be interested in something external (say, tennis or astronomy) so that they can make friends. I'd say this is missing the point. People join clubs so that they can meet people who share the same interests - not just so that they can meet people. Though some people probably do join clubs just to meet people. You see that in sitcoms from time to time, but there are clubs in other countries in the world, and presumably people in other countries join clubs for the same reasons as us. I was a member of a whisky club once, but I left because I didn't like hanging out with the people, and preferred to drink whisky on my own.One of my biggest sticking points was the idea that English people, despite their excessive use of pleases and thank yous, are not actually polite. We're only pretending to be polite because our class system so pervades every day affairs that we're actually only trying to make people we consider to be below us feel they're on the same level as us by asking the bus driver for a ticket ""please"". Even if that were the case, that would still be fairly polite. However, my opposition to this is that I don't consider anyone to be below me, and in every day life, I am often required to interact with people who, regardless of perception, are on the same level - and I still say please and thank you to excess. ""Manners cost nothing"", people say, and that's because they don't, they are nice, and people like to hear other people saying please and thank you. Finally, a more topical point: the English notion of fair play. Yes, I do believe in fair play, but I would suggest that the very class system Fox writes so extensively about, suggests that the upper classes don't...There was an interesting passage about how terrible we are at saying goodbye. This, again, is true. It goes on to say that we indoctrinate our children into this at a very young age, teaching them to say ""bye"" over and over again, and wave until visitors have passed out of sight. I didn't realise we were teaching our children this. I just thought kids loved to say goodbye. We are terrible at taking our leave, but I still think kids love saying goodbye and waving.So anyway, I wouldn't normally focus on as many negatives as I can think of (or maybe I would), but I found these particular negatives pretty annoying. In the interest of fairness though, Fox gets much of the rest of it right - or at least right enough that I can't confidently dispute it. She makes many, many observations about our behaviour that are definitely things I've seen or can relate to, or even that describe me - like the passive aggressive way you react when it looks like someone is going to queue jump. This social ""dis-ease"" thing that she keeps going on about; I can relate to that, but I don't think all English people can be said to struggle in social situations - the ones who join clubs for example; joining a club means you regularly and voluntarily put yourself in an awkward social situation. You just wouldn't do that if you found the whole thing difficult. And is it the case that all Spaniards, for example, are perfectly comfortable all the time? Or does it just not have any effects on their behaviour.Am I reading too much into this? I would say not. If it were purely a humorous book, then yes, you could say that. But Fox is essentially presenting a hypothesis (that she arrived at in the process of writing it), and as such, it is open to peer review - though I don't think I can really call myself her peer. She seems to represent a higher class than I do. Should you read it? That's a tough one. It will give you some insight into the behaviour of English people, but it would be more interesting if it stuck to observations and left out the analysis. It's just too long and repetitive to really be compelling. And despite it's length, there's a surprising lack of depth - the conclusion at the end of each section, essentially just agrees with the conclusion at the end of the previous section, so you feel like you're being forced to read two redundant extra pages every time you finish a chapter. It reads, overall like a compendium of blog posts, and perhaps would have been best in that media. So... I'm going to say no. It just isn't as much fun as it should be."

To be fair - I gave the book 5 stars, in large part because it resonated so strongly with me. However, it does drag a bit in places and could have done with being perhaps 2/3 it actual length. "

However, as the author has about three points that she keeps repeating to show how they relate to any social situation, it quickly becomes repetitive. It also doesn't help that the author's ego gets it the way and it turns into a guide of how to become upper (middle) class, as written by an upper middle class female (as she reminds us at every opportunity).

118,0340752122,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5878530-passive-apathetic,0,"At some point I dropped quoting since there were too many passages to quote. Simply hilarious.""Size, we sniffily point out, isn’t everything, and the English weather requires an appreciation of subtle changes and understated nuances, rather than a vulgar obsession with mere volume and magnitude.Indeed, the weather may be one of the few things about which the English are still unselfconsciously and unashamedly patriotic. During my participant-observation research on Englishness, which naturally involved many conversations about the weather, I came across this prickly defensiveness about our weather again and again,among people of all classes and social backgrounds. Contempt for American size-fixation was widespread – one outspoken informant (a publican) expressed the feelings of many when he told me: ‘Oh, with Americans it’s always “mine’s bigger than yours”, with the weather or anything else. They’re so crass. Bigger steaks, bigger buildings, bigger snowstorms, more heat, more hurricanes, whatever. No fucking subtlety, that’s their problem.’Jeremy Paxman, rather more elegantly, but equally patriotically, dismisses all Bill Bryson’s monsoons, ragingblizzards, tornadoes and hailstorms as ‘histrionics’. A very English put-down."" (p. 15)-------------""The ‘brash American’ approach: ‘Hi, I’m Bill from Iowa,’ particularly if accompanied by an outstretched hand and beaming smile, makes the English wince and cringe. The American tourists and visitors I spoke to during my research had been both baffled and hurt by this reaction. ‘I just don’t get it,’ said one woman. ‘You say your name and they sort of wrinkle their noses, like you’ve told them something a bit too personal and embarrassing.’‘That’s right,’ her husband added. ‘And then they give you this tight little smile and say “Hello” – kind of pointedly not giving their name, to let you know you’ve made this big social booboo. What the hell is so private about a person’s name, for God’s sake?’I ended up explaining, as kindly as I could, that the English do not want to know your name, or tell you theirs, until a much greater degree of intimacy has been established – like maybe when you marry their daughter. Rather than giving your name, I suggested, you should strike up a conversation by making a vaguely interrogative comment about the weather (or the party or pub or wherever you happen to be). This must not be done too loudly, and the tone should be light and informal, not earnest or intense. The object is to ‘drift’ casually into conversation, as though by accident. Even if the other person seems happy enough to chat, it is still customary to curb any urges to introduce yourself.Eventually, there may be an opportunity to exchange names, providing this can be achieved in a casual, unforced manner, although it is always best to wait for the other person to take the initiative. Should you reach the end of a long, friendly evening without having introduced yourself, you may say, on parting, ‘Goodbye, nice to meet you, er, oh – I didn’t catch your name?’ as though you have only just noticed the omission. Your new acquaintance should then divulge his or her name, and you may now, at last, introduce yourself – but in an offhand way, as though it is not a matter of any importance: ‘I’m Bill, by the way.’One perceptive Dutch tourist, after listening attentively to my explanation of this procedure, commented: ‘Oh, I see. It is like Alice Through the Looking Glass: you do everything the wrong way round.’ I had not thought of recommending Alice as a guide to English etiquette, but on reflection it seems like quite a good idea."" (p.18)------------------Formality is embarrassing. But then, informality is embarrassing. Everything is embarrassing.The Embarrassment RuleIn fact, the only rule one can identify with any certainty in all this confusion over introductions and greetings is that, to be impeccably English, one must perform these rituals badly. One must appear self-conscious, ill-atease, stiff, awkward and, above all, embarrassed. Smoothness, glibness and confidence are inappropriate and un-English. Hesitation, dithering and ineptness are, surprising as it may seem, correct behaviour. Introductions should be performed as hurriedly as possible, but also with maximum inefficiency. If disclosed at all, names must be mumbled; hands should be tentatively half-proffered and then clumsily withdrawn; the approved greeting is something like ‘Er, how, um, plstm-, er, hello?’If you are socially skilled, or come from a country where these matters are handled in a more reasonable, straightforward manner (such as anywhere else on the planet), you may need a bit of practice to achieve the required degree of embarrassed, stilted incompetence. (p.19)-------------------""The guessing-game rituals allow us, eventually, to elicit this kind of rudimentary census-form information, but the English privacy rules ensure that any more interesting details about our lives and relationships are reserved for close friends and family. This is ‘privileged’ information, not to be bandied about indiscriminately. The English take a certain pride in this trait, and sneer at the stereotyped Americans who ‘tell you all about their divorce, their hysterectomy and their therapist within five minutes of meeting you’. This cliché, although not entirely without foundation, probably tells us more about the English and our privacy rules than it does about the Americans."" (p.20)--------------Seriousness is acceptable, solemnity is prohibited. Sincerity is allowed, earnestness is strictly forbidden. Pomposity and self-importance are outlawed. Serious matters can be spoken of seriously, but one must never take oneself too seriously. The ability to laugh at ourselves, although it may be rooted in a form of arrogance, is one of the more endearing characteristics of the English. (At least, I hope I am right about this: if I have overestimated our ability to laugh at ourselves, this book will be rather unpopular.) To take a deliberately extreme example, the kind of hand-on-heart, gushing earnestness and pompous, Biblethumping solemnity favoured by almost all American politicians would never win a single vote in this country – we watch these speeches on our news programmes with a kind of smugly detached amusement, wondering how the cheering crowds can possibly be so credulous as to fall for this sort of nonsense. When we are not feeling smugly amused, we are cringing with vicarious embarrassment: how can these politicians bring themselves to utter such shamefully earnest platitudes, in such ludicrously solemn tones? We expect politicians to speak largely in platitudes, of course – ours are no different in this respect – it is the earnestness that makes us wince. The same goes for the gushy, tearful acceptance speeches of American actors at the Oscars and other awards ceremonies, to which English television viewers across the country all respond with the same finger-down-throat ‘I’m going to be sick’ gesture. You will rarely see English Oscar-winners indulging in these heart-on-sleeve displays – their speeches tend to be either short and dignified or self deprecatingly humorous, and even so they nearly always manage to look uncomfortable and embarrassed. Any English thespian who dares to break these unwritten rules is ridiculed and dismissed as a ‘luvvie’.---------------""The understatement rule means that a debilitating and painful chronic illness must be described as ‘a bit of a nuisance’; a truly horrific experience is ‘well, not exactly what I would have chosen’; a sight of breathtaking beauty is ‘quite pretty’; an outstanding performance or achievement is ‘not bad’; an act of abominable cruelty is ‘not very friendly’, and an unforgivably stupid misjudgement is ‘not very clever’; the Antarctic is ‘rather cold’ and the Sahara ‘a bit too hot for my taste’; and any exceptionally delightful object, person or event, which in other cultures would warrant streams of superlatives, is pretty much covered by ‘nice’, or, if we wish to express more ardent approval, ‘very nice’.""-------------But I would maintain that the armchair cynicism of ‘Oh, come off it!’ is more truly representative of the English psyche than the belligerent activism suggested by ‘I know my rights’. This may be why, as someone once said, the English have satire instead of revolutions.--------------""The understatement is also difficult for foreigners to ‘get’ because it is, in effect, an in-joke about our own unwritten rules of humour. When we describe, say, a horrendous, traumatic and painful experience as ‘not very pleasant’, we are acknowledging the taboo on earnestness and the rules of irony, but at the same making fun of our ludicrously rigid obedience to these codes. We are exercising restraint, but in such an exaggerated manner that we are also (quietly) laughing at ourselves for doing so. We are parodying ourselves. Every understatement is a little private joke about Englishness."" (p.28)"
119,0340752122,http://goodreads.com/user/show/29257231-neil-cake,3,"ah, finished at last. I had thought that this would make a fun book to read before bed, but it really didn't. It was caught, and never really chose, between being anthropological humour and serious academic study, trying to interject humorous anecdotes, while retaining a detached demeanour - which is a problem, because the anecdotes aren't that humourous, and the writer is English. Being English does afford her a special insight, but it also means her own prejudices aren't fully divorced from the study.So what is it? It is presented as a guide to the strangeness of English behaviour, and it tries really hard to that end, breaking down any kind of human interaction you can think of and describing how we do it, and how it accords to the class we are in. Class is a pretty big thing, so there are lot of passages that go, ""if you do this, you are working class. If you do that, upper-working class"", etc, etc. It turns out there are many more classes than most people probably realise - lower-middle, middle-middle, upper-middle, and upper for instance. That might sound amusing, but it gets pretty tiresome, pretty quickly.Apparently class isn't determined by wealth or profession, which traditionally it would be. No, it is determined by what words you use, whether you use coasters, whether you have garden gnomes and whether you display them ironically or not... again, stuff that sounds amusing, but after 416 pages of small type of this stuff, it really isn't amusing. I kept turning to the back to see how many pages were left, and consistently couldn't believe it was taking so long. But, like I say; small type.So, let's continue with some of the problems I have with this book. First, there are a few observations that are inaccurate:1. English people abbreviate ""thank you"" frequently to ""anks"". Now, I'm not saying that no English people do this, but I am English, and I have literally never heard anyone say ""anks"". Maybe in Oxfordshire where the writer lives, but nowhere else I'm aware of. ""Thanks"", ""ta"" and ""cheers"" are much more er... typical - to reference a recurring observation within the text. [Clever].2. Fox reckons it is normal to tip in pubs by ordering your drinks and instructing the barman; ""and one for yourself"". Again, I'm not saying this doesn't happen in certain small villages, but I am 38 and I have literally never done this, nor have I seen it done by anyone outside of a soap opera setting. It is much more common to over pay and say ""keep the change"". And even doing that means the people either side of you will think, ""bellend"".You might think I'm being picky, but I would justify my viewpoint by saying it's all very well to provide examples of behaviour, but to supply behaviour that isn't typical in a ""guide"" format and suggest it is typical behaviour is misleading to anyone who might be relying on the information during a visit.Those are all I can think of right now, so I'll move on to another problem, which is that Fox frequently ascribes patterns of behaviour to English people, which are not uncommon among other societies in the world. Most pressing of these, is the observation that commuters don't tend to talk to each other - in fact, that they can share the same journey with each other for many years without entering into any kind of familiar relationship. This of course, is very true. But I suspect it is true of commuters throughout the world. If it wasn't, the world would be chaos! No one would get on the train because the platform would be locked with people swapping pleasantries with each other every day. You'd have to have another night out at Christmas, this time with your 'commuting friends'.Fox does go on to demonstrate that there are situations in which a commuter will talk to another commuter which, again, is valid, and I don't know under what circumstances commuters in say, New York, would be allowed to speak to each other, but the validity of this doesn't make the previous statement applicable only to the English.Then you've got clubs. Apparently English people join clubs because they don't know how to meet other people, so they have to almost pretend to be interested in something external (say, tennis or astronomy) so that they can make friends. I'd say this is missing the point. People join clubs so that they can meet people who share the same interests - not just so that they can meet people. Though some people probably do join clubs just to meet people. You see that in sitcoms from time to time, but there are clubs in other countries in the world, and presumably people in other countries join clubs for the same reasons as us. I was a member of a whisky club once, but I left because I didn't like hanging out with the people, and preferred to drink whisky on my own.One of my biggest sticking points was the idea that English people, despite their excessive use of pleases and thank yous, are not actually polite. We're only pretending to be polite because our class system so pervades every day affairs that we're actually only trying to make people we consider to be below us feel they're on the same level as us by asking the bus driver for a ticket ""please"". Even if that were the case, that would still be fairly polite. However, my opposition to this is that I don't consider anyone to be below me, and in every day life, I am often required to interact with people who, regardless of perception, are on the same level - and I still say please and thank you to excess. ""Manners cost nothing"", people say, and that's because they don't, they are nice, and people like to hear other people saying please and thank you. Finally, a more topical point: the English notion of fair play. Yes, I do believe in fair play, but I would suggest that the very class system Fox writes so extensively about, suggests that the upper classes don't...There was an interesting passage about how terrible we are at saying goodbye. This, again, is true. It goes on to say that we indoctrinate our children into this at a very young age, teaching them to say ""bye"" over and over again, and wave until visitors have passed out of sight. I didn't realise we were teaching our children this. I just thought kids loved to say goodbye. We are terrible at taking our leave, but I still think kids love saying goodbye and waving.So anyway, I wouldn't normally focus on as many negatives as I can think of (or maybe I would), but I found these particular negatives pretty annoying. In the interest of fairness though, Fox gets much of the rest of it right - or at least right enough that I can't confidently dispute it. She makes many, many observations about our behaviour that are definitely things I've seen or can relate to, or even that describe me - like the passive aggressive way you react when it looks like someone is going to queue jump. This social ""dis-ease"" thing that she keeps going on about; I can relate to that, but I don't think all English people can be said to struggle in social situations - the ones who join clubs for example; joining a club means you regularly and voluntarily put yourself in an awkward social situation. You just wouldn't do that if you found the whole thing difficult. And is it the case that all Spaniards, for example, are perfectly comfortable all the time? Or does it just not have any effects on their behaviour.Am I reading too much into this? I would say not. If it were purely a humorous book, then yes, you could say that. But Fox is essentially presenting a hypothesis (that she arrived at in the process of writing it), and as such, it is open to peer review - though I don't think I can really call myself her peer. She seems to represent a higher class than I do. Should you read it? That's a tough one. It will give you some insight into the behaviour of English people, but it would be more interesting if it stuck to observations and left out the analysis. It's just too long and repetitive to really be compelling. And despite it's length, there's a surprising lack of depth - the conclusion at the end of each section, essentially just agrees with the conclusion at the end of the previous section, so you feel like you're being forced to read two redundant extra pages every time you finish a chapter. It reads, overall like a compendium of blog posts, and perhaps would have been best in that media. So... I'm going to say no. It just isn't as much fun as it should be."

Unforntunately, as an Englishman I rather felt the prick of that skewer. So often during the reading of Fox's book I commented to my wife (one of those obnoxious American's mentioned throughout) that she absolutely had to read the book to understand me: it's not me that's weird, it's simply that I'm English. To be fair - I gave the book 5 stars, in large part because it resonated so strongly with me. However, it does drag a bit in places and could have done with being perhaps 2/3 it actual length. "

However, as the author has about three points that she keeps repeating to show how they relate to any social situation, it quickly becomes repetitive.

148,0340752122,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5878530-passive-apathetic,0,"At some point I dropped quoting since there were too many passages to quote. Simply hilarious.""Size, we sniffily point out, isn’t everything, and the English weather requires an appreciation of subtle changes and understated nuances, rather than a vulgar obsession with mere volume and magnitude.Indeed, the weather may be one of the few things about which the English are still unselfconsciously and unashamedly patriotic. During my participant-observation research on Englishness, which naturally involved many conversations about the weather, I came across this prickly defensiveness about our weather again and again,among people of all classes and social backgrounds. Contempt for American size-fixation was widespread – one outspoken informant (a publican) expressed the feelings of many when he told me: ‘Oh, with Americans it’s always “mine’s bigger than yours”, with the weather or anything else. They’re so crass. Bigger steaks, bigger buildings, bigger snowstorms, more heat, more hurricanes, whatever. No fucking subtlety, that’s their problem.’Jeremy Paxman, rather more elegantly, but equally patriotically, dismisses all Bill Bryson’s monsoons, ragingblizzards, tornadoes and hailstorms as ‘histrionics’. A very English put-down."" (p. 15)-------------""The ‘brash American’ approach: ‘Hi, I’m Bill from Iowa,’ particularly if accompanied by an outstretched hand and beaming smile, makes the English wince and cringe. The American tourists and visitors I spoke to during my research had been both baffled and hurt by this reaction. ‘I just don’t get it,’ said one woman. ‘You say your name and they sort of wrinkle their noses, like you’ve told them something a bit too personal and embarrassing.’‘That’s right,’ her husband added. ‘And then they give you this tight little smile and say “Hello” – kind of pointedly not giving their name, to let you know you’ve made this big social booboo. What the hell is so private about a person’s name, for God’s sake?’I ended up explaining, as kindly as I could, that the English do not want to know your name, or tell you theirs, until a much greater degree of intimacy has been established – like maybe when you marry their daughter. Rather than giving your name, I suggested, you should strike up a conversation by making a vaguely interrogative comment about the weather (or the party or pub or wherever you happen to be). This must not be done too loudly, and the tone should be light and informal, not earnest or intense. The object is to ‘drift’ casually into conversation, as though by accident. Even if the other person seems happy enough to chat, it is still customary to curb any urges to introduce yourself.Eventually, there may be an opportunity to exchange names, providing this can be achieved in a casual, unforced manner, although it is always best to wait for the other person to take the initiative. Should you reach the end of a long, friendly evening without having introduced yourself, you may say, on parting, ‘Goodbye, nice to meet you, er, oh – I didn’t catch your name?’ as though you have only just noticed the omission. Your new acquaintance should then divulge his or her name, and you may now, at last, introduce yourself – but in an offhand way, as though it is not a matter of any importance: ‘I’m Bill, by the way.’One perceptive Dutch tourist, after listening attentively to my explanation of this procedure, commented: ‘Oh, I see. It is like Alice Through the Looking Glass: you do everything the wrong way round.’ I had not thought of recommending Alice as a guide to English etiquette, but on reflection it seems like quite a good idea."" (p.18)------------------Formality is embarrassing. But then, informality is embarrassing. Everything is embarrassing.The Embarrassment RuleIn fact, the only rule one can identify with any certainty in all this confusion over introductions and greetings is that, to be impeccably English, one must perform these rituals badly. One must appear self-conscious, ill-atease, stiff, awkward and, above all, embarrassed. Smoothness, glibness and confidence are inappropriate and un-English. Hesitation, dithering and ineptness are, surprising as it may seem, correct behaviour. Introductions should be performed as hurriedly as possible, but also with maximum inefficiency. If disclosed at all, names must be mumbled; hands should be tentatively half-proffered and then clumsily withdrawn; the approved greeting is something like ‘Er, how, um, plstm-, er, hello?’If you are socially skilled, or come from a country where these matters are handled in a more reasonable, straightforward manner (such as anywhere else on the planet), you may need a bit of practice to achieve the required degree of embarrassed, stilted incompetence. (p.19)-------------------""The guessing-game rituals allow us, eventually, to elicit this kind of rudimentary census-form information, but the English privacy rules ensure that any more interesting details about our lives and relationships are reserved for close friends and family. This is ‘privileged’ information, not to be bandied about indiscriminately. The English take a certain pride in this trait, and sneer at the stereotyped Americans who ‘tell you all about their divorce, their hysterectomy and their therapist within five minutes of meeting you’. This cliché, although not entirely without foundation, probably tells us more about the English and our privacy rules than it does about the Americans."" (p.20)--------------Seriousness is acceptable, solemnity is prohibited. Sincerity is allowed, earnestness is strictly forbidden. Pomposity and self-importance are outlawed. Serious matters can be spoken of seriously, but one must never take oneself too seriously. The ability to laugh at ourselves, although it may be rooted in a form of arrogance, is one of the more endearing characteristics of the English. (At least, I hope I am right about this: if I have overestimated our ability to laugh at ourselves, this book will be rather unpopular.) To take a deliberately extreme example, the kind of hand-on-heart, gushing earnestness and pompous, Biblethumping solemnity favoured by almost all American politicians would never win a single vote in this country – we watch these speeches on our news programmes with a kind of smugly detached amusement, wondering how the cheering crowds can possibly be so credulous as to fall for this sort of nonsense. When we are not feeling smugly amused, we are cringing with vicarious embarrassment: how can these politicians bring themselves to utter such shamefully earnest platitudes, in such ludicrously solemn tones? We expect politicians to speak largely in platitudes, of course – ours are no different in this respect – it is the earnestness that makes us wince. The same goes for the gushy, tearful acceptance speeches of American actors at the Oscars and other awards ceremonies, to which English television viewers across the country all respond with the same finger-down-throat ‘I’m going to be sick’ gesture. You will rarely see English Oscar-winners indulging in these heart-on-sleeve displays – their speeches tend to be either short and dignified or self deprecatingly humorous, and even so they nearly always manage to look uncomfortable and embarrassed. Any English thespian who dares to break these unwritten rules is ridiculed and dismissed as a ‘luvvie’.---------------""The understatement rule means that a debilitating and painful chronic illness must be described as ‘a bit of a nuisance’; a truly horrific experience is ‘well, not exactly what I would have chosen’; a sight of breathtaking beauty is ‘quite pretty’; an outstanding performance or achievement is ‘not bad’; an act of abominable cruelty is ‘not very friendly’, and an unforgivably stupid misjudgement is ‘not very clever’; the Antarctic is ‘rather cold’ and the Sahara ‘a bit too hot for my taste’; and any exceptionally delightful object, person or event, which in other cultures would warrant streams of superlatives, is pretty much covered by ‘nice’, or, if we wish to express more ardent approval, ‘very nice’.""-------------But I would maintain that the armchair cynicism of ‘Oh, come off it!’ is more truly representative of the English psyche than the belligerent activism suggested by ‘I know my rights’. This may be why, as someone once said, the English have satire instead of revolutions.--------------""The understatement is also difficult for foreigners to ‘get’ because it is, in effect, an in-joke about our own unwritten rules of humour. When we describe, say, a horrendous, traumatic and painful experience as ‘not very pleasant’, we are acknowledging the taboo on earnestness and the rules of irony, but at the same making fun of our ludicrously rigid obedience to these codes. We are exercising restraint, but in such an exaggerated manner that we are also (quietly) laughing at ourselves for doing so. We are parodying ourselves. Every understatement is a little private joke about Englishness."" (p.28)"
149,0340752122,http://goodreads.com/user/show/29257231-neil-cake,3,"ah, finished at last. I had thought that this would make a fun book to read before bed, but it really didn't. It was caught, and never really chose, between being anthropological humour and serious academic study, trying to interject humorous anecdotes, while retaining a detached demeanour - which is a problem, because the anecdotes aren't that humourous, and the writer is English. Being English does afford her a special insight, but it also means her own prejudices aren't fully divorced from the study.So what is it? It is presented as a guide to the strangeness of English behaviour, and it tries really hard to that end, breaking down any kind of human interaction you can think of and describing how we do it, and how it accords to the class we are in. Class is a pretty big thing, so there are lot of passages that go, ""if you do this, you are working class. If you do that, upper-working class"", etc, etc. It turns out there are many more classes than most people probably realise - lower-middle, middle-middle, upper-middle, and upper for instance. That might sound amusing, but it gets pretty tiresome, pretty quickly.Apparently class isn't determined by wealth or profession, which traditionally it would be. No, it is determined by what words you use, whether you use coasters, whether you have garden gnomes and whether you display them ironically or not... again, stuff that sounds amusing, but after 416 pages of small type of this stuff, it really isn't amusing. I kept turning to the back to see how many pages were left, and consistently couldn't believe it was taking so long. But, like I say; small type.So, let's continue with some of the problems I have with this book. First, there are a few observations that are inaccurate:1. English people abbreviate ""thank you"" frequently to ""anks"". Now, I'm not saying that no English people do this, but I am English, and I have literally never heard anyone say ""anks"". Maybe in Oxfordshire where the writer lives, but nowhere else I'm aware of. ""Thanks"", ""ta"" and ""cheers"" are much more er... typical - to reference a recurring observation within the text. [Clever].2. Fox reckons it is normal to tip in pubs by ordering your drinks and instructing the barman; ""and one for yourself"". Again, I'm not saying this doesn't happen in certain small villages, but I am 38 and I have literally never done this, nor have I seen it done by anyone outside of a soap opera setting. It is much more common to over pay and say ""keep the change"". And even doing that means the people either side of you will think, ""bellend"".You might think I'm being picky, but I would justify my viewpoint by saying it's all very well to provide examples of behaviour, but to supply behaviour that isn't typical in a ""guide"" format and suggest it is typical behaviour is misleading to anyone who might be relying on the information during a visit.Those are all I can think of right now, so I'll move on to another problem, which is that Fox frequently ascribes patterns of behaviour to English people, which are not uncommon among other societies in the world. Most pressing of these, is the observation that commuters don't tend to talk to each other - in fact, that they can share the same journey with each other for many years without entering into any kind of familiar relationship. This of course, is very true. But I suspect it is true of commuters throughout the world. If it wasn't, the world would be chaos! No one would get on the train because the platform would be locked with people swapping pleasantries with each other every day. You'd have to have another night out at Christmas, this time with your 'commuting friends'.Fox does go on to demonstrate that there are situations in which a commuter will talk to another commuter which, again, is valid, and I don't know under what circumstances commuters in say, New York, would be allowed to speak to each other, but the validity of this doesn't make the previous statement applicable only to the English.Then you've got clubs. Apparently English people join clubs because they don't know how to meet other people, so they have to almost pretend to be interested in something external (say, tennis or astronomy) so that they can make friends. I'd say this is missing the point. People join clubs so that they can meet people who share the same interests - not just so that they can meet people. Though some people probably do join clubs just to meet people. You see that in sitcoms from time to time, but there are clubs in other countries in the world, and presumably people in other countries join clubs for the same reasons as us. I was a member of a whisky club once, but I left because I didn't like hanging out with the people, and preferred to drink whisky on my own.One of my biggest sticking points was the idea that English people, despite their excessive use of pleases and thank yous, are not actually polite. We're only pretending to be polite because our class system so pervades every day affairs that we're actually only trying to make people we consider to be below us feel they're on the same level as us by asking the bus driver for a ticket ""please"". Even if that were the case, that would still be fairly polite. However, my opposition to this is that I don't consider anyone to be below me, and in every day life, I am often required to interact with people who, regardless of perception, are on the same level - and I still say please and thank you to excess. ""Manners cost nothing"", people say, and that's because they don't, they are nice, and people like to hear other people saying please and thank you. Finally, a more topical point: the English notion of fair play. Yes, I do believe in fair play, but I would suggest that the very class system Fox writes so extensively about, suggests that the upper classes don't...There was an interesting passage about how terrible we are at saying goodbye. This, again, is true. It goes on to say that we indoctrinate our children into this at a very young age, teaching them to say ""bye"" over and over again, and wave until visitors have passed out of sight. I didn't realise we were teaching our children this. I just thought kids loved to say goodbye. We are terrible at taking our leave, but I still think kids love saying goodbye and waving.So anyway, I wouldn't normally focus on as many negatives as I can think of (or maybe I would), but I found these particular negatives pretty annoying. In the interest of fairness though, Fox gets much of the rest of it right - or at least right enough that I can't confidently dispute it. She makes many, many observations about our behaviour that are definitely things I've seen or can relate to, or even that describe me - like the passive aggressive way you react when it looks like someone is going to queue jump. This social ""dis-ease"" thing that she keeps going on about; I can relate to that, but I don't think all English people can be said to struggle in social situations - the ones who join clubs for example; joining a club means you regularly and voluntarily put yourself in an awkward social situation. You just wouldn't do that if you found the whole thing difficult. And is it the case that all Spaniards, for example, are perfectly comfortable all the time? Or does it just not have any effects on their behaviour.Am I reading too much into this? I would say not. If it were purely a humorous book, then yes, you could say that. But Fox is essentially presenting a hypothesis (that she arrived at in the process of writing it), and as such, it is open to peer review - though I don't think I can really call myself her peer. She seems to represent a higher class than I do. Should you read it? That's a tough one. It will give you some insight into the behaviour of English people, but it would be more interesting if it stuck to observations and left out the analysis. It's just too long and repetitive to really be compelling. And despite it's length, there's a surprising lack of depth - the conclusion at the end of each section, essentially just agrees with the conclusion at the end of the previous section, so you feel like you're being forced to read two redundant extra pages every time you finish a chapter. It reads, overall like a compendium of blog posts, and perhaps would have been best in that media. So... I'm going to say no. It just isn't as much fun as it should be."

To be fair - I gave the book 5 stars, in large part because it resonated so strongly with me. However, it does drag a bit in places and could have done with being perhaps 2/3 it actual length. "

178,0340752122,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5878530-passive-apathetic,0,"At some point I dropped quoting since there were too many passages to quote. Simply hilarious.""Size, we sniffily point out, isn’t everything, and the English weather requires an appreciation of subtle changes and understated nuances, rather than a vulgar obsession with mere volume and magnitude.Indeed, the weather may be one of the few things about which the English are still unselfconsciously and unashamedly patriotic. During my participant-observation research on Englishness, which naturally involved many conversations about the weather, I came across this prickly defensiveness about our weather again and again,among people of all classes and social backgrounds. Contempt for American size-fixation was widespread – one outspoken informant (a publican) expressed the feelings of many when he told me: ‘Oh, with Americans it’s always “mine’s bigger than yours”, with the weather or anything else. They’re so crass. Bigger steaks, bigger buildings, bigger snowstorms, more heat, more hurricanes, whatever. No fucking subtlety, that’s their problem.’Jeremy Paxman, rather more elegantly, but equally patriotically, dismisses all Bill Bryson’s monsoons, ragingblizzards, tornadoes and hailstorms as ‘histrionics’. A very English put-down."" (p. 15)-------------""The ‘brash American’ approach: ‘Hi, I’m Bill from Iowa,’ particularly if accompanied by an outstretched hand and beaming smile, makes the English wince and cringe. The American tourists and visitors I spoke to during my research had been both baffled and hurt by this reaction. ‘I just don’t get it,’ said one woman. ‘You say your name and they sort of wrinkle their noses, like you’ve told them something a bit too personal and embarrassing.’‘That’s right,’ her husband added. ‘And then they give you this tight little smile and say “Hello” – kind of pointedly not giving their name, to let you know you’ve made this big social booboo. What the hell is so private about a person’s name, for God’s sake?’I ended up explaining, as kindly as I could, that the English do not want to know your name, or tell you theirs, until a much greater degree of intimacy has been established – like maybe when you marry their daughter. Rather than giving your name, I suggested, you should strike up a conversation by making a vaguely interrogative comment about the weather (or the party or pub or wherever you happen to be). This must not be done too loudly, and the tone should be light and informal, not earnest or intense. The object is to ‘drift’ casually into conversation, as though by accident. Even if the other person seems happy enough to chat, it is still customary to curb any urges to introduce yourself.Eventually, there may be an opportunity to exchange names, providing this can be achieved in a casual, unforced manner, although it is always best to wait for the other person to take the initiative. Should you reach the end of a long, friendly evening without having introduced yourself, you may say, on parting, ‘Goodbye, nice to meet you, er, oh – I didn’t catch your name?’ as though you have only just noticed the omission. Your new acquaintance should then divulge his or her name, and you may now, at last, introduce yourself – but in an offhand way, as though it is not a matter of any importance: ‘I’m Bill, by the way.’One perceptive Dutch tourist, after listening attentively to my explanation of this procedure, commented: ‘Oh, I see. It is like Alice Through the Looking Glass: you do everything the wrong way round.’ I had not thought of recommending Alice as a guide to English etiquette, but on reflection it seems like quite a good idea."" (p.18)------------------Formality is embarrassing. But then, informality is embarrassing. Everything is embarrassing.The Embarrassment RuleIn fact, the only rule one can identify with any certainty in all this confusion over introductions and greetings is that, to be impeccably English, one must perform these rituals badly. One must appear self-conscious, ill-atease, stiff, awkward and, above all, embarrassed. Smoothness, glibness and confidence are inappropriate and un-English. Hesitation, dithering and ineptness are, surprising as it may seem, correct behaviour. Introductions should be performed as hurriedly as possible, but also with maximum inefficiency. If disclosed at all, names must be mumbled; hands should be tentatively half-proffered and then clumsily withdrawn; the approved greeting is something like ‘Er, how, um, plstm-, er, hello?’If you are socially skilled, or come from a country where these matters are handled in a more reasonable, straightforward manner (such as anywhere else on the planet), you may need a bit of practice to achieve the required degree of embarrassed, stilted incompetence. (p.19)-------------------""The guessing-game rituals allow us, eventually, to elicit this kind of rudimentary census-form information, but the English privacy rules ensure that any more interesting details about our lives and relationships are reserved for close friends and family. This is ‘privileged’ information, not to be bandied about indiscriminately. The English take a certain pride in this trait, and sneer at the stereotyped Americans who ‘tell you all about their divorce, their hysterectomy and their therapist within five minutes of meeting you’. This cliché, although not entirely without foundation, probably tells us more about the English and our privacy rules than it does about the Americans."" (p.20)--------------Seriousness is acceptable, solemnity is prohibited. Sincerity is allowed, earnestness is strictly forbidden. Pomposity and self-importance are outlawed. Serious matters can be spoken of seriously, but one must never take oneself too seriously. The ability to laugh at ourselves, although it may be rooted in a form of arrogance, is one of the more endearing characteristics of the English. (At least, I hope I am right about this: if I have overestimated our ability to laugh at ourselves, this book will be rather unpopular.) To take a deliberately extreme example, the kind of hand-on-heart, gushing earnestness and pompous, Biblethumping solemnity favoured by almost all American politicians would never win a single vote in this country – we watch these speeches on our news programmes with a kind of smugly detached amusement, wondering how the cheering crowds can possibly be so credulous as to fall for this sort of nonsense. When we are not feeling smugly amused, we are cringing with vicarious embarrassment: how can these politicians bring themselves to utter such shamefully earnest platitudes, in such ludicrously solemn tones? We expect politicians to speak largely in platitudes, of course – ours are no different in this respect – it is the earnestness that makes us wince. The same goes for the gushy, tearful acceptance speeches of American actors at the Oscars and other awards ceremonies, to which English television viewers across the country all respond with the same finger-down-throat ‘I’m going to be sick’ gesture. You will rarely see English Oscar-winners indulging in these heart-on-sleeve displays – their speeches tend to be either short and dignified or self deprecatingly humorous, and even so they nearly always manage to look uncomfortable and embarrassed. Any English thespian who dares to break these unwritten rules is ridiculed and dismissed as a ‘luvvie’.---------------""The understatement rule means that a debilitating and painful chronic illness must be described as ‘a bit of a nuisance’; a truly horrific experience is ‘well, not exactly what I would have chosen’; a sight of breathtaking beauty is ‘quite pretty’; an outstanding performance or achievement is ‘not bad’; an act of abominable cruelty is ‘not very friendly’, and an unforgivably stupid misjudgement is ‘not very clever’; the Antarctic is ‘rather cold’ and the Sahara ‘a bit too hot for my taste’; and any exceptionally delightful object, person or event, which in other cultures would warrant streams of superlatives, is pretty much covered by ‘nice’, or, if we wish to express more ardent approval, ‘very nice’.""-------------But I would maintain that the armchair cynicism of ‘Oh, come off it!’ is more truly representative of the English psyche than the belligerent activism suggested by ‘I know my rights’. This may be why, as someone once said, the English have satire instead of revolutions.--------------""The understatement is also difficult for foreigners to ‘get’ because it is, in effect, an in-joke about our own unwritten rules of humour. When we describe, say, a horrendous, traumatic and painful experience as ‘not very pleasant’, we are acknowledging the taboo on earnestness and the rules of irony, but at the same making fun of our ludicrously rigid obedience to these codes. We are exercising restraint, but in such an exaggerated manner that we are also (quietly) laughing at ourselves for doing so. We are parodying ourselves. Every understatement is a little private joke about Englishness."" (p.28)"
179,0340752122,http://goodreads.com/user/show/29257231-neil-cake,3,"ah, finished at last. I had thought that this would make a fun book to read before bed, but it really didn't. It was caught, and never really chose, between being anthropological humour and serious academic study, trying to interject humorous anecdotes, while retaining a detached demeanour - which is a problem, because the anecdotes aren't that humourous, and the writer is English. Being English does afford her a special insight, but it also means her own prejudices aren't fully divorced from the study.So what is it? It is presented as a guide to the strangeness of English behaviour, and it tries really hard to that end, breaking down any kind of human interaction you can think of and describing how we do it, and how it accords to the class we are in. Class is a pretty big thing, so there are lot of passages that go, ""if you do this, you are working class. If you do that, upper-working class"", etc, etc. It turns out there are many more classes than most people probably realise - lower-middle, middle-middle, upper-middle, and upper for instance. That might sound amusing, but it gets pretty tiresome, pretty quickly.Apparently class isn't determined by wealth or profession, which traditionally it would be. No, it is determined by what words you use, whether you use coasters, whether you have garden gnomes and whether you display them ironically or not... again, stuff that sounds amusing, but after 416 pages of small type of this stuff, it really isn't amusing. I kept turning to the back to see how many pages were left, and consistently couldn't believe it was taking so long. But, like I say; small type.So, let's continue with some of the problems I have with this book. First, there are a few observations that are inaccurate:1. English people abbreviate ""thank you"" frequently to ""anks"". Now, I'm not saying that no English people do this, but I am English, and I have literally never heard anyone say ""anks"". Maybe in Oxfordshire where the writer lives, but nowhere else I'm aware of. ""Thanks"", ""ta"" and ""cheers"" are much more er... typical - to reference a recurring observation within the text. [Clever].2. Fox reckons it is normal to tip in pubs by ordering your drinks and instructing the barman; ""and one for yourself"". Again, I'm not saying this doesn't happen in certain small villages, but I am 38 and I have literally never done this, nor have I seen it done by anyone outside of a soap opera setting. It is much more common to over pay and say ""keep the change"". And even doing that means the people either side of you will think, ""bellend"".You might think I'm being picky, but I would justify my viewpoint by saying it's all very well to provide examples of behaviour, but to supply behaviour that isn't typical in a ""guide"" format and suggest it is typical behaviour is misleading to anyone who might be relying on the information during a visit.Those are all I can think of right now, so I'll move on to another problem, which is that Fox frequently ascribes patterns of behaviour to English people, which are not uncommon among other societies in the world. Most pressing of these, is the observation that commuters don't tend to talk to each other - in fact, that they can share the same journey with each other for many years without entering into any kind of familiar relationship. This of course, is very true. But I suspect it is true of commuters throughout the world. If it wasn't, the world would be chaos! No one would get on the train because the platform would be locked with people swapping pleasantries with each other every day. You'd have to have another night out at Christmas, this time with your 'commuting friends'.Fox does go on to demonstrate that there are situations in which a commuter will talk to another commuter which, again, is valid, and I don't know under what circumstances commuters in say, New York, would be allowed to speak to each other, but the validity of this doesn't make the previous statement applicable only to the English.Then you've got clubs. Apparently English people join clubs because they don't know how to meet other people, so they have to almost pretend to be interested in something external (say, tennis or astronomy) so that they can make friends. I'd say this is missing the point. People join clubs so that they can meet people who share the same interests - not just so that they can meet people. Though some people probably do join clubs just to meet people. You see that in sitcoms from time to time, but there are clubs in other countries in the world, and presumably people in other countries join clubs for the same reasons as us. I was a member of a whisky club once, but I left because I didn't like hanging out with the people, and preferred to drink whisky on my own.One of my biggest sticking points was the idea that English people, despite their excessive use of pleases and thank yous, are not actually polite. We're only pretending to be polite because our class system so pervades every day affairs that we're actually only trying to make people we consider to be below us feel they're on the same level as us by asking the bus driver for a ticket ""please"". Even if that were the case, that would still be fairly polite. However, my opposition to this is that I don't consider anyone to be below me, and in every day life, I am often required to interact with people who, regardless of perception, are on the same level - and I still say please and thank you to excess. ""Manners cost nothing"", people say, and that's because they don't, they are nice, and people like to hear other people saying please and thank you. Finally, a more topical point: the English notion of fair play. Yes, I do believe in fair play, but I would suggest that the very class system Fox writes so extensively about, suggests that the upper classes don't...There was an interesting passage about how terrible we are at saying goodbye. This, again, is true. It goes on to say that we indoctrinate our children into this at a very young age, teaching them to say ""bye"" over and over again, and wave until visitors have passed out of sight. I didn't realise we were teaching our children this. I just thought kids loved to say goodbye. We are terrible at taking our leave, but I still think kids love saying goodbye and waving.So anyway, I wouldn't normally focus on as many negatives as I can think of (or maybe I would), but I found these particular negatives pretty annoying. In the interest of fairness though, Fox gets much of the rest of it right - or at least right enough that I can't confidently dispute it. She makes many, many observations about our behaviour that are definitely things I've seen or can relate to, or even that describe me - like the passive aggressive way you react when it looks like someone is going to queue jump. This social ""dis-ease"" thing that she keeps going on about; I can relate to that, but I don't think all English people can be said to struggle in social situations - the ones who join clubs for example; joining a club means you regularly and voluntarily put yourself in an awkward social situation. You just wouldn't do that if you found the whole thing difficult. And is it the case that all Spaniards, for example, are perfectly comfortable all the time? Or does it just not have any effects on their behaviour.Am I reading too much into this? I would say not. If it were purely a humorous book, then yes, you could say that. But Fox is essentially presenting a hypothesis (that she arrived at in the process of writing it), and as such, it is open to peer review - though I don't think I can really call myself her peer. She seems to represent a higher class than I do. Should you read it? That's a tough one. It will give you some insight into the behaviour of English people, but it would be more interesting if it stuck to observations and left out the analysis. It's just too long and repetitive to really be compelling. And despite it's length, there's a surprising lack of depth - the conclusion at the end of each section, essentially just agrees with the conclusion at the end of the previous section, so you feel like you're being forced to read two redundant extra pages every time you finish a chapter. It reads, overall like a compendium of blog posts, and perhaps would have been best in that media. So... I'm going to say no. It just isn't as much fun as it should be."

181,0340752122,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5150069-robert,5,"In my view, a brilliant skewering of English culture and society. Unforntunately, as an Englishman I rather felt the prick of that skewer. So often during the reading of Fox's book I commented to my wife (one of those obnoxious American's mentioned throughout) that she absolutely had to read the book to understand me: it's not me that's weird, it's simply that I'm English. To be fair - I gave the book 5 stars, in large part because it resonated so strongly with me. However, it does drag a bit in places and could have done with being perhaps 2/3 it actual length. "
182,0340752122,http://goodreads.com/user/show/17423186-dagmar-belesova,2,"It started out well, and some of the observations were not only very true but also described in a hilarious manner. However, as the author has about three points that she keeps repeating to show how they relate to any social situation, it quickly becomes repetitive. It also doesn't help that the author's ego gets it the way and it turns into a guide of how to become upper (middle) class, as written by an upper middle class female (as she reminds us at every opportunity). I e eventually gave up after about 100 pages."

208,0340752122,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5878530-passive-apathetic,0,"At some point I dropped quoting since there were too many passages to quote. Simply hilarious.""Size, we sniffily point out, isn’t everything, and the English weather requires an appreciation of subtle changes and understated nuances, rather than a vulgar obsession with mere volume and magnitude.Indeed, the weather may be one of the few things about which the English are still unselfconsciously and unashamedly patriotic. During my participant-observation research on Englishness, which naturally involved many conversations about the weather, I came across this prickly defensiveness about our weather again and again,among people of all classes and social backgrounds. Contempt for American size-fixation was widespread – one outspoken informant (a publican) expressed the feelings of many when he told me: ‘Oh, with Americans it’s always “mine’s bigger than yours”, with the weather or anything else. They’re so crass. Bigger steaks, bigger buildings, bigger snowstorms, more heat, more hurricanes, whatever. No fucking subtlety, that’s their problem.’Jeremy Paxman, rather more elegantly, but equally patriotically, dismisses all Bill Bryson’s monsoons, ragingblizzards, tornadoes and hailstorms as ‘histrionics’. A very English put-down."" (p. 15)-------------""The ‘brash American’ approach: ‘Hi, I’m Bill from Iowa,’ particularly if accompanied by an outstretched hand and beaming smile, makes the English wince and cringe. The American tourists and visitors I spoke to during my research had been both baffled and hurt by this reaction. ‘I just don’t get it,’ said one woman. ‘You say your name and they sort of wrinkle their noses, like you’ve told them something a bit too personal and embarrassing.’‘That’s right,’ her husband added. ‘And then they give you this tight little smile and say “Hello” – kind of pointedly not giving their name, to let you know you’ve made this big social booboo. What the hell is so private about a person’s name, for God’s sake?’I ended up explaining, as kindly as I could, that the English do not want to know your name, or tell you theirs, until a much greater degree of intimacy has been established – like maybe when you marry their daughter. Rather than giving your name, I suggested, you should strike up a conversation by making a vaguely interrogative comment about the weather (or the party or pub or wherever you happen to be). This must not be done too loudly, and the tone should be light and informal, not earnest or intense. The object is to ‘drift’ casually into conversation, as though by accident. Even if the other person seems happy enough to chat, it is still customary to curb any urges to introduce yourself.Eventually, there may be an opportunity to exchange names, providing this can be achieved in a casual, unforced manner, although it is always best to wait for the other person to take the initiative. Should you reach the end of a long, friendly evening without having introduced yourself, you may say, on parting, ‘Goodbye, nice to meet you, er, oh – I didn’t catch your name?’ as though you have only just noticed the omission. Your new acquaintance should then divulge his or her name, and you may now, at last, introduce yourself – but in an offhand way, as though it is not a matter of any importance: ‘I’m Bill, by the way.’One perceptive Dutch tourist, after listening attentively to my explanation of this procedure, commented: ‘Oh, I see. It is like Alice Through the Looking Glass: you do everything the wrong way round.’ I had not thought of recommending Alice as a guide to English etiquette, but on reflection it seems like quite a good idea."" (p.18)------------------Formality is embarrassing. But then, informality is embarrassing. Everything is embarrassing.The Embarrassment RuleIn fact, the only rule one can identify with any certainty in all this confusion over introductions and greetings is that, to be impeccably English, one must perform these rituals badly. One must appear self-conscious, ill-atease, stiff, awkward and, above all, embarrassed. Smoothness, glibness and confidence are inappropriate and un-English. Hesitation, dithering and ineptness are, surprising as it may seem, correct behaviour. Introductions should be performed as hurriedly as possible, but also with maximum inefficiency. If disclosed at all, names must be mumbled; hands should be tentatively half-proffered and then clumsily withdrawn; the approved greeting is something like ‘Er, how, um, plstm-, er, hello?’If you are socially skilled, or come from a country where these matters are handled in a more reasonable, straightforward manner (such as anywhere else on the planet), you may need a bit of practice to achieve the required degree of embarrassed, stilted incompetence. (p.19)-------------------""The guessing-game rituals allow us, eventually, to elicit this kind of rudimentary census-form information, but the English privacy rules ensure that any more interesting details about our lives and relationships are reserved for close friends and family. This is ‘privileged’ information, not to be bandied about indiscriminately. The English take a certain pride in this trait, and sneer at the stereotyped Americans who ‘tell you all about their divorce, their hysterectomy and their therapist within five minutes of meeting you’. This cliché, although not entirely without foundation, probably tells us more about the English and our privacy rules than it does about the Americans."" (p.20)--------------Seriousness is acceptable, solemnity is prohibited. Sincerity is allowed, earnestness is strictly forbidden. Pomposity and self-importance are outlawed. Serious matters can be spoken of seriously, but one must never take oneself too seriously. The ability to laugh at ourselves, although it may be rooted in a form of arrogance, is one of the more endearing characteristics of the English. (At least, I hope I am right about this: if I have overestimated our ability to laugh at ourselves, this book will be rather unpopular.) To take a deliberately extreme example, the kind of hand-on-heart, gushing earnestness and pompous, Biblethumping solemnity favoured by almost all American politicians would never win a single vote in this country – we watch these speeches on our news programmes with a kind of smugly detached amusement, wondering how the cheering crowds can possibly be so credulous as to fall for this sort of nonsense. When we are not feeling smugly amused, we are cringing with vicarious embarrassment: how can these politicians bring themselves to utter such shamefully earnest platitudes, in such ludicrously solemn tones? We expect politicians to speak largely in platitudes, of course – ours are no different in this respect – it is the earnestness that makes us wince. The same goes for the gushy, tearful acceptance speeches of American actors at the Oscars and other awards ceremonies, to which English television viewers across the country all respond with the same finger-down-throat ‘I’m going to be sick’ gesture. You will rarely see English Oscar-winners indulging in these heart-on-sleeve displays – their speeches tend to be either short and dignified or self deprecatingly humorous, and even so they nearly always manage to look uncomfortable and embarrassed. Any English thespian who dares to break these unwritten rules is ridiculed and dismissed as a ‘luvvie’.---------------""The understatement rule means that a debilitating and painful chronic illness must be described as ‘a bit of a nuisance’; a truly horrific experience is ‘well, not exactly what I would have chosen’; a sight of breathtaking beauty is ‘quite pretty’; an outstanding performance or achievement is ‘not bad’; an act of abominable cruelty is ‘not very friendly’, and an unforgivably stupid misjudgement is ‘not very clever’; the Antarctic is ‘rather cold’ and the Sahara ‘a bit too hot for my taste’; and any exceptionally delightful object, person or event, which in other cultures would warrant streams of superlatives, is pretty much covered by ‘nice’, or, if we wish to express more ardent approval, ‘very nice’.""-------------But I would maintain that the armchair cynicism of ‘Oh, come off it!’ is more truly representative of the English psyche than the belligerent activism suggested by ‘I know my rights’. This may be why, as someone once said, the English have satire instead of revolutions.--------------""The understatement is also difficult for foreigners to ‘get’ because it is, in effect, an in-joke about our own unwritten rules of humour. When we describe, say, a horrendous, traumatic and painful experience as ‘not very pleasant’, we are acknowledging the taboo on earnestness and the rules of irony, but at the same making fun of our ludicrously rigid obedience to these codes. We are exercising restraint, but in such an exaggerated manner that we are also (quietly) laughing at ourselves for doing so. We are parodying ourselves. Every understatement is a little private joke about Englishness."" (p.28)"
209,0340752122,http://goodreads.com/user/show/29257231-neil-cake,3,"ah, finished at last. I had thought that this would make a fun book to read before bed, but it really didn't. It was caught, and never really chose, between being anthropological humour and serious academic study, trying to interject humorous anecdotes, while retaining a detached demeanour - which is a problem, because the anecdotes aren't that humourous, and the writer is English. Being English does afford her a special insight, but it also means her own prejudices aren't fully divorced from the study.So what is it? It is presented as a guide to the strangeness of English behaviour, and it tries really hard to that end, breaking down any kind of human interaction you can think of and describing how we do it, and how it accords to the class we are in. Class is a pretty big thing, so there are lot of passages that go, ""if you do this, you are working class. If you do that, upper-working class"", etc, etc. It turns out there are many more classes than most people probably realise - lower-middle, middle-middle, upper-middle, and upper for instance. That might sound amusing, but it gets pretty tiresome, pretty quickly.Apparently class isn't determined by wealth or profession, which traditionally it would be. No, it is determined by what words you use, whether you use coasters, whether you have garden gnomes and whether you display them ironically or not... again, stuff that sounds amusing, but after 416 pages of small type of this stuff, it really isn't amusing. I kept turning to the back to see how many pages were left, and consistently couldn't believe it was taking so long. But, like I say; small type.So, let's continue with some of the problems I have with this book. First, there are a few observations that are inaccurate:1. English people abbreviate ""thank you"" frequently to ""anks"". Now, I'm not saying that no English people do this, but I am English, and I have literally never heard anyone say ""anks"". Maybe in Oxfordshire where the writer lives, but nowhere else I'm aware of. ""Thanks"", ""ta"" and ""cheers"" are much more er... typical - to reference a recurring observation within the text. [Clever].2. Fox reckons it is normal to tip in pubs by ordering your drinks and instructing the barman; ""and one for yourself"". Again, I'm not saying this doesn't happen in certain small villages, but I am 38 and I have literally never done this, nor have I seen it done by anyone outside of a soap opera setting. It is much more common to over pay and say ""keep the change"". And even doing that means the people either side of you will think, ""bellend"".You might think I'm being picky, but I would justify my viewpoint by saying it's all very well to provide examples of behaviour, but to supply behaviour that isn't typical in a ""guide"" format and suggest it is typical behaviour is misleading to anyone who might be relying on the information during a visit.Those are all I can think of right now, so I'll move on to another problem, which is that Fox frequently ascribes patterns of behaviour to English people, which are not uncommon among other societies in the world. Most pressing of these, is the observation that commuters don't tend to talk to each other - in fact, that they can share the same journey with each other for many years without entering into any kind of familiar relationship. This of course, is very true. But I suspect it is true of commuters throughout the world. If it wasn't, the world would be chaos! No one would get on the train because the platform would be locked with people swapping pleasantries with each other every day. You'd have to have another night out at Christmas, this time with your 'commuting friends'.Fox does go on to demonstrate that there are situations in which a commuter will talk to another commuter which, again, is valid, and I don't know under what circumstances commuters in say, New York, would be allowed to speak to each other, but the validity of this doesn't make the previous statement applicable only to the English.Then you've got clubs. Apparently English people join clubs because they don't know how to meet other people, so they have to almost pretend to be interested in something external (say, tennis or astronomy) so that they can make friends. I'd say this is missing the point. People join clubs so that they can meet people who share the same interests - not just so that they can meet people. Though some people probably do join clubs just to meet people. You see that in sitcoms from time to time, but there are clubs in other countries in the world, and presumably people in other countries join clubs for the same reasons as us. I was a member of a whisky club once, but I left because I didn't like hanging out with the people, and preferred to drink whisky on my own.One of my biggest sticking points was the idea that English people, despite their excessive use of pleases and thank yous, are not actually polite. We're only pretending to be polite because our class system so pervades every day affairs that we're actually only trying to make people we consider to be below us feel they're on the same level as us by asking the bus driver for a ticket ""please"". Even if that were the case, that would still be fairly polite. However, my opposition to this is that I don't consider anyone to be below me, and in every day life, I am often required to interact with people who, regardless of perception, are on the same level - and I still say please and thank you to excess. ""Manners cost nothing"", people say, and that's because they don't, they are nice, and people like to hear other people saying please and thank you. Finally, a more topical point: the English notion of fair play. Yes, I do believe in fair play, but I would suggest that the very class system Fox writes so extensively about, suggests that the upper classes don't...There was an interesting passage about how terrible we are at saying goodbye. This, again, is true. It goes on to say that we indoctrinate our children into this at a very young age, teaching them to say ""bye"" over and over again, and wave until visitors have passed out of sight. I didn't realise we were teaching our children this. I just thought kids loved to say goodbye. We are terrible at taking our leave, but I still think kids love saying goodbye and waving.So anyway, I wouldn't normally focus on as many negatives as I can think of (or maybe I would), but I found these particular negatives pretty annoying. In the interest of fairness though, Fox gets much of the rest of it right - or at least right enough that I can't confidently dispute it. She makes many, many observations about our behaviour that are definitely things I've seen or can relate to, or even that describe me - like the passive aggressive way you react when it looks like someone is going to queue jump. This social ""dis-ease"" thing that she keeps going on about; I can relate to that, but I don't think all English people can be said to struggle in social situations - the ones who join clubs for example; joining a club means you regularly and voluntarily put yourself in an awkward social situation. You just wouldn't do that if you found the whole thing difficult. And is it the case that all Spaniards, for example, are perfectly comfortable all the time? Or does it just not have any effects on their behaviour.Am I reading too much into this? I would say not. If it were purely a humorous book, then yes, you could say that. But Fox is essentially presenting a hypothesis (that she arrived at in the process of writing it), and as such, it is open to peer review - though I don't think I can really call myself her peer. She seems to represent a higher class than I do. Should you read it? That's a tough one. It will give you some insight into the behaviour of English people, but it would be more interesting if it stuck to observations and left out the analysis. It's just too long and repetitive to really be compelling. And despite it's length, there's a surprising lack of depth - the conclusion at the end of each section, essentially just agrees with the conclusion at the end of the previous section, so you feel like you're being forced to read two redundant extra pages every time you finish a chapter. It reads, overall like a compendium of blog posts, and perhaps would have been best in that media. So... I'm going to say no. It just isn't as much fun as it should be."
210,0340752122,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4743253-katy-irving,5,"A book I've read and re-read and recommended to friends intending to stay in England for any long period of time; I first read this after 6 months in London and it shed so much light on the English people I had met and why they acted the way they did; Kate Fox approaches her own people (the English) as a social anthropologist and reviews them with the trademark English wit and humor - it's a thoroughly enjoyable read! Although if you're English, beware, my husband says it felt like getting a progress report and can sting sometimes!"
211,0340752122,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5150069-robert,5,"In my view, a brilliant skewering of English culture and society. Unforntunately, as an Englishman I rather felt the prick of that skewer. So often during the reading of Fox's book I commented to my wife (one of those obnoxious American's mentioned throughout) that she absolutely had to read the book to understand me: it's not me that's weird, it's simply that I'm English. To be fair - I gave the book 5 stars, in large part because it resonated so strongly with me. However, it does drag a bit in places and could have done with being perhaps 2/3 it actual length. "
212,0340752122,http://goodreads.com/user/show/17423186-dagmar-belesova,2,"It started out well, and some of the observations were not only very true but also described in a hilarious manner. However, as the author has about three points that she keeps repeating to show how they relate to any social situation, it quickly becomes repetitive. It also doesn't help that the author's ego gets it the way and it turns into a guide of how to become upper (middle) class, as written by an upper middle class female (as she reminds us at every opportunity). I e eventually gave up after about 100 pages."
213,0340752122,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3971785-asmaa-kamel,5,"A brilliant book! and indeed made me laugh out loud several times. It's interesting to read while experiencing England for the first time, however, it made me a bit oppessive about how people behave trying to test the theories suggested in the book! It will definetly help you better understand the English but don't be too ""earnest"" about it and take every interpretation of the English behaviour as a fact :)Finally, if you're not a native English speaker like myself, you'll have to look up a lot of adjectives! "
214,0340752122,http://goodreads.com/user/show/50896493-sandra,5,"I think I have to give this 5 stars: it is entertaining and audacious and for me, being fairly glued to a non fiction text is quite unusual. It was laugh out loud in many places, but still serious enough to get me reflecting on the topic and my own behaviour and tics as well as the behaviour of those around me. A couple of missed opportunities for updating in the latest edition and a bit of confusion (for me) about our island race when she is very specifically referring to the English. I loved it though! "

I, as an honorary Brit, recognised most of the aspects and recognised them with amusement and sometimes plain laughter. But that could be a typical reaction, because the middle name of the English is humour. As Kate Fox writes: when in doubt, joke. Or impersonate Eeyore. After reading this book I became aware that I am more English (in behaviour) than I thought I was and I don't think that's a bad thing. "

Well, it was in a way - the book presents some peculiar aspects of English behaviour. But, in the last chapters, I was skimming though the pages, eager to finish it!

Quite extraordinary how the writer could draw the same conclusions out of everything. It got me quite ill disposed by the end and I started disliking the English. I think that's mainly because I started drawing my own ill favoured conclusions to counterbalance hers."
220,0340752122,http://goodreads.com/user/show/221920-kristin,4,I found this book to be both entertaining and - as I'm not English - very informative. I think it's highly likely that the 'English' would find it even more entertaining than me.

But so many of the things that she describes as particularly English seemed..... awfully universal. As in, descriptive of typical Americans. So that made it kind of hard to enjoy it.

Simply hilarious.""Size, we sniffily point out, isn’t everything, and the English weather requires an appreciation of subtle changes and understated nuances, rather than a vulgar obsession with mere volume and magnitude.Indeed, the weather may be one of the few things about which the English are still unselfconsciously and unashamedly patriotic. During my participant-observation research on Englishness, which naturally involved many conversations about the weather, I came across this prickly defensiveness about our weather again and again,among people of all classes and social backgrounds. Contempt for American size-fixation was widespread – one outspoken informant (a publican) expressed the feelings of many when he told me: ‘Oh, with Americans it’s always “mine’s bigger than yours”, with the weather or anything else. They’re so crass. Bigger steaks, bigger buildings, bigger snowstorms, more heat, more hurricanes, whatever. No fucking subtlety, that’s their problem.’Jeremy Paxman, rather more elegantly, but equally patriotically, dismisses all Bill Bryson’s monsoons, ragingblizzards, tornadoes and hailstorms as ‘histrionics’. A very English put-down."" (p. 15)-------------""The ‘brash American’ approach: ‘Hi, I’m Bill from Iowa,’ particularly if accompanied by an outstretched hand and beaming smile, makes the English wince and cringe. The American tourists and visitors I spoke to during my research had been both baffled and hurt by this reaction. ‘I just don’t get it,’ said one woman. ‘You say your name and they sort of wrinkle their noses, like you’ve told them something a bit too personal and embarrassing.’‘That’s right,’ her husband added. ‘And then they give you this tight little smile and say “Hello” – kind of pointedly not giving their name, to let you know you’ve made this big social booboo. What the hell is so private about a person’s name, for God’s sake?’I ended up explaining, as kindly as I could, that the English do not want to know your name, or tell you theirs, until a much greater degree of intimacy has been established – like maybe when you marry their daughter. Rather than giving your name, I suggested, you should strike up a conversation by making a vaguely interrogative comment about the weather (or the party or pub or wherever you happen to be). This must not be done too loudly, and the tone should be light and informal, not earnest or intense. The object is to ‘drift’ casually into conversation, as though by accident. Even if the other person seems happy enough to chat, it is still customary to curb any urges to introduce yourself.Eventually, there may be an opportunity to exchange names, providing this can be achieved in a casual, unforced manner, although it is always best to wait for the other person to take the initiative. Should you reach the end of a long, friendly evening without having introduced yourself, you may say, on parting, ‘Goodbye, nice to meet you, er, oh – I didn’t catch your name?’ as though you have only just noticed the omission. Your new acquaintance should then divulge his or her name, and you may now, at last, introduce yourself – but in an offhand way, as though it is not a matter of any importance: ‘I’m Bill, by the way.’One perceptive Dutch tourist, after listening attentively to my explanation of this procedure, commented: ‘Oh, I see. It is like Alice Through the Looking Glass: you do everything the wrong way round.’ I had not thought of recommending Alice as a guide to English etiquette, but on reflection it seems like quite a good idea."" (p.18)------------------Formality is embarrassing. But then, informality is embarrassing. Everything is embarrassing.The Embarrassment RuleIn fact, the only rule one can identify with any certainty in all this confusion over introductions and greetings is that, to be impeccably English, one must perform these rituals badly. One must appear self-conscious, ill-atease, stiff, awkward and, above all, embarrassed. Smoothness, glibness and confidence are inappropriate and un-English. Hesitation, dithering and ineptness are, surprising as it may seem, correct behaviour. Introductions should be performed as hurriedly as possible, but also with maximum inefficiency. If disclosed at all, names must be mumbled; hands should be tentatively half-proffered and then clumsily withdrawn; the approved greeting is something like ‘Er, how, um, plstm-, er, hello?’If you are socially skilled, or come from a country where these matters are handled in a more reasonable, straightforward manner (such as anywhere else on the planet), you may need a bit of practice to achieve the required degree of embarrassed, stilted incompetence. (p.19)-------------------""The guessing-game rituals allow us, eventually, to elicit this kind of rudimentary census-form information, but the English privacy rules ensure that any more interesting details about our lives and relationships are reserved for close friends and family. This is ‘privileged’ information, not to be bandied about indiscriminately. The English take a certain pride in this trait, and sneer at the stereotyped Americans who ‘tell you all about their divorce, their hysterectomy and their therapist within five minutes of meeting you’. This cliché, although not entirely without foundation, probably tells us more about the English and our privacy rules than it does about the Americans."" (p.20)--------------Seriousness is acceptable, solemnity is prohibited. Sincerity is allowed, earnestness is strictly forbidden. Pomposity and self-importance are outlawed. Serious matters can be spoken of seriously, but one must never take oneself too seriously. The ability to laugh at ourselves, although it may be rooted in a form of arrogance, is one of the more endearing characteristics of the English. (At least, I hope I am right about this: if I have overestimated our ability to laugh at ourselves, this book will be rather unpopular.) To take a deliberately extreme example, the kind of hand-on-heart, gushing earnestness and pompous, Biblethumping solemnity favoured by almost all American politicians would never win a single vote in this country – we watch these speeches on our news programmes with a kind of smugly detached amusement, wondering how the cheering crowds can possibly be so credulous as to fall for this sort of nonsense. When we are not feeling smugly amused, we are cringing with vicarious embarrassment: how can these politicians bring themselves to utter such shamefully earnest platitudes, in such ludicrously solemn tones? We expect politicians to speak largely in platitudes, of course – ours are no different in this respect – it is the earnestness that makes us wince. The same goes for the gushy, tearful acceptance speeches of American actors at the Oscars and other awards ceremonies, to which English television viewers across the country all respond with the same finger-down-throat ‘I’m going to be sick’ gesture. You will rarely see English Oscar-winners indulging in these heart-on-sleeve displays – their speeches tend to be either short and dignified or self deprecatingly humorous, and even so they nearly always manage to look uncomfortable and embarrassed. Any English thespian who dares to break these unwritten rules is ridiculed and dismissed as a ‘luvvie’.---------------""The understatement rule means that a debilitating and painful chronic illness must be described as ‘a bit of a nuisance’; a truly horrific experience is ‘well, not exactly what I would have chosen’; a sight of breathtaking beauty is ‘quite pretty’; an outstanding performance or achievement is ‘not bad’; an act of abominable cruelty is ‘not very friendly’, and an unforgivably stupid misjudgement is ‘not very clever’; the Antarctic is ‘rather cold’ and the Sahara ‘a bit too hot for my taste’; and any exceptionally delightful object, person or event, which in other cultures would warrant streams of superlatives, is pretty much covered by ‘nice’, or, if we wish to express more ardent approval, ‘very nice’.""-------------But I would maintain that the armchair cynicism of ‘Oh, come off it!’ is more truly representative of the English psyche than the belligerent activism suggested by ‘I know my rights’. This may be why, as someone once said, the English have satire instead of revolutions.--------------""The understatement is also difficult for foreigners to ‘get’ because it is, in effect, an in-joke about our own unwritten rules of humour. When we describe, say, a horrendous, traumatic and painful experience as ‘not very pleasant’, we are acknowledging the taboo on earnestness and the rules of irony, but at the same making fun of our ludicrously rigid obedience to these codes. We are exercising restraint, but in such an exaggerated manner that we are also (quietly) laughing at ourselves for doing so. We are parodying ourselves. Every understatement is a little private joke about Englishness."" (p.28)"
239,0340752122,http://goodreads.com/user/show/29257231-neil-cake,3,"ah, finished at last. I had thought that this would make a fun book to read before bed, but it really didn't. It was caught, and never really chose, between being anthropological humour and serious academic study, trying to interject humorous anecdotes, while retaining a detached demeanour - which is a problem, because the anecdotes aren't that humourous, and the writer is English. Being English does afford her a special insight, but it also means her own prejudices aren't fully divorced from the study.So what is it? It is presented as a guide to the strangeness of English behaviour, and it tries really hard to that end, breaking down any kind of human interaction you can think of and describing how we do it, and how it accords to the class we are in. Class is a pretty big thing, so there are lot of passages that go, ""if you do this, you are working class. If you do that, upper-working class"", etc, etc. It turns out there are many more classes than most people probably realise - lower-middle, middle-middle, upper-middle, and upper for instance. That might sound amusing, but it gets pretty tiresome, pretty quickly.Apparently class isn't determined by wealth or profession, which traditionally it would be. No, it is determined by what words you use, whether you use coasters, whether you have garden gnomes and whether you display them ironically or not... again, stuff that sounds amusing, but after 416 pages of small type of this stuff, it really isn't amusing. I kept turning to the back to see how many pages were left, and consistently couldn't believe it was taking so long. But, like I say; small type.So, let's continue with some of the problems I have with this book. First, there are a few observations that are inaccurate:1. English people abbreviate ""thank you"" frequently to ""anks"". Now, I'm not saying that no English people do this, but I am English, and I have literally never heard anyone say ""anks"". Maybe in Oxfordshire where the writer lives, but nowhere else I'm aware of. ""Thanks"", ""ta"" and ""cheers"" are much more er... typical - to reference a recurring observation within the text. [Clever].2. Fox reckons it is normal to tip in pubs by ordering your drinks and instructing the barman; ""and one for yourself"". Again, I'm not saying this doesn't happen in certain small villages, but I am 38 and I have literally never done this, nor have I seen it done by anyone outside of a soap opera setting. It is much more common to over pay and say ""keep the change"". And even doing that means the people either side of you will think, ""bellend"".You might think I'm being picky, but I would justify my viewpoint by saying it's all very well to provide examples of behaviour, but to supply behaviour that isn't typical in a ""guide"" format and suggest it is typical behaviour is misleading to anyone who might be relying on the information during a visit.Those are all I can think of right now, so I'll move on to another problem, which is that Fox frequently ascribes patterns of behaviour to English people, which are not uncommon among other societies in the world. Most pressing of these, is the observation that commuters don't tend to talk to each other - in fact, that they can share the same journey with each other for many years without entering into any kind of familiar relationship. This of course, is very true. But I suspect it is true of commuters throughout the world. If it wasn't, the world would be chaos! No one would get on the train because the platform would be locked with people swapping pleasantries with each other every day. You'd have to have another night out at Christmas, this time with your 'commuting friends'.Fox does go on to demonstrate that there are situations in which a commuter will talk to another commuter which, again, is valid, and I don't know under what circumstances commuters in say, New York, would be allowed to speak to each other, but the validity of this doesn't make the previous statement applicable only to the English.Then you've got clubs. Apparently English people join clubs because they don't know how to meet other people, so they have to almost pretend to be interested in something external (say, tennis or astronomy) so that they can make friends. I'd say this is missing the point. People join clubs so that they can meet people who share the same interests - not just so that they can meet people. Though some people probably do join clubs just to meet people. You see that in sitcoms from time to time, but there are clubs in other countries in the world, and presumably people in other countries join clubs for the same reasons as us. I was a member of a whisky club once, but I left because I didn't like hanging out with the people, and preferred to drink whisky on my own.One of my biggest sticking points was the idea that English people, despite their excessive use of pleases and thank yous, are not actually polite. We're only pretending to be polite because our class system so pervades every day affairs that we're actually only trying to make people we consider to be below us feel they're on the same level as us by asking the bus driver for a ticket ""please"". Even if that were the case, that would still be fairly polite. However, my opposition to this is that I don't consider anyone to be below me, and in every day life, I am often required to interact with people who, regardless of perception, are on the same level - and I still say please and thank you to excess. ""Manners cost nothing"", people say, and that's because they don't, they are nice, and people like to hear other people saying please and thank you. Finally, a more topical point: the English notion of fair play. Yes, I do believe in fair play, but I would suggest that the very class system Fox writes so extensively about, suggests that the upper classes don't...There was an interesting passage about how terrible we are at saying goodbye. This, again, is true. It goes on to say that we indoctrinate our children into this at a very young age, teaching them to say ""bye"" over and over again, and wave until visitors have passed out of sight. I didn't realise we were teaching our children this. I just thought kids loved to say goodbye. We are terrible at taking our leave, but I still think kids love saying goodbye and waving.So anyway, I wouldn't normally focus on as many negatives as I can think of (or maybe I would), but I found these particular negatives pretty annoying. In the interest of fairness though, Fox gets much of the rest of it right - or at least right enough that I can't confidently dispute it. She makes many, many observations about our behaviour that are definitely things I've seen or can relate to, or even that describe me - like the passive aggressive way you react when it looks like someone is going to queue jump. This social ""dis-ease"" thing that she keeps going on about; I can relate to that, but I don't think all English people can be said to struggle in social situations - the ones who join clubs for example; joining a club means you regularly and voluntarily put yourself in an awkward social situation. You just wouldn't do that if you found the whole thing difficult. And is it the case that all Spaniards, for example, are perfectly comfortable all the time? Or does it just not have any effects on their behaviour.Am I reading too much into this? I would say not. If it were purely a humorous book, then yes, you could say that. But Fox is essentially presenting a hypothesis (that she arrived at in the process of writing it), and as such, it is open to peer review - though I don't think I can really call myself her peer. She seems to represent a higher class than I do. Should you read it? That's a tough one. It will give you some insight into the behaviour of English people, but it would be more interesting if it stuck to observations and left out the analysis. It's just too long and repetitive to really be compelling. And despite it's length, there's a surprising lack of depth - the conclusion at the end of each section, essentially just agrees with the conclusion at the end of the previous section, so you feel like you're being forced to read two redundant extra pages every time you finish a chapter. It reads, overall like a compendium of blog posts, and perhaps would have been best in that media. So... I'm going to say no. It just isn't as much fun as it should be."

To be fair - I gave the book 5 stars, in large part because it resonated so strongly with me. However, it does drag a bit in places and could have done with being perhaps 2/3 it actual length. "

However, as the author has about three points that she keeps repeating to show how they relate to any social situation, it quickly becomes repetitive. It also doesn't help that the author's ego gets it the way and it turns into a guide of how to become upper (middle) class, as written by an upper middle class female (as she reminds us at every opportunity).

Everything is embarrassing.The Embarrassment RuleIn fact, the only rule one can identify with any certainty in all this confusion over introductions and greetings is that, to be impeccably English, one must perform these rituals badly. One must appear self-conscious, ill-atease, stiff, awkward and, above all, embarrassed. Smoothness, glibness and confidence are inappropriate and un-English. Hesitation, dithering and ineptness are, surprising as it may seem, correct behaviour. Introductions should be performed as hurriedly as possible, but also with maximum inefficiency. If disclosed at all, names must be mumbled; hands should be tentatively half-proffered and then clumsily withdrawn; the approved greeting is something like ‘Er, how, um, plstm-, er, hello?’If you are socially skilled, or come from a country where these matters are handled in a more reasonable, straightforward manner (such as anywhere else on the planet), you may need a bit of practice to achieve the required degree of embarrassed, stilted incompetence. (p.19)-------------------""The guessing-game rituals allow us, eventually, to elicit this kind of rudimentary census-form information, but the English privacy rules ensure that any more interesting details about our lives and relationships are reserved for close friends and family. This is ‘privileged’ information, not to be bandied about indiscriminately. The English take a certain pride in this trait, and sneer at the stereotyped Americans who ‘tell you all about their divorce, their hysterectomy and their therapist within five minutes of meeting you’. This cliché, although not entirely without foundation, probably tells us more about the English and our privacy rules than it does about the Americans."" (p.20)--------------Seriousness is acceptable, solemnity is prohibited. Sincerity is allowed, earnestness is strictly forbidden. Pomposity and self-importance are outlawed. Serious matters can be spoken of seriously, but one must never take oneself too seriously. The ability to laugh at ourselves, although it may be rooted in a form of arrogance, is one of the more endearing characteristics of the English. (At least, I hope I am right about this: if I have overestimated our ability to laugh at ourselves, this book will be rather unpopular.) To take a deliberately extreme example, the kind of hand-on-heart, gushing earnestness and pompous, Biblethumping solemnity favoured by almost all American politicians would never win a single vote in this country – we watch these speeches on our news programmes with a kind of smugly detached amusement, wondering how the cheering crowds can possibly be so credulous as to fall for this sort of nonsense. When we are not feeling smugly amused, we are cringing with vicarious embarrassment: how can these politicians bring themselves to utter such shamefully earnest platitudes, in such ludicrously solemn tones? We expect politicians to speak largely in platitudes, of course – ours are no different in this respect – it is the earnestness that makes us wince. The same goes for the gushy, tearful acceptance speeches of American actors at the Oscars and other awards ceremonies, to which English television viewers across the country all respond with the same finger-down-throat ‘I’m going to be sick’ gesture. You will rarely see English Oscar-winners indulging in these heart-on-sleeve displays – their speeches tend to be either short and dignified or self deprecatingly humorous, and even so they nearly always manage to look uncomfortable and embarrassed. Any English thespian who dares to break these unwritten rules is ridiculed and dismissed as a ‘luvvie’.---------------""The understatement rule means that a debilitating and painful chronic illness must be described as ‘a bit of a nuisance’; a truly horrific experience is ‘well, not exactly what I would have chosen’; a sight of breathtaking beauty is ‘quite pretty’; an outstanding performance or achievement is ‘not bad’; an act of abominable cruelty is ‘not very friendly’, and an unforgivably stupid misjudgement is ‘not very clever’; the Antarctic is ‘rather cold’ and the Sahara ‘a bit too hot for my taste’; and any exceptionally delightful object, person or event, which in other cultures would warrant streams of superlatives, is pretty much covered by ‘nice’, or, if we wish to express more ardent approval, ‘very nice’.""-------------But I would maintain that the armchair cynicism of ‘Oh, come off it!’ is more truly representative of the English psyche than the belligerent activism suggested by ‘I know my rights’. This may be why, as someone once said, the English have satire instead of revolutions.--------------""The understatement is also difficult for foreigners to ‘get’ because it is, in effect, an in-joke about our own unwritten rules of humour. When we describe, say, a horrendous, traumatic and painful experience as ‘not very pleasant’, we are acknowledging the taboo on earnestness and the rules of irony, but at the same making fun of our ludicrously rigid obedience to these codes. We are exercising restraint, but in such an exaggerated manner that we are also (quietly) laughing at ourselves for doing so. We are parodying ourselves. Every understatement is a little private joke about Englishness."" (p.28)"
269,0340752122,http://goodreads.com/user/show/29257231-neil-cake,3,"ah, finished at last. I had thought that this would make a fun book to read before bed, but it really didn't. It was caught, and never really chose, between being anthropological humour and serious academic study, trying to interject humorous anecdotes, while retaining a detached demeanour - which is a problem, because the anecdotes aren't that humourous, and the writer is English. Being English does afford her a special insight, but it also means her own prejudices aren't fully divorced from the study.So what is it? It is presented as a guide to the strangeness of English behaviour, and it tries really hard to that end, breaking down any kind of human interaction you can think of and describing how we do it, and how it accords to the class we are in. Class is a pretty big thing, so there are lot of passages that go, ""if you do this, you are working class. If you do that, upper-working class"", etc, etc. It turns out there are many more classes than most people probably realise - lower-middle, middle-middle, upper-middle, and upper for instance. That might sound amusing, but it gets pretty tiresome, pretty quickly.Apparently class isn't determined by wealth or profession, which traditionally it would be. No, it is determined by what words you use, whether you use coasters, whether you have garden gnomes and whether you display them ironically or not... again, stuff that sounds amusing, but after 416 pages of small type of this stuff, it really isn't amusing. I kept turning to the back to see how many pages were left, and consistently couldn't believe it was taking so long. But, like I say; small type.So, let's continue with some of the problems I have with this book. First, there are a few observations that are inaccurate:1. English people abbreviate ""thank you"" frequently to ""anks"". Now, I'm not saying that no English people do this, but I am English, and I have literally never heard anyone say ""anks"". Maybe in Oxfordshire where the writer lives, but nowhere else I'm aware of. ""Thanks"", ""ta"" and ""cheers"" are much more er... typical - to reference a recurring observation within the text. [Clever].2. Fox reckons it is normal to tip in pubs by ordering your drinks and instructing the barman; ""and one for yourself"". Again, I'm not saying this doesn't happen in certain small villages, but I am 38 and I have literally never done this, nor have I seen it done by anyone outside of a soap opera setting. It is much more common to over pay and say ""keep the change"". And even doing that means the people either side of you will think, ""bellend"".You might think I'm being picky, but I would justify my viewpoint by saying it's all very well to provide examples of behaviour, but to supply behaviour that isn't typical in a ""guide"" format and suggest it is typical behaviour is misleading to anyone who might be relying on the information during a visit.Those are all I can think of right now, so I'll move on to another problem, which is that Fox frequently ascribes patterns of behaviour to English people, which are not uncommon among other societies in the world. Most pressing of these, is the observation that commuters don't tend to talk to each other - in fact, that they can share the same journey with each other for many years without entering into any kind of familiar relationship. This of course, is very true. But I suspect it is true of commuters throughout the world. If it wasn't, the world would be chaos! No one would get on the train because the platform would be locked with people swapping pleasantries with each other every day. You'd have to have another night out at Christmas, this time with your 'commuting friends'.Fox does go on to demonstrate that there are situations in which a commuter will talk to another commuter which, again, is valid, and I don't know under what circumstances commuters in say, New York, would be allowed to speak to each other, but the validity of this doesn't make the previous statement applicable only to the English.Then you've got clubs. Apparently English people join clubs because they don't know how to meet other people, so they have to almost pretend to be interested in something external (say, tennis or astronomy) so that they can make friends. I'd say this is missing the point. People join clubs so that they can meet people who share the same interests - not just so that they can meet people. Though some people probably do join clubs just to meet people. You see that in sitcoms from time to time, but there are clubs in other countries in the world, and presumably people in other countries join clubs for the same reasons as us. I was a member of a whisky club once, but I left because I didn't like hanging out with the people, and preferred to drink whisky on my own.One of my biggest sticking points was the idea that English people, despite their excessive use of pleases and thank yous, are not actually polite. We're only pretending to be polite because our class system so pervades every day affairs that we're actually only trying to make people we consider to be below us feel they're on the same level as us by asking the bus driver for a ticket ""please"". Even if that were the case, that would still be fairly polite. However, my opposition to this is that I don't consider anyone to be below me, and in every day life, I am often required to interact with people who, regardless of perception, are on the same level - and I still say please and thank you to excess. ""Manners cost nothing"", people say, and that's because they don't, they are nice, and people like to hear other people saying please and thank you. Finally, a more topical point: the English notion of fair play. Yes, I do believe in fair play, but I would suggest that the very class system Fox writes so extensively about, suggests that the upper classes don't...There was an interesting passage about how terrible we are at saying goodbye. This, again, is true. It goes on to say that we indoctrinate our children into this at a very young age, teaching them to say ""bye"" over and over again, and wave until visitors have passed out of sight. I didn't realise we were teaching our children this. I just thought kids loved to say goodbye. We are terrible at taking our leave, but I still think kids love saying goodbye and waving.So anyway, I wouldn't normally focus on as many negatives as I can think of (or maybe I would), but I found these particular negatives pretty annoying. In the interest of fairness though, Fox gets much of the rest of it right - or at least right enough that I can't confidently dispute it. She makes many, many observations about our behaviour that are definitely things I've seen or can relate to, or even that describe me - like the passive aggressive way you react when it looks like someone is going to queue jump. This social ""dis-ease"" thing that she keeps going on about; I can relate to that, but I don't think all English people can be said to struggle in social situations - the ones who join clubs for example; joining a club means you regularly and voluntarily put yourself in an awkward social situation. You just wouldn't do that if you found the whole thing difficult. And is it the case that all Spaniards, for example, are perfectly comfortable all the time? Or does it just not have any effects on their behaviour.Am I reading too much into this? I would say not. If it were purely a humorous book, then yes, you could say that. But Fox is essentially presenting a hypothesis (that she arrived at in the process of writing it), and as such, it is open to peer review - though I don't think I can really call myself her peer. She seems to represent a higher class than I do. Should you read it? That's a tough one. It will give you some insight into the behaviour of English people, but it would be more interesting if it stuck to observations and left out the analysis. It's just too long and repetitive to really be compelling. And despite it's length, there's a surprising lack of depth - the conclusion at the end of each section, essentially just agrees with the conclusion at the end of the previous section, so you feel like you're being forced to read two redundant extra pages every time you finish a chapter. It reads, overall like a compendium of blog posts, and perhaps would have been best in that media. So... I'm going to say no. It just isn't as much fun as it should be."

Unforntunately, as an Englishman I rather felt the prick of that skewer. So often during the reading of Fox's book I commented to my wife (one of those obnoxious American's mentioned throughout) that she absolutely had to read the book to understand me: it's not me that's weird, it's simply that I'm English. To be fair - I gave the book 5 stars, in large part because it resonated so strongly with me. However, it does drag a bit in places and could have done with being perhaps 2/3 it actual length. "

However, as the author has about three points that she keeps repeating to show how they relate to any social situation, it quickly becomes repetitive. It also doesn't help that the author's ego gets it the way and it turns into a guide of how to become upper (middle) class, as written by an upper middle class female (as she reminds us at every opportunity). I e eventually gave up after about 100 pages."

Simply hilarious.""Size, we sniffily point out, isn’t everything, and the English weather requires an appreciation of subtle changes and understated nuances, rather than a vulgar obsession with mere volume and magnitude.Indeed, the weather may be one of the few things about which the English are still unselfconsciously and unashamedly patriotic. During my participant-observation research on Englishness, which naturally involved many conversations about the weather, I came across this prickly defensiveness about our weather again and again,among people of all classes and social backgrounds. Contempt for American size-fixation was widespread – one outspoken informant (a publican) expressed the feelings of many when he told me: ‘Oh, with Americans it’s always “mine’s bigger than yours”, with the weather or anything else. They’re so crass. Bigger steaks, bigger buildings, bigger snowstorms, more heat, more hurricanes, whatever. No fucking subtlety, that’s their problem.’Jeremy Paxman, rather more elegantly, but equally patriotically, dismisses all Bill Bryson’s monsoons, ragingblizzards, tornadoes and hailstorms as ‘histrionics’. A very English put-down."" (p. 15)-------------""The ‘brash American’ approach: ‘Hi, I’m Bill from Iowa,’ particularly if accompanied by an outstretched hand and beaming smile, makes the English wince and cringe. The American tourists and visitors I spoke to during my research had been both baffled and hurt by this reaction. ‘I just don’t get it,’ said one woman. ‘You say your name and they sort of wrinkle their noses, like you’ve told them something a bit too personal and embarrassing.’‘That’s right,’ her husband added. ‘And then they give you this tight little smile and say “Hello” – kind of pointedly not giving their name, to let you know you’ve made this big social booboo. What the hell is so private about a person’s name, for God’s sake?’I ended up explaining, as kindly as I could, that the English do not want to know your name, or tell you theirs, until a much greater degree of intimacy has been established – like maybe when you marry their daughter. Rather than giving your name, I suggested, you should strike up a conversation by making a vaguely interrogative comment about the weather (or the party or pub or wherever you happen to be). This must not be done too loudly, and the tone should be light and informal, not earnest or intense. The object is to ‘drift’ casually into conversation, as though by accident. Even if the other person seems happy enough to chat, it is still customary to curb any urges to introduce yourself.Eventually, there may be an opportunity to exchange names, providing this can be achieved in a casual, unforced manner, although it is always best to wait for the other person to take the initiative. Should you reach the end of a long, friendly evening without having introduced yourself, you may say, on parting, ‘Goodbye, nice to meet you, er, oh – I didn’t catch your name?’ as though you have only just noticed the omission. Your new acquaintance should then divulge his or her name, and you may now, at last, introduce yourself – but in an offhand way, as though it is not a matter of any importance: ‘I’m Bill, by the way.’One perceptive Dutch tourist, after listening attentively to my explanation of this procedure, commented: ‘Oh, I see. It is like Alice Through the Looking Glass: you do everything the wrong way round.’ I had not thought of recommending Alice as a guide to English etiquette, but on reflection it seems like quite a good idea."" (p.18)------------------Formality is embarrassing. But then, informality is embarrassing. Everything is embarrassing.The Embarrassment RuleIn fact, the only rule one can identify with any certainty in all this confusion over introductions and greetings is that, to be impeccably English, one must perform these rituals badly. One must appear self-conscious, ill-atease, stiff, awkward and, above all, embarrassed. Smoothness, glibness and confidence are inappropriate and un-English. Hesitation, dithering and ineptness are, surprising as it may seem, correct behaviour. Introductions should be performed as hurriedly as possible, but also with maximum inefficiency. If disclosed at all, names must be mumbled; hands should be tentatively half-proffered and then clumsily withdrawn; the approved greeting is something like ‘Er, how, um, plstm-, er, hello?’If you are socially skilled, or come from a country where these matters are handled in a more reasonable, straightforward manner (such as anywhere else on the planet), you may need a bit of practice to achieve the required degree of embarrassed, stilted incompetence.

The English take a certain pride in this trait, and sneer at the stereotyped Americans who ‘tell you all about their divorce, their hysterectomy and their therapist within five minutes of meeting you’. This cliché, although not entirely without foundation, probably tells us more about the English and our privacy rules than it does about the Americans."" (p.20)--------------Seriousness is acceptable, solemnity is prohibited. Sincerity is allowed, earnestness is strictly forbidden. Pomposity and self-importance are outlawed. Serious matters can be spoken of seriously, but one must never take oneself too seriously. The ability to laugh at ourselves, although it may be rooted in a form of arrogance, is one of the more endearing characteristics of the English. (At least, I hope I am right about this: if I have overestimated our ability to laugh at ourselves, this book will be rather unpopular.) To take a deliberately extreme example, the kind of hand-on-heart, gushing earnestness and pompous, Biblethumping solemnity favoured by almost all American politicians would never win a single vote in this country – we watch these speeches on our news programmes with a kind of smugly detached amusement, wondering how the cheering crowds can possibly be so credulous as to fall for this sort of nonsense. When we are not feeling smugly amused, we are cringing with vicarious embarrassment: how can these politicians bring themselves to utter such shamefully earnest platitudes, in such ludicrously solemn tones? We expect politicians to speak largely in platitudes, of course – ours are no different in this respect – it is the earnestness that makes us wince. The same goes for the gushy, tearful acceptance speeches of American actors at the Oscars and other awards ceremonies, to which English television viewers across the country all respond with the same finger-down-throat ‘I’m going to be sick’ gesture. You will rarely see English Oscar-winners indulging in these heart-on-sleeve displays – their speeches tend to be either short and dignified or self deprecatingly humorous, and even so they nearly always manage to look uncomfortable and embarrassed. Any English thespian who dares to break these unwritten rules is ridiculed and dismissed as a ‘luvvie’.---------------""The understatement rule means that a debilitating and painful chronic illness must be described as ‘a bit of a nuisance’; a truly horrific experience is ‘well, not exactly what I would have chosen’; a sight of breathtaking beauty is ‘quite pretty’; an outstanding performance or achievement is ‘not bad’; an act of abominable cruelty is ‘not very friendly’, and an unforgivably stupid misjudgement is ‘not very clever’; the Antarctic is ‘rather cold’ and the Sahara ‘a bit too hot for my taste’; and any exceptionally delightful object, person or event, which in other cultures would warrant streams of superlatives, is pretty much covered by ‘nice’, or, if we wish to express more ardent approval, ‘very nice’.""-------------But I would maintain that the armchair cynicism of ‘Oh, come off it!’ is more truly representative of the English psyche than the belligerent activism suggested by ‘I know my rights’. This may be why, as someone once said, the English have satire instead of revolutions.--------------""The understatement is also difficult for foreigners to ‘get’ because it is, in effect, an in-joke about our own unwritten rules of humour. When we describe, say, a horrendous, traumatic and painful experience as ‘not very pleasant’, we are acknowledging the taboo on earnestness and the rules of irony, but at the same making fun of our ludicrously rigid obedience to these codes. We are exercising restraint, but in such an exaggerated manner that we are also (quietly) laughing at ourselves for doing so. We are parodying ourselves. Every understatement is a little private joke about Englishness."" (p.28)"

It was caught, and never really chose, between being anthropological humour and serious academic study, trying to interject humorous anecdotes, while retaining a detached demeanour - which is a problem, because the anecdotes aren't that humourous, and the writer is English. Being English does afford her a special insight, but it also means her own prejudices aren't fully divorced from the study.So what is it? It is presented as a guide to the strangeness of English behaviour, and it tries really hard to that end, breaking down any kind of human interaction you can think of and describing how we do it, and how it accords to the class we are in. Class is a pretty big thing, so there are lot of passages that go, ""if you do this, you are working class. If you do that, upper-working class"", etc, etc. It turns out there are many more classes than most people probably realise - lower-middle, middle-middle, upper-middle, and upper for instance. That might sound amusing, but it gets pretty tiresome, pretty quickly.Apparently class isn't determined by wealth or profession, which traditionally it would be. No, it is determined by what words you use, whether you use coasters, whether you have garden gnomes and whether you display them ironically or not... again, stuff that sounds amusing, but after 416 pages of small type of this stuff, it really isn't amusing. I kept turning to the back to see how many pages were left, and consistently couldn't believe it was taking so long. But, like I say; small type.So, let's continue with some of the problems I have with this book. First, there are a few observations that are inaccurate:1. English people abbreviate ""thank you"" frequently to ""anks"". Now, I'm not saying that no English people do this, but I am English, and I have literally never heard anyone say ""anks"". Maybe in Oxfordshire where the writer lives, but nowhere else I'm aware of. ""Thanks"", ""ta"" and ""cheers"" are much more er... typical - to reference a recurring observation within the text. [Clever].2. Fox reckons it is normal to tip in pubs by ordering your drinks and instructing the barman; ""and one for yourself"". Again, I'm not saying this doesn't happen in certain small villages, but I am 38 and I have literally never done this, nor have I seen it done by anyone outside of a soap opera setting. It is much more common to over pay and say ""keep the change"". And even doing that means the people either side of you will think, ""bellend"".You might think I'm being picky, but I would justify my viewpoint by saying it's all very well to provide examples of behaviour, but to supply behaviour that isn't typical in a ""guide"" format and suggest it is typical behaviour is misleading to anyone who might be relying on the information during a visit.Those are all I can think of right now, so I'll move on to another problem, which is that Fox frequently ascribes patterns of behaviour to English people, which are not uncommon among other societies in the world. Most pressing of these, is the observation that commuters don't tend to talk to each other - in fact, that they can share the same journey with each other for many years without entering into any kind of familiar relationship. This of course, is very true. But I suspect it is true of commuters throughout the world. If it wasn't, the world would be chaos! No one would get on the train because the platform would be locked with people swapping pleasantries with each other every day. You'd have to have another night out at Christmas, this time with your 'commuting friends'.Fox does go on to demonstrate that there are situations in which a commuter will talk to another commuter which, again, is valid, and I don't know under what circumstances commuters in say, New York, would be allowed to speak to each other, but the validity of this doesn't make the previous statement applicable only to the English.Then you've got clubs. Apparently English people join clubs because they don't know how to meet other people, so they have to almost pretend to be interested in something external (say, tennis or astronomy) so that they can make friends. I'd say this is missing the point. People join clubs so that they can meet people who share the same interests - not just so that they can meet people. Though some people probably do join clubs just to meet people. You see that in sitcoms from time to time, but there are clubs in other countries in the world, and presumably people in other countries join clubs for the same reasons as us. I was a member of a whisky club once, but I left because I didn't like hanging out with the people, and preferred to drink whisky on my own.One of my biggest sticking points was the idea that English people, despite their excessive use of pleases and thank yous, are not actually polite. We're only pretending to be polite because our class system so pervades every day affairs that we're actually only trying to make people we consider to be below us feel they're on the same level as us by asking the bus driver for a ticket ""please"". Even if that were the case, that would still be fairly polite. However, my opposition to this is that I don't consider anyone to be below me, and in every day life, I am often required to interact with people who, regardless of perception, are on the same level - and I still say please and thank you to excess. ""Manners cost nothing"", people say, and that's because they don't, they are nice, and people like to hear other people saying please and thank you. Finally, a more topical point: the English notion of fair play. Yes, I do believe in fair play, but I would suggest that the very class system Fox writes so extensively about, suggests that the upper classes don't...There was an interesting passage about how terrible we are at saying goodbye. This, again, is true. It goes on to say that we indoctrinate our children into this at a very young age, teaching them to say ""bye"" over and over again, and wave until visitors have passed out of sight. I didn't realise we were teaching our children this. I just thought kids loved to say goodbye. We are terrible at taking our leave, but I still think kids love saying goodbye and waving.So anyway, I wouldn't normally focus on as many negatives as I can think of (or maybe I would), but I found these particular negatives pretty annoying. In the interest of fairness though, Fox gets much of the rest of it right - or at least right enough that I can't confidently dispute it. She makes many, many observations about our behaviour that are definitely things I've seen or can relate to, or even that describe me - like the passive aggressive way you react when it looks like someone is going to queue jump. This social ""dis-ease"" thing that she keeps going on about; I can relate to that, but I don't think all English people can be said to struggle in social situations - the ones who join clubs for example; joining a club means you regularly and voluntarily put yourself in an awkward social situation. You just wouldn't do that if you found the whole thing difficult. And is it the case that all Spaniards, for example, are perfectly comfortable all the time? Or does it just not have any effects on their behaviour.Am I reading too much into this? I would say not. If it were purely a humorous book, then yes, you could say that. But Fox is essentially presenting a hypothesis (that she arrived at in the process of writing it), and as such, it is open to peer review - though I don't think I can really call myself her peer. She seems to represent a higher class than I do. Should you read it? That's a tough one. It will give you some insight into the behaviour of English people, but it would be more interesting if it stuck to observations and left out the analysis. It's just too long and repetitive to really be compelling. And despite it's length, there's a surprising lack of depth - the conclusion at the end of each section, essentially just agrees with the conclusion at the end of the previous section, so you feel like you're being forced to read two redundant extra pages every time you finish a chapter. It reads, overall like a compendium of blog posts, and perhaps would have been best in that media. So... I'm going to say no. It just isn't as much fun as it should be."
