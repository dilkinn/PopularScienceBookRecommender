0,0465013023,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4377693-pvw,2,"Nice booklet about many famous and less famous mathematical problems. Many of the puzzles are rather complicated, so it takes some time to fully grasp them in order to be able to appreciate the solution. This is not a book you easily read through from start to finish. It is more something to have on you shelf, picking it up occasionally to enjoy one or two discusions and then letting it rest for a while.As an introdution to maths for the non-mathematician, Stewart's book is too diverse and doesn't follow a chronological story. A better overview of math's history would be Mathematics: The Science of Patterns."
1,0465013023,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6100646-brian-clegg,4,"This is the second review of a trilogy, I'm reading in entirely the wrong order (book 3, then 1 here, and 2 to follow), so for me, this book is a predecessor to Professor Stewart's Casebook of Mathematical Mysteries. The format is very similar - a collection of factoids, logical puzzles, mathematical expositions and more to entertain any recreational maths enthusiast. I think it works significantly better in this first book of the series because, to be honest, by volume 3 there is probably a bit of barrel scraping going on. Here the topics are fresh and fun.There is arguably something for everyone here, which inversely means that there are probably some bits, depending on your mathematical knowledge and interests, that you will either find too trivial or too heavy going. But the format makes it easy to skip through to the next. I personally most enjoy the logic problems (though a small black mark for featuring a near-identical ""moving the cups"" problem to one in the third book) and, much to my surprise, the geometry, which I suppose took me back to a more innocent time. There were inevitably some entries where there was a strong feeling of 'so what?', leaving the reader suspecting that mathematicians need to get a life. And at least one where I think the answer is wrong, if you apply the same logic as applied in an earlier tricksy question. (It's the one about pigs and umbrellas, if you must know.) Funnily, what works least well are the bits that are most like a conventional popular maths book, that describe famous mathematical problems and their context, such as the four colour problem and Fermat's last theorem. The entries for these are rather longer than the rest, but obviously much shorter than, say, Simon Singh's brilliant book on Fermat. That means that you get concentrated fact, but none of the interesting detail that makes a popular science or maths book appealing. For me these sections just don't work and I largely skipped them. But - and that's the joy of the format - it really doesn't matter. Because in a few pages there will be something else, and something else, and something else again to entertain and tickle the brain cells. It made me think, reminded me of some old favourite problems and puzzles, introduced plenty of new ones and entertained. What more can you ask from maths?"
2,0465013023,http://goodreads.com/user/show/13997511-anoop-dixith,2,"'The book has some serious problems' would be a compliment to this book! Cabinet of Mathematical Curiosities lives up to its expectations, if not exceeds it by a margin. This is basically a popular Math book by popular science author Professor Ian Stewart. But the gamut of topics (or ""curiosities"" touched upon in this book is impressive. Many curiosities come across as silly, a few are captivating, a bunch of them are explorative, but I'm afraid none was original to my dismay, although I probably should have guessed it before I picked up the book. If you're already an expert at knowing interesting and varied topics in Math and logic, this book might just mildly interest you. Yet, there are some topics that are explained so well they give a new perspective to the concept. The one that impressed me the most is Euler's Equation (widely regarded as the most beautiful equation in all of Math) - e ^ (i*pi) = -1. I had come across that equation thousands of times, but the author's way of ""realizing"" the equation using a circle and tangents at right angles was truly marvelous. Many more such explanations come to my mind - Langton's Ant, the elaborate explanation of Poincare Conjecture, the puzzle of division into 17 entities, the nature and idea of ""pi"", realistic meaning of squaring a circle, Fermat's Last Equation  etc.I must admit that there are some puzzles in the book that are well known, like the river crossing puzzle, coin swaps, pour glasses, weighing machines etc. But the point is if you're compiling a list of mathematical curiosities of various kinds for a heterogeneous audience, I guess those ought to get a place, and so the author has done a good job with that. There were some news as well, like the patented primes, simple yet brilliant ""Tap-an-Animal"" game etc that gave me new ideas to create a few more puzzles.Overall, while I did enjoy reading the book, a large portion of it was ""re-visiting"" what I had already enjoyed in my teens. The book is not equation-heavy and caters mostly to general audience, so if you're like me that loves equations and proofs, the book won't impress you dearly but you'd still have a fun ride. "
3,0465013023,http://goodreads.com/user/show/71839432-joshua,4,A Fun book with lots to think about(if you can understand it)
4,0465013023,http://goodreads.com/user/show/909939-brian-sison,4,"Ian Stewart is one of the famous names in popular mathematics, along with Douglas Hofstadter and Martin Gardner. He also wrote Flatterland, one of the better sequels written for Flatland.This book is about 40% math history, 30% classic mind puzzles, and 30% new (to me) brain benders. It's a great collection for that small percentage of people that would choose to read math for fun. "
5,0465013023,http://goodreads.com/user/show/16878809-ann,4,"Ian Stewart's popular math books are some of my favorite books of all time, and this installment did not disappoint. If you enjoy interesting puzzles, dorky humor, and mathematical trivia, you will probably like this book as much as I did. There are several errors, though, including in the solutions guide, but they are generally easy to spot. Some of the explanations were a little too brief, and one or two of the puzzle solutions were basically rewordings of ""because it's obvious,"" but there are many links given to further information for the curious."
6,0465013023,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3124370-justin,4,"A fun little popular math book. A bit uneven (most of his explanations were outstanding, but some left me scratching my head) but overall well worth reading, especially for secondary school math teachers. Some of the math puzzles found inside were excellent, and I'm looking forward to sharing them with my students."
7,0465013023,http://goodreads.com/user/show/15843630-stephen-dawson,3,"Lots of mathematical snippets, ranging from the odd joke to detailed proofs of interesting theorems. I suppose this means that there is something for everyone, but it also means that the range is too wide for most. A couple of errors slightly take the gloss off, but nevertheless this makes for an interesting and informative book to dip into."
8,0465013023,http://goodreads.com/user/show/18942380-william-schram,4,"Professor Stewart speaks of a number of mathematical curiosities and puzzles with solutions. Among them are the Monty Hall Problem, the Riemann Hypothesis and other things that are interesting. While it is heavy on math, some of the problems only require simple logic to figure out. Just a disclaimer, it doesn't solve the Riemann Hypothesis, it only discusses it."
9,0465013023,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5932356-tim-robinson,5,"The equal of anything by Martin Gardner, who is the gold standard in such matters. There were one or two things I hadn't met before. Excellent."
10,0465013023,http://goodreads.com/user/show/51664350-paul-weiss,2,"What a disappointment after Flatterland! Professor Stewart seemed to have the devil's own time finding a balance that would appeal to fans of popular mathematics. Much of his Cabinet of Mathematical Curiosities is positively pedestrian and, frankly, quite boring - riddles we've all heard before; high school geometry; combinatorial curiosities such as the number of ways to shuffle a pack of cards of the number of different sudoku puzzles that exist; school age party tricks based on nothing fancier than public school arithmetic; and, for goodness' sake, a listing of constants such as e, √2 or pi to 50 decimal places ... my, my and ho hum!At the other end of the scale, Stewart included complex summary essays on cutting edge mathematical topics as advanced and esoteric as the Riemann Hypothesis, fractional dimensions, Zeta functions, the Goldbach conjecture and so on. I don't think of myself as mathematically challenged by any means but (and this is strictly my opinion) I believe many of these essays are pitched at a level that would bewilder a young bright-eyed mathematician fresh off the earning of an undergraduate degree. It was the merest handful of essays that found that brilliant middle ground that challenged, entertained and educated - Kurt Gödel's Incompleteness Theorem; the Poincaré Conjecture; a discussion of Hilbert's Hotel and the cardinality of infinities put forward by Cantor; Bessel functions and the differences in the ""quality"" or ""timbre"" of the sounds generated by the shape of a drum as opposed to merely its pitch. But these successes were precious few and far between.High expectations dashed on the shores of mediocrity. Not recommended!Paul Weiss "
11,0465013023,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5554077-pamela-scott,2,"https://thebookloversboudoir.wordpres...This book is not what I expected at all. I thought it would be a fun, entertaining read about mathematical curiosities. This is the case with some of the anecdotes in this book. However, there are many puzzles that don’t have the solution. Some of these are quite complex and I didn’t fully understand them. It would have been better if the solutions had been included. This is aimed at mathematical and non-mathematical people alike after all. It’s not the best book to read straight through as I found it very dull at times. Very disappointing. "
12,0465013023,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5617338-sam,3,"Mathematics is such a fascinating field of science for me, I studied maths up to college level. This books is full of interesting proofs of theorems, odd jokes and plenty of puzzles. This book is split into two sections; the “question” section which outlines the puzzle or the theorem and the “answer” section will give you the solution to the puzzle or more details about the theorem. This book is a good read, but, it is written for someone who has more advanced mathematical knowledge, as some of the finer details in this book were lost on me. "
13,0465013023,http://goodreads.com/user/show/30206283-kursad-albayraktaroglu,5,"Like all of Ian Stewart's books, this is an excellent and very informative text for the mathematically inclined. It is essentially a compendium of mathematical puzzles, interesting theorems, obscure facts and trivia. It is not a very easy book to read and will take some time to read properly - on some days, I was stumped by one of the puzzles and kept part of the day thinking about a solution; and on some days I was simply amazed by something I learned from the book and had to go read more about it online. Highly recommended to anyone interested in math."
14,0465013023,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7349312-andrew-y,2,"I don't know if this book knows what it wants to be. Too little of anything to really chew on, too many abrupt shifts to allow the mind to take anything in fully. You'd do better to read something else."
15,0465013023,http://goodreads.com/user/show/40163717-armshaw,5,"Lots of intriguing gems, with a few puzzles and jokes along the way."
16,0465013023,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1720603-baal-of,4,"Having started this book many years ago, I've finally finished it. This book covers an amazing large range of topics in math and logic. Some of the puzzles were not too difficult, and others were extremely hard, some impossible. I'm definitely best when there are algebraic or logical solutions, and weak on geometry, especially tiling and space-filling. My favorite part was the last bit on mathematical theology, where he goes over the ontological argument, and why it fails on a fundamental logical and philosophical principle, i.e. that one cannot assume the properties of something without first establishing that the thing exists."
17,0465013023,http://goodreads.com/user/show/29368653-geo-collins,5,"My brother received this book as a Christmas present in 2010, and didn't take much interest in it. I had just fallen into my love of mathematics at the time, and proceeded to steal this book from him, just for some light reading. My eyes were opened to all these amazing and beautiful areas of mathematics, and I found myself going back and re-reading various sections as if learning each thing over again. This book completely took my interest and imagination, and still sits on my shelf with about 30 pages with the corners folded as my favourite parts to go back to, and is probably the one book I've re-read the most number of times."
18,0465013023,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1873877-katty,3,"Too smart for me! Not all of it, but some of the puzzles were complicated and the explanations of different theorems tedious. The book's enjoyment might depend on how knowledgeable and into math the reader is - for me it was occasionally too complex, for others it's probably too light. Even though some of the content wasn't accessible to me, I still found many of the tidbits interesting and would browse through it again sometime when I need a nice change of pace in my reading. "
19,0465013023,http://goodreads.com/user/show/9187541-yanni-cooper,5,"Do you like math? Do you kind of wish you liked math? This is a great book. It covers a little bit of everything, from math jokes, to puzzles both old and new, to explanations of ancient problems and new types of math. Many of the ""problems"" are partially left as an exercise for the the reader, with answers at the back of the book if you get stumped in classic Encyclopedia Brown style.Even if math isn't your forte, this book is certainly worth a skim."
20,0465013023,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1883903-pat,5,"Great book for math-o-philes or just anyone who finds numbers fascinating. Hundreds of puzzles, mensa-like teasers, explanations of everything math. Some problems easy, others difficult but something for everyone to use to amaze their friends and finally get those questions answered that your h.s. algebra teacher never would, i.e., why can't you divide by zero?"
21,0465013023,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5996952-tim,3,"After the Penguin Dictionary of numbers, this cabinet of maths branches out into geometry, statistics, philosophy, jokes and puzzles. Fortunately the puzzles do have answers in the back, and while the book progresses from simple concepts to proving (or not) the existence of God, you can dip in and out randomly too."
22,0465013023,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1937294-monica,4,"There is a lot of known stuff here, for us with interest in mathematics, but the idea of gathering, and putting this together in one book is good. I liked it. And there were something I either forgot or never knew."
23,0465013023,http://goodreads.com/user/show/237421-joe,3,"This is a pretty cursory review of a vast number of mathematical concepts. Part history book, part textbook, part riddle book and a science joke now and then, this seems like a good book to own and glance through once and a while rather than take out of the library and read cover to cover. "
24,0465013023,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5330834-simon-harvey,4,"Quirky snippets of maths facts, history and puzzles (plus essential crib-sheet). All rounded off with a modal logic view of the mathematical ""proof"" of God's existence (or not). Thoroughly entertaining."
