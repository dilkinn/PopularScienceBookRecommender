0,0156687410,http://goodreads.com/user/show/26188-jafar,4,"This book was written around 50 years ago. It may be one of the earlier solid attempts in sociobiology and evolutionary psychology. The subject of the book is aggression. Aggression, which is between the members of the same species, should not be confused with the predatory behavior towards the members of other species. Lorenz, one of founders of ethology, presents a detailed treatment of aggression in animals and the purposes that it serves. Then he moves on to humans. The implication is that aggression is hard-wired in us, and we’d better acknowledge this fact and find ways to mitigate it if we want to prevent it from igniting wars. The fact that Lorenz was a member of the Nazi party and supported their ideas of racial purity doesn’t help when he talks about aggression and human nature. From what I read in the book, the man who wrote this book is not the same man who was a member of the Nazi party. Regardless of his politics and what he says about human societies, this book is a great read on animal behavior. Read it for some really fascinating tales on geese and ganders. I never thought these birds were so interesting. "
1,0156687410,http://goodreads.com/user/show/14475342-abubakar-mehdi,3,"Lorenz, a famous ethologist and a somewhat controversial figure for his ideas, proposes that human beings, like most of other vertebrates, are inherently aggressive and this aggression is triggered by a variety of situations. Therefore, if we understand the instinctual behavior patterns in animals, we can explain a thing or two about human behavior too. Now, this is a wonderful book. I learned about the gorgeous and aggressive coral fish, geese, rats and many amazing things about other animals. Its not until the last three chapters that he properly presents his thesis, and It wasn't convincing enough. I think aggression in humans is slightly a more complex phenomenon then in vertebrates. Our society, behaviors and drives are more intricate and cannot be explained in this context. Neuroscience and Behavioral psychology have a better chance of explaining that, but as far as Greylag goose and Cichlid are concerned, Lorenz is very adept at explaining their social hierarchies and their rites and rituals."
2,0156687410,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1409349-karson,5,"The author was awarded a Nobel Peace Prize for this book. It looks at the functional nature of aggression as it is found in nature in animal populations and explains much of human behavior in the context of its natural root in any society or group. It is fairly easy to read in the first few chapters, and then I experienced some interest doldrums which I am currently stuck in. However, it has so much applicable information in the first few chapters that regardless of what is left for me to read, I highly recommend it. I feel that much of our society is hell-bent on turning our society into a bunch of gutless, passive wimps. What I have read in this book explains that aggression is a naturally occurring phenomenon and that it even has some functionality. Obviously aggression can be overdone and be inappropriate in a systemic or individual basis, but it does have a role in establishing order. For me, more than anything it has been a thought provoking read."
3,0156687410,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1320696-al,5,"Behavior is not excused or justified but can be explained. Human behavior is no different. Auschwitz is not a German problem, any more than Wounded Knee or the Little Big Horn white or Indian problems. Until we learn to accept the fact that these are human problems we will continue to rationalize the fact that we are dangerous predators and unlike a shark are fully aware of that fact, and choose to ignore it."
4,0156687410,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2835388-samuel-viana,5,"I've know about Lorenz since I was a little boy. I remember that when he died, in 1989, the portuguese TV reminded his name in a TV documentary of some episodes about the life of the man that could made little goslings walk beside him and everyone feel fascinated by those pictures.I've heard about is ideas on human behaviour some years after that and I reminded curious about the observations he have made about them, some like: the intraspecific competition and the way the aggression first appeared on evolution as a way to set the places in which each member of a species has its own 'vital place' (or territory, as you prefer to call it). From that, he starts to develop his thesis, giving examples about animals (starting with the fish the coral reefs), never forgetting to retouch here and there the human species. Lorenz make some paragraphs in the middle of its descriptions about animal behaviour examples just to compare the last example with some special case with the human race that looks very similar. I don't know if some examples he gives could be applied immediately to our species. I don't know.You can read this book as a species of manifesto or a sermon . I don't forget the way he finishes the chapter four: "" As we shall hear later , this expedients often resorted to in nature to prevent the injurious effects of aggression . But the human being without insight has been known to kill his friend.""The title of the chapter six- ""The Great Parliament of Instincts"" is another slogan that I won't forget too. Of course the best of all chapters is the chapter eleven - ""The bond"" - where he describes goose life stories almost as they were human beings (which is very curious - because Lorenz sometimes says that the ""anthropomorphizing reader"" should took care in order to not interpret in a ""human way"" the examples done).Some people will feel that only the three final chapters matter - the ones in which he describes the risks posed by the human race. He specially gives special attention into the ""militant manifest"". I heard about the potential connections between Lorenz and the Nazism that the could a initial supporter of this ideology, giving up later. Try to make your own conclusions knowing that and the condemnation of the so-called ""millitant manifest"". Strange, don't you think. Anyway, Lorenz never confirmed he supported Nazism in any period of his life. Just vilification !?Anyway, I recommend the book for anyone that would like to know more about Lorenz work, the greylag goose life and just for the literary style, it deserves a read!P.S.: just to know that I owned geese for some years ago (now I don't have anymore) and after I read this book I felt nostalgic and started to remember all of special episodes I had about that experience. I wish one day I would own geese again!"
5,0156687410,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3532958-charlie,2,"There was a lot of racism here, as well as classism and sexism. The author's thought processes often seemed incomplete and were difficult to follow. Many of the chapters contained very little of the content their titles led me to expect. It felt as though the author was trying to cover too much, and as a result many of the topics that I did find interesting never received enough detail. I also wonder how much of the information and speculation about non-human animal behaviour in this book is accurate, and how much of it was the author projecting his own worldview onto other species. "
6,0156687410,http://goodreads.com/user/show/82130173-goodreads-user-2-0,3,"Konrad Lorenz proposed in “On Aggression” the theory that the violence is something good and necessary for all the animals. Self-defense would be the reason why species have developed this mechanism of behavior over the centuries. Unfortunately, Lorenz had a big knowledge about animals, but he did not understand this matter in all its complexity. Erich Fromm, in his book “The Anatomy of Human Destructiveness”, made a total critique of the theories that Lorenz proposed in“On Aggression”. And, it seems clear that Fromm was right.Fromm realized that Lorenz didn't see that in the humans (and in other species) there are other types of aggression, in addition to the defensive. When soldiers of an army, with imperialist intentions, invade a country that is not their country, they do not use a defensive violence. The aggressiveness of a serial killer is criminal and evil. Policemen and mercenaries on the pay of a political dictator, do not use violence for defensive purposes, but to terrorize and dominate the citizens of a country. The aggressiveness of animals is much more complex than Lorenz thought. It is very difficult to understand this subject by studying only ducks and rats. To understand it, it is necessary to study, in addition, history, psychology and religion.Richard Dawkins is another writer who, in his book “The Selfish Gene”, has made critics to Lorenz's positive vision of violence postulated in “On Aggression”."
7,0156687410,http://goodreads.com/user/show/31320014-rita,4,"Great book. I started it two years ago, I felt it a bit slow, so I moved on to something else. A few weeks ago It caught my attention again, I want to think it's me who has changed a lot in that time, because somehow the book was now incredibly interesting. Konrad Lorenz's sense of humor and witty jokes make this book very enjoyable. The few final chapters were my favorite."
8,0156687410,http://goodreads.com/user/show/8713042-anthony,5,"This book is a gateway into evolutionary biology. It takes the universal animal ""condition"" of aggression, a facet of the fight or flight response, that has over time become refined by social rituals and ""cultures"" of behaviors, and goes full-blown behavior-study-analysis into how this could occur, and further extrapolates what this means for humankind, having evolved from ""lesser"" (lower-tiered among certain strata) animals. The definition of aggression is important to get right here: Lorenz sees it as the fight of ""fight of flight,"" but that fight can be and often is channeled into other outlets that signal other types of interactive behavior, such as mating rituals and pair bonding. Lorenz's writing is lucid and on point with every beautiful detail. As an expert ethologist (he studies animal behavior) he does not miss a detail, from the slightest neck movement of a greylag goose to the angular direction of movement of a cichlid. As in observing people, it is not the what they say that reveal their realities, but the subtle cues of how they act. Any good psychologist knows this. Lorenz, in observing animals, digs even deeper. He often refers to Kant, citing what biological ""mechanisms"" must underly his a priori categories as necessary generational developments borne out of evolution. It is in these areas that our vocabulary obscures what is the heart of the matter--the disciplines at the time this book was written, and still today, lack the language necessary for elucidating processes of multi-generational biological emergences. Lorenz's genius in writing is his ability to communicate these things in a way that readers can digest. There is a lot of tediously observed and tested behavioral science in this book, but it hardly ever gets boring. Each chapter opens up a whole new layer and shines with an enthusiasm for life as it is expressed in all sorts of living things. This infectious enthusiasm, combined with revelatory insights into evolutionary biology in every chapter, gives the book a storylike progression. Eventaully, Lorenz applies everything he's unraveled to human beings, unwrapping the social world with such a refreshing perspective that your attention is challenged by the suspense of ""getting the answers"" to how this all works inside of and all around you. Yet, the book is taken best at a slow pace, because there is a lot of insight in it, and unless you have primed yourself in animal observation well beforehand, it is almost too much to take in. Evolutionary biology t is a deep, labrynthine rabbit hole to explore.Each chapter could be taken in alone as a mind-blowing essay that is still as fresh today as it must have been in 1972 (albeit more controversial back then). There are challenges that Lorenz makes to standard assumptions that still linger today. They basically are the aspects of biology that brush up against the outcomes (though not the opportunities) of social idealism. It is important to keep in mind that this book is a scientist's observations, and that Lorenz is aware of such charges he will evoke. The book is offered as an insight into human nature, and on the premise of ""know thyself,"" because only once we do can we take control and responsibility for who we are--and who we are (as a species, alive today, with ancestors that go back way longer than we can account for) is mind-bogglingly complicated. Taking our distant cousins (other species) as models from which we can learn about ourselves is a genius idea. Life, after all, is hard to argue. Life is something we can intuitively know, so much as we look into the eyes of a deer or a dog and look into the window of its soul. We see it grow up from birth, get old, and pass on, and we know that it is alive, just like us. Lorenz is a truth-seeker, an admirer of beauty, an advocate of the method of science, a humanitarian, an expert in his field, and a gifter teacher. Science, done earnestly and prudently, cannot eradicate beauty, but merely plunges its dedicated followers (or tool-users, if you will) into a more and more deeply comlex and beautiful world. Is science self-eradicating? Possibly. Does it requre a humble soul to use it? Certainly. What remains of Lorenz's research is an eternal awe of the animals he loved, and the echoes of how much we are part of that kingdom of life, no matter how much we try to moralize and abstract ourselves out of it. This sometimes is a hard pill to swallow. In the end, it is the irrefutable basis for all future morality and abstraction, and source of who we are.Addendum: I am eager to read more Lorenz, and having just stumbled upon him on YouTube, learn more about what's going on in the world of evolutionary biology today through Bret Weinstein."
9,0156687410,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7060405-benjamin-l,4,"On Aggression is a classic in the ethology literature, first published in 1963, and when I picked it up off the shelf of a second-hand bookstore I was mostly looking for the scientific romance that characterised science literature back then. I did not expect it's central message to be so strong after all these years - a testament to both the strength of the science, and the humility Lorenz shows when going 'beyond the science of the day' - nor did I expect it to be so painfully topical. I began reading this before the pandemic of police brutality that has come to characterise the may/june protests in america really began take up my (an Australian) day-to-day attentions, but in the final chapter of the book Lorenz discusses what animals have taught us about aggression and how we can use that knowledge to try surmount our own sociopolitical aggression - using race relations in America as a case study. I could not think of a more moving coincidence. A gain of salt should be taken with this book - after all, it is a scientific book 60 years out of date and is not immune to cultural baggage of the time - but it should be read by every activist, political scientist, diplomat, military & police officer, psychologist, ethologist, and behaving human out there (Just perhaps read Behave by Robert Sapolsky first). But I am getting ahead of myself - the majority of the book is about an ethological approach to studying aggression; that is, looking at aggression in animal behaviour and trying to understand it. More broadly than understanding the mechanics of aggression, Lorenz asks the teleological and evolutionary questions about aggression - why does aggression exist? What survival-value does it provide? In the behavioural sciences, 'aggression' is a slightly more narrow concept than it is in general use. Aggression refers to 'aggressive' acts between members of the same, or closely related, species and precludes behaviours that function as predation or play. There are a number of answers to this question - the obvious ones presented in biology 101 - defending territories for food and/or reproductive access, but aggression runs far deeper than that. Some have suggested that On Aggression deals a lot with tangential topics, but I think this criticism is missing the point. Lorenz wants to claim Aggression is only one part of an animals behavioural repertoire, and must be understood within the context of everything else that animal does, and that is why the book can sometimes seem to veer off topic. The great majority of the book actually concerns social formation in animals and comparisons across species, from the 'anonymous flock' to deep, life-long friendships. The book could accurately be titled, instead, 'On Friendship' - probably attracting a very different audience than 'On Aggression,' but it is Lorenz' view that the two are intimately tied, and co-evolved as two opposing but necessary behavioural drives, analogous to the autonomic and parasympathetic response that either prepares us for action ('fight or flight) or calms the body down to save metabolic energy ('Rest and Digest'). Social bonding may have originally evolved in predatory species (It is well known now, and speculated at in the 60's, that social bonding evolved numerous times) as a way to inhibit aggression. For animals with 'natural weapons,' such as a wolf, there must be an intrinsic inhibitor of conspecific aggression else the species would commit a kind of murder-suicide because it is simply too easy for one member of the species to kill another. Even in non-social predatory species - the Tiger is a good example - multiple members of the species can only meet safely when there is another powerful behavioural drive (Usually Sexual or Maternal) strong enough to overcome the intrinsic aggressive drive. It is noteworthy that a Female Tiger (in most cases) will attack and kill her own offspring once they have grown up enough to be unable to trigger a maternal response. In contrast, for a species where is it more difficult for one member to kill another - traditional prey species - such an inhibitory drive is less required as it is comparatively easier for a fight to break down before death occurs, or killing requires more effort and is, thus, a rarer occurrence. As such, these species have less need for inhibition of aggression. Lorenz reviews the understanding of agression and it's evolutionary history in his time - beginning in coloured reef fish - and social bonding/group formation - with particular attention to the goose. The writing here is superb. Lorenz manages to give detailed accounts without getting bogged in biological minutiae, and brings genuine humour throughout the book. It is a fine blend of scientific results and personal anecdotes told in tandem and in support, to satisfy both the sceptic in the reader who desires accuracy and the curiosity in the reader, who wants to be entertained. Lorenz is well aware that, though accuracy is important, it is entertainment that will drive the reader to understand. The book is very well structured, beginning with a slow wade into the reef of coloured fish where new concepts and ideas are gradually introduced, bit by bit, such that it never feels overwhelming. This is the greatest strength of the book, and i found that before i realised it i was intellectually wrestling with some pretty hefty themes, but Lorenz is a good guide. Having finished his survey of the animal ethology literature Lorenz turns to the 'most complex animal species', man. Here is where On Aggression really becomes an interesting read. As a book on it's topic it is interesting enough. As a modern reader, however, reading about the topic of human aggression in society and politics written during the beginning of the Cold War and just after World War Two, it's a fascinating window into a chaotic time. In this respect, On Aggression is as useful to historians of the middle 20th century as it is to the animal lover. The biggest concern here is that our species is, phylogenetically, a prey species. The technological ascendancy of man is cultural and in evolutionary terms very, very new. We are therefore in the unfortunate position of having a Wolf's Jaw without the behavioural inhibitions of not using it against ourselves. We have the socio-cognitive development of a prey species with the (technologically augmented) body of a predatory one, and for a Lorenz looking back at the first and second world wars and staring into the possibility of nuclear holocaust - a legitimate fear in the 1960's - a bet on the long-term survival of H. sapiens is not a good gamble. He is worried that even if we do not 'irradiate ourselves with the bomb,' we are just as likely to 'do a similar thing with Carbon.' I wish I could give him better news from the future. But Lorenz wants to offer some solutions, for through we don't have the inhibitions of a predatory social species bred into us by millennia of evolution, we do have the advantage of abstract reasoning. With that, perhaps we can learn from a study of aggression in animals and use what we learn to design our own inhibitions. The greatest inhibitory drive is a bond of friendship, and so it is Lorenz's great hope that the nations and peoples of the world could overcome the aggressive, fearful drives first instilled into us as rodent-like mammals fleeing before the Tyrannosaurus by enhanced international and intercultural exchange, by turning the 'other' into just another friend. An ardent supporter of the U.N, In this hope he foretells some many of the findings in psychology and political science of the 60 years after his book, and precedes them all in his prescriptions for world peace all by looking 'backwards though evolution' to see what the animals around us have to say. It is in the final chapter where Lorenz outlines his ideas on how to avoid human-human aggression that he uses race relations in the US as a case study - and here the book is really depressing, for 60 years on, it is very, very clear we as a global society have learned nothing from Lorenz, On Aggression, or his favourite goose Martina."
10,0156687410,http://goodreads.com/user/show/34888012-min-p-min,5,"Impossible to rate anything but five. Should be required reading for all human beings. One of those rare books which make you look at the world from a whole new angle. It offers countless vital insights into social existence and- even if you think man is something fundamentally different from other animals - forces one to look at many a social phenomena in a new light. Well written, absolutely riveting - and extremely important.Lorenz makes too many fascinating points to mention, but here are three which I feel are maybe the most important: 1) Aggression is beyond good and evil; it has a function and fulfilling it, it causes things we consider both good and bad. This means that to remove aggression would mean to also remove things such as respect, competition, and even love. Not to mention how much beauty has emerged from sublimated aggression. 2) We are not driven by reason but by our emotions, instincts and drives, which we are only beginning to understand. To attempt to 'weed out' certain essential aspects of humanity (like aggression) because they appear useless or even harmful to our reason, is utmost folly and hubris if ever there was any. 3) Humanity's greatest advantage may turn out to be his worst nightmare. Species' which are easily capable of killing others of their own kind, like lions or wolves, have very strict inhibitory mechanism against attacking each other. Human beings, because we lack lethal teeth or claws, also lack these strong inhibitory mechanisms. Which was all fine and dandy until we invented weaponry. Technology may be our undoing. Our brains just aren't wired to deal with the responsibility inherent in pulling triggers, much less with buttons that kill thousands of people per press.But it's not all about people. Lorenz talks of humanity by first fooling you in through lots of fascinating stories about animals, many of them hilarious, some heartbreaking. But it's a nice kind of fooling: the kind you are grateful for. If you've ever wondered why people seem to turn into a mindless herd in large groups, how crows remember things from ten years back, or why we laugh, this book is for you. Actually, if you are human, this book is for you. If everyone read this, the world would be a better place with a bit more honesty and a bit less hate."

There is lots of stuff in this book about the functionality of and speaking about the adaptive value of aggression that makes a lot of sense when it comes to fish, geese and even some mammals.

I'm wondering whether it is because of the style of writing or the time in which it was written.The first few chapters were excellent but then it just dropped off and seemed to be repetitive.The last chapters picked up a bit and once he started to apply his research to human behaviour it was better.All in all, this book has left me slightly perturbed and disappointed."

21,0156687410,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5075908-jeannette,3,"I read this so long ago that its hard to remember details, just that it inspired me to ask deeper questions about aggression in all animals, humans included. Instinct? Gender twisted? The one idea I remember is that male bonding and aggression are linked: aggressiveness in men might be necessary for male bonding and that is important to human life. I was a graduate student with a focus on how animals form and maintain social groups when I read this book. I remember writing to David Bygott who was studying aggression among male chimpanzees at Gombe Stream with Jane Goodall. I asked him if male chimp bonds were stronger among the more aggressive males and how male bonds worked in chimp society. Even tho I never got an answer, when I met the man at Cambridge University in England when he was writing up his Ph.D. thesis, he did give me some answers. And he has now been my husband for over 40years. Bonding is still a fascinating topic! Thanks to Lorenz for that added push, not just about aggression."
22,0156687410,http://goodreads.com/user/show/57809054-sanja-zanni,3,"A very important piece of writing put together in an overly ambitious fashion. As a science oriented individual I do agree everything stands, but the data itself is stacked up in a big cluster and not that easy to follow. Must agree with the comment Lorenz pointed out in the prologue when his friend said it wasn't clear what all of this adds up to. But to be fair, I hoped for much more paragraphs similar to those from the last 3 chapters - a comparative approach and an analysis of humans or at least primates in the current context - and my hopes can not be a valid means of judgment. But still, too much fish and birds for me.All in all, Lorenz presents some key ideas at the end and an honest concern for man's assurance of his detachment from primitive instincts."

What really impressed me were the stories about animals who turn out to be ""highly emotional people of very limited intelligence"" (Lorenz quoting from Oskar Heinroth). They love, can be jealous, suffer when the loved ones do not pay attention to them, get depressed or enthusiastic, feel sorrow and mourn the loss of close friends. Indeed more than what some humans can feel towards another person."
24,0156687410,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5870882-sunny,4,"stunning book. perhaps one of the most underrated books ive ever read. a bit boring i shoud add in parts when it goes into animals and random fishes a bit too much but the ecce homo chapter is almost as good as Nietzsches book of the same name! - the book talks about how historically (cromagnon, neanderthal days) weve had vens for our agression but now in an over ritualized societies we dont have as many opportunities for catharsis. and when we do it explodes. the chapter on rats and the link to humans is amazing also. stunning book. "
25,0156687410,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5946412-elizabeth,3,"I was actually very bored by this book. Most of the ideas are very outdated. Often times it was very difficult to follow the point he was trying to make. Much of the behavior we know, you can find some of a base in his theories. Often he makes some of his ideas into absolutes. Any behaviorist/scientist knows there are no absolutes when it comes to other beings' behavior. Read it for fun but don't expect to get much out of it."
26,0156687410,http://goodreads.com/user/show/215221-bria,4,"Mostly I like to learn about the habits and behavior of animals. Humans are a pretty ok animal to learn about the behavior of, but you hear about them all the time, so it's not quite as fun, but I don't mind it as much when it's just peppered in among stories about other species. I think Lorenz has a pretty solid view of some repercussions of the fact of human biology, that some humans don't seem to understand, even now, some fifty years later."
