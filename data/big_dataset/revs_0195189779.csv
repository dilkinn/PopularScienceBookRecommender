0,0195189779,http://goodreads.com/user/show/175635-trevor,4,"There was a point at the start of this book when I thought I wasn’t going to make it to the end – or even past the start. It was when the market economy was described as  The World of Truth. ‘Oh god’, I thought, ‘this can only mean one thing…’But I was wrong. This was a much better book than I thought it was going to end up. It was quite slow at the start when he was talking about Starbucks and pricing policies – but my interest picked up when he discussed two computer printers made by IBM in which the only difference between them was that a chip was added to the cheaper one to make it run more slowly. That is, of the two printers the expensive one was cheaper to produce and was then nobbled to make it run more slowly and this surreal exercise was so as to create a price comparison between the two models.After explaining why the market is magnificent he does then modify this by explaining that the market does have problems and blind spots and some ways incentives can be created to force the market to address these blind spots. There is an interesting discussion of game theory and a very comprehensive discussion of externalities which I found fascinating. I kept comparing this book with Sowell’s Basic Economics. Both writers are very keen ‘the market is great’ types – but Harford is much less of a fundamentalist than Sowell. I’m looking at getting hold of a Teaching Company introduction to Economics. I need to learn more about comparative advantage as advanced by Ricardo. Basically, the idea is that free trade doesn’t do all the bad things people think it does, because free trade encourages countries to focus on their comparative advantage. This was something that Sowell also discussed, but I found him so rabidly pro-market and pro-free trade that all I could hear was his playing with numbers. The idea is actually quite an interesting one.Let’s say workers in the US can make both shoes and televisions, as can workers in Australia. The US workers can make 1000 shoes in an hour and 50 televisions. The workers in Australia can make 500 shoes and 5 televisions in an hour. Ricardo says that even though the US workers can make more of both products than the Australian workers can they would be better off making just televisions and trading with Australia for shoes – as Australia has a comparative advantage in making shoes over Australia making televisions and if both countries do what they do ‘best’ then both will be better off. It doesn’t seem to make sense – but both Sowell and Harford show clearly that when countries play to their comparative advantages they are, in fact, better off.In both books this also leads to the idea that I should give up my self imposed ban on Nike products – as despite the horrible, sweatshop conditions that Nike creates and profits from, those conditions are better for the workers in third world countries than the existing conditions outside of those workshops are. I’m going to have to read more about this.Harford isn’t as smug as Sowell, but that has meant he has made me think about things much more than Sowell was ever likely to. For example, he talks about the nexus between environmental destruction and economic progress. This is something my friends and I talk about quite often over an Indian lamb curry. The problem is that we know that we consume a disproportionate share of the world’s resources. We know that the rest of the world can’t possibly share our lifestyle. So, then what? Should we actively stop the third world from developing? Are we ever likely to live simpler, more environmentally sustainable lives in the West? Well, it seems very unlikely. Where Sowell simply denies there is a problem, Harford proposes ways of addressing these issues which are not just saying ‘there’s no place like the market’ over and over again while clicking your heels together. Central to these are ways of manipulating the ‘pure’ operation of the market so as to take into consideration market failures, such as ecological collapse. He proposes that this be done by putting a value on the production of CO2 or other pollutants and allowing the market to then adjust to that cost.As he says at the end of the book – morally, development seems to be the only possible solution. I just wish I could believe that when confronted with a choice between a bigger television set and the end of the world that people would make the right choice. Given the number of SUVs on the streets (and despite the cost to run them) I have no reason for any such confidence.I really need to read a leftwing guide to basic economics that deals with these issues in a comprehensive way."
1,0195189779,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1928100-stringy,2,"Harford says he's going to tell you how the world really works, how economics provides insight into our activity. What he really tells you is how awesome the world would be if it was run by economists and everybody always acted rationally, if by 'rationally' you mean the economics jargon of 'assigning a monetary value to every single action/object in life' and not the common usage of 'according to the rules of logic'. You can also find out how poverty is easy to fix (you just move the starting blocks, dummy!), sweatshops are not evil (because workers there earn more money than if they'd stayed on the farm, silly!) and fair trade is useless (because it only solves a problem for the people who participate in it, not for the whole world). It's not that he's wrong about these things, because in a limited sort of way he's entirely correct. It's that he's completely blind to the underlying assumptions that economic theory makes. He provides anecdotes to prove his point, instead of data. And he never acknowledges the difficulties involved in implementing his 'solutions'. It's not a bad book, it's just naive. And given the recent global financial crisis, the bragging and smugness of his worldview are particularly galling - financiers acted exactly as 'rationally' as economists predicted, and look what that got us.Why did I keep reading this annoying book? Because I'm a glutton for punishment, apparently. "
2,0195189779,http://goodreads.com/user/show/28313-matt,5,"I'm a sucker for pop books about economics, and this is the best of the breed -- better, even, than that NYT bestseller Freakonomics. Why? Because Harford, unlike Levitt, actually explains the reasoning and the data he used to follow a problem from its formulation through to its conclusions. He also addresses classic economic problems--why is it hard to buy a used car? why do all the restaurants in Times Square suck? etc., as compared to why you should name your child ""Tova"". His chapter on health care and why it's so difficult to get a system that works is one of the clearest explanations of the problems and potential solutions that I've read anywhere."
3,0195189779,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1248983-joe,1,"Like a bad cup of coffee, I'm already struggling to force this down. As a former World Bank employee and Financial Times editor it will come as no surprise that Hardford thinks trade unions and free healthcare are bad, sweatshops are good and the free market will fix everything. There's something to be said for knowing your enemy, but The Undercover Economist's smug, patronising tone and Harford's self-avowed preference for armchair reasoning will have you grinding your teeth in frustration."
4,0195189779,http://goodreads.com/user/show/19540749-richard-newton,4,"A long time ago I did an economics degree. Like most of the stuff I studied on my various degrees it has mostly passed back out of my brain through a lack of active use. I found this book to be a useful reminder of some basic economics packaged up in easy to understand every day concepts. I put this in that category of making complicated subjects easy to understand. Nicely written and not to difficult to follow.The book was published in 2006 - and at some points it does feel a little quaint. Questioning Amazon's $40 share price, and explaining that the claim that one day there will only be 4 major internet portals is nonsense because there is no barriers to entry seem slightly amusing now. (Does anyone even use the term ""internet portal"" anymore?). On top of that, this is definitely in the school of free-market economics and if your philosophy/politics is more interventionist and less laissez-faire you might find a few arguments less convincing. Nevertheless a good read. "

6,0195189779,http://goodreads.com/user/show/335000-sheila,4,"Rereading it several years later, and with a bit more background in econ, I still find it informational and entertaining, but it highlights some of the frustrations I have with econ: great for revealing insights, a struggle when it comes to applying it to public policy. Sweatshops are better than the alternative, and given time (decades) lead to prosperity, but people are still suffering today, right now, so how do you address that without throwing off the progress over time? (Note: I don't know either! I'm just saying.)***Original review:For me, the standard in ""Economics for People Who Hate Economics"" books is Freakonomics by Steven D. Levitt and Stephen J. Dubner, which opened my mind to all the things economists studied besides just GNP and GDP. This is another entry in the field, and I liked it as much or more than Freakonomics. Harford does a fantastic job of explaining basic economic theory in even more basic terms, using examples like Starbucks, the government of China, and traffic congestion to make his point. He's got a great sense of humor and a good turn of phrase. I still don't feel like I could carry on a conversation about economics, but after this book I feel like I could eavesdrop on one and follow along reasonably well.Now, can someone find me a book like this that makes statistics seem fun and comprehensible? I would love you forever."
7,0195189779,http://goodreads.com/user/show/993940-dustin-allison,3,"From buying a used car to purchasing health insurance, Harford takes a look at a variety of situations that can have a real pratical impact on how we look at some of our everday activities. His take on health care, and how it is dealt with differently in Britain and the United States, was perhaps the most meaningful topic for me. Growing up, I constantly heard how poor the health care was in socialized medicine and how we should protect our market system. The problem is that our health care system clearly isn't working for us. Millions of American citizens are uninsured and we still spend more money per citizen than Britain, and they offer universal health care. How is that possible?Harford goes on to talk about how health care as a business, like the used car business, causes problems. Namely, the buyer doesn't know what he is buying. In health care, Blueshield is essentially a buyer who doesn't know if it is buying a lemon, an unhealthy person, or healthy person. This lack of knowledge screws up the pricing which has huge ramifications on our pocketbooks. Harford also talks about the problems associated with universal health care in Britain. All in all, you come out thinking that we still haven't figured out the ideal health care system...but that we definitely need to try another one."
8,0195189779,http://goodreads.com/user/show/294938-cory,5,"This book was a fantastic overview of (what I think is) basic economic theory, but told in a way that made it incredibly readable. Harford is a great writer and manages to frame his topics in a way that is both highly relevant to real life while being simple enough that anyone can understand. It ranges from the small (the economics of Starbucks and how to prevent traffic jams) to the huge (why poor countries stay poor and how china became rich). I imagine that someone with a serious background in economics might not learn much, and therefore might not be impressed by this book, but for me it was perfect. A grown up Freakonomics for those who care more about the world around them and less about narrow topics like baby names and drug dealers."

Will the benefits I will enjoy in the pleasure of the reading experience and the knowledge I will gain outweigh the loss of money? Will the benefit to the economy of Canada from my cash injection into publishing industry outweigh the growth to my personal debt levels? Should I borrow a copy from the library?These are exactly the kinds of questions reading this will help you think your way through. It is as engaging a read as you are likely to find on the dismal science.
10,0195189779,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1157120-marlowe,2,"The best bits are at the start (price targeting in coffee) and at the end (China's economic success). Best-selling, but not particularly brilliany by any means. The book's success - as it's author might testify - is probably down to the supply and demand ratio for economics books that aren't bloody dull. "
11,0195189779,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1721150-toe,3,"Harford offers a decent little introduction to some of the more basic applications of economics. I finished it in two days and I read slowly. The Undercover Economist is a short, easy, but ultimately forgettable read.Perhaps it's my own fault for reading essentially the same narrowly focused nonfiction book on economics over and over and over again, but I literally received no new information here. Thomas Sowell's ""Basic Economics"" covers the same ideas in more intellectual depth while Levitt's ""Freakonomics"" covers similar ideas in a more exciting and novel way. It's hard for me to criticize or fault Harford because nearly everything he says is accurate and well put. His arguments that free markets consist of many people making voluntary choices that are mutually beneficial, that poor countries are poor because of unreliable government protection of property rights, that China's Great Leap Forward cost tens of millions of lives, that command economies are inherently inefficient without a price system, and that externalities are market failures which may sometimes justify government intervention are spot on. It's just that I've heard this story a thousand times before. He's pushing an open door with me.Kudos to Harford for speaking the truth and getting the message out there for those who haven't heard it. If you haven't heard the message from Ayn Rand, Thomas Woods Jr., Thomas Sowell, John Stossel, Murray Rothbard, Ron Paul, Milton Friedman, Friedrich Hayek, or the countless other conservative and libertarian economists, this book may be worth your while. If you've read any of the above authors, you needn't waste your time here. Either way, I will summarize some of Harford's big points.1. Economic value arises out of the combination of usefulness and scarcity. As the population of England grew, fertile land became scarce and, therefore, more valuable.2. Coffee and sandwich prices are high in airports, terminals, and big cities because of the underlying scarcity of the land on which the shops are built. When land is scarce, the landlords have bargaining power and can demand higher rent, which, in turn, requires the lessees to charge prices high enough to cover the higher rent.3. Traffic would be most efficiently decongested by putting an externality charge on each trip. The trip is what adds pollution, noise, and cars to the road. By charging for that externality, actors can alter their behavior at the margin and decide every moment if they believe the cost is worthwhile. England has something similar to this by charging higher rates for road usage during rush hour.4. Poor countries are poor because of government corruption, stiflingly high taxes, and massive amounts of red tape. It's a very simple point: the more hassle it is to start a business, the more one has to pay in taxes, and the less likely one is to be secure in his property, the less incentive there is to exert effort and produce. People respond to incentives.5. Some complain that a natural talent like Wilt Chamberlain or Tiger Woods is ""unfair"" because those individuals are born with some talent that earns them many millions of dollars while others will never be as good even if they work extremely hard. The problem with taxing income is that if the athletes do not enjoy the sport, they will stop working. Thus, the tax would not be received and the fans would be deprived of watching the sport. The solution, though completely impractical, would be to levy a large, one-time tax on those with talent. This would not alter their subsequent behavior and would result in a more even allocation of wealth. Of course, it's impossible to discern talent early enough to not alter behavior.6. FDR levied an income tax of 79%--a level so high that only one individual paid it: John D. Rockefeller.7. Some college degrees, like philosophy, that do not prepare a student with any tangible or technical skills nonetheless act as signals to employers that the holder of the degree is intelligent and hardworking.8. There is a long-term pattern, shown by Yale economist Robert Shiller as stretching back to 1881, of stock prices hovering around a price-to-earnings ratio of 16. If the ratio is much below that, there is a signal to invest; if the ratio is much above that, there is a signal the economy is overheated and a crash may come soon.9. Sweatshops are a symptom, not the cause, of poverty for the countries that have them. In fact, sweatshops, while horrible, are better than the alternatives available to the workers and act as a rung on the ladder of a progressing economy. South Korea’s economy, which used to be home to countless sweatshops, has largely made the transition to a higher tech economy producing cars, computers, and other electronics.10. Tariffs are bad, free trade is good. In 1999, countries had the following average tariffs: U.S. 2.8%, European Union 2.7%, South Korea 5.9%, Argentina 10.7%, China 15.7%, India 29.5%, Cameroon 61.4%.Memorable Quotes:""All professions are conspiracies against the laity."" - George Bernard Shaw""Each model is useful for different things, but a 'model' that tried to describe the design, the engineering, the ecology, and the economics would be no simpler than reality itself and so would add nothing to our understanding...The truth is that it's simply not possible to understand anything complicated without focusing on certain elements to reduce that complexity.""""It is not polite to say so, but it is obvious that paying people to be unemployed encourages unemployment.”“We learned in chapter 3 exactly why markets work: because our choices as consumers between competing producers gives them both the right incentives and the right information to produce the right amount of exactly what we want. And we’ve also learned that scarcity power, externalities, and inside information can each ruin the way markets do this.”“Hours are long. Wages are pitiful. But sweatshops are the symptom, not the cause, of shocking global poverty. Workers go there voluntarily, which means—hard as it is to believe—that whatever their alternatives are, they are worse. They stay there, too; turnover rates of multinational-owned factories are low, because conditions and pay, while bad, are better than those in factories run by local firms…The solution to this poverty is not going to come by boycotting shoes and clothes made in developing countries. On the contrary, as countries like South Korea have opened up to multinational companies, slowly but surely they have become richer.”"

For an economist this guy is almost a communist!Really decent book. Quite informative even it had me thinking ""doh, I knew that"" on a couple of occasions. And now I don't feel cheap when buying Tesco value products. I feel smart!"
13,0195189779,http://goodreads.com/user/show/28426866-yogeeswar,4,"This book was good. Surprising. It is because it dealt mostly with coffee, beer, poker and game theory - some of the things I'm obsessed with. Tim did a great job revealing about Cameroon, Nepal, India and yeah China's economy. Every pop economics book that I've read have said something about China's rise, here there is a chapter dedicated to it.A worthy read."

15,0195189779,http://goodreads.com/user/show/103758891-george-rigby,3,"After stumbling across a dusty copy on my Old Man’s bookshelf, I thought I’d give it a gander and found it to be a pleasantly intriguing read."
16,0195189779,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4471828-philip-hollenback,3,"The first half of this book was great. Harford laid out some economic principles, then showed their real-life application. For example, due to problems with information quality on both sides of the deal, it's basically impossible to buy a decent used car at a reasonable price.However, the last part of this book was... unsettling. The author veered in to a long discussion of why China is becoming such an economic powerhouse. Then he asserts that it's ok we are losing jobs to China, and in fact we are actually gaining jobs in the US. All very rosy in a reaganomics sort of way. The problems he sidesteps is that all the jobs we are gaining in this country are crap. Wal-Mart, anyone?I feel like Harford read too much Ayn Rand, and developed this perfect idea of how the world works and why progress is wonderful for everyone. Especially here in 2011 it's pretty difficult to stomach his assertions that the world economy is making things better for everyone, especially in the light of disasters like the 2008 bank bailout.My recommendation: read the first half of this book for the interesting info about marginal rents and how to determine if markets are fair. Then skip the rest of the book."
17,0195189779,http://goodreads.com/user/show/78284232-anjana,1,"- enough with the free market propaganda!!- the entirety of the second half was just harford writing about ‘oh poor little third world countries’ and ‘oh look how white countries have helped they world they’re so holy!!!!’ he legitimately said that the us singlehandedly has helped reduce pollution. get a grip! - he defended sweatshops. - oh also - enoUGH with the free market propaganda@white men, y’all really think you help everyone and know everything huh "
18,0195189779,http://goodreads.com/user/show/80310601-hpmasih,4,"this books gives you the first intuitions about economy conundrums and gives visions to widen up our views to those problems, it is entertaining and easy( maybe too much) to read, I enjoyed reading it. "
19,0195189779,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3498716-monthly-book-group,4,"Introducing the book to the Monthly Book Group, the proposer said he had chosen it because his wife was buying a book for a rail journey, and, as there was a two for one offer at the station, he chose this. No, despite the analysis of railway station coffee outlets in Harford’s opening chapter, he had not also succumbed to the temptation to buy an expensive coffee. (He had been brought up to believe that food and drink was something to be consumed at home, not purchased at inflated prices outside the home, a view of continuing disappointment to his wife).The book had intrigued him, being an interesting and enlightening review of a wide range of subjects, even if it rather skimmed over some of them. Despite his business background it had shed new light on a range of commercial practices. It was amazing that a cheaper HP printer was the more expensive one slowed down (and another member of the group with an electronics background could confirm a similar example of pricing practice for calculators with almost identical circuitry).All agreed it was written in engaging and eminently readable prose - with many entertaining anecdotes - despite dealing with a wide range of complex subjects. Most had enjoyed and welcomed the attempts to simplify economics, and found it persuasive on non-political microeconomic matters such as retail practice. It was also a pleasant change that here was an economist who offered firm views, rather than the normal “On the one hand, on the other hand”.However – as with attempts to write popular science books – it proved very difficult to treat complex issues satisfactorily in a simplistic, easy-reading style. And it was the big issues tackled in the second half of the book – political issues such as health care, failing countries in Africa, climate change, road pricing, and the need for more free markets – that proved red rags to some of our bulls.Or, more precisely, blue rags, to those brought up in the twentieth century Scottish tradition of distrusting the free market. What about the need for regulation of the free market – why did he not bring that out more strongly? Didn’t the book lack balance – no mention here of Union Carbide in Bhopal! Was the cult of the free market not passing its zenith, as demonstrated by the current meltdown in the financial markets?Yet, for others, Harford’s recommendations were uncontroversial. The points he was making about the role of the market in encouraging the more efficient use of resources and economic growth were widely accepted by economists. Climate change and excess traffic were indeed better tackled, in the main, by economic instruments, with regulation only forming a small part of the policy mix, as the recent UK Stern report on climate change had concluded.The difficulty was in persuading democratic governments and legislators of this, and it did not seem likely that Harford’s book was going to make it any easier. His dumbed-down versions of the theory of comparative advantage, of Ricardo on rent, of supply and demand, and of marginal decision-making were not going to make people leap to accept his later analyses of a random set of big policy issues.Indeed, it turned out that no member of the group had changed their mind about any of the political issues he discussed as a result of reading his book. Perhaps a rather less dumbed-down version – making more of use of graphs and numbers - would have had more impact. (And many big issues in economics – such as monetarism and supply side economics – were not touched on at all). But maybe we had all such fixed views on political issues that we were impervious to other opinions. “Freakonomics”, the similar book by Steven Levitt, was less political, more original, and perhaps more successful in making you look at issues differently.Yet for everyone who disliked a particular chapter, it turned out that someone else really liked it. His analysis of why China had succeeded where Cameroon had failed annoyed several – for example because he had not brought out fully that China’s was a planned capitalist economy, or explored the one child policy, or acknowledged the scale of investment that might be needed in Cameroon. Yet others were big fans of this section of the book, including a recent visitor to the failing economy of Burma who could recognise most of what Harford had found in Cameroon. Some thought his analysis of the health sector and insurance issues impeccable, while others strongly disputed it, and so on.Most found something intriguing in the book – such as the discussion of game theory – but what was new for one was old hat for another. And at times it seemed that we had been reading different books – some felt he failed to bring out the importance of the rule of law for allowing capitalism to work effectively, whereas others felt he brought it out particularly well.An oddity that everyone noticed was his tendency to write at some times as if he were American and addressing an American audience, and at some times as if he were British and addressing a British audience. This might reflect his own career background and the markets he hoped to sell in, but it produced a disconcertingly schizophrenic effect. How many Tim Harfords were there? And it aggravated the feelings of those who felt he was already overly pro-American in his policy prescriptions – no mention, for example, of the indifference of the US Government to that country’s massive impact on climate change.But, reader, do not assume from the above that we had a calm, rational and well-structured discussion. The reality was a pinball-machine discussion, ricocheting violently between the price of tomatoes and democracies’ ability to tackle climate change, luridly illuminating Civil Service corruption and the failure of Russian capitalism, and then crashing from irrational packaging taxes to the Rangers/Hearts semi-final via education in India. Occasional efforts to refocus the discussion on the book were brushed aside as we plunged into highways and byways, and as serial shoppers revealed that their supermarket loyalties were of even greater importance than their loyalties to capitalism or socialism.Finally, however, we did reach two points of consensus. One was that structuring governments around legislatures – whether in Scotland, the UK, or the EU – produced an insatiable and undesirable urge to legislate and regulate.The other was that more of us were now looking for own brand bargains on the bottom shelf of supermarkets. Not perhaps as world-changing an outcome as Tim Harford was hoping for from “The Undercover Economist”, but a more tangible product than from some other books…This is an extract from a review at http://monthlybookgroup.wordpress.com/.

20,0195189779,http://goodreads.com/user/show/73813903-aisha-ayoosh,4,"This is a nice light read for anyone interested in economics explained in Layman’s terms. Tim Harford explains fundamental facts about free markets and decision-making. These ideas are easy to grasp as he illustrates with an impressive number of examples, some of which include buying second-hand cars, game theory in auction settings, why healthcare works in very different ways among countries, the impact of corruption on growth etc. This book will not make you into an economics expert, but, as it promises to, it will leave you thinking like an economist.Let’s just say I walk into a supermarket with a very different view now 😉 "
21,0195189779,http://goodreads.com/user/show/35724109-david,4,"Enjoyable read. A well-written, clever view of many of the most practical concepts in economics. "
22,0195189779,http://goodreads.com/user/show/79919281-tawfiq-hamid,4,"Really good read, interesting, informative and nicely written. Not as fun or easy to read as freakonomics but I think it's a lot more insightful into the modern world. The author presents a lot of fundamental/introductory economic ideas and then extends them to tackle big social, political and economic problems of the modern world. Really answering some of the big questions about why our current political economic climate is the way it is. Tackles a lot of big misconceptions along the way and highlights what we can do to fix things. Great read, really enjoyed it, just a bit dense at times. "
23,0195189779,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1385106-jamie,3,"Following my recent interest in books on the psychology of decision-making and behavioral economics, I thought it might be interesting to read up on some actual economics. I had gotten some of this out of Freakonomics and Superfreakonomics by Levitt and Dubner, but Tim Harford's Undercover Economist is a little less afraid to throw in actual economic theory and terms. So you get explanations of ""perfect"" markets, inefficiencies, externalities, and other economic jargon.Which isn't to say that the book isn't interesting. In fact, Harford has a great style, and like those other books he couches his discussion of economics in everyday things that we're all familiar with: buying a cup of coffee, health insurance, traffic, and orange juice. My favorite parts of the book were where he would look at very practical problems from a consumer's point of view, such as why you have to pay so much more for coffee in certain locations and why ""fancy"" gourmet grocery stores will stock some of the same products as their bargain bin competitors, but use it to influence different purchasing patterns.But there's also larger scale discussions about China's economic recovery (which I found really fascinating), the influence of corruption on small countries, and globalization. It's interesting to see how an economist approaches these issues with an ultra rational approach to decision-making, and it's pretty shocking to see the extremes to which that kind of thinking can you lead you --some of Harford's propositions would nip problems like cross-town traffic or public health in the bud, but they may offend our sense of justice in the process. And Harford is grounded enough in reality to cop to that kind of thing, up to the point where you get just a little feeling of world weariness and cynicism. But not too much."
24,0195189779,http://goodreads.com/user/show/8372692-kevin-dary,4,"I laughed a little when i finished the book to realized that the book itself was a way to make me buy the book using its own strategy. In a sense , I meant to say that by putting the topic ""coffee"" as a first topic it attracted my attention such as raising prices and sugar coating products to sell out to price sensitive customers who was willing to buy what was worth more than price.Tim harford nether less tackles the basics of economics in his book by showing us the first part of his book in a micro-economic introduction to the second half of a macro economic. From talking about coffee prices , why companies offer discounts to nearby employees all the way from health care and china ""getting rich"". The book was not a complex economic book to understand and anyone without a economic background could easily be drag in to economics and learn to question why prices are different in different places. Even though Harford book was very informative , well-written and entertaining. I was hoping for a book that has a more information about mircoeconomics. Although many do argue that the topic about healthcare and china was underlooked the interesting part about"" Why is wine always very expensive in restaurants ? Because one of the big costs in a restaurant is table space. Restaurants would therefore like to charge customers for dawdling, but because they can't do that, they charge higher prices for products that tend to be consumed in longer meals, like wine, appetizers and desserts."" Should be something interesting to at least read about. "
25,0195189779,http://goodreads.com/user/show/25277659-george-roper,3,"This was an admirable attempt by the author to make economic theory much more accessible to the casual reader of the subject. Harford does a very good job explaining some of the basic fundamental concepts (e.g., law of diminishing returns) and some much more complex ones (e.g., some of the principles of game theory). The chapter on the auctioning of “air” (radio spectrum) was brilliant.However, the book, after a very strong first half, meanders in the last half and suffers from gross oversimplification in its analysis of what makes some countries poorer than others. Assertions are made without adequate supporting evidence proffered to justify the author’s statements, e.g., Harford states that China must have a good education system since he was beaten at chess by a polite Chinese national! And to add insult to injury, in his comparison of rich versus poor countries – and the cause of their respective lots – he totally ignores imperialism, slavery and their cousin systematic racism! Shocking.Comparing Cameroon with China was not of much value to me - the two countries are galaxies apart in terms of intrinsic factors from which they would derive their respective ""comparative advantages"" (a concept explained in the book). It would have been better to do a comparison between Cameroon and other francophone African countries with a much more similar heritage, history, population size and reservoirs of natural resources.Half-way through the book I was certain I would have rated this 4 stars…by its end I was struggling to justify why I should rate it at 3."

By using contemporary examples (such as the various factors that influence the price of a cup of coffee), Mr Harford removes some of the mystery and explains how some of the conclusions consumers may draw can be both logical, and flawed. While this won’t make your coffee any cheaper, it may make some decisions more informed. And you can always strike up a conversation with your fellow coffee aficionados about the analysis of coffee rents. Just wait until they’ve had at least one coffee first.Readers should note that this book addresses market behaviour rather than social issues. Most readers will consider sweatshops to be inherently bad: however the alternatives for the participants need to be considered as well.Like other books in this field, this could be a starting point for discussion. Knowing more about the way in which supply, demand and the markets which address both work gives some insight into a field which is often seen as full of dry, mechanistic arcana. Who knows? You may even understand the used car market."

Starting with the laws of supply and demand, working through externality charges and the stock market and getting to foreign trade and taxation policies, The Undercover Economist is the perfect half-way point between ""Economics for Dummies"" (I imagine) and every economics textbook ever (I guess, from the few I've unfortunately sampled). It does a great job at explaining terms and linking the concepts to real life, whether he's discussing the price of an espresso or the incredible rise of China's economics. Still, 4 stars because it did occasionally feel a bit ""I hold the absolute truth""-y. Apparently there's a sequel, so that's going on my wishlist."

Harford throughout the course of this book, engages in insightful discussions on topics as wide ranging and diverse as 'Who pays for your coffee?' to discussing the impacts of globalization and market based reforms in China. The book provides plenty of thoughtful(and thought-provoking) analysis and tries to propose effective and efficient solutions to the problems, from an economist's standpoint.

Who, after all, could boast of being able to grow, pick, roast, and blend coffee, raise and milk cows, roll steel and mold plastics and assemble them into an espresso machine, and, finally, shape ceramics into a cute mug? Your cappuccino reflects the outcome of a system of staggering complexity. There isn’t a single person in the world who could produce what it takes to make a cappuccino. The economist knows that the cappuccino is the product of an incredible team effort. Not only that, there is nobody in charge of the team.page 14 | location 207-209 | Added on Monday, 23 June 2014 04:47:02When Cornelius arrived, the grassland became the marginal land, meadows became yet more attractive relative to the marginal land, and so the landlords were able to raise the rent on meadows again. It’s important to note here that there is no absolute value: everything is relative to that marginal land.page 15 | location 221-222 | Added on Monday, 23 June 2014 04:49:08The willingness to pay top dollar for convenient coffee sets the high rent, and not the other way around.page 24 | location 355-359 | Added on Monday, 23 June 2014 22:21:43If I want to know whether I am being ripped off by supermarkets, banks, or drug companies, I can find out how profitable those industries are. If they are making high profits, then initially I am suspicious. But if it seems that it is fairly easy to set up a new company and compete, I become less suspicious. It means that the high profits are caused by a natural scarcity: there are not many really good banking organizations in the world, and good banking organizations are much more efficient than bad ones.page 34 | location 520-524 | Added on Monday, 23 June 2014 22:40:01Fair trade coffee associations make a promise to the producer, not the consumer. If you buy fair trade coffee, you are guaranteed that the producer will receive a good price. But there is no guarantee that you will receive a good price. The truth is that fair trade coffee wholesalers could pay two, three, or sometimes four times the market price for coffee in the developing world without adding anything noticeable to the production cost of a cappuccino, because coffee beans make up such a small proportion of that cost. Charging an extra ten pence gave a misleading impression of how much it really cost to get hold of that fair trade coffee.page 44 | location 661-663 | Added on Monday, 23 June 2014 23:00:59My recommendation, if you are convinced of the merits of organic food, is not to let food retailers exploit your enthusiasm: vote with your wallet by supporting any retailer—or direct supplier—who brings the price of organic and nonorganic food closer together.page 46 | location 693-696 | Added on Monday, 23 June 2014 23:04:44So here’s my advice: if you want a bargain, don’t try to find a cheap store. Try to shop cheaply. Similar products are, very often, priced similarly. An expensive shopping trip is the result of carelessly choosing products with a high markup, rather than wandering into a store with “bad value,” because price-targeting accounts for much more of the difference between prices than any difference in value between one store and another.page 48 | location 728-731 | Added on Monday, 23 June 2014 23:09:05But this is an example of a universal truth about supermarkets: they are full of close (or not so close) substitutes, some cheap, some expensive, and with a strong random element to the pricing. The random element is there so that only shoppers who are careful to notice, remember, and compare prices will get the best bargains. If you want to outwit the supermarkets, simple observation is your best weapon. And if you can’t be bothered to do that, you really don’t need to save money.page 52 | location 787-788 | Added on Monday, 23 June 2014 23:15:13So, like the lack of tables in coach-class trains and the uncomfortable seats in airport lounges, the ugly packaging of “value” products is designed to make sure that snooty customers self-target price increases on themselves.page 53 | location 807-811 | Added on Monday, 23 June 2014 23:17:48Services and convenience products are the most fertile grounds for price-targeting strategies, because they don’t leak. The really great pricing tricks take place on airlines, in restaurants and cocktail bars (not many bookstores have a “happy hour”), in supermarkets, and at tourist attractions. In contrast, some products are inherently leaky: they’re expensive, easy to transport, and nonperishable. The obvious examples are digital media (CDs, DVDs, and software) and pharmaceuticals.page 67 | location 1022-1025 | Added on Tuesday, 24 June 2014 22:14:32Because Western society relies heavily on free markets, we find it difficult to imagine what it would be like if we didn’t, or to take a step back and see quite how profound the effect of the market is. Yet any modern democracy provides goods outside the market system, and looking at the way such goods are provided gives us a hint of the strengths and weaknesses of markets. Think of your friendly local police force, which is paid for by a nonmarket system of taxation.page 69 | location 1057-1059 | Added on Tuesday, 24 June 2014 22:18:23Nonmarket systems have their advantages, but they also lose something important: information, information about wants, needs, and desires, and about inconveniences and costs. Sometimes the loss of information is worthwhile because it is offset by gains in equality or stability.page 107 | location 1632-1637 | Added on Wednesday, 25 June 2014 22:23:37Most economics has very little to do with GDP. Economics is about who gets what and why. Clean air and smooth-flowing traffic are part of the “economy” in this sense. It’s possible that congestion charging would increase GDP because people would get to work more quickly and produce more, and prices in stores would be lower because of more efficient distribution. But it’s perfectly possible that congestion charging would reduce GDP. This does not, in fact, matter in the slightest. We know for certain that it would make us better off in a much more meaningful sense: that we would have many new choices open to us about where we go and what we do. There is much more to life than what gets measured in accounts. Even economists know that.page 109 | location 1669-1673 | Added on Wednesday, 25 June 2014 22:28:46Anyone who has ever tried to buy a secondhand car will appreciate that Akerlof was on to something. The market doesn’t work nearly as well as it should; secondhand cars tend to be cheap and of poor quality. Sellers with good cars want to hold out for a good price, but because they cannot prove that a good car really is a peach, they cannot get that price and prefer to keep the car for themselves. You might expect that the sellers would benefit from their inside information, but in fact there are no winners: smart buyers simply don’t show up to play a rigged game.page 111 | location 1702-1705 | Added on Wednesday, 25 June 2014 22:33:12Health insurance is important because illnesses are extremely unpredictable and sometimes cost a lot to treat. Not only can some medical treatment be very expensive, it is often impossible to postpone it until a more convenient moment. It can also coincide with periods of low income because people are more likely to need medical care after retirement, and because those who need medical care may also be too ill to work.page 114 | location 1743-1745 | Added on Wednesday, 25 June 2014 22:39:26Since insurance depends on mutual ignorance, then any advance in medical science, which pushes back the boundaries of ignorance—whether for the insurers, the insured, or both, will weaken the basis of insurance. The more we know, the less we can insure. This is a worrying prospect if we want to give people a chance to protect themselves against the high costs of bad luck.page 116 | location 1775-1777 | Added on Wednesday, 25 June 2014 22:42:48The employers are willing to do this despite the fact that the philosophy degree itself does not improve the candidate’s productivity at all. It is merely a credible signal, because a philosophy degree is too much trouble for lazy, dumb people to acquire. Since Spence himself majored in philosophy at Princeton, perhaps there is something in his idea.page 133 | location 2037-2042 | Added on Saturday, 28 June 2014 12:11:43In the case of health care, the market works poorly because while we want the reassurance of knowing they can afford expensive medical bills, inside information eats away at the insurance by driving away low-risk customers and forcing premiums to rise. Private companies have developed ways to get around the problem, but they are expensive and bureaucratic. Singapore’s government had the power to tackle the problem head on, by using forced saving and catastrophe insurance to make sure costs were manageable but keeping the power of patient choice at the heart of the system. Governments can replace markets, but they will often do better to try to fix them. They are unlikely to succeed unless they appreciate exactly what the problem is in the first place.page 146 | location 2232-2244 | Added on Sunday, 29 June 2014 22:29:18The hidden premise is that if we are in an economic revolution, shares should be very valuable. This premise is wrong. Shares should rise in price only if there’s good reason to think that future profits will be high. As we know, profits derive from scarcity; for instance, ownership of scarce land (protected by legal title), a scarce brand (protected by trademark), or an organization with unique capabilities (protected by nothing more than the fact that most effective organizations are hard to copy). So share prices should rise only if economic transformation increases the degree to which organizations control scarce resources. It’s easy to see that there might be a link between economic transformation and the control of scarcity. It’s far less easy to see what it is, and it seems unlikely that it is as straightforward as “new technologies will increase corporate control of scarce resources.” Some companies will gain; others will lose. Historically, there has been no clear link between economic transformation and high profits for the average company. In fact, the reverse is often true: economic transformation destroys the profitability of old firms (by replacing or duplicating their scarce assets), while the new firms that replace them often face a high failure rate and very large costs of building their businesses. The advantages are enjoyed by workers who are paid higher wages on average and by customers who pay lower prices or get new and better goods and services. For example, Amazon’s profits of $30 million in 2003 should be weighed against the fall in global music industry profits of around $2.5 billion in the same year, a drop that industry executives blame on Internet music downloads and easy piracy. The Internet can destroy profits as well as enable them.page 167 | location 2549-2557 | Added on Monday, 7 July 2014 23:11:10Game theorists have an alternative explanation: bidders were learning from each others’ bids about what the 3G licenses were likely to be worth. This was one of the advantages of the auction’s transparent design. A commonly used alternative would simply have been to run a “sealed bid” auction where everyone handedin an envelope containing a single bid. But such an auction would have left every bidder guessing in the dark, probably leading to much more conservative bidding and a much less profitable outcome for the government. With an open auction, even when the bidding rose higher than anyone had expected, each bidder could see that its twelve competitors were making equally large offers and shared confidence that the licenses would prove hugely valuable. Each company had its own business plan, its own technology partners, its own sales projections. All of these were speculative, but the transparent auction gathered signals of these plans together and put the information at the disposal of all the bidders. (The auction also put the information at the disposal of the government and collected revenue on that basis at the same time—all very neat.)page 169 | location 2579-2584 | Added on Monday, 7 July 2014 23:14:14We learned way back in chapters 1 and 2 that firms will charge the maximum they possibly can, under any circumstance. We also know that their ability to do this is limited by their scarcity power. For the UK, the crucial determinant is that there are five licenses. Five licenses are few enough to give each company enoughscarcity power to be able to charge quite high prices. If only two licenses were available, then the scarcity power would be greater and the prices would be higher. If twenty licenses were available, the scarcity power would be less and the prices would be lower. It is the scarcity power, and not the price of the licenses, which determines the price for customers.page 194 | location 2962-2966 | Added on Friday, 11 July 2014 13:40:11Regardless of who was in charge, Bruges continued to prosper: it was the center of gravity for the Hanseatic League of trading cities, its arts scene was flourishing, it was developing new industries such as cutting diamonds from India, and its population was twice that of London.

It does not matter if the Chinese really are better than we are at making everything: they should stick to producing whatever their economy is most efficient at turning out.

Growing them in Iowa makes use of a special technology that turns wheat into Toyotas: simply put the wheat onto ships and send them out into the Pacific ocean. The ships come back a short while later with Toyotas on them. The technology used to turn wheat into Toyotas out in the Pacific is called “Japan,” but it could just as easily be a futuristic biofactory floating off the coast of Hawaii. Either way, auto workers in Detroit are in direct competition with farmers in Iowa. Import restrictions on Japanese cars will help the auto workers and hurt the farmers: they are the modern-day equivalent of “frame breaking.”page 204 | location 3114-3117 | Added on Friday, 11 July 2014 14:02:06Between 1993 and 2002, almost 310 million jobs were lost in the United States. Over the same period, more than 327 million jobs were created. Nearly 18 million more people had jobs in 2002 than in 1993. Each of the 310 million times somebody lost a job, that person was entitled to sympathy and to help, whether or not foreign competition had anything to do with it. Trade or no trade, a healthy economy loses jobs all the time, and creates them as well.page 205 | location 3134-3137 | Added on Friday, 11 July 2014 14:30:26Foreign investment is widely recognized to be good for economic growth in poor countries: it is an excellent way for them to create jobs, learn cutting-edge techniques, and do so without having to invest their own scarce money. Unlike investments in shares, currency, or bonds, foreign direct investment cannot quickly be reversed in a panic.

But 0.5 percent of Western Europe’s imports in 2000 were from the least developed countries, down from 1 percent in 1980. For Japan, the figure is 0.3 percent, down from 1 percent. And for all the major world traders put together, the percentage of their imports from the least developed countries is 0.6 percent,down from 0.9 percent twenty years before. For the really poor countries, their problem certainly isn’t excessive participation in the world trading system. A similar story holds true for foreign investment.page 207 | location 3172-3177 | Added on Friday, 11 July 2014 14:41:32If American environmental standards are really so strict, why do the most pollution-intensive American firms spend only 2 percent of their revenues on dealing with pollution? Most spend much less. When companies move abroad they are seeking cheap labor, not a pollution haven. And companies do not pollute for fun; the latest manufacturing techniques are often cheaper and less polluting at the same time. Energy efficiency, for instance, saves money and reduces pollution. This is why many companies regard environmental performance as part of general quality control and good efficient manufacturing. Even if it was possible to save some costs by cutting environmental corners, many firms build factories everywhere in the world using the same latest, cleanest technology from the developed world, simply because that kind of standardization itself saves costs.page 232 | location 3554-3555 | Added on Sunday, 13 July 2014 14:52:03Markets do not work well without market-supporting institutions: in a market economy, people need banks for commercial loans, contract law to resolve disputes, and confidence that their profits will not be confiscated. Such institutions cannot be set up overnight.page 242 | location 3710-3711 | Added on Sunday, 13 July 2014 15:11:45In the end, economics is about people—something that economists have done a very bad job at explaining.

Modern examples such as the location of Starbucks and the cost of a double latte grande clarify the points completely.In the second half of the book, Harford moves into the realm of macroeconomics dealing with issues such as taxation, government subsidies, incentives and disincentives related to externalities, the seemingly endless cycle of poverty in third world countries, the theory of comparative advantages, third world dictatorship and communist government policies as contrasted with democratic capitalist economies, education and so on.Not quite a treatise on macroeconomics, Harford makes the subject infinitely more interesting by exploring the margins of the topic and explaining how such macroeconomic considerations drift into the world of microeconomics and affect such basics as pricing, supply, demand, production and incentives.Perhaps the most interesting chapter in the entire book was Harford's brief explanation of the mathematics of game theory and how economic game theorists constructed a series of government auctions to attempt to sell frequencies for cellphone licences to the highest bidding communications companies. The devil was obviously in the details as one auction succeeded beyond the wildest expectations of the government policy wonks whereas another garnered less than 1% of the anticipated revenue for the sale. Another chapter that will raise more than a few eyebrows explained in some depth why the world should welcome the globalization of trade and the elimination of trade barriers entirely.Informative and entertaining, somewhat more academic in approach than the likes of Freakonomics, The Undercover Economist is good reading for anyone who would like to have a deeper understanding of what makes the world's economies tick.Paul Weiss"

I enjoyed the book and its reasoning, which led me to his podcast and now this book. In this book, I loved the way the author explained his point of view and help understand ""how things work in the modern world"" to people who are not from an economics background without the economics jargon. He talks at length about various events that we notice in daily lives like the price of coffee, traffic jams, high health insurance premium and difficulty in selling the second-hand car. He introduced economics concepts like scarcity power, game theory, inside information, and market power. Through powerful, relatable examples, he helped me understand the viewpoint of the economist, how they think and how they expect people to behave.Towards the end, he talks about globalization, how(or rather why) poor countries remain poor and how Chine grew to its current position from multiple economic and political failure.A good read for non-economics background people to grasp the concepts of economy."

It tried to be topical and engaging and for the most part it was. Its greatest fault is that it is on a topic that bores me to tears. Its not the book or the authors fault that this is the case but it is my review so there you have it. Why would I read something that is so obviously going to be unenjoyable for me, you might ask? Well its for the same reason I slogged through Joyce's Ulysses or read the New York Times to learn something I don't know. This does an admirable job of doing this.

Fast forward was used often while I listened to this one- and I don't think I missed that much."

However, I learned a lot in the book and thoroughly enjoyed most of it.

49,0195189779,http://goodreads.com/user/show/36400626-pranav-hundekari,4,"Tim Harford is a British Economist, who through ‘The Undercover Economist’ introduces us to some of the basics principles of Economics. Looking at our day to day world, through the eyes of an economist, he manages to explain the otherwise boring (and complex) concepts like demand-supply, externalities, international trade, auctions, comparative advantage, Government policy and globalization. The book is divided into 10 chapters. Each chapter is a case study in which Harford explains the economics behind familiar things.The book begins with the economics of the reason behind, why coffee at prime locations is much costlier than on other locations. It explains the concepts of Marginal Cost/Benefit with examples of the effects of rents on meadows, grasslands and scrub-lands. He explains the same concept with a set Banks each providing services of diminishing quality to other. With these examples we get to understand a model, which Harford projects on the initial coffee problem. Through out the book, Harford has used this multi pronged approach to making us understand a concept.In the next chapter, the book explains the hidden truths behind the pricing of products and how it really influences consumer choices. In the 'Perfect markets and the World Truth’ chapter, we are taken into a fantasy trip where 'everyone speaks the truth’, or markets are free, competitive and complete. This unreal chapter is used to show us where the problems arise in the real world as we step away from the perfect world. Armed with this knowledge the book goes on to show us ways of dealing with problems in the society like pollution, congestion etc. Here, Harford stresses the point that economics is not just about numbers like GDP, GNP but it can be and must be used to solve day to day problems and help common people make better choices in their life. Through various stories in this chapter he introduces us to a complex concept like the Externality charge with utmost simplicity.The Fifth chapter discusses the effects of Inside Information on second hand car sales. Harford then extrapolates the model of car sales to the dynamics of pricing Health Insurance. The Sixth chapter is about the 'Rational Insanity’ used in making decisions related to investing in the stock markets, especially when having a strategy against the ‘Irrationally Sane’ view held by rest of the market experts. Next, the book focuses on the outcomes of Auction of 3G bandwidths in various countries and explains them using the Game Theory. Again, he doesn’t bother with explaining the intricacies of the theory itself, but keeps it simple enough for us to get the concept. The last three chapters discuss Government policies and their economic as well as cultural impacts on the nations. Harford shows how countries like Cameroon remain poor despite receiving huge amount of funding. Despite the enterprising nature of its citizens, he shows why the governments choose to remain corrupt. Further he discusses the efficacy of sweatshops in bringing nations out of poverty through global trades. Lastly he uses the case of China’s rapid growth to point out why it worked in China but hasn’t worked at all in Cameroon or as effectively in countries like India.When you start to read the book, you might quickly classify the book in the same category as Stephen J. Dubner and Steven D. Levitt’s Freakonomics or Malcom Gladwell’s Tipping Point. Yes, the book seems to have a similar style but isn’t that exciting to read as those books. It is appropriate to say that this is a book for someone who is beginning to study Economics as a subject rather than someone who wants to be amazed by Economic Wizardry. Having said that, the book presents some advanced concepts with such simplicity and with so many examples that any reader will understand them, even if she/he doesn’t enjoy them."
50,0195189779,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5993493-neeraj-bali,3,"The book began interestingly for me, dissecting the ‘secret’ of high prices of common goods – coffee being the centre of the author’s attention. The dots he joins from advantage of ‘location’ to ‘cost of owning or renting real estate to sell products’ to ‘the power of scarcity’ was illuminating in a rudimentary way. Indeed, the advantage enjoyed by those who sell what is scarce runs right through the book like a silent stream.Scarcity is relative, of course, and shifts from situation to situation – even person to person. For me the great lesson was that prices are essentially determined by the willingness of the people to pay. Hence, if one refuses to be seduced by allure of big brand names and glitz of malls, one can avoid the trap of being seduced by high-priced goods.Often, interest groups cause scarcity to ensure uninterrupted existence of scarcity. High wages are maintained by doctors, lawyers and other professions (Chartered Accountants in India!) by keeping the supply of their ilk low.The other big lesson that I learnt is that based on the logic that businesses can only charge what the customers are willing to pay, businesses devise strategies to determine who will pay more. Hence there is a regular cappuccino and then, for those who are not price sensitive, there are variants that charge far more than the difference in producing them vis a vis a regular cappuccino. Supermarkets price their goods based on the type of clientele they expect – are its customers more likely to treat fruit-juice as a luxury or they will want it anyway because it is a permanent fixture at their breakfast table? Hence, don’t waste your time finding a cheap store, advises the author; instead shop cheaply, looking for bargains wherever you go. Tim Harford is an unabashed supporter of the free-market system. He argues, with a great deal of success, that ‘you can’t get more efficient than a perfectly competitive market’. Prices, he deduces, are true representation of the cost to the company and value to the customer. Free markets have a natural way to ferret out information on the true needs, desires, wants and costs. When markets are not free or government controlled, much of this information is lost and hence the decisions are not cost-effective.But what about ‘fairness’? Harford arrives at the conclusion that free-markets can be made perfectly fair by adjusting the starting blocks for different strata of people. Skilful use of taxation is part of that solution.There are three issues that need to be addressed if free-markets are to work well. The power of scarcity is one; the availability of information so that informed decisions can be made is another. Finally, markets do not work well when some people make decisions that affect others – the bystanders are affected by those who are buying petrol, for example. This factor is called ‘externality’ and needs to be addressed by economists. An externality charge imposed on those who intend to drive cars into the crowded city-centre is an example.The book also discusses the reasons for profitability of companies. What matters is not that you get there first but that you continue to produce something that others cannot or do not. This would explain the relative decline of Microsoft and current supremacy of Google and Facebook.Finally the book discusses why poor countries are poor and why China has risen so dramatically. It is all about free-markets, goes the refrain. The argument is persuasive but then, I suppose, so would be the counter if presented side-by-side.Interesting but simplistic!"
51,0195189779,http://goodreads.com/user/show/25371127-rossdavidh,3,"It is, in some sense, unfair to be reviewing this book now. Tim Harford is, primarily, an orthodox economist, and it is not a good time to be defending orthodox economics. He wrote the book in 2005, after Enron but before Lehman Brothers (both nouns which now represent events more than companies), and in it you will find little analysis of how either came to pass. Which is something like reading a book on the Internet that doesn't mention viruses, or a book on biology that never mentions death or disease.It does, however, not shun entirely the unpleasant side of economics. There are, for example, highly readable and convincing analyses of Starbucks, tourist traps, and used cars.Harford's purpose in this book seems to be, to bring economic analysis to bear on parts of the economy which we actually encounter in real life. Why does Starbucks have so many different things on its menu, with such different prices, when basically their costs are determined almost entirely by rent? Why are the restaurants near major tourist sites so often bad and overpriced? Why is it so hard to buy a good used car? What is going wrong with our health insurance system?The two biggest new concepts, for the average reader, are the consequences of asymmetric information, and the many businesses that try to sell the same product at different prices to different customers (cheap for those who will only buy cheap, expensive for those who are willing to). Harford's analysis of how this makes Fair Trade coffee more expensive than regular (even though the money paid to coffee farmers is still a tiny portion of the total cost), and how the used car market is fundamentally broken if you don't have enough people who can evaluate a used car, unless nobody knows how to evaluate a used car in which case everything is fine, is highly readable and seems to have more to do with reality than most economics.Missing from Harford's analysis is any mention of how internet availability of information could be expected to change this. If people can find information more easily, from more sources (for example, knowing which restaurants near tourist traps are overpriced and low quality), wouldn't we expect something to change? It would also have been nice to see some application of this to the ever-increasing complexity of financial products (one of the prime drivers behind the current financial crisis seems to have been the growing opacity of the true value of the properties banks were trading, compared to the simple mortgages of several decades ago).However, while it doesn't answer such questions, it does an excellent job of giving you the mental framework to ask them (and perhaps answer them) yourself. In the long run, this is likely to be more important. The fundamental message of Harford's book is that economics is happening around you every day, and you need to know how it works just as you need to know how the food you eat impacts your health. Harford's book is light on abstract models, and heavy on real-world examples and analysis; it's made for people to use in their real life. That is a direction we could all wish the rest of his field would move."
52,0195189779,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5675365-simon-howard,4,"It takes a special kind of effort to be so behind the times that I’m reviewing The Undercover Economist more than three years after it was published, despite having it on my “must read” list for most of that time. As a fan of Tim Harford’s contributions to the Financial Times and his presentation of More or Less, I had great expectations for this book – and I wasn’t disappointed.The Undercover Economist seeks to explain the economic theories underpinning everyday life, from buying a coffee to shopping in a supermarket. I was passingly familiar with most of the theories being discussed, as I would imagine that most people would be, but Harford does a good job of fleshing out the details, equipping the reader with economic vocabulary, and showing how the theories work in everyday situations.Harford is clearly an excellent writer, and the book zips along at a fair lick for the most part. There are, however, some parts that drag a little. Occasionally, Harford goes to some lengths to explain the same theories repeatedly in different situations in a way that becomes a little repetitive and unnecessary in parts. I sometimes felt like the speed of the repeated explanations was a little slow, as though I was some way ahead of the book. This was a bit frustrating. But it’s not a major issue. I guess what I’m saying is that a well-abridged version of the book would be no bad thing.There are also bits of the book where I feel like Harford strays a little too far into relating a particular point of view, rather than setting out the wider picture as I would expect from a book like this. I am actually interested in Harford’s opinions on globalisation, for example, but don’t think that this is necessarily the place to communicate his point of view (almost) exclusively. I felt that a little more balance would have been welcome in this introductory book.But these are niggles. Economics is often portrayed as dry and theoretical, and The Undercover Economist shows it to be anything but. It sheds light on the economic decisions we all make everyday, and the way that we are economically manipulated by corporations and governments – for better or worse. It is absorbing and enjoyable – not words that necessarily spring to mind for books about this particular subject matter.So whilst there were some rough edges, I enjoyed The Undercover Economist. And perhaps the best I can say is that the sequel is on my “must read” list… and I think I’ll get to it some time before 2017!This review was originally published on my blog, at http://sjhoward.co.uk/archive/2014/01..."
53,0195189779,http://goodreads.com/user/show/31075902-novem,2,"The book's okay. I feel many of the things Hartford mentions have been mentioned in greater detail in Paul Krugman's Pop Internationalism and Richard Thaler's The Winner's Curse. Many of the topics were just covered superficially, so maybe I just need to read some of the books that were cited in the bibliography.One argument that he does make, which seems pretty compelling is that fixing environmental problems by limiting trade is like throwing out the baby with the bath water. Yes, trade liberalization can lead to some bad outcomes like monocultures because farmers want to maximize their income by planting only crops that can be exported. BUT, trade restrictions don't necessarily improve environmental conditions either and agricultural subsidies can lead to some pretty bad environmental outcomes too. He argues that what we really need are direct environmental regulations that limit herbicide/pesticide use instead of indirectly trying to fix environmental problems by restricting trade, which makes sense. Also, he cites some interesting findings on air quality being negatively correlated with foreign investment -- this is based a paper by David Wheeler in 2001 on China, Brazil and Mexico. I did a quick Google Scholar search on ""air quality"" and ""foreign investment"" and found that there are papers that found the opposite pattern though, so I'm not sure if increasing globalization necessarily fixes environmental problems either.Small nitpicky thing: some of the examples he uses feel really dated. One of them is literally from another time: he cites Keynes's example of readers choosing which girl will be voted the prettiest by all readers as analogous to picking which stocks will perform the best. And there's an example where bad economic decisions will mean ""[y]ou're left homeless and nearly penniless, your wife divorces you."" For me, it's like getting economic advice/lessons from a slightly embarrassing uncle who occasionally makes inappropriate comments about women's appearances or wives' financial dependence on their husbands. You know he means well, but you can't help cringing a bit."

It is about 90 % easy and 10% very in depth and complicated when covering complex subjects like auction theory- at no point does Hartford treat you like an idiot. NOTESP.32The facts support the application of Ricardo's theory to immigration. Skilled immigrants lower the wages of skilled natives, and unskilled immigrants lower the wages of unskilled natives. In the UK, the salaries of nurses in the National Health Service have been kept low by the influx of thirty thousand foreign nurses; immigrants in the UK are nearly 50% more likely than natives to have a university degree. In contrast, in the Unites States, which takes in a far higher percentage of low skilled immigrants than the UK does, it is unskilled wages that have stayed low: the income of unskilled workers has barely kept pace with inflation for the last forty years. David Ricardo, was an early campaigner for free trade. He won a seat in 1819 when he campaigned for the repeal of the Corn Laws, which severely restricted the import of grain. Ricardo's theories had demonstrated clearly that the Corn Laws were shovelling money into the pockets of landlords at the expense of everyone else in the country. Ricardo was not content simply to observe the effects of the Corn Laws, he wanted to abolish them. Theory of Price Targeting The 'World of Truth' -- price as a way of determining value which is interfered with when market is not left. This is why it is difficult to determine value on public spending - each voter will say they want well funded education and NHS, but whereas if they were consuming some would pay more for NHS and more for education, signalling the value of these services, there is no such clear cut way of determining how to allocate funds centrally to take into account these preferences. Basic premise is that markets do do a good job of processing complex information- but overlooks that markets are made up of individuals which as the 2008 crash shows us, aren't necessarily any better at processing complex information than governments, and similarly don't always have the best interests of the public at heart. p.82 Kenneth Arrow received the Nobel Prize for economics for fairness vs efficiency. ""He proves that not only are all perfect markets efficient, all efficient outcomes can be achieved using a competitive market, by adjusting the starting position.""

Seems to be against progressive taxation, rather the is more in favour of making ""lump sum payments and levying one time taxes"" but doesn't provide any examples so unclear what this means.

Britain spends less per person THAN THE AMERICAN GOVERNMENT but still manages to provide free health care for everyone. US spending on health care per person is the highest in the world, factoring insurance, private health care and government. ""Moral hazard"" p.140 if you compensate people when bad things happen to them, they are more likely to be careless. Does this apply when governments agree to prop up banks? Yes, but in case of 2008 there was basically no alternative, the carnage to people's lives would be too great. Needed a degree of separation before the crash; once the crash arrived we had no alternative but to intervene. 147 NICE calculates the impact of health treatment in Quality Adjusted Life Years or QUALYS. Hartford in favour of efficient private health care in Singapore- but it's not fair!The subprime loan crisis- p.159 ""The financial egg cartons were called mortgage-backed securities, and the rotten eggs that filled them were the now-infamous subprime loans. Banks bought these risky - or 'subprime'- mortgages from 'originators', companies who initially made the loans. The banks then repackaged them into financial products, which provided the rights to a stream of mortgage repayments, and the risks that the mortgage would not be repaid. These loans were individually repackaged many times, like moving eggs between different egg cartons. The interest from each loan or egg would provide an income, but the odds of having a 'rotten' egg (a loan that wouldn't be repaid) was calculated at about 3% so overall not supposed to be that risky. However, in fact the risk was much higher without people realising, as high as 10%. What ends up happening is every time a loan or egg is transferred, the chance of having a carton full of 'rotten' eggs increases with each transfer. The 'rotten' eggs clustered together. Then there was national housing slump. p.167 Damage done to the British economy - could have lowered UK national income by 10%. Hartford suggests situation would have been much worse if we didn't bail out the banks. John Von Neumann invented Game theory. p.186 John Maynard Keynes, the most influential economist of the twenty first century, longed for the day when economists were no longer 'arch theorists' but instead 'rather like dentists' consulted to solve every day problems and give straightforward advice.

Mancur Olson argues that in a dictatorship in an LEDC, the greater the democratic pressure, the more healthy the economy is likely to become , but don't want to tip over into an unstable dictatorship. Elinor Ostrom looked into irrigation in Nepal, and how ineffective bilateral spending was to improve irrigation when actually farmers already had their own measures in place and cooperated with each other. Ha Joon Chang and Hartford disagree as to what extent the economy of South Korea, a development success story, was planned in the 60s and 70s. Hartford claims it wasn't and was unleashed to the market in the 70s, Ha Joon Chang claimed it was planned. "

He seizes your wallets, but asks you both to secretly bid for the cash in the two wallets put together. What should you bid assuming you know the contents of your wallet?Tim Harford, the author of The Undercover Economist, writes a clever, witty column in the Saturday Financial Times. He, typically, picks a silly-sounding quandary posed by a reader, and proceeds to offer an insightful analysis and solution, drawing on ideas in economics and game theory. This book follows a similar pattern though the topics he examines are considerably weightier: they span issues as different as product pricing, trade theory, wireless spectrum auctions, and macroeconomics. He emphasizes familiar themes -- incentive structures determine an economy's path; competitive advantage drives specialization; social capital is essential for economic growth of nations; trade enriches everyone. But, he employs these ideas to debunk many common woolly-headed arguments -- that multinationals impoverish everyone by way of building sweatshops, or that globalization has led to massive environmental degradation.I found the questions in the book very interesting even if, on occasion, I found some of the discussions less than complete. For instance, the chapter on spectrum auctions left me intrigued but none the wiser. The final chapter on the drivers for China's explosive growth is probably the best, and just by itself, well-worth the price of the book."
56,0195189779,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4841374-earl-grey-tea,3,"This was an interesting book that helps explains basic concepts in economics in a manner that many people will be able to comprehend. There aren't any complicated math formulas or graphs to follow, there's just simple (and at time overly simple) explanations about the way things are, such as the price of a cup of coffee.I have to say that the biggest strength of this book is giving nice examples of basic economic principles. If I ever need to introduce economics to a high school student or someone just starting college, I would definitely use some of the situations in the book he describe.My biggest beef with the book will have to be the over simplification of ""how to improve or fix"" a problems in the world. In his section about healthcare, he gave a good overview of some of the basic problems that private and public healthcare systems have. However, when he presents a solution on how to improve the healthcare, he brings out the Singaporean system as the answer. While there are some things that we can learn from this city-state, things are a lot more complicated than that. I have a hard time believing that the US government could convince or force American citizens to have a mandatory savings.In addition to that, the section on the environment seems to have been done a bit too quickly. There were a few examples of why businesses prefer to spend money on reducing pollution in their factors and how the pollution in China is going down despite the country's rapid industrialization. This section seemed a bit over simplified and spurious. As data shows, the downward move in the graph showing Chinese pollution in the early 2000's did not maintain that direction. See Chinese pollution 2012-2015.Overall, Tim Harford does a nice job of giving simple explanations using real world examples of how economics works. I think he should keep his books focused on that aspect instead of trying to tackle complex issues with over simplified notions."

More choice, less fear, less toil, and hardship.If we can be able to view the world like the economist, what is the economist seeing? What could we see? What are the reasons behind all this trading between the nations and business? Who is the one benefited when you are drinking a cup of coffee that you purchased at the end of the corner of the building. If we can be able to see like one of the economists, and we know that the coffee we drink, after all, is a product of a team effort trying to compete with each other to bring it in front of us. Through out the book, the author distinguishes the book into 10 chapters. Some of the chapters which required my extra attention to seek the information from the internet to study the context of his writing and examples. (Self-disclaimer, I'm not a student of economics or business. I have no basic knowledge about economic, I practically learn by reading economic books and actual experience by running a business). If I've read ""The Wealth of Nation"", I believe I can be able to enjoy more of the writing and explanation or speculation of the author. Who pays for your coffee?At first, the author describes how a nation or business can be able to charge or earn a high-profit margin are basically based on the power of scarcity. He even likening the metaphor of ""Farmland and Marginal lands importance"" by interpreting the writing of David Ricardo into coffee bars. ""The common-sense view is that coffee is expensive because the coffee bars have to pay high rent......David Ricardo's model shows us this is wrong because high rent is not an arbitrary of life. It has a cause.....The willingness to pay top whack for convenient coffee sets the high rent, not the other way around. What supermarkets don't want you to knowUniqueness alone wasn't enough to persuade people to pay to cover the business costs. People can always choose for the other more options. During this chapter, the author describes how the company or business trying to use many different approaches to target at the different group of customer to maximize their profit. For instance, Starbuck coffee menu is offering different types of coffee starting from the lower price to higher price. How IBM is manufactured a two completely different printer to target the high and lower segment of the customer with a similar process and same cost. Perfect markets and the 'world of truth'The author is encouraging the free market in this chapter. Because prices are optional, which means people don't buy things that are worthless to them, and people don't sell things that are worth more to them. ""The reason is simple: nobody is forcing them to, which means that most transactions that happen in a free market improve efficiency because they make both parties better off. The example of the perfect markets interconnected like this:Companies are making things the right way.Companies are making the right things.Things are being made in the right proportions.Things are going to the right people.P/S: The author even discusses the taxes efficiency and the non-free market such as government.Crosstown TrafficDuring the previous chapter, the author describes the transactions between the producer and customer are better off without harming others.

For instance, Second-hand car, tourist looking for local restaurants or hotel. All of this can be able to look up on the internet right now at this era.

He trying to address the issue by emphasizing that the public are the one who bears the consequences and how government bailout the wall street banks. (I learned valuable lessons from this chapter, ""Both hi-tech shares on Nasdaq stock exchange and the subprime mortgage-backed securities were badly mispriced. In the dot com crash, it was all too easy for the investors simply to assume the pioneers of new-fangled internet business models must have known what they were doing, and the same overconfidence afflicted investors when it came to the mind-bogglingly complex CDOs-squared and cubed and so forth."")The men who knew the value of nothingIt's fascinating how the radio spectrum is selling by auction thru government to those telecom companies. (I only realized it after reading this chapter). he describes, auctioning is like auctioning air, like playing poker, is a game of great skill, and one that was played for very high stakes indeed. And he likening the game theory into economics which I find it very surprising to read too. Why poor countries are poorEconomic growth came from a combination of man-made resources (road, factories, machines), human resources (education, labor) and technological resources (machinery, etc). But the main reason why poor countries stagnant it's because of the widespread poverty, economic growth running in reverse, and crumbling infrastructure. The most crucial thing to country development it's on the mantra that 'institutions matter'.

He also describes how the free trade is actually improving the living condition in every development countries and improving the individual life. How China grew richHe describes how China grew rich under Mao massive invest in heavy industry and agriculture techniques to feed the whole China vast population. This book not only changed my perspective of ""Capitalism"" or free trade can actually improve people life. But at some point, it has a lot of controversial topics involved in this book which is quite provocative to ponder and much more to learn further. After reading this book, I think I will have a totally different experience when I'm shopping in the supermarket."
58,0195189779,http://goodreads.com/user/show/113627-joyce,0,"Smoothly written and very entertaining introduction to basic economic insights. Makes great use of everyday enterprise, especially coffee stands, to cleverly re-cast some of the greats -- like Ricardo -- who get a bit overlooked today due to their examples being from an agricultural era that is no longer familiar to anyone except historians. I have no idea what images come up in the minds of Millennials when you say words like ""Enclosures"", ""pin factory"", or even ""Fordism""... but I'm thinking that coffeeshops are easier for the modern mind to completely understand than almost any other type of business.On the other hand... I'm not a Millennial but I understand they have a lot less chirpy faith in the market system than this author was selling 10 years ago, now that the levers of inequality have been shown to be working almost unchecked. He highlights the worst failures of government -- basically turning the tragedies of the Mao era into a heavyhanded morality tale which probably also won't be familiar to young people -- while skimming exceptionally lightly over the human costs of global capitalism, which ARE familiar to young people. In some places I couldn't even figure out the logic of his argument: e.g. working-class Americans tend to resent working-class immigrants due to decreased scarcity value... yet apparently there is no corresponding resentment among highly-educated Americans worried about their scarcity value? Author seems to have been an H1B candidate himself, so maybe that colors his arguments. Also this book is anachronistically focused on the ""atoms"" part of the economy at the total expense of the far more consequential ""bits"" part... which might be a flipside of Harford's facility at choosing examples for ease of conceptualization.Still, very worthwhile book that I wish everyone would read... critically :)"
59,0195189779,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5148911-devika,3,"This book is among Steven D. Levitt’s top ten books to read, as well as on the suggested reading list for MPhil. Economics. It was a natural curiosity on my part to order this book just to find out the reason for all the hype. Frankly, this book started on a disappointing note since it outlines basic economic ideas—scarcity, bargaining, Ricardian comparative advantage. But such disappointment was inevitable for any economics student. One has to give Harford the benefit of doubt as the introduction is probably meant for those that are unfamiliar with economic ideas. The specialty of Hartford is his observational skills. He shows how companies like Starbucks and Sainsbury practice price discrimination to the extent that ordering another cup of coffee would never be the same for me. He offers extremely clever analogies for different economic concepts—equating Arrow’s idea (that all efficient outcomes can be achieved using a competitive market and adjusting the starting position) to a 100-metre sprint where a lump-sum tax is equivalent of changing the starting position of the runners but income tax and sales tax are like asking the best runners to run backwards.The chapters where he discusses asymmetric information and auctions were my favorite, probably because I’m partial to mechanism design. But I also loved the last chapter that provides a simple outline of China’s growth as the leadership shifted from Mao to Deng. There are points where Harford’s writing gets a bit dull, yet it’s quite enlightening. This book makes an economics student appreciate the subject more by familiarizing himself/herself with its real world applications. It is a must read for non-economics students as it gives a simple and interesting introduction to what economics is all about. "
60,0195189779,http://goodreads.com/user/show/27895809-katherine-humphrey,3,"I'd like to think that sociology (my subject at university) is always supplemented and supported by contributions from similar fields, like economy. To me, they're both tied up together. But I confess, I get nervous when people start talking about economics, because my conception of it is NUUUUMMMMMBBBEEEERRRRSssss.So when I picked up The Undercover Economist, it was not without a certain amount of trepidation. But read I wanted to, and it had been recommended partly on the strength of being relatively simple to understand. On the whole, I was not disappointed.Admittedly, the section on share prices went over my head because of the numbers going on, but that was only, what, twenty pages' worth? Everything else, Harford simplified with very simple examples and without sounding condescending in anyway: game theory, diminishing returns, externalities, how markets work, scarcity power, and how governments, individuals and groups all contribute toward making things happen. His examples are clear and appropriate and mundane, helping to make a complicated subject much more transparent. Admittedly, some explanations I had to read again, but that's probably got more to do with me and my lack of expertise. I was goign to give this book four stars, because it's well worth reading, but now I've finished it I wouldn't go back into it (unless looking up something). But then I felt like it began to drag towards the end (maybe because I'd sat down with it for so long). The chapter on China's economic growth was mighty interesting, and a nice way to round off the book, sure, but I couldn't help but feel that by that point, I was already impatient for it to be over. I blame the auctions for that. "
61,0195189779,http://goodreads.com/user/show/21136796-boni-aditya,3,"This is a basic beginners level simplified guide to Economics 101. Every Economist is aware of all these principles of free trade of comparative advantage & absolute advantage, of socialism vs Capitalism, The rents vs profits (Capital in 21st Century deals it better), how corruption kills economies (Cameroon example), the fall of socialist economies (Russia, China & India), the power of globalization and trade, poor countries, Nike sweat shops, 3g auctions, different types of auctions, All of which are merely general knowledge to almost all the economics students and finance students across the world.The examples that the author chooses to stress the interesting economic theories are interesting and show how economics makes and breaks the real world rather than any other. Out of the many examples cited. I liked the example of ""Why Should I get a Degree?"" or better yet ""Why does it make sense economically to earn a good for nothing degree even when I have all the knowledge in the field?"" is interesting. May be because it was applicable to my situation a few years ago. But many examples though were intuitive and refer to historical events.Jagadish Bhagwati - mention of him almost five times in specific chapters and attribution to his works is really interesting. The author has a free market approach and libertarian views at heart while composing the book and the idea of leaving it to the market to decide the price of a product and no intervention from the governments.But it would be a sheer re watch of an entire anime series you have already seen! If you have any level of acquaintance with economics you don't have to go through this book - You would be wasting roughly 20 hrs of your life - with respect to your reading abilities."
62,0195189779,http://goodreads.com/user/show/31384949-ian,4,"In the UK Tim Harford presents a radio show called ""More or Less"", which debunks the sort of dubious and selectively presented statistics peddled alike by governments, opposition politicians, NGOs and pressure groups. I occasionally catch the show and it was this knowledge of the author that led me to get this book. As a layman to the subject I found this a thought-provoking read. I didn't read it that quickly, mainly because I would often stop and think about the implications of something I had just read. My interest also waxed and waned across the various chapters but at its best this book was nothing short of fascinating. I didn't think beforehand that I was particularly naive about big corporations, but after reading this I see that I was! Most of all I was astonished at the revelations about IBM and Intel (which I won't describe to avoid spoilers). I also particularly enjoyed the section on the application of Game Theory to devise the format of the auction for 3G mobile phone licences in the UK, something that produced a massive boost for the UK taxpayer and a lot of tears and snotters from the operators of the mobile networks. Overall the author mounts a strong defence of free trade and the free market, so this might not please those with set political views to the contrary, but this book is very far from a paen to unbridled capitalism. Oh, and as promised by the blurb, I really do now know why someone like myself never ends up with a good deal when buying a second hand car!"

On the one hand, this is a more straightforward ""pop econ"" book because it is aimed at actually trying to teach you economics. On the other hand, it doesn't seem to recognize many flaws in the invisible hand.Each chapter focuses on a real-world example of how economics works. This is helpful when thinking about how economics can influence policy, but there's also far too little discussion of where these simplified examples breakdown. There is essentially no recognition of what economics gets wrong in the entire book.The book also struggles because at this point it is dated. Also, it uses data out of context far too frequently to be useful, and it often implies causation from correlation any time it makes ""the market"" look good.But ultimately, the biggest flaw is the one that affects too many economic texts, and the fact that it does not address this is just absurd: it believes in rational actors. At this point, there are far too many examples of the irrationality of human behavior to hold on to this crutch. Human beings are not fully rational creatures, and to pretend like they always act in their self interest is kind of ridiculous. But unfortunately, most of the arguments made in this book hinge on that fact.There was maybe a little extra I learned from this book, but I can't say it's a highly recommended read."
64,0195189779,http://goodreads.com/user/show/15966369-j,3,"A fairly entertaining book that perhaps lacked somewhat in a clear purpose. He examines pertinent questions using Economics in order to show the utility of Economic thinking; this wasn't precisely what I was expecting but the conversational tone and occasional wit was enough to keep me reading. I do wonder about the slant of this book. A staunch Marxist or fashionable academic in the Humanities will be deeply upset by pretty much all of his analyses. I think he certainly overstepped himself logically speaking, sometimes. Most enlightening however is the final chapter (worth reading the whole book for this one) which explicates why China grew so spectacularly in the last twenty years. (Hint: not because of Communism or other leftist fantasies like 'Oh they allowed themselves to first develop outside of neoliberal doctrines') It's quite entertaining to read an economics book like this from pre-2008 and see the difference in thinking - at one point he summarily dismisses the idea of an imminent depression/recession. This is not to detract from the book, after all he himself admitted Economists are no more clairvoyant than the average Joe. Lots of lampooning of holy cows (fair-trade coffee, organic things, buying local, the poor are worse off than they've ever been etc.) which makes me very happy. If you're an ideology-robot, don't bother."
65,0195189779,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5870191-mark-jones,5,"With humour, and style, Tim Harford introduces the reader to the not-so-esoteric word of economics. The awesome power of the market to not just create wealth and redistribute it, but to also dramatically improve people's lives in ways no other system can manage, whilst simultaneously improving efficiency and delivering information becomes shockingly clear, and surprisingly simple! There's a wealth of optimism and hope riding through these pages, not because Tim is an optimistic chap, but because Economic forces have proved to be effective many times, and improvements to people lives where these forces are allowed to flourish are simply a matter of course. I was reminded on many occasions of books on biology, as explaining how simple processes and rules can lead to such staggeringly-complex (and highly effective) systems like the global economy sounds very much like an explanation of how a single cell, under the guidance of genes, with the 'experience' of millions of years of trial and improvement, can form the foundations of a complex machine like the human body.And I can now see that 'sweatshops' are actually not nearly so bad a thing as I once thought!"

Hartford is witty, easy on the eye and has a great way of explaining complex things. But for me it didn't more than that. There is a good deal of oversimplification in the book, and in certain discussions such as why nations are poor he tends to just state conclusions without any facts/arguments, leaving the reader unconvinced. The book tends to move from microeconomics to macroeconomics as the chapters go by, and I felt least impressed by his insights on the latter, especially around globalization. Perhaps the topics are too complex to be covered in a book such as this and he should have stuck to specific, narrow topics such as second hard cars.So overall a good introduction book, but on a lot of topics it will leave you with more questions than answers."
67,0195189779,http://goodreads.com/user/show/36680209-amy,3,"This book started out strong for the amateur economist (average reader), discussing coffee, cars, and other common transactions. The author did a good job describing the interconnectedness, hidden costs, and the relative value of a product. Sadly, later in the book, the author discusses economies of developing nations, specifically Camaroon and China, without connecting most of it back to the consumer, or average reader. He ends with a strong summary explaining why the economy matters, but I couldn't find the ""why"" through the entire second half of the book. So, if you are interested in why some coffee costs so much in some places in not others, and why people may spend so much on coffee while others don't, this book can help. Otherwise, I think an interest in the global economy and politics of developing nations is needed to sit through the rest of the book.I listened to this in audio format and felt the narrator, Robert Ian Mackenzie was not a good match for the content. He has a good performing voice, but this was an informational book full of details that seemed harder to follow through his tone and accent."

I started reading it for the first time in 2009 when I got it as a gift. I was already fascinated by economics but, somehow, I was not able to stick with it and go beyond the first chapter --and I believe this happened twice. This fact might come as a shock, given that, this time around, I have given the book a 5-star rating.Nevertheless, it is so true as it is fascinating that incentives matters (one of the main cornerstones of the book). In 2009, despite being ""fascinated"" with economics, I was not anywhere near understanding its true impact in the world. So, I guess I did not grasp the value of Tim Harford's words.Now, almost ten years later and nearly half-way through my Phd in economics, I could clearly appreciate the messages that ""connected""  economic theory to real world examples . It was a wonderful book, full of real life examples and simple-to-understand explanations of economic concepts. And to complete the message... a realization, if I was not completely convinced yet, that Economics matters. "

There's a lot of food for thought here.I'm not an economist and I don't get a LOT of what this guy is talking about a lot of the time - but I got it some of the time, so his efforts at creating an accessible piece of economic writing are not in vain. I did furrow my brow in confusion quite a bit but my brow usually unfurrowed sooner or later as I read so the furrowing was worth it. It's kind of nice to be so completely out of my own element. I'm not sure I agree with him on a lot of his major points but I wouldn't know how to begin to refute his seemingly airtight arguments. I want to read the book that another economist would write in response to this one because I'm certainly not going to go become an economist just so I can argue with this guy! "

Yes, you heard me right. Basically, they do fact-checking on audience-recommended bizarre-sounding statistics. It's funny, fun, and relevant, and has the added benefit of actually catching all the zombie statistics that politicians use. Catch NPR ever having anything like that.Anyway, all that simply goes to note that I was heavily, heavily predisposed to like this book. And I did.... And that's all I'm going to post here.

However, they are very different books. Although Freakonomics and the sequels are a lot of fun to read, most of the ideas presented there were backed by pretty flimsy logic. On the other hand, Tim Harford takes on some serious issues, using daily life examples, and explains some major economics principles. He draws big conclusions, ubt unlike Freakonomics, backs his conclusions with data and logic. The only issue is the book tends to get to heavy at times, and for someone like me, who has absolutely no base in economics, there are times when pages have to be reread just to get an idea whats going on.Loved the chapters on Public Health and why Cameroon continues to be poor, but overall the book did not hold my attention throughout.It's a brilliantly written book, making a lot of complex economic concepts accessible, but I guess being in healthcare, I just couldn't get myself too interested.

This should probably not count toward my yearly books goal.Tim Harford has a talent for explaining economics concepts in understandable, dryly witty language with clear examples. As a learning tool, I bet this is just as good and more entertaining than any textbook. As a casual read, it's a bit wall-of-text and fast-paced; it's not a deliciously gossipy tear-through-me beach read like Harford's collection of advice letters (Dear Undercover Economist: Priceless Advice on Money, Work, Sex, Kids, and Life's Other Challenges). As a more-or-less layman who listens to ""Planet Money"" but never took an economics class, more of a mind-expanding stop-every-few-pages-and-digest-the-content type of book."

While the dispassionate economist in me (there is one in there somewhere) can recognise that, recognition is one thing, acceptance is another. Hence I'm not studying pure economics (because I do think that if you only look at economics, and take out the human element we all end up like Milton bloody Friedman and then it's the Shock Doctrine all over again...)But it is a good read, and served its purpose in getting me back into the subject.*I'm studdying Politics, Philosophy & Economics in anticipation of becoming the next UK Prime Minister."

Although at heart I am and have always been a fiction junkie, I highly recommend The Undercover Economist even to those who, like me, thrive on fantasy and the imagination. This book is very readable – it’s well-written and yet simple so you feel like he’s just talking to you through the book, and each chapter is worth reading by itself, so you can even skip a couple of chapters in the middle if you find it getting too slow-going.

The book is, in its basic form, common sense written with an air of smugness. It is hard to take this book seriously - as earnest as the Undercover Economist believes that the world can be completely reduced to high school economics. Sure, it is insightful, and rather reassuring that economics hasn't really grown far from basic sense - but the book does not give anyone any new insight into the world.Plus the notion that the world just needs a good economist to save the day and the environment is pitiful, given the many times the author himself has pointed out the ridiculous failures of economists before.On the whole - a completely ridiculous book, and I genuinely pity the fool who took the pains to download this book on my computer. He would be extremely better off picking up an actual economics text book instead."
76,0195189779,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7481433-michael-lewyn,4,"This book tries to popularize basic economic concepts. Harford is most interesting and provocative when describing daily economic events, such as why some things seem overpriced. He suggests that movie popcorn is expensive because high-priced food is a way for theaters to price-target- that is, to get money out of consumers who are not particularly sensitive to prices. Similarly, he explains the value of difficult liberal arts majors as a signaling device- a way to tell employers, ""I did really tough work in college so I must be smart.""Sometimes Harford is simplistic. For example, he argues that nations like Cameroon are poor and corrupt partially because they are dictatorships. However, Taiwan and South Korea began to bloom economically before they became democracies (as has China)."

Also had the impression during reading that, on a few occasions, the explanation for why things had gone so terribly wrong had been overly simplified; while economics is generally good at description, it has proven far less reliable at prediction, simply because economic problems in the real world often have more meaningful variables than are in the economic model.All that said, the account of Cameroon's plight is completely appalling, and the story of how China managed to jump-start itself after Mao's death in 1976 was fascinating.

Because of the examples' relevancy, this book is a great aid in understanding how not only economics works, but politics and international affairs. And it's easy enough for someone not gifted in math and various policies, like me, to follow quite easily. In the end, I'm glad I had to read it for class.(I spent more than 4 days on it, although the bulk of it was read that quickly in preparation for exams, but it's still a fairly quick read-just a bit dull sometimes.)"

Ta-da! Economic lesson learned. Though, the way he explains typical common situations accompanying an economic concept/principle is interesting. At some point, he uses biology (something about bacteria/virus) to explain why poor countries remain poor.Also, game theory keeps propping up at regular intervals and apparently an economist is a person who knows the price of everything and the value of nothing.

80,0195189779,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2436371-dennis-littrell,5,"More of an economic primer than any kind of expose, but excellentA straightforward title for this book might be ""Economics 101."" Tim Harford makes the case for the invisible hand of the marketplace, for globalization as good for both the developed world and the undeveloped; he makes ""differential pricing"" clear, shows the value of free trade and why protectionist policies can be bad even for the protected and always costly to the country implementing them. His is the traditional view of the mainstream economist, the racy title notwithstanding. (I wonder: did the success of Freakonomics by Steven D. Levitt and Stephen J. Dubner, which came out a little before this book, influence the people at the Oxford University Press to employ a spicy title?)It's tempting to compare ""The Undercover Economist"" with ""Freakonomics,"" but I won't except to say that Freakonomics really is about economics beneath the radar and undercover while The Undercover Economist is a very nice introduction to traditional economic thought as applied contemporaneously. Both books are excellent in their own way. Harford is more of a teacher and explainer, while Messrs. Levitt and Dubner are more interested in surprising us.Harford is fond of coffee and beer and uses the economics of those products to make some telling points. He is not enamored of the ""fair trade"" coffee movement believing that the problem for coffee farmers is simply that the have no scarcity power since coffee can be grown in so many places in the world and growing it requires no great skill. He doesn't see sweatshops as a great evil. Instead he believes that if we banned clothing from countries that have sweatshops that would only hurt the workers in those shops since they would lose their jobs. His arguments for the good that globalization does follow the same sort of logic: yes, we in the developed world are gaining nicely from our capitalization of and trade with the underdeveloped countries, but they are gaining too. Without First World investments and a place to sell their goods and services, the underdeveloped countries would be poorer. I call this the trickle down theory of globalization, and I think it is generally correct. The sad truth is that no matter what scheme or system of interaction between the haves of the world and the have nots is employed, the haves are going to have an advantage and they are going to benefit more than the underdeveloped. This has been true since at least the time of the conquistadors.He uses the sad example of Cameroon to demonstrate why some countries are so poor. In Cameroon tariffs are among the highest in the world; the government is corrupt and not friendly to foreign investment while the ability of the locals to do business is stifled by governmental regulations and taxes, and bribes at every level. When the government steals from the people the people lose their incentive to work.Harford touts the economic resurgence of China and compares it directly with the failed economy of Cameroon. His main point is that once Mao and his top down economic policies were gone, and Deng was able to move China toward a profit motive economy, beautiful things began to happen. Harford recalls the horrors that the people of China suffered during the so-called Great Leap Forward and the Cultural Revolution. China for Harford is an example of a real world economic experiment that proves that a national economy is too complex to be directed from on high as in the communist system. His main point is that the information that we get from the marketplace cannot be had in any other way; and it is this information about what people really want, and what they are really willing to pay, that is what makes the invisible hand so powerful. Much of the book is devoted to illustrating this idea. When governments set prices or make quotas they are inviting gross inefficiency that steals from all of us. Letting the market place fix these values is much more efficient.Although Harford bends over backwards to let us know that he feels for those who suffer the pain that comes from the constant change that takes place in free economies--people who lose their jobs, people whose companies go out of business, etc. because of competition from afar or because of technological advances elsewhere--I don't think he pays enough attention to the effect of free enterprise on limited and non-renewable resources. Economists tend to believe that when one commodity or element becomes scarce, the economy will find a substitute. Harford is no exception. He doesn't spend any ink worrying about the loss of the rain forests of the world probably because he sees them primarily in relatively short term economics. But in the long run the loss of something irreplaceable such as the rain forests or the coral reefs may cost us dearly in ways we cannot predict. Furthermore, there is such a thing as the aesthetic, spiritual and even psychological value of resources that are not taken into account in the economist's short term view.By the way, the reason you can't buy a decent used car is the problem of ""asymmetric information."" In situations where one side has important information that the other side doesn't have, the result is a rip off--or there is no sale since the side without the information may have no confidence in the value of the sale item. In the chapter entitled ""The Men Who Knew the Value of Nothing"" Harford shows how information can affect auctions as well as used car sales and how the value of spectrum rights licenses and even your house may depend on asymmetric information. --Dennis Littrell, author of “The World Is Not as We Think It Is”"
81,0195189779,http://goodreads.com/user/show/71646156-nv,4,"I love how a book organized around a central theme of the emergent wisdom of markets itself arises from a conceptually consistent investigation of the teleonomic nature of the superior performance, efficiency, and optimal equilibrium as the inevitable consequence of free markets. Right from Ch1 where he investigates the pricing of FMCG in the retail sector, it gave me the impression of careful decisions made by marketing executives poring over the results of meticulously designed market research studies, when in actuality it’s most likely they’ve simply analyzed the sales metrics and arrived at these teleonomic principles. On the one hand, it’s an amazing, efficient, and cheap tool to conduct such natural experiments in conducive controlled environments and modify results through natural selection rather than expensive, time-consuming, and high-attrition intelligent design. On the other hand, so many of the just-so results that the book analyzes and compares good vs bad examples of, are well, just-so. It’s certainly a low-hanging fruit in much of the world, and the book plainly speaks to the developing world that has a long way to go to catch up, simply by building the efficient institutions of market pricing, addressing market/govt failures and promoting the free movement of goods, ideas, and people. But the high-hanging fruits, especially for the developed world, are less clear. Negative externalities like environmental damage are addressed very clearly, but the elephant in the room, of a significantly non-zero cost that needs to be absorbed somewhere, isn’t quite mentioned in all its inconvenient entirety. Similarly, where do the increasing findings of behavioral economics fit in to perfectly free markets? In the book we are given a view of how free markets can sometimes lead to negative spirals (lemons) or sub-optimal local maxima, requiring government intervention but what about situations where markets are fundamentally limited by the cognitive limitations of its individual units, ie people? If our irrational behavior was noise, then that’s fine it gets averaged out over a large sample size, but if it’s a uniform bias then we are moved silently away from the rational optimal equilibrium solutions. It seems to me that neoclassical liberal economics might have crossed the bend in the developed countries, while still being by far the best solution for the developing countries, which leaves us at an uncomfortable impasse. The same solutions are no longer applicable everywhere. Given a choice of uniform application, I imagine it is far more dangerous for the developing countries to abandon free market capitalism than it is for the developed countries to keep it in its diluted corrupted current form, and yet since our intellectual capitals are in the West, we’re more likely to see developing countries abandon free market capitalism along with the West, a disastrous move for overall global prosperity, so we could really use more books like this one.NotesPrice discrimination: Fairprice (only 1p cost increase, 10p price increase to souse out who’s willing to pay). Expensive-seeming stores like Wholefoods aren’t more expensive for the same products, they just have more expensive alternative SKUs which are often placed easier to find and pick, so your bill ends up being more. To make an expensive and cheap product, sometimes companies need to make the same product (like IBM) and then do some extra work to handicap the product to make it cheap. Software does this all the time, develop it and then develop extra software to block certain functions. More work for a cheaper product. This strikes us as unfair, but paradoxically we want companies to do extra work and ship medicine to poor countries and charge lower prices there. Head Start: in a race with fast runners and slow, it’s better to give the slow-runners a one-time headstart than to slow down the fast runners. Slowing them down is a grinding tax, head-start is a one-time windfall payment that then leaves their incentive to earn untouchedNeed to think about the marginal quantity. For eg: Car tax is paid in bulk, the next km is free so no incentive to reduce fuel usage. Similarly, fuel tax doesn’t account for congestion-time usage. The right approach to externalities is to price the marginal kilometer. Lemons: Asymmetry of info leads to adverse selection. Can make lemonade, in insurance, by getting better info, genetic test will reveal all underlying conditions and even out informationBill Gates takes monopoly money from Microsoft and becomes disproportionately rich. Is this bad on the margin? If you need 80 to survive and 100 people each had Rs.100, then they give nothing back, the optimal equilibrium of savings (for investment) vs expenditure (personal utility and contributing to economy) is not reached? Instead if 99 people had 80, and 1 person has 2080, likely he gives at least 1000 to charity? Markets contain revealed preferences. Carbon auctions reveal how valuable green technology is.Carbon-neutral charities not economic but moralPricing externalities with different people’s different preferences on things like Noise, pollutionGovernment banditry, rent-seeking by increasing processes. Stable dictator worse than democracy but better than anarchy, cartel of thugs? Compare with syphilis virus that has to be benign enough not to kill the host and stop its main source of foodThe secret of China’s great success under Deng after Mao isn’t one of liberalization and capitalism but of pricing everything. They still maintain state control over industry but attach a price to everything such that incentives aren’t misaligned. State-run corporations are incentivized to ‘over-produce’ if they can sell excess at market rates."
82,0195189779,http://goodreads.com/user/show/19341029-aur-lien-thomas,4,"A simple yet original attempt: introducing economics (its major concepts and, some of its most pertinent theorists) simply by looking at the world around us. From the price of a cup of coffee to a trip for shopping at the supermarket, from renting a flat to buying a second-hand car, Tim Harford thus manages to turn a seemingly complicated topic into a accessible one -relevant to all of us. He even manages to explain the late financial crisis and, question why capitalism works in some countries but not others. It's easy to read, punchy and, fulfil its mission perfectly: make us more aware of all the economical issues involved behind our consumerists' lives. A great read. "
83,0195189779,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3027543-stephen-dorneman,4,"Harford explains the working of basic economic principles with terrific examples that can be easily grasped, and shows how many of the problems bedeviling countries both developing and developed either have been, or could be, solved by a rigorous application of those self-same principles. He does get a bit preachy and repetitive at times, but overall, makes his case with wit, and with a surprising amount of sympathy for those that might be individuals losers in cases where the overall economy still wins. Give a copy to your anti-sweatshop, pro-protectionist friend, and if he or she is open enough to new (well, actually old) ideas, watch their minds getting blown."

Harford never strays far from the 'standard model' of economics, and chooses his examples to fit the basic Ricardo/Smith view of the world. That's not necessarily bad of course, but I didn't pick up too much from this book. E.g. Freakonomics: A Rogue Economist Explores the Hidden Side of Everything doesn't try as hard to connect their stories to economic theory, but I found it a bit more... entertaining."

Harford is obviously very pro-market, but is more realistic and less preachy/smug than he could be, and the discussion of China's economic explosion and subsequent reflection on the developing world challenged some of my assumptions. As other reviewers have said, this one hit harder topics and gave more in-depth explanation than many others."
86,0195189779,http://goodreads.com/user/show/46255232-anders-rasmussen,4,"Interesting and sometimes surprising, down to earth, economic analysis of markets that we encounter on a daily basis.Why is coffee so expensive on train stations? Which type of illegal activity gives the best profit? What are the benefits and the downsides of free markets? Is natinal health insurance good or bad? Should you feel bad when purchasing products made in countries where workers do not enjoy the same rights as in your own country?In The Undercover Economist Tim Harford deals with these as well as other economic issues that we encounter on a daily basis, often without being aware of it. The book is generally easy to understand and have a subtle humorous tone which keeps you engaged. Like almost all economist (that I have encountered anyway), Harford favors a more or less free market. Whether this should be seen as a bias or if this is because free markets are intrinsically good is a question I cannot answer. In any case the book is definitely pro free market which may be a dealbreaker for some potential readers.Harford begins by introducing the concept of scarcity power. He claims that the scarcity of a product or any type of asset will determine the price of that asset. In the case of a coffee stand on a busy London train station the price can get very high indeed which ultimately results in high coffee prices. In my mind scarcity is simply part of the supply and demand equation. If the supply is very small, and demand very high prices will be high. Perhaps there is something I do not understand... Harford moves on to discuss the implications of this principle in the society. For instance, if you own a maffia, one of the most lucrative paths to take is to start a legit business and then threaten competition to increase scarcity power (reduce supply). With the competition gone you can charge what you want and make a nice profit.One of the most interesting things I learned from this book was that sales, rebates, special prizes for students and seniors, class seating on trains and airplanes etc, are often just ways for a business to charge customers as much as they are willing to pay for any particular product. A coffee stand may earn a profit by selling coffee quite cheap but would of course like people with a lot of money to pay as much as possible. To get rich people to pay allot while not scaring off poor people or students you can offer large cups or alternative types of coffee such as coffee mocha coco bozo with cream, ice cream etc etc. Such fancy product are really not much more expensive to produce but you can charge much more for it (and if you check out the prizes at your local cafe this is exactly what they do).Similarly if you own an airline company it makes sense to have different types of seating because then you can charge insane amounts of money for a little bit more leg space and a little better service which many people are willing to pay to feel just a little bit more special. To increase the gap you can also consciously make standard seating slightly uncomfortable.While being a free market proponent Harford acknowledges that markets can run into trouble. For example, the insurance industry is very susceptible to the problem of imperfect information. If people only get insurance once they are sick, or if insurance companies only offer insurance to those who are completely healthy and have a tiny risk of getitng sick, then the market will not work. As Tim puts it, insurance industry is dependent on mutual ignorance. In the case of health insurance one practical solution is to have universal health insurance, which erases these issues. The only problem with this is that people are likely to consume more health care than they really need...Harford also offers an analysis of what makes poor countries poor. The short answer is high tariffs (which reduces trade with the rest of the world), and corruption. These two factors can be particularly detrimental in small countries which are extremely dependent on international trade. There is nothing preventing poor countries from developing into richer countries and there are in fact many examples of such a transition. One particularly striking example which is discussed in the book is South Korea which used to have many “sweat shops” where working conditionins were poor compared to the rest of the world. However, because they could offer cheap products they achieved impressive growth and a rapid switch from an agricultural to a manufacture economy. Today, South Korea is a highly technological society with a high standard of living and sweat shops have moved to other countries, because today there are better jobs available to Koreans. Harford makes it clear that boycotting a county’s products because their workers do not have the same job security or pay as our own workers does not help that country, even though it people think they are doing a good deed. To illustrate what freer markets can achieve Harford looks to China, a country which has seen an improbable economic growth in recent decades. As a result of this development, 300 million people have been lifted out of poverty in China. This number is so high that it is difficult to comprehend what it really stands for. When a natural disasters kills tens of thousands of people it is also easy to lose sight of the fact that every person is an individual with his or her own personality, feelings, food preferences, etc etc. Similarly when hearing that that 300 million people have been lifted out of poverty it means a very significant improvement in the lives of these individuals and that is something worth remembering!
