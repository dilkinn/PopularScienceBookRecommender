0,057123545X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7702916-cheyenne-blue,4,"Once or twice a year, I'll read a popular science book. The last two or three have been on quantum theory--I'm DETERMINED to get this straight in my head. ""Quantum Theory Cannot Hurt You"" is far and away the easiest to read and the book that has brought me closest to comprehension. Chown uses a lot of everyday examples as comparisons: pine trees in a forest, water boiling in a pot. The result is an interesting, informative, easy to read book that gets the information across.This is the closest I'm come to getting a grip on quantum theory yet. If I keep reading a book or two on the subject each year, I reckon I'll have it nailed by about 2025. Then I'll move on to string theory.Recommended."
1,057123545X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/56445759-alex,5,"As the tittle says quantum theory can be explained in a way that can be understand by everyone. It is book for people who do not deal with quantum mechanics every day, and for those who try to do so. Of course it is not a book to explain you how to deal with wave functions but it explains the idea of quantum physics. Anyway it is great book to begin your jurney through quantum mysteries."
2,057123545X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7402485-lee-penney,4,"Apparently Richard Feynman (a noted physicist who received a Nobel Prize) said: ""I think I can safely say that nobody understands quantum mechanics."" I quote that because, even after listening to this book, I don’t fully understand all the principles and theories. This was another audiobook, picked with the intention of trying to get a better understanding of a complex topic.It succeeded in as much as I know more about the subject than I did before I listened to the book, but the quote from Feynman does at least provide me with some comfort. Mind you, I learnt enough to understand why the recent discovery of neutrinos that appear to have travelled faster than light has grabbed so many headlines, and what it could mean for quantum theory. So maybe nobody understands the laws of quantum physics (or, more likely, an explanation for how these particles got to their destination quicker than expected will be found).Anyway, the book covers many of the facets of quantum theory, and if I had a penny for every time Einstein is mentioned, I'd be rich. Amongst the subjects covered are special and general relativity, probability waves, quantum entanglement, gravity, and the Big Bang.To put those into perspective, the book covers how stars manufacture the various elements we find in the universe, how there is so much space in each atom that, if you could remove it, the entire Earth would compress to the size of a sugar cube. It talks about quantum computing, how time and space, things we think of as constant, compress and expand, and how gravity doesn’t exist (at least, not in the way you think). Also mentioned are that all energy has weight, even light, so a warm cup of coffee actually weighs more than a cold one.It's a fascinating, if somewhat mind-bending subject and the book does a pretty good job or navigating your way through it, while avoiding equations in favour of real-world examples. Certainly worth a go."
3,057123545X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/233507-s-ach,3,"Contrary to what the title of this book suggests, Quantum Theory does hurt me, in many many ways. For a starter, it has taken my night's sleep. Like a defeatist I am running around the trees to get the grasp of it. But in vain. The moment I see a light at the end of the tunnel, I realize that is just a firefly. And instead of grasping the depth, I just gasp for breath. May be I am too dumb to gulp it all, but I won't stop trying till it makes all sense.Now, coming to this book, in the beginning the author asks the readers which of the following statements might be true,--- Every breath you take contains an atom breathed out by Marilyn Monroe--- There is a liquid that can run uphill--- You age faster at the top of a building than at the bottom--- An atom can be in many different places at once, the equivalent of you being in Newyork and London at the same time.--- The entire human race would fit in the volume of a sugar cube.--- One percent of the static on a television tuned between stations is the relic of the big bang.--- Time travel is not forbidden by the laws of Physics.--- A cup of coffee weighs more when it is hot than when it is cold.--- The faster you travel, the slimmer you get....and tells, with a chuckle, that everything is.The rest of the book goes on explaining these weird phenomena of Science, that is definitely more stranger than all the science fictions I have come across so far (I have read all Michael Crichtons and couple of Arthur C Clarkes) with the help of Quantum Theory ( microscopic world) and the Relativity Theories( macroscopic world).The language of the book is fiction-like. And the author does a pretty good job at enthusing his non-scientific readers towards the mindboggling discoveries of twentieth century. However, the book is not for the beginners who do not have a clue about what modern physics is all about. (For beginners I highly recommend 'The Dancing Wu Li Masters'.) Neither it is for physics researchers who want to understand reality via mathematics. This book is best suited for people who wants to get awed by how our modern science has shaped human understanding of the universe and everything in it.I don't think this book has helped me coming out of my confusions, but it has nevertheless entertained me in a Quantum way.In the end, the author propounds a thought that could there be a single theory combining these two - like Quantum Relativity( quantum gravity). A thing to ponder about.One question is troubling me of late, after reading so much on Quantum Mechanics and Relativity - Can a reductionist explanation be sufficient to explicate the holistic complexity?"
4,057123545X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/207385-sarah,3,"I read this book for the letter Q in my alphabet yearly challenge. It is not a book that I would have ordinarily have picked up but finding a book beginning with Q isn't that easy and then when this came up as a Kindle daily deal, I thought what the hell!I am a complete layman when it comes to this subject. I do however love learning new things and things like this do fascinate me - I love all the programs on TV that Prof. Brian Cox does.This book is quite a short, just 200 pages, so it is very concise considering the topic that is being explained. The book started off really well and I was understanding what was being said but then when alternate universes, time travel and time in general was discussed, I started to lose my understanding somewhat and just grasping the odd bit here and there.The author was very good at explaining a complex subject in a simple way but some of the concepts are still a little way out there me to understand. A lot of analogies are used to help you understand different phenomenon and theories which I found quite helpful. Perhaps if I read it again, more of it would sink in but unlike what the title of the book claims, this did hurt my head so I don't think I will revisit it anytime soon!"
5,057123545X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/10486977-themadhatter,4,"Aussie Readers 2019 Mother's Day Reading Challenge: Bunch of Orange Gebera (Read a book with an orange cover)I found this book in a kid's box at a second hand book sale and boy was it in the wrong place - a case of you can't judge a book by its cover as all those bright colours and cartoony images obviously gave someone the wrong impression. I really enjoyed this book - it was engaging and we connected from the start. Then in the middle we had some relationship issues where the writing got a little bland and I found myself clock watching and we grew apart. Thankfully, this was only a slight bump in our relationship and we reconnected for the final 3-4 chapters with a BANG (Best chapters of the book I think). The title is not particularly representative as it really is more a contrast of the big and the small applications of quantum physics and a large number of pages were taken up with a glossary (was that really needed?). Overall this was a (surprisingly) engaging read and I found a few of the analogies he used to explain concepts that were really good and that I will definitely apply. Most books on the topic of quantum either are too superficial or are textbooks. This book hit the spot quite nicely with a bit of depth that is usually lacking. While this is not really geared toward the novice, it is also not geared to the expert either - a nice in between read. Overall this was an engaging, not too difficult read of an absolutely fascinating area of physics."
6,057123545X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/12399672-sebastian-radu,4,"I never truly understood Quantum Mechanics in college. We had the course over two semesters and, sure, I did alright, passed the course, did my best at memorizing all the wave functions and bra-ket notations and wibbly wobbly timey wimey stuff... But I kept asking myself ""why"" these phenomena happened, which kept leading me into a rabbit hole of information that not even all physicists truly understand. Unlike classical physics, there's no real ""why"" to talk of, things are just weird at the quantum level. So you either go all in with the madness and start studying advanced mathematics or you get out while you still have your wits. So I got my B+, thanked the professor and got the hell outta there. :)Years later, having finished college and dropped out of a master's, I was left with the impression that Quantum Theory is a messy web of math and physics and unintuitive results. And, boy, after this book refreshed my memory, I was completely right. It's a great choice for the layman who wants to understand the important theories and experiments in quantum physics and relativity, without getting their hands dirty with Hilbert spaces and Hamiltonians. It's fun and light and explains all the good stuff, like how entanglement and special relativity work. You'll scratch your head reading all these space oddities and don't worry if you don't understand it fully, just enjoy the ride and cash-out early. I give it a B+"
7,057123545X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/36377410-hattie,4,"Ok, I’m not saying I don’t believe it, I’m just saying if all this turns out to be complete rubbish and/or a hoax, I saw it coming. But really, a pretty good rundown in simple English of the basics of all that Weird Physics that’s not really possible to comprehend with a human brain "
8,057123545X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4331887-steve,3,"A whistlestop tour through the two theories that underpin pretty much all modern physics - quantum theory, and relativity. The title is somewhat misleading as this is very much a book of two halves - 'Small Things' and 'Big Things'. It's also surprisingly short, consisting of just 80 pages on quantum theory and 71 on relativity, and that's it! Well, besides the admittedly ample glossary, which appears to be a staple of Chown's books. That said, it manages to cram in some of the important stuff to varying degrees of success. Chown's down-to-earth writing style helps, but there's no escaping the problem that condensing topics like quantum entanglement and probability waves to this extent will necessarily sacrifice answers to a whole host of follow-up questions that arise to the curious beginner. Still, there are some good explanations and analogies, particularly on time dilation. For me though, it didn't quite live up to the standard of Chown's earlier book, The Magic Furnace. By all means give it a go if you're a beginner - you'll no doubt expand or strengthen your understanding of at least some aspects of the subject. Just don't be surprised if you wind up with a lot of unanswered questions by the end of it. (Better still, try Jim Al-Khalili's 'Quantum: A Guide for the Perplexed' which has better explanations and demonstrates the vital role a diagram can play when grappling with a new concept.)"
9,057123545X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/45700320-todd,4,"I'm not going to lie, I love popular science books. While reading this I could feel Chown’s enthusiasm, his passion for physics. And that just makes me even more enthusiastic and passionate about physics. This is the value of popular science, it nurtures enthusiasm and encourages passion. As I am a nerd, I had encountered lots of the ideas discussed in this book before. Yet I didn't feel bored. Chown links them all wonderfully, in a way I would never have been able to do on my own. I'm hesitant to say that I understand quantum theory better now, because there is no maths in this book. But that's not the point, popular science books aren't intended to be textbooks, they don't pretend to rigorously explain everything. The purpose of reading popular science is to become acquainted with complicated ideas, not to become an expert. Which is fine, and Chown has certainly achieved this goal. (Although I would have liked some maths, or at least some diagrams, because I'm a nerd).Overall, I'd definitely recommend this if you have any sort of vague notion about quantum theory and want to read something to keep you interested. (As a final note, when the book was written gravitational waves had not been observed. They have been since. But as far as I can tell that's the only major outdated piece of information presented in the text)."
10,057123545X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3366140-david-workman,4,"A great little book that gives a high level introduction to relativity and quantum theory, with equal weight being given to the two (despite what the title suggests).While this isn't going to satisfy someone looking for a detailed treatment of the two major physical theories of the current time, it does serve as an introduction if you have some interest but don't want to get into the complex maths that a full description necessarily entails. It gets across the concepts well, with only a couple of very basic pieces of maths thrown in to demonstrate a couple of points."
11,057123545X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1470777-thom-beckett,4,"Although Chown doesn't make everything entirely understandable - one could hardly expect him to, this book certainly engages the awe sections of your brain. Over and over again. Chown does a grand job of, where possible, providing metaphors and similes to help you get some of the more esoteric areas of modern science in an immensely readable way.If you really enjoyed  Bill Bryson's  A Short History Of Nearly Everything, this book is an excellent next step."
12,057123545X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7317144-philip,4,I highly recommend this book to someone with marginal understanding of physics. The author writes in a very readable fashion although his audience is the British which can result in some strange phrasings and examples to the American reader but aren't strange enough to detract from the book as a whole. Chown does a great job of making quantum theory and Einstein's theory of relativity (among manny other topics) interesting and understandable. 
13,057123545X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/26809872-muhammad-fadhli-abd-razak,4,"we are mumbling about time travel, origin of universe and relativity. the last question asked and yet we dont know the answer, sarcasticaly, where does the rock come from?"
14,057123545X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/11654681-paul,5,Simply the best. Better than all the rest.
15,057123545X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/52660498-joshua-neil,3," Quantum Theory Cannot Hurt You is a brief, simple description of two fundamental theories of physics: quantum theory and the theory of relativity. Chown attempts to use simple descriptions and analogies to describe in less than 200 pages the ideas behind Heisenberg's Uncertainty Principle, quantum computers, space-time and dark matter, with varying results. This is certainly a book of two halves, metaphorically as well as literally: for the most part, I found the part on quantum physics wildly entertaining, well-described and understandable, barring the last part on quantum waves and the difference between fermions and bosons. Its central ideas, though oft-repeated nowadays, are still awesome to learn about, from nonlocality to the possibility of quantum computers using the processing power of their counterparts in other realities.  The second half, on relativity, is more difficult to laud. I know for certain that I am not alone in becoming lost as this part when on, and while this could simply be a lack of understanding or intelligence on my part I'm rather more like to attribute it to poor description on Chown's - the section on why gravity doesn't exist is particularly confusing, and I am certain his metaphor about the trampoline and bowling ball does more harm than good. Overall this is an enjoyable, quick read, but could definitely do with revising - and simplification of a number of points, as well as perhaps some further explanation of some of the key points mentioned but not elaborated on.  "
16,057123545X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/17004114-max-urai,3,"A fun little book about physics for adults who want to take a slightly deeper dive into the world of atoms than the usual old metaphors about rubber blankets and bowling balls. I mean the adults part in an approving way: despite the cartoony cover, this is not a beginners book or a book for children in the Horrible Scienc mould. It's more like an overview of everything that can be explained about quantum theory and relativity without, as the author calls it, ""opaque maths"".Chown does an nice job of showing how the different parts of quantum physics and relativity connect to each other, and how each of the weird and well-known consequences of these things - atoms existing in two places at once, for instance - are inevitable, logical consequences of the deep theory. What I also really like is that every time he comes to a point where he has to make a logical jump that would take too much explaining, he tells you that's what he's doing (""this has to be taken on faith but can be proven"", for instance). He doesn't humor his readers and I like that. Only caveat about this book, which is not really a vice of the author, is that's it's a little outdated (although this realisation was actually kind of exciting: physics is still so much in flux, a century after Einstein, and really fundamental stuff is still being discovered every year or so)."
17,057123545X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/17999985-brendan,4,"Marcus Chown has created Quantum Theory explanation for dummies, a quick but thorough book that opens the door for many other books. I will admit that I have limited knowledge on the subject here but I learnt quite a lot from this book. I will track down a heavier book but this is a good starter on the subject, call it a appetizer if you will. The amount of Einstein breakdowns was astonishing, the man was definitely a pioneer in this field of research. Relativity is an interesting subject and this book only touches some of the vast topics on hand. I picked this up on my kindle for quite cheap and I will highly recommend it to anyone interested in finding out more in this field of studies. The next 100 years will be interesting for mankind."
18,057123545X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/49601400-camio-dontchaknow,4,"That was a lot of fun!This book held a really nice balance between introducing and explaining the downright bonkers, without overwhelming the audience with the unnecessarily complicated.A really solid intro to quantum theory and related sci-fi tropes. I really enjoyed his explanations and illustrations. And it's reassuring to know you don't need to know the maths to grasp what quantum theory is all about. For those that want to precisely understand the how's, whys, and wherefore's sure you do, but a book called ""Quantum Theory Cannot Hurt You"" is clearly not intended for those people.It would be nice to see a revised copy detailing recent scientific discoveries. Which I suppose is true of any science book."
19,057123545X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/10725027-harsh-gopal,5,"For a person like me who has been weak in his physics since school days, Marcus Chown does a spectacular job in garnering the interest in Quantum Theory with less technical English as much as possible. The book is a brilliant source for anybody who would want to start off understanding what Quantum Theory is in layman terms, starting from the building particles like electrons and protons to the universe.Anybody interested in learning more about Quantum Theory should first read this and understand the concept in simple understandable language. :)"
20,057123545X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/89501914-kamila-jast,5,"This is the third book by Marcus Chown I have read after “We have no idea..” and “The ascent of gravity”. All are extremely good and author very skilled in popularising scientific topics to science enthusiasts in a very understandable, clear, and yet extremely interesting way. It’s page turner - Indiana Jones of science, from brilliant popular science writer. Will definitely read more from Marcus Chown."
21,057123545X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/18326963-yxas,3,"Despite its title, this is a book about quantum *and* general relativity. Quantum in the first half, general relativity in the second.It's okay. If you're completely new to quantum, I'd start off with something a bit more rigorous, like Alistair Rae's Quantum Physics, and then I'd read something like this for the helpful and original metaphors."
22,057123545X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/28728161-raghavendra-selvan,4,"Reading about the wonders of nature, apart from being scintillating, is also a great way to put our struggles, squabbles and misery into the cosmic perspective. Another dose of such humbling experience with this book that strings (no pun intended) the microscopic quantum theory to quantum gravity with tons of very visual analogies."
23,057123545X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4356381-troy,3,"Good presentation of the material. Each chapter starts with a little scenario/scene to set the tone, then gets into the actual science. This books is more of a simplified overview of physics so don't expect to get too in-depth. "
24,057123545X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5560129-kole,4,"Great book about basics of important things in physics that everybody heard about but not everybody knows what they are about - for example superposition, special relativity, quantum entanglement etc."
25,057123545X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/84069222-hannah,4,I’m a physics PhD student and I thoroughly enjoyed reading this - mainly due to the rewording of many complicated things into simple and re-inspiring explanations. ‘Darkness at Night’ was my favourite section - I’d never considered it!
26,057123545X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/108941886-callum-mccormick,5,Brilliant. An easy to understand description of the very small and the very big whilst also posing the unanswered questions that could be huge for the human race going forward! Conclusion: Einstein was brilliant.
27,057123545X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/47753782-bastgr,4,"The metaphors are hilarious and the guy clearly has the hots for Einstein, but the beautiful, crazy qt renders it all inessential."

31,057123545X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/66945857-trowly-plisner,4,"It's pretty basic knowledge in this book. Though it ain't bad, it's meant for an entry level hobby physicist."
32,057123545X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/77634610-leo-s-new-kindle,5,One of the few books trying to explain Quantum that you have a chance to read to the end...praise to Chown
33,057123545X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/70537751-robert-bunker,4,"Elegant and insightful description of quantum mechanics and the key problems therein. Some good, original examples highlight key concepts."
34,057123545X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/22546604-lucia,5,"One of the best books about physics and universe that I have ever read. Even if the book is this short, it is not just about the Quantum Theory, but also about the Relativity and another topics like black holes, Big Bang... The autor of the book is incredibly good in explaining things in a very understandable way, using great analogies and examples. The book is very informative, illustrative and interesting. I have already read about a lot of the things of this book in another books, but this one shows you different angles. It helps you understand better the Quantum Theory - finally! - and Relativity too. Everything looks easier now. I recommend it to every physics enthusiast."
35,057123545X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7096726-tony,4,"Mmm... quantum theory might not be able to hurt you, but it can run the risk of boring and/or annoying you, so it's not as straightforward as all that.This book sets out with good intentions, and gives more than occasional wink to the audience, especially in fictional set-ups at the start of chapters to show points in practical application. It's not by any means a bad book, but it occasionally falls between the two stools at which it's aiming - the chatty layman's guide to the universe, and the harder-core science it needs to explain. For personal preference, I'd go with Bill Bryson's Short History of Nearly Everything, or a bunch of Stephen Hawking books, as both those authors manage the balancing act with more appealing proficiency. Also - and of course, this could just be me - I'd say the text needed one final edit, because the author-quirk of repeatedly asking readers to 'Recall...' this thing or that grew quickly grating.So - worth the read? Maybe - it certainly won't hurt you. But not as worthwhile as some similar works in the same genre, for my money."
36,057123545X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/42531358-amanda-dsouza,5,"I read this book because of my interest in physics and because I take physics for A level. So, here's my outlook on the book from a students perspective.It brilliantly introduces the reader to fascinating new concepts such as entanglement, quantum schizophrenia and of course, the theory of relativity (I am a student and these topics were all new to me). Despite these topics being extremely difficult to explain, Chown meticulously uses examples and metaphors to aid the reader in their understanding, relating the worlds of the very very small and the very very large to the everyday world.There are familiar concepts for A level physics students to cling on to, such as wave particle duality, the nature of light, emission and absorption and the make up of atoms. Here, Chown delves into the details of how such phenomena were founded and who helped find these pillars of physics- interesting stuff, and definitely worth the read to further your A level physics knowledge.Before reading this book I was interested in physics, especially astronomy, something that has captivated me since I was a child. After reading this book however, I feel like every field of physics is a treasure trove. There were some passages you have to just accept on face value without satisfying explanations, but that's because this book deals with quantum theory and relativity at the most basic of levels. However this actually inspired me to want to learn more in the future. A great read!"
37,057123545X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/80490-rob,4,"If the key to good science writing is clear understanding, Marcus Chown does a really good job here of explaining phenomena he claims no-one fully understands.This is a really nice book for the layman, one that delights in pulling the rug out from underneath ""science-as-you-understood-it"", and invites you to do so too. A sort of hysteria takes over as you realise that each turned page has pretty much ripped another hole in your personal fabric of physics & reality, let alone space-time. The style is light and as clear as possible, although some areas do require a degree of persistence - the author is at pains to remind us throughout that you basically have to be Einstein to 'get it' first time. Chown also does a good job of measuring out the correct amount of information for his readers - we don't want to be swamped, but equally, most of us don't want to read another book on quantum theory or relativity for a little while yet, either.I'd certainly recommend this book for anyone who takes an active interest in science. Whether to start you off exploring these incredible worlds of the very big and very small, or just to add a highbrow element to your discussions in the pub, it's highly enjoyable."
38,057123545X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6994338-ashok,4,"It's an interesting book, well, I suppose as interesting as any book on Quantum Theory can be. Marcus Chown explains the extremely intricate topic at hand really well, and goes to some length at explaining certain things that I would have thought I already knew, and in the process I learned I didn't know that much to begin with. Over all though, the deeper you go into this book and topic, the stranger it gets, and now and then I had to pause and remind myself, this is no less strange than the strangest tales from various religious texts out there - and this is science, and that's mostly makey-uppy-doodaah. I find this seriously mind-bending. Near the end of the book Marcus goes into the general area of cosmos, big bang etc and how Quantum Theory could, may be - just slightly may be - help explain what the general theory of relativity can not, but unfortunately by this time I have lost my faith in science and contemplating reading some religious text for next 3 weeks, standing on one foot, in a cave, somewhere in Himalayas. No Alps.. hmm, what should I read, Hitchhikers Guide to Galaxy perhaps? Compared to the quirks of Quantum Theory, H2G2 is just 'Basic Science for dummies'."
39,057123545X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/27493200-joel-murray,4,"Albert Einstein is credited as saying that ""everything should be as simple as possible, but not simpler"". Marcus Chown does a great job of taking extremely complex ideas and simplifying them to a point in which they are understandable. However, by relying so heavily on analogies, avoiding any maths and not including any pictures, I do wonder if he crosses the line sometimes into over-simplification. He describes in words such topics as quantum mechanics, special and general relativity which can be pretty full-on topics and I feel they need some images and background to explain them properly. I realise that could end up being a very long book though.A lot of the stuff covered in this book are things that I learnt at uni so this was a nice refresher, as well as filling in some gaps and highlighting certain amazing aspects which I'd previously overlooked. I do wonder, however, how someone would go if they didn't already have the background. My guess is that this book wouldn't be sufficient to fully grasp the concepts (not that I fully do anyway), but would be a good starting point to encourage them to delve deeper."
40,057123545X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3316230-mike,3,"I was hoping this book was essentially the ""dummy's guide"" to quantum theory, but it's a bit more complicated than that. There is some interesting stuff that's explained very well, the descriptions of white dwarves and neutron stars at the atomic level were very interesting to me (being a former chemisty student). The sections on gravity and space-time warpage, not explained so well (and what are they even doing in a book on quantum theory?).It must have been a challenging book to write as no-one really understands quantum theory, unfortunately a lot of the sections are rather challenging to read, even with a science background. And why, why are there no diagams? There is not a single one in the book.Despite its shortcomings, I do know what fermions and bosons are now, and why super fluids work, and know more about the Heisenberg uncertainty principle and mass-engery equivalence than I did before. The most important fact to take away from this book is that you weigh more when exercising, and therefore it should be avoided at all costs!"
41,057123545X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4979799-martin-sidgreaves,4,After watching a programme on TV that touched on Quantum Physics I decided I would like to read something that covered the subject in a little more depth without plunging the reading into the huge abyss that no doubt surrounded the subject.This book is great. It explains most of the main areas of QP in simplistic language using clever analogies to illustrate the points it makes. I read it entirely at bedtime and at times I did find myself having to reread some portions as it just wasn't sinking in or making sense to me (probably tiredness) however after reading again normal order was restored! What I will say is that some of the concepts explained are absolutely wild and really require an open mind.... especially if you have any existing understanding of physics.All in all a great introduction to this fascinating but complex subject and has now led me to wanting something more in-depth. I really enjoyed this book :-)
42,057123545X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1391160-fauza,3,"This book is talking about the basic of quantum theory. The author reveals all the ideas and the theory in simply ways such that even ordinary people, without physics background, can understand better. The discussion merely around atom, as basic building block, of the quantum theory and also lights that comes on discrete chunks or quanta was the most shocking discovery in the history of science. Of course, Einstein as the first person to realise this, will be the main person whom the author took the example from.When Einstein said, ""God does not play dice with the Universe"". Hawking said, ""Not only does God play dice with the Universe, He throws the dice where we cannot see them!"". Which one you believe? Oh, forgot to mention that this book is divided into two parts, one is talking about the basic things like I mentioned before, and the other is talking about the advanced stuffs, like the possible aplications etc."
43,057123545X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1533440-al-bit,4,"The title says it all: and the author is well adept at keeping it as straightforward as possible. The crazy, amazing world of Quantum physics, in its application to the very small, and to the very large in the physical world as we know it. This is an excellent coverage of the principle concepts of Quantum physics, and their implications for our understanding of the world we live in. The ideas might be difficult and complex, but the writing is clear and understandable. This is the perfect type of popular writing on scientific matters which most of us tend to shy away from. This book tells us we shouldn't, and it does so extremely well indeed. Recommended for those who want their brains stretched and their minds boggled, all without very much pain at all, and lots of pleasure in the meantime!"
44,057123545X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4896582-flannery,4,"This is a great book for those who are interested in quantum physics, but feel a bit daunted by it. It's written in simple language and explains the more complicated subjects using clever analogies that illuminate things very well. My only concern with the book is that in some cases, I suspect the information was presented a little TOO simply, and I worry about how much I'm truly getting from the abridged version of quantum theory.The subject matter itself is fascinating, and Marcus Chown goes out of his way to avoid presenting information drily, throwing in some cheesy science-related humour here and there.All-in-all, I think this book is a quality addition to anybody's ""Science for Laymen"" bookshelf."
45,057123545X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6249499-nicholas-pateman,5,"Excellent book on Quantum Physics. It isn't immensely difficult to follow and covers a broad aspect of the science through various statements that you would expect to be false, yet when applied to Quantum Physics end up proving the contrary.I read this book in a few days whilst travelling on the train and enjoyed every bit of it, as I do with most books on this subject. The author does an extremely good job of keeping you interested, even if you aren't in a particularly analytics mindset. It's written well enough to set a presidence for quantum physics books, to prove that they don't have to be overly complex!If you haven't read any Quantum Physics books before, you wouldn't go wrong in making this one your first."
46,057123545X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/41912303-vil-m-zouhar,3,"I was surprised at the quality of this tiny and somehow mediocre looking popular science book. I also have to mention the quality of the Czech translation (Markéta Jansová, 2010). Usually books like these are given for translation to college students and you know right after reading the first chapter that you should have bought the original. Nothing like that happened to me with this book.It is much easier to read than Hawking's A Brief History of Time or The Grand Design, although the later offers greater enlightenment. In Quantum Theory Cannot Hurt You I especially liked the introduction - a quote and a short excerpts from a story. It tunes you to the topic of the whole chapter and makes it easier to stay focused. Great for reading while commuting to school or work."
47,057123545X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4859109-irena,5,"The author sets out to explain quantum theory inspired by A.Einstein's statement: ""Most of the fundamental ideas of science are essentially simple, and may, as a rule, be expressed in a language comprehensible to everyone."" Quantum theory cannot hurt but it can bewilder. At the middle of the book, when things get complicated enough, the author quotes Richard Feynman: ""I think I can safely say that nobody understands quantum mechanics."" Nonetheless, even though it is hard to get a crystal clear picture of quantum theory from this book, it opens a fascinating window into a bewildering and enchanting world of modern physics - a window that you will never wish to shut."
48,057123545X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6918304-edward,4,"This is fairly succinct and simplified summary of the important points of quantum theory. The author takes you on an immensely stimulating and illuminating tour of this microscopic reality. Always in a logical order and well structured with relavent simplifying devices he traces the course through from the Initial incursions of luminaries such as Rutherford, Bohr and Young into the realm of the very small all the way through to the advent of special relativity and touching on superstring theory at the end. It's a good springboard into this fascinating field and is made palatable here for the layman. "
49,057123545X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/15511678-sam,3,Listened to this on audiobook. A very good introduction to the world of Quantum Physics. Fair to say I had to rewind this more than a couple of times. I won't pretend I fully understand Einstein's theory of Relativity but like the gentleman says in the book - 'I'm pretty sure Einstein does.' And I would add Marcus Chown to that as well. He clearly knows his stuff and does an impressive job of unravelling coherent strands from the complicated mass of the subject. If you wish to know something of Quantum Theory or just something about bare bones of the Universe we live then this book is a good place to start and discover that the universe is stranger than we could possibly imagine. 
50,057123545X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/26442981-sehar-moughal,5,"Wow! Such an amazing book. I have read a few books on Quantum Theory and I think it is safe to say, so far, this one has been the best. I am not claiming that I know all there is to know about quantum theory but Chown has definitely made it easier to understand the concepts a little better. He uses imagery to get across concepts such as space-time, dark matter, inflation theory, gravity/acceleration and time travel. If you are even slightly curious to find out whether gravity exists or not, whether you can time-travel - ever or how can the entire human race fit in the volume of a sugar cube, then you must read this book. "
51,057123545X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/47323871-sid-nuncius,5,"This is a first-rate book. If you're looking for an account of the current state of Quantum Mechanics and Relativity which is accessible to a non-scientist and takes you from the basics through to most recent developments, this is for you. It is easy to read, but doesn't fudge issues or patronise and has real intellectual weight beneath a thoroughly good-humoured surface. Marcus Chown has been one of our best scientific writers in journals like New Scientist for many years and has already written several really good books. This is well up to standard and I recommend it without reservation. A cracker. "
52,057123545X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/53373701-shoti,4,"Nice intro into the basics of quantum physics. Chown does a great job by rendering the mind-boggling nature of quantum theory as accessible as possible to laymen, through his funny but precise and logical explanatory style. Better understanding and mastering of currently unknown, untested and utterly bizarre things around quantum physics has a huge potential for humanity. It is a pity that there are yet too many aspects which are wholly incomprehensible given the current state of science. I am afraid it will take some time until I can get my hands on my first car (spaceship?) propelled by a friendly bubbling matter-antimatter engine."
53,057123545X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4319912-georgina-allen,3,"I enjoyed this book but it did make my brain hurt.Even with a physics degree, I never really got to grips with quantum theory and relativity - sure, I can accept ""it just IS"" as an explanation and run with it, but don't really *understand* it, it feels totally counterintuitive.This book was really well written, and while I still struggle with the concepts, this wasn't any fault of the author - excellent examples and good quality analogies. I certainly could have done with it as a companion while I was doing lecture courses on this stuff!"
54,057123545X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/21845605-david,3,"I both enjoyed and did not enjoy this book at the same time; of course, when I went to observe what it was about it that I enjoyed, I was unable to locate the book. I found it interesting and densely explanatory, but I feel that more examples of the everyday could have been used to illustrate the points. I also found myself asking ""why?"" at lot, and I think this is because it didn't go right down the paths I wanted it to. Overall it was good, but I've had to think hard about the notes I made to make my own simpler explanations."
55,057123545X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/743700-dj,5,"Brilliant. Definately in my top 10. Digestable explanations of the most bizzare aspects of science that are fundamental to the universe.

I understand the theories more now - not saying that I agree with them, but this book has spawned a lot of conversation with my friends outside the book - and for that I loved it.Listened to this book from Audible.comMaf"
57,057123545X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3143792-abdullah-almuslem,1,"I read the Arabic translation which was very bad. The Author tries to explain things in an easy manner but the quantum theory is too complex to be explained. I found it very hard to grasp the ideas involved in this theory. The second part of the book was in some way easy to follow. I think that my rating is affected by the bad translation but it would not be much different if I read it in English. My conclusion, Quantum theory is too difficult to be understood fully. "

Nevertheless, I hope I never come across any children that understand this - they would be insufferable. I am gamely wading through this book, atom by atom, and struggling to get my head around it all. Sometimes I think I've understood a paragraph only to find two paragraphs later that I obviously had NO idea and have to backpedal (again). Worth it though."
59,057123545X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/16891313-marin,2,"It's not easy to write popular science books. The writer has to be a great storyteller, able to distil the meaning of the science theories to lay people, to attract attention and improve the reader's understanding of universe.Marcus Chown is not one of them, some of his explanations are hard to follow, tries to cram too much into a short book, whose title is misleading - the second part is a rush through the theory of relativity."
