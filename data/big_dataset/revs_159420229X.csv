0,159420229X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/236411-steve,3,"Here’s the hook. Suppose you want to commit the items on your to-do list to memory because you don’t have a pencil and paper. The first five items on your list are:1. Buy a bottle of Bordeaux for tonight’s dinner party2. Put Trainspotting at the front of the Netflix queue3. Finish the office TPS reports before the weekend4. Pick up the copy of The Master and Margarita that’s on hold at the library5. Check the Haile Selassie wiki entry to see if the account of the attempted coup in Cutting for Stone was factualThe list may be much longer than this, but the shortened version above will illustrate the point well enough. Research shows we remember mental images of things much better than we do raw data by rote (things like numbers, playing cards, poems, or list items). Most people can only keep a random sequence of about 7 digits in their heads at a time when first hearing them. Memory experts have found that by transforming any sequence of things into pictures instead, and sticking these pictures in what they call a memory palace, that we can recall them much more effectively. An example should help show this.First of all, we need to visualize a place we know very well. This is the memory palace. In fact, the home you grew up in, while it may not have been a real palace, is probably rich in the kind of recallable detail that can help in retaining long sequences. We then position the mental images associated with the objects we’re trying to remember along a path within the home. In my case, that might mean I come to the front door where a little doe – say Bambi’s girlfriend Faline – is resting. You can tell by her eyes that she’s bored, though. She’s a “Bordeaux”. (I know it’s bad, but this is going to work.) Let the image burn into your brain for a moment. Once inside at the base of the stairs in the foyer I come to a freight car of a model train. It looks ridiculous spotted with pink polka dots, but hey, it’s a way to remember Trainspotting. Up the stairs on the left is a faux antique table. On it sits our mnemonic for TPS: miniature tepees. And just to make it more memorable, imagine that a teenager lives inside one of them and it was TPed with Charmin. (I was tempted to have Lumbergh say “Ummm… yeah…. “ at this point, but wasn’t sure that Office Space was a universal reference.) Then it’s a quick right into the living room. In the middle of it is a big hot tub, but instead of water inside, it’s a giant margarita. The drink comes complete with salt around the edge of the tub and a wedge cut from a lime the size of a beach ball. Inside the tub is a miniature ship with a master on board shouting orders. Some of the crew look like they wouldn’t mind walking the plank. Finally, through the entry way into the kitchen I see Marley’s ghost (Bob Marley, that is) and he’s sitting on the table with doctor/writer extraordinaire Abraham Verghese. In case the link to Haile Selassie isn’t clear, he was also known as Ras Tafari, viewed by many a Jamaican as a messianic figure. Surprisingly enough, Marley is not holding anything rolled up and burning; he’s got a dove perched on his hand instead and it’s cooing (which, of course, is auditorially equivalent to coup-ing).So there’s our list. Picture it in sequence one more time: the bored doe just inside the door, the spotted train at the base of the stairs, the tepees on the table at the top of the stairs, the ship master in the margarita in the living room, and finally, sitting on the kitchen table, the Selassie worshipper with the author of Cutting for Stone and the cooing dove. I could presumably have had dozens of these images stuck along a path throughout the house. The placement along a set route (say up the stairs and clockwise, hitting every room) helps since that way we aren’t as apt to skip anything. Experts also say it’s best to choose images that are ridiculous or racy or in any other way more apt to stick in your head. That pretty much covers the trick to memorization. To get an entire book out of the deal, though, Foer had to expand the scope. He started out mentioning the remarkable feats the elite memorizers can perform (x digits of pi, y decks of cards, z lines of verse). He then got into the small but interesting world of competitive memorization, including his own involvement. Foer began his investigation on a journalistic whim and ended up, with hard work and a lot of help from memory mentors, becoming the US champion. Even though the end result of his competition is mentioned at the outset, there is drama in how it unfolds. The competition involves several categories, one of which is memorizing card sequences. The trick in doing that is an offshoot of what I described above. The difference is that every card has a mental image associated with it that you spend days and days drilling into your head beforehand. Each mental image has a subject and a verb. The ace of clubs may be Karl Spackler (the Cinderella boy himself) teeing off at Augusta. The two of clubs may be Groucho Marx lighting a cigar. And so on for each card in the deck. Then, when you want to memorize the randomized order of a deck, you put these images in a fresh memory palace. Only to make fewer images necessary, you can join the subject of one card with the action of the next card into a single image. If the first card is the seven of diamonds (which you may have associated with Einstein twirling the tassel on his mortarboard) and the next one is the jack of spades (which is J.D. Salinger moonwalking, say) then the pair of those cards together would produce an image of Einstein moonwalking. Memorizing the deck would then involve 26 images. There may be variations, but that’s the basic approach. Sequences of digits are done similarly, only for that you may have 100 different pre-memorized images – one for each pair in the range from 00 to 99. Foer points out that our memories don’t get much of a workout these days. We all know how easy it is to rely on spell checks and Google searches for things we used to keep in our heads. So is it useful to keep more information available for immediate use? Probably. Foer argues that our ideas, abstractions, and arguments depend on recallable units that are the building blocks. What Foer does not do as effectively is demonstrate how the aforementioned devices help with that kind of practical memory. He admits to it, too, though only after he tells his fun story of the US Memory Championship. The “mental athletes” he first encountered were not what he’d expected. They were not savants, nor did they possess photographic memories. Rather, they’d all learned these visualization techniques that date back to the ancient Greeks. The top competitors were often the ones with the most creative images. After being coached by several top mnemonists, Foer was able to compete with the best in the US. He said he still loses his keys, though.There was more to this book as well. However, and I say this with a full appreciation of the irony, I don’t remember much of it. (It was several months ago.) There was a partial debunking of the savant from 60 Minutes who was “born on a blue day”, there was a bit on the tricks in reciting poems, and there was the blow-by-blow action of the memory competition. My impression at the time was that it was all fairly interesting, but not very useful in the end.So who remembers the to-do list? Would you have remembered it without the images? I just tested myself and I can recite it back without error, but then I’ve made six rounds of edits to this stupid review. I’d probably remember it anyway. Besides that, I usually have a pencil and paper. "

I'd give it one and a half stars but it is just not worth two.Moonwalking with Einstein: The Art & Science of Remembering Everything reads like a long magazine article - which is kind of where I found out about the book - The NY Times - last week. Having read the article, I was sufficiently impressed to get online and order the book. It arrived four days later and I couldn't wait to get started. At the onset of his book - which does have a snappy title - Foer was very clear this is not a 'how to' book but rather, it is an account of his one-year journey from being a journalist-spectator to becoming winner of the US Memory Championship. Maybe that's where I got off track. The NY Times article, detailed as it was, failed to mention that part. Its a critical detail - more than an oversight - in my estimation.Foer has a decent writing style - again, like a magazine article. This book is written in the vein of Malcolm Gladwell's books and it does have information but not quite as polished or as jam packed. So far, hardly anything that wasn't already mentioned on the NY Times synopsis has been written and little has been added to what I already read so I am feeling just a little bit ripped off - the subtitle seems to imply that the book will talk about, ""the art and science of remembering everything..."" For the sake of accuracy, it should read; ""My year-long journey toward becoming the US Memory champion with a few interesting tidbits about memory thrown in for good measure.""I'd give this book a grade of ""B+"" for style and an overall grade of ""D"" because it was not at all what it was hyped to be. The discontinuity between Foer's book title and its content are such that if I ever come across this writer's books again, I am going to be hard-pressed to trust him enough to plop down my hard-earned money because I will be less likely to fall for that trick twice.Foer's synopsis on the NY Times deserves an ""A"" - moreover, since he failed to expand the book that's where the material should have stayed.I am going to be recommending the NY Times synopsis - penned by the author and - which turns out to be $14.00 + shipping cheaper - not to mention, the article is (ironically) more directed at hard examples of just how memory techniques can be applied. I suppose if there is anything redeeming about Foer's book is its extensive bibliography.Other than that, save your money and check this book out at your local library where you can also photocopy the bibliography because it will offer more detail germane to the topic."

Joshua Foer was a journalist who wrote a story on the U.S. Memory Championship, and he became so intrigued by the chance to improve his memory that he spent a year training to become a ""mental athlete."" The book covers his year spent learning about mnemonics and memory palaces and all of the memorable (ahem) characters he met along the way. My favorite sections covered the history of memorization -- it goes back to the ancient Greeks, when Socrates famously complained that writing destroys memory -- and some inspiring passages on how to make your life seem more full:""Monotony collapses time; novelty unfolds it. You can exercise daily and eat healthily and live a long life, while experiencing a short one. If you spend your life sitting in a cubicle and passing papers, one day is bound to blend unmemorably into the next -- and disappear. That's why it's important to change routines regularly, and take vacations to exotic locales, and have as many new experiences as possible that can anchor our memories. Creating new memories stretches out psychological time, and lengthens our perception of our lives.""The last chapter and the epilogue cover the memory championships in which Foer competed, but the outcome of those events really doesn't matter. By then, it was clear that the purpose of a good memory isn't just for party tricks like memorizing a deck of cards; more importantly, it teaches you to become more mindful in your life."

4,159420229X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/16958299-dr-appu-sasidharan,4,"This is a book discussing the topic of memory in-depth written by 2006 USA Memory champion, Joshua Foer. These are some of the interesting topics discussed in this book.
Memory Athletes
 Memory athletes compete in memorising information like that of names, decks of cards, random numbers, digits of pi. They compete in different memory competitions organised by International Association of Memory and World Memory Sports Council. The USA Memory Championship (USAMC) takes place every year in NYC. It is considered as an Olympiad for mental athletes. 

 The author is describing the various methods like the different mnemonic techniques that the athletes use to memorise for these competitions. We can use some of these methods in our everyday life and academic life effectively. If you have extraordinary memory power USAMC is the adroit way to showcase your talent. 
Mind Map
 It is a method used to organise information visually. It is a technique popularized by Tony Buzan. It is a simple technique of writing the major ideas in the centre and other ideas branching out from it. They are also called spider diagrams and are very effective in memorising difficult concepts and is very useful for review and recall. 


Savant Syndrome
 If you have seen the movie Rain Man, you can never forget the character played by Dustin Hoffman, who was suffering from Savant syndrome. 

 It is a condition where someone with mental disabilities has some extraordinary abilities. They usually also have an autism spectrum disorder. Latest DSM-5 has excluded it from mental disorder. Savant skills are usually found in 1) Memory2) Arithmetic3) Art4) Music5) Spatial skills
Eidetic Memory or Photographic Memory
 This is one of the most exciting topics in this book. We always think about how to take a mental snapshot of a page in the textbook (especially during the last minute cramming in the night before the exams). The people with eidetic memory can do that. Is the eidetic memory more a myth than a reality? Joshua Foer is describing it in detail in this book. According to Foer, there is only one proper Scientific study pointing out the existence of a person with Eidetic memory. That was a study done in Harvard by Charles F Stromeyer on a 23-year-old Harvard teacher named Elizabeth. He wrote in his research that ""Her eidetic ability, or photographic memory, is so great that she can hallucinate at will a beard on a clean-shaven man or repeat a page of poetry written in a foreign language verbatim-backwards and forwards-after merely looking at it."" Elizabeth is the only person who had passed the Eidetic memory test. Interestingly, no other study was done on Elizabeth, who later became Stromeyer's wife. So many of the Scientists believe that eidetic memory is an “unfounded myth.” If you are interested in any of the above-discussed topics, you will undoubtedly love this book. Joshua Foer achieved the impossible feat of having a cerebral discussion that is palatable to everyone through this book."

It's about Josh's journey to winning the biggest little award in the US... which is NOT why I read this book.Sure, the overall story was interesting, there were some useful tips, and some real truths came out of the work. However, this book is not, I repeat, about *teaching* the ""Art and Science of Remembering Everything"". I will admit I went into the book expecting much in the way of being taught some useful skills so my rating reflects this entry bias.Read it for a decently entertaining tale of participative journalism.

6,159420229X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/175635-trevor,3,"This wasn’t a bad book – I quite enjoyed some of it and the author sometimes had me laughing in the way you can’t help but laugh the first time you see the last scene of the very first Star Wars movie. About twenty years ago I first came across Tony Buzan. I read a couple of his books and even learnt enough of his methods to be able to memorise an entire weekly shopping list and to go around the supermarket without paper. The problem was that I quickly came to the conclusion that ‘learning’ has very little to do with ‘remembering’ – particularly when ‘remembering’ is defined as keeping strings of more or less unconnected facts in mind. There is quite a lot of this book dedicated to watching the author learn to remember a deck of cards in a very short time. Perhaps, if I was a gambler, this might seem a much more worthwhile task. However, like too many memory feats, this just seems like a waste of life. Part of this book talks about learning poetry by heart and how hard this can be. But he does say that at least with learning poetry by heart you can bring texts with you wherever you go. This is the desert island scenario, but rather than getting to choose a book to bring with you at the last minute, you in fact spend your life ensuring you always have favourites with you just in case. Now, this is a worthwhile thing to do, there is never a time when you can be bored if you can think your way through a great poem. For years I used to memorise poems – I have, more or less by heart – poems such as The Second Coming, La Figlia Chi Piange (which I do with extravagant hand gestures) and have tried and failed for years to learn Sonnet 129 – the lists of nouns and the inversions trip me every time. But it all comes in handy eventually – I was talking to my mother the other day about growing older and was able to quote one of my remembered poems to her in full:The cruel girls we loved Are over forty,Their subtle daughters Have stolen their beauty;And with a blue stare Of cool surprise,They mock their anxious mothersWith their mothers’ eyes.(Now that I’ve checked my memory against the poem it seems I almost remembered it – but couldn’t quite remember what kind of surprise they had, I had it as cruel for a second time – and the line breaks I remembered as fewer – mine was a poem of four lines in total, but I still knew there was a big break between beauty and And.)A couple of weeks ago my eldest daughter and I were walking around St Kilda talking about this and that. Now, St Kilda has lots of streets that are named after poets – and we came to Herbert Street and I told her it was probably named after George Herbert, a poet she didn’t know and so I started quoting The Collar – God, I love that poem, I love it so very much. I love how it gets increasingly annoyed with itself and how the end is the calm after the climax. In fact, the rushing urgency of the poem is very much like sex, now I think of it.Ted Hughes has a wonderful book I can’t recommend too highly called By Heart – about the poems you should learn by heart and why.The problem with memory is that we think we know what it is – but really, memory is much more complicated than we generally imagine. I tend to think there are three kinds of memory: recognition, recall and recollection. Recall is the one that is most ‘prized’ – particularly by the Tony Buzan’s of the world. Being able to recall pi to 300 decimal places might seem a remarkable thing to some minds – but as someone who would train huskies to turn and eat their adventurers after they had crossed the first ice field or on the call of the twentieth ‘mush’ on their way to the North Pole, I have to say the whole thing seems rather pointless to me. I’ve never really liked the ‘because it’s there’ excuse for doing anything. Recall is hard, and is often the only type of memory we bother ‘testing’ – but really, it is hard because it isn’t something that we humans actually need all that often.We are infinitely better at recognition. We may not remember names, but by god we remember faces and what those faces have meant to us. Names are a recall task – faces a recognition task. There is a lovely experiment where people are shown a thousand photographs and asked to remember as many as they can. Generally, people are only able to remember about 2% - our recall is a very weak type of memory. But if you add another thousand photos and show them to the people again and ask which photos they have seen before then you get about 98% right, our recognition ability is almost infallible.. The point being, that if you want to remember something then you need to link it to your recognition memory, and not rely on your recall memory. The memory palaces and techniques described in this book rely on this fact and virtually this fact alone.The third kind of memory is our most dangerous and also our most interesting. We think we ‘remember’ our lives – in much the same way that these guys spending their time memorising cards remember lists of disconnected facts – but actually, we don’t remember disconnected facts in any sense at all well. What we remember is story. And facts tend to get twisted out of recognition if they don't fit with the story we have chosen to tell. Try telling someone about a fight you had between with your partner and not only will the story prove to be rather self-serving, but much more interestingly (if there is a way to compare what you have to say with what actually happened), your ‘story’ will drop facts in ways that make for a good story – rather than a true story. We re-collect facts to fit our narrative, sometimes adding some to help the story make sense, often dropping some that add nothing or that no longer fit.I got to witness this happening at the start of the year when I was on a jury. We watched hours of film from hotel security cameras and we listened to people, good people, trying their best to tell the truth, but being repeatedly caught out completely misremembered something. Sometimes the disbelief these witnesses felt in being proven they had misremembered a key fact – clearly shown on the videotape in complete contradiction to what they had said – was utterly remarkable to witness. I’ve known for a long time narrative-flow trumps fact every time. But I never knew quite how much that was the case until I sat in that jury box trying to decide if I could reconstruct the truth of what had happened that night from the all-too-fallible memories of a dozen or so ‘witnesses’.My point is that you can remember as many cards as you like, but recall memory is by far the least interesting of the three types of memory we humans have. By far the most important is recollection – it is the story we tell ourselves about our lives and therefore the story that structures how we experience the world (past, present and future). This has virtually nothing to do with recall, despite what we tell ourselves – in some ways we could say recollection is the series of lies we tell to ourselves to help us make sense of our lives, but if they are lies, they are lies we believe implicitly and breathlessly.Like I said, I quite enjoyed this – the guy got to compete in various memory events and shows that hard work brings rewards. Buzan repeatedly talks about the ‘education revolution’ his memory tricks will bring – you might notice that in the twenty years since I first noticed him his revolution hasn’t quite gotten off the ground. But then, we’ve waited longer for the second coming of Christ, so if Buzan wishes to slouch his way toward Bethlehem, who am I to stop him? He seems to be making buckets of money in his widening gyre, if nothing else."

I’m a competitive person (as are most of you reviewers out there). A few years ago I would have added the word “very” in front of competitive; I’ve mellowed as I’ve aged but I remember the lengths I went to in order to be the best at whatever I deemed important. But I’m fairly certain I would not go to such lengths to win a memory competition.Joshua Foer thought it was a dandy idea…..Joshua found himself in the world of competitive memory when he decided he wanted to do a journalistic book about the subject and the people in it. Apparently, and I didn’t know this, there is a world competition for memory. These people memorize long lists of numbers, decks on top of decks of cards, poetry….ect, all to repeat what they remember to some judges in hopes of winning. My question was why? What purpose could this possibly serve? Who needs a skill like this and when would one have the need to memorize 20 decks of cards?As the author points out in the book, we no longer need to remember much of anything these days, all our electronic gadgets serve as our external memory. When was the last time you memorized a phone number? Pretty close to “a really flippin long time ago” I would guess. To accomplish the mind boggling feet of, say, memorizing the order of cards in many set of cards in just minutes, they use the technique called mnemonics. What this is, is making a visual backdrop for each card, or number, or object and putting them in ‘memorable’ situations doing strange things……and apparently the raunchier the better. Trust me you don’t want to know what his mind had conjured up for Bill Clinton and a Watermelon, but I will never forget it. Competition got the better of Foer, and he went from writing a book about memory competitors to being a competitor himself. He wanted the American memory championship bad! So bad he resorted to wearing blacked out goggles with small holes in them to see whatever he studying and to wearing earmuffs to minimize distractions. That's dedication."

But! OMG you guys, my memory is so laughably bad. And apparently this book might possibly have a side effect of helping me improve that, which would be worth slogging through a middling memoir.***Here's another book I'm sad I never found time to review. It was a great case of proving my open-mindedness (ha)—although I went in very ready to hate, I was totally charmed by this. Moonwalking is a strange window into a very strange world; if you didn't know there was a ""competitive memory"" circuit, you're in for some fun (and some bemused head-shaking). It's actually also a very good use of the ""I did this wacky thing for a year, and then I wrote a book about it!"" genre, because it's fascinating to watch Joshua completely embrace a new hobby and get totally embroiled in it, but I'm glad he then extricated and went back to (presumably) his normal life. I'd like to say other things about this book, like to tell you about the very fascinating people you'll meet herein, and the unbelievably intricate lengths people go to to build their competitive-memory chops, such as constructing ""memory palaces"" completely populated with bizarre statuary and bric-a-brac, which is assigned excruciatingly specific meaning that corresponds to the thing you're trying to remember—but look, I read this book over a year ago, and I didn't actually do any of those memory-training exercises, even while I was reading, and so: nope. Nothing much more was retained.It's a great book, though."
10,159420229X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3621230-angie,4,"Joshua Foer begins exploring memory at the US Memory Competition, where he watches people who claim to have normal memory capacity memorize lists of phone numbers, the order of decks of cards, and poems in mere minutes. Intrigued, he eventually decides to compete in the competition himself and receives help from leaders in memory techniques along the way.Foer weaves his experience in memory training with research and a history of the practice. With a casual, story-telling style he takes you on a meandering but fascinating journey. I enjoyed that he was able to take himself seriously while also poking some fun at himself and his memory competitors. While he begins as an outsider looking in, by the end, he really seemed to become a part of this eclectic community.I came to this book curious to know how I could improve my own unreliable memory. Foer does make a serious case that most people who dedicate themselves to learning memory techniques could learn how to do some pretty awesome party tricks. However, once I learned what that dedication required, I lost interest in doing any sort of serious memory training.However, I think this book makes a strong point that being more aware of what we're taking in, and finding ways to record it on our external memory devices like computers and notebooks, can improve our own creative output. I found it an interesting commentary on what we may have lost along the way as we have gained more ways to store and record information."

I often hear 'good memory is useless with technology' or 'memory techniques are tricks, but wouldn't add value to my life'. I think both of these are wrong. I've been spending this Christmas understanding more about memory because I think there's significant leverage in being productive with these techniques.I have varies situational checklists. If I am about to buy something, I ask myself simple questions such as ""Would I buy this again if it broke?"", ""Have I wanted this for more than a month?"", ""Does this replace something I already have, or does it add a new need?"" and ""If I get this, will I have to resist the urge to get 10 other things to go along with it?"". I have checklists for making decisions: ""What would change my mind about this decision?"", ""What alternatives have been seriously considered?"" and ""What can we do to get our feet wet, without jumping in heads first?"". I have lists of the mental models, principles and cognitive biases that I use on most problems I face: inversion, second-order effects, black swans, survivorship bias, antifragility, conditioning, fundamental attribution error, and so on. I have a 20+ point checklists for reviewing code.The problem with these lists is that they're stored in an app on my phone. I only run through them on occasion, despite finding value every time I do. It's difficult to condition myself to use them as often as I'd like. In the middle of a discussion, it's disruptive to pull up a list on your phone and work through it. With a memory palace, I can install these checklists in my head to run through at any point in time. I've started doing this since reading the book and it's provided the impetus to finally adopt memory palaces into my day-to-day. I don't have many of them yet, in fact, the only one is a subset of my list of mental models, principles, and biases. I've built this on a couple of streets in the city I grew up in. I start the memory palace in the parking lot of my kindergarten. There, I see a bunch of people doing headstands. It reminds me to attempt to invert the problem. On the sidewalk, I see a bunch of domino pieces falling. This prompts me to consider second-order and third-order thinking. I look over the fence, inside the kindergarten. There's a tall, blue tower and I see a monkey throwing carrots. That means I should think about what the incentives are in the problem at hand. Do the incentives of the systems line up with those of the individuals? I keep walking and see a massive, exponentially shaped slide, thinking of compounding. Soon enough a black swan jumps out, causing me to think of Taleb's black swan. I see clocks on the pavement and I think of whether everyone is operating on the same time-scale, or if the disagreement is formed because some are thinking on a 1-month time-scale, and others on a 1-year time-scale? I see a barbell, think of antifragility. A plane, and think of survivorship bias. I have about 20 mental models and biases incorporated in this model so far.This may seem slow, but in fact, I'd be able to name all of the models in seconds. It's extremely fast to run through this list. Adding new models is only getting easier, too.Remembering numbers and card games isn't particularly useful for me, but these are just easy-to-evaluate tests for a competition format to test how productive someone is with memory palaces. They don't do the techniques justice. As you use these techniques more and more, it becomes easier to form mental images to build palaces. I'm only a week in, and I'm already building small palaces for the books I'm reading and vocabulary I'm currently learning. This makes it easy to go through it when you aren't reading the book.Fundamentally, as a result of reading this book and other resources on memory, I've come to think of a brain as a data structure with the following strengths:* Great at building associations* Extremely visual and spatially oriented* Good at appending, poor at updating, mediocre at recallBoiling memory down to these limitations makes it easier for me to understand why palaces are so useful. The brain is poor at lists and numbers unless packaged into visual, spatial and associations—for which the memory palace is a fantastic technique. If you think of building memories in terms of these strengths, it makes a dramatic difference.I like the book because it has a compelling narrative. The problem with it is that it doesn't go deep enough into how to use memory day-to-day, despite my hypothesis that it is useful in day-to-day life. Adopting these techniques is hard work, don't read the book if you don't see any use for it. But if you do, this is a fantastic place to start. Something I found incredibly surprising is that we used to be much better at remembering than we are now. In ancient greece, they had perfected these techniques to remember. Before the printing press, getting your hand on a book was rare. When you did, you made sure to memorize as much of it as possible. With Gutenberg, we had the first wave of suppressing the importance of memory. The second wave came with smartphones and the Internet, where everything seems to be just seconds away. I certainly agree that this changes things in terms of what we need to remember, but I feel that strategically applying these techniques would yield great results. I look forward to see if I'm still using them months and years from now."
12,159420229X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6610433-midnightfaerie,4,"Moonwalking with Einstein was a phenomenal book that made me feel differently about myself. An average student growing up, I still felt I was a step behind everyone when it came to ""getting stuff"". So I made a point to know things ahead of time, go over itinerary for conventions, review code and new techniques for a meeting before the meeting or seminar happened, memorize rules and lists for activities in which I belonged to in a group, etc. Because of this I was often seen as being in the ""top of the class"" or ""In the know"", but the truth was I was terrified of looking stupid, a particular insecurity of mine. As I got older I learned to live with my strengths and weaknesses, but some of those habits are still around. I'm convinced my obsession with reading comes from this insecurity as well. The problem is, like the old adage says, the more I read, the more I know, and the more I know, the more I realize I really don't know anything. And then there's the whole retention rate. How much of what we digest do we really retain? Then one of my book clubs suggested this book about world memory championships and I was fascinated. Like most, my first thought was that these people that memorize numerous decks of cards or numbers that are twenty thousand digits long have innate abilities or are savants of sorts. But Foer shows us this isn't necessarily true. In fact, he's convinced many people that are labeled special or savants are just normal people that have utilized these age old memorization techniques. I was hooked. Is it possible that I could be retaining even more information? That I could make myself (at least feel) smarter? I was determined to find out. Foer is a journalist that just happens to stumble on the memory championships and decides to train for a year and compete, to test his theories. This book is both eye-opening and thought provoking. Is it possible we've been teaching our children the wrong way to learn in schools? How do the experts in certain fields learn what they do? How is it that they show super human like abilities in analyzing and understanding their fields? In science? In chess? In cricket? Foer explores the many different memory techniques that have become standard for these memory sports. He also researches the whole idea of human memory at the same time. He gets tested himself before and after he starts training, he talks to scientists and psychologists who have studied this field for years and looks at various case studies that have been done over the years. He interviews people with various memory deficiencies/abilities, from world renown savants to a man who can't retain any information longer than it takes to concentrate on it. Foer does an exceptional job with looking at both sides of the issues, but keeping an open mind all the way up until the end. His struggles and humorous imagery he uses for some of his techniques stay with you long after you've read the book. As I read the book and began to learn some of these techniques, I immediately began to employ them. The lady at the library that I asked three times what her name was, my grocery list, the names and interests of the twenty or so families that I've recently come to know in my church group. I employed techniques for all of these and was surprised to find how quickly the information came to me when trying to recall them. I've chosen a memory palace and have decided to memorize a small book I use for reference all the time called, ""Know your Bible: All 66 books explained and applied"". I use it constantly to look up the name of the book or the general idea of the book of the Bible I'm studying. I also wanted to memorize the names of the books of the Bible in order, as it makes for much easier referencing. So, I keep this book next to my bed, and have begun using my childhood home as my memory palace, forming imagery as I walk through my house to retain the information. This is a popular technique Foer explains in the book, especially when memorizing lists of concrete things, like a grocery list. It's working wonderfully. The more obnoxious or silly the image, the easier it is to retain the information. I won't go into each scene, but I will say some of my scenes include the Oompla Loompas, Professor Dumbledore, and talking French Peas. (Not all in the same scene though) I found the history of some of these techniques fascinating as well, especially the sexual aspect of it. As you can imagine, lewd and obscene sexual acts might come in handy in forming imagery to remember things, and it was because of this, at some point in history it was sometimes banned as being immoral. In demonstrating to the reader the technique of using the memory palace to memorize a grocery list, he used an image of Claudia Shiffer covered in cottage cheese. He described the clumps of it falling off of her and asked the reader to imagine the smell of it. Many days later, I still can't get that image out of my mind, and will have no problem if I ever need to remember cottage cheese on my shopping list. But, with much humor, Foer also demonstrates the down side to sometimes using sexual acts to remember. For remembering playing cards he needed to remember a person, action, and item for each card, then (without going into too much description) as the cards are shown in a particular order, you have these people, items, and acts/verbs mixed up to form new images. He made the mistake of including some sexual acts as some of the verbs and his mother as one of the people. You can see how this got him into trouble. He ended up having to go back and change some of his image decisions or endure some mental scarring. All in all though, are these techniques enough to really help us retain information or are they just fancy tricks that really have no real world use? Does memorizing your address book really matter when you can't remember where you put your car keys? Well, that's for you to decide. But Foer does an excellent job of exploring all sides of this entertaining phenomenon. And I highly recommend this book.  ClassicsDefined.com"
13,159420229X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/146952-grumpus,5,"I love his style of writing...fun and chatty. Nice introductory chapters and a technique I learned while listening on the train (for half an hour) that allowed me to come home and impress my kids by having them write down a 50-digit number and then me recalling it digit-by-digit in order for them.I never thought about it before, but the book points out that before pen and paper, anything that needed to be preserved had to be memorized. That is why so many of the techniques mentioned in the book are from antiquity and continue to stand the test of time.The mind likes sequential memories. Memories that are stored as part of a story that are made as multi-sensorial in the mind as possible are easily recalled. After finishing the book and applying some of the techniques, I can attest to the fact that my mind does operate in this fashion. Once a memory association is started vast amounts of information can be easily stored and retrieved. It is like knocking over the first domino in a series. They just lead into the next thought, which leads into the next. I was amazed how effortless it becomes once you get going.The book also chronicles the author’s story of covering both the U.S. and world memory championships as a journalist that ultimately led to his own appearance in the tournament one year later. No spoilers here regarding how he did.His story, the history of memory, and how to apply some of these memory methods make for an enjoyable book with practical applications in your daily life. I have been inspired to see how big of a memory athlete I too can become. Highly recommend. "

This book is a fast read..(funny, somewhat interesting, somewhat useful)June: 2015... 4 years later: i've come back to change my rating from 2 stars to 4 stars This book actually is brilliant I remember it quite well. It didn't deserve 2 stars. The ending is actually very touching. My reason for giving it 2 stars four years ago is I didn't think I personally was very good at the techniques in the book.

15,159420229X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3335664-david,5,"What do chicken sexers, chess masters, and SWAT officers have in common? They all become good at what they do by memorizing a vast amount of highly specialized information that allows them to make instant judgments. Moonwalking with Einstein is about memory, and is the most interesting non-fiction book I've read in the past year. It's full of interesting facts, a history of the art of memory and how it relates to the history of reading, and a lot of surprising information I did not know about how memory works.The author, Joshua Foer, was initially just writing a magazine article on the U.S. Memory Championship. This is a highly geeky competition for a handful of obsessive ""mental athletes"" who compete in events like memorizing long strings of random numbers, decks of cards, and lines of poetry. The tricks they can do are impressive, and for the true champions, may seem to border on superhuman. What Foer learns, though, is that they are just tricks - learned techniques. In fact, with few exceptions, all those fantastic feats of extraordinary memory you have heard about are not tricks performed by savants with superhuman recall, but people with perfectly ordinary brains who have learned special memory techniques. Anyone can do it!The key to becoming really great at memorizing, and the reason why everyone doesn't learn these (fairly simple, when you get down to it) techniques and impress their friends at parties, is that memory techniques are like playing chess or the piano — anyone can do it, and anyone who puts in serious effort can become pretty good at it (at least good enough to impress people who aren't very good at it), but to become great at it requires lots and lots of practice and years of study, like any other skill.Still, it was quite a revelation to me that this is a skill that anyone can learn. There is really no such thing as ""photographic memory"" and those guys who memorize the entire Bible cover to cover or can recite pi out to thousands of digits do not actually have memories, or brains, that are any better than yours or mine.To prove it, Foer decides to enter the U.S. Memory Championship himself. I won't spoil the ending, but after just one year of training, he does very well indeed. Part of the book is his own odyssey of memory competition and reporting on the U.S. and international memory competition scene (American competitors he likens to the Jamaican bobsledding team - very enthusiastic, but not considered serious competitors internationally; what breaks records in the U.S. is barely qualifying in European championships.)So what are these ""tricks""? Foer describes the techniques in the book, but basically, you learn to build ""memory palaces"" constructed from places very familiar to you, and stock them with vivid, memorable, often outrageous images (a 14th century author of a treatise on memory techniques offended churchmen by admitting that he used images of, ahem, comely maidens in his memory palaces) that you associate with whatever it is you want to memorize. So if you are memorizing numbers, you might come up with a system in which 137 is Britney Spears performing a karate kick while standing on the back of a giant turtle, and you place her in your living room, and then the next chunk of numbers is another image which is in the hallway to your bedroom. If this sounds unlikely or bizarre, read the book (or go read one of the books that actually teaches the techniques). To prove it works, I am typing this right now off the top of my head without having spent any time with brute force, rote memorization:

   A jar of pickled garlic 
   Cottage cheese 
   Peat-smoked salmon 
   Six bottles of white wine 
   Three pairs of socks
That's a partial grocery list Foer gives you in one chapter — as much of it as I bothered to memorize when he gave a quickie tutorial to demonstrate how the technique works. This is several days after reading it, and according to the brain scientists Foer interviews, it's possible that that list will stick in my head for months or years. Seriously, the ""palace of memory"" works!The only problem is, as Foer points out, there actually aren't that many situations in the modern world where this kind of memorization is actually useful. We now have externalized memories in the form of books, computers, sticky notes, etc. Memorizing huge volumes of information that you could just as easily grab with a Google search doesn't seem worth it.But these ""memory palaces"" go back to ancient Greece, and at one time, every educated person used these techniques. That is why lawyers, orators, poets, kings, generals, doctors, monks, and so on, were famous for being able to give long speeches or recite back a long body of work from memory - everyone learned to do it. Before the printing press, when books were rare and expensive, people wouldn't just read as many books as they could get their hands on, they'd make a serious study of a handful of books in their lifetime and pretty much commit each volume to memory.Really, really interesting book. Will change the way you think about memory and intelligence, expertise, and maybe even reading. My highest non-fiction recommendation!"
16,159420229X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2908629-ellie,4,"I enjoyed Moonwalking with Einstein: The Art and Science of Remembering Everything by Joshua Foer. I guess I just wanted it to be more...life-changing. And I resented its movement between a theoretical examination of memory, a history of memory and memory techniques, and the author's experience with a group of hard-core champions of memory contests. The author happens upon the world of memory training in which people perform amazing feats of memory and claim that their memory is only average, that we could all (pretty much) do what they do if we trained ourselves. The book is a recounting of Foer's year training with the experts to compete in memory championships. Along the way, Foer recounts the history of memorization-its one-time primacy, its fall into disrespect and its current championship by some educators. He has some fascinating stories to tell and raises some interesting questions as well. Before writing, memory was the only way to transmit information, culture, and history. Even after writing was invented and became common, even, in fact, after the printing press was invented, books were (Foer informs us) more of a memory aid than a source of information. As books became more sophisticated, it became easier to access the information they contained and gradually at first, then, with the advent of the Internet, extremely quickly, memory no longer seemed important. Foer raises an important question: Although memory does not constitute understanding, facts are an essential foundation to learning. As a teacher, I find myself defending the need to memorize a sets of basic facts so that the students can then proceed to think about them and analyze them.Stories about individuals whose memories have been damaged along with stories of ""savants"" were of more interest to me for the questions they raised about the function of memory in forming our identity and as a necessary constituent of relationships than for their anecdotal pleasure. Generally, my dissatisfaction with the book came from what is also its major attraction: a lot of information is covered in a relatively short space. In fact, not just a lot of information, but a lot of different areas-history, education, psychology-along with the current tale of Foer's training and the people he meets along the way. The book left me dissatisfied in that it didn't seem to offer a coherent starting point for further investigation because of the rapidity with which it covered so many important issues.On the other hand, I was fascinated by much of the book and will spend time trying to sort out the questions it raised and decide where to go next with it. And that's a great thing for a book to do. "
17,159420229X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/793473-clif-hostetler,3,"This book explores technics that can be utilized to remember things. It's not a ""how to"" book, but rather it's an account of a year in the author's life dedicated to the training in the use of mnemonics to change from being a person with ""normal"" memory to winner of the USA Memory Championship. The basic point seems to be that you don't need to have a good memory to remember things. What's needed is to use the human brain's natural abilities at remembering images as a means to remember the esoteric things of today such as telephone numbers, names of strangers, and in the case of memory championships, the order of a shuffled deck of playing cards. Humans are descended from a long line of hunter gathers who needed to remember where to find food and how to find their way back home. Thus the ability to remember numbers or names of strangers did not play a role in natural selection. That is why today we have minds that can remember images better than we can remember numbers and names. Mnemonics is the technic of utilizing the human brain's natural strength as a means for helping those areas where the brain is naturally weak.As the book's narrative follows the author's year of mnemonic training it addresses miscellaneous facts about the history of memorization technics, examples of unusual memory abilities, and miscellaneous neurological facts. So the reader of this book can learn some worthwhile facts of history and science which I found to be of more interest than the author's work at mnemonic training.I feel sorry for any readers who pick up this book with the expectation that it is about Einstein. I went through the whole book and didn't recall any reference to Einstein. So I did a word search of the ebook text and found the word Einstein mentioned two places. One place in the author's training he mentions that he uses the imagined image of ""Albert Einstein's thick white mane"" as a way to remember the playing card, ""three of diamonds."" Then later in the book after the author has developed a system of images to remember all possible three card combinations, the word ""Einstein"" is used again. Under this enhanced system, ""Myself moonwalking with Einstein,"" stands for, ""four of spades, king of hearts, and three of diamonds.""The author admits that even though he is able to memorize the order of a deck of cards in less than two minutes, he still can't remember where he left his car keys."
18,159420229X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/155663-david,4,"This is a fascinating book about the subculture of memory competitions. Joshua Foer, a journalist, decided to explore this subculture by attending competitions and talking with a number of the competitors. He relates some of the astounding feats of memory, like reciting 50,000 or even 80,000 digits of pi. He interviews Kim Peek, about whom the film Rain Man was written. Kim Peek really has the mental abilities portrayed by Dustin Hoffman in the movie, but is much more sociable (maybe even overly sociable) in real life. But Peek is quite unlike the other characters in the book, for his mental abilities come naturally, apparently without effort or practice.Foer decided that the best way to understand the technical approaches used by mentalists, is to try learning the set of mental tricks himself. He is approached by a world-class competitor, who acts as a tutor and a mentor. Foer learns and practices the mental tricks, such as the ""memory palace."" In the palace, the mentalist imagines a set of rooms that one follows in a preset order. In each room the mentalist places vivid (and often sexual) images that correspond to numbers/cards/dates in a pre-planned way. The trick is to place these images quickly, as the competitions are races against time. Within a year, Foer finds himself a real contender for the American memory champion!"
19,159420229X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/25353295-carmen,3,"This was a book about a man who learns to improve his memory in order to compete in the memory competition. The book talks a lot about creating 'memory palaces' in your mind in order to remember things. One thing that really annoyed me about this book was the sheer amount of time and effort these people put into memorizing useless stuff when I struggle so much with foreign language acquisition. This book also teaches that one should 'practice better, not harder.' Also, their methods of memorization involve imagining some pretty gross stuff that I don't think I want in my mind. “There are no limits. There are plateaus, but you must not stay there, you must go beyond them. If it kills you, it kills you.” - Bruce Lee, p.185. It also seems that people with the best memories have no life (and no job). There is also a difference, I believe, between learning and memorizing, although the author makes the case that you can't do one without the other. Learning without understanding, really knowing the text you have memorized, etc. are all concerns of mine. He argues that it 'takes knowledge to gain knowledge' and that everything expands on your memory (which is called a database). I don't know if I necessarily agree.He really tears down Daniel Tammet (author of Born on a Blue Day: Inside the Extraordinary Mind of an Autistic Savant) for reasons I can't quite understand (he feels threatened by him?). I am sorry to say I laughed at his description of Kim and Kim's childhood. It also made me laugh to imagine (not suggested in the book) that one could self-injure their left brain in order to become a savant. I like that, at the end, he suggests all that work was really for nothing and he still forgets plenty in real life."
20,159420229X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1045774-mehrsa,4,"I've been meaning to read this book since I first read Foer describe the concept of the memory castle in a magazine article with the book's release. Honestly, there isn't much more in here than that. I did love the emphasis on memorizing as learning--that's how I was taught in grade school in another country and I still get a lot of satisfaction for memorizing things. Although these days, I can't even remember a phone number for 3 seconds. "

There are many areas here related to education which inspired me (most interestingly and somewhat removed slightly from memory of the concept of the ‘ok plateau’), and of which I must further research, but... the memory palace was extraordinary! I sat with my two daughters and we moved in just an hour from remembering 7 +/- 2 bits of info to 24. And could easily recount them the following day, even backwards!Those who are familiar with my reviews will know how poor my memory is, I am astounded. So how much use will this be to me or my students? I’m really not sure (without spoilers, there’s an excellent anecdote at the end of the book related to its usefulness). I really aim to find out though. Loved this!!!"
23,159420229X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5204784-vonia,5,"Plain and simple. This is a valuable book that overviews so much more than the title. There are a few pages highlighting the basics on how to be an ""expert"" menocist, but really these are things that need to be practiced; it is nothing that cannot be easily found elsewhere. All can be traced to The Method of Loci/The Memory Palace Technique, a mnemonic device adopted in ancient Roman and Greek rhetorical treatises (in the anonymous Rhetorica ad Herennium, Cicero's De Oratore, and Quintilian's Institutio Oratoria). In basic terms, it is a method of memory enhancement which uses visualization to organize and recall information; data is stored in a sequence of memorable images that can be translated back into their original form (i.e., remembering a groceries list would translate into placing said list items into various ""locations"" around a house; the more memorable the image, the better. On recall, the idea is that the individual would ""walk"" through the house, the images coming to mind with relative ease). Many memory contest champions claim to use this technique to recall faces, digits, and lists of words. These champions’ successes have little to do with brain structure or intelligence, but more to do with their technique of using regions of their brain that have to do with spatial learning. He includes The Major System and the PAO System for memorizing numbers and cards, and Mind Mapping by Buzan, founder of The Memory Championship in this country. In fact, the title is completely misleading, as it really is not so much a guide on how to become an expert in memorization as it is a reference/informational book on so many intriguing topics, from The Art of Memory to The History of Printing to Savant Syndrome to Defining Expertise to Linguistics, Humanities, Mythology, Psychology, Sociology, Neurosciences... The list goes on, as Foer managed to cover a lot of research in his year, unemployed, studying for The National Memory Championships. He also meets Daniel Tammet (formerly Corney), a famous savant whom he manages to ""debunk"" a little, Kim Peek, inspiration for ""Rain Man"", & ""EP"", who seems to essentially be the character in ""50 First Dates"" whom forgets everything within two minutes (not Drew Barrymore, but the guy they meet together @ the hospital). Aside from all this fascinating information there is Foer's story; the memoir aspect of the book in which he documents his year in training, his transition from reporter at the event one year with a mere interest in the techniques used to becoming a serious competitor in the following year's event. Yes, I will say I am quite impressed that Foer was able to win it all; as The 2006 United States of America Memory Champion, he represented the nation in the international circuit. Of course, as in all things education, we are far subpar in the international realm, so Foer, although still managing to perform impressively, did not place. Foer states in the epilogue that he had no hesitation in deciding never to compete again; although fun, challenging, etcetera, he knew there were better ways to use his time. The important thing he has from his year immersed in this subculture is the insightful proof that with enough work, enough practice, enough desire, the brain can do quite awesome things. As obvious and/or cliche as this seems, I agree with Foer completely. This is my take away from his story, as well."
24,159420229X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4174287-robert-delikat,5,"I just realized that my last three books had to do with memory: Remembrance of Things Past, The Man Who Mistook His Wife for a Hat and Moonwalking with Einstein (MwE). It was certainly not intentional and the Proust was not really about memory per se, only the title suggests that. But MwE is all about memory. If you are looking for a self-help book on improving your memory, you might wish to look elsewhere, perhaps something by Tony Buzan who is a very important character in MwE. This is not to suggest that the author does not elucidate many of the techniques used by MAs or Mental Athletes as the memory champions of the world are called. One might think that the individuals who compete at the national and international memory competitions are mentally-gifted or Savants. Not so. In fact, by definition, Savantism, as described in the literature, is that rare condition that, among other aspects of the syndrome, has as a commonality among its holders a prodigious memory that while very deep, is also exceedingly narrow. MAs on the other hand have memories that can, to name only a few, manage and regurgitate ordered lists of hundreds of random numbers, orders of multiple, shuffled decks of cards, poetry never before seen and all in a matter of a few short minutes. While these are but a few examples of the feats these athletes are capable of performing, there really are no limits to the subject materials they are capable of memorizing. And, as in the case of other forms of athletics, these require a similar kind and degree of training and conditioning. In my studies as an educator, we learned theories about the kinds of student learning that takes place within us and particularly two and the one of which most of us have a particular proclivity for. We, for example, were taught that there are visual- and there are auditory-learners. I did not totally buy into that division and later on came to believe that even auditory learners, upon ‘hearing” the words, translate them into pictures, “seeing” them within their brains and therefore making us all pretty much visual. This is the premise upon which the techniques employed by MAs such as The Memory Palace derive their inspiration. Much to its credit, this is not only a book about the personal stories of some of the most important contemporary memory champs alive today, it is also about how they accomplish their stunning and almost magical feats of mental acumen. One of the most fascinating aspects of the book is that its author. 20-something and fledgling author, Joshua Foer, in the process of writing a piece for Discovery Magazine on the U.S. Memory Championships, is convinced to train himself for the competition. He, with no particularly high IQ or Savantist syndrome whatever, does just that and goes on to win. While it gives hope for us mortals on the one hand, the book goes on to describe the incredibly intense training that goes into accomplishing such a feat.Writing for Discovery, this is not a schlock, tabloid-like look at the subject of memory. Much of what is outlined is taken from cutting-edge research in the fields of psychology and neuroscience. I felt that the book was very well written, easy to understand, edifying and enjoyable. I think that I came to better understand and appreciate how much memory actually defines just who we are... and not necessarily who we are to others, but who we are to ourselves. The book was very well narrated and was everything a book should be and I give it five stars all the way around."

Alas, it was not worth the wait. There are tiny moments of interesting information regarding how the human memory works, but for the most part, the author drones on about mundane details regarding his tedious preparation for a memory contest. It was a repetitive read, and very difficult to maintain focus and interest in the book. Sadly, I do not feel it will be very memorable, though I did award an extra 0.5 star rating for that glorious little bit of irony.-------------------------------------------Favorite Quote: In a sense, the elaborate system of externalized memory we’ve created is a way of fending off mortality.First Sentences (which were my unheeded warning): Dom DeLuise, celebrity fat man (and five of clubs), has been implicated in the following unseemly acts in my mind’s eye: He has hocked a fat globule of spittle (nine of clubs) on Albert Einstein’s thick white mane (three of diamonds) and delivered a devastating karate kick (five of spades) to the groin of Pope Benedict XVI (six of diamonds). Michael Jackson (king of hearts) has engaged in behavior bizarre even for him. He has defecated (two of clubs) on a salmon burger (king of clubs) and captured his flatulence (queen of clubs) in a balloon (six of spades)."

I honestly can't believe the information in this book isn't being taught in school. I learned HOW to remember, and it was fascinating to see Joshua's progress as he made it to the memory championships. Would highly recommend it! :) "
28,159420229X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3301814-james,4,"A deeply interesting book. Joshua Foer covered a US Memory Championship and was inspired or stumbled into the world of memorization to the extent that a year later he competed and won the US memory championship. Now accounts of journalist undertaking some droll activity, with some appealingly oddball characters, are pretty common place and usually feel like a great magazine article was stretched out to painful lengths. What made Moonwalking with Einstein so enjoyable was the mixture between learning about things you never knew you would find interesting, having answers to questions you always wanted to know, a practical application that is surprisingly effective, and finally putting it all in a rich context.In terms of the practical application I could do no better than steer you to this review my link text with the warning that you will now have lodged in your mind the particular set of chores Steve was grappling with on that day for much longer than you would ever want. As some of the other reviewers point out there are probably better texts out there to help you learn the art or science of memorization many of them written over a thousand years ago.I doubt though you would get the same richness of nuggets. Two of my favourites: Chess Grandmasters and Chicken Sexers have the same IQ and the same highly evolved use of certain parts of the brain; and that the earliest texts had no punctuation or indeed spaces between words, a form of writing that would suit me to a tee. I have always wondered about the claims that ones brain is akin to a muscle that can be further developed by extensive training. A claim that is thoroughly debunked and will save us all a fortune in late night advetorials but rather different parts of the brain can be enlisted in solving memory questions. So essentially while we struggle to remember more than seven numbers or seven words we are absolutely wonderful at remembering a whole host of images.Finally the whole book is put in the context of what the learning of memory has meant and what it means in todays environment where on has so very many tools that replace the need to rely one oneself. A grand read and if you will excuse me I will be constructing an array of memory palaces."

The only problem - hard to remember all details about this beautiful book, so need to re-read it. :-)"
30,159420229X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2188450-andrea,4,"I started this one with somewhat lowered expectations, feeling like I was revisiting too-familiar territory. Being the clever woman I am, I had diagnosed a trend of immersive journalism about ""brain sports"" (I just made that term up), profiling the odd sort of people that tend to become obsessive about such things, and learning how to become obsessive oneself. And having spotted this trend, I was (of course) subsequently dismissive, skeptical that this book about memory competition would entertain me any more than similarly themed books like ""Word Freak"" by Stefan Fatsis (about Scrabble) and ""The Kings of New York"" by Michael Weinreb (Chess) already had. (I can't help but assume that, as a journalist, immersing oneself in competitive memory competition would be much more attractive than say, covering Afghanistan or playing for the Detroit Tigers, due to the substantially decreased risk of bodily harm). However, even though the premise was nothing new, I was very entertained by this book. Foer manages to find many fascinating things to say about something that is, at heart, just an extreme version of an everyday human activity - remembering shit. I found myself eager to come back to this book when I had to put it down, and excited to learn more about the subject."
31,159420229X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/26560507-heather,4,"I thoroughly enjoyed this book and couldn't wait to get back into it every time I had to step away. I don't know that it taught me very much (& I have no intention whatsoever to improve my memory using the tactics loosely outlined in this book - not because I don't believe they are effective, but because I don't want to), but it was extremely interesting and kept me engaged the entire time. I also REALLY enjoyed the writing style and hope Joshua Foer plans to write more in the future, because I am eager to read whatever it may be."

It's mostly about the author's quest towards US memory championship. An interesting read, but if you're seeking a manual for memory techniques, it wouldn't suit you. "
33,159420229X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2922699-genia-lukin,3,"Joshua Foer tackles in his book the issues of memory - how it is formed, how it has been lost, and how to improve it. Aside from the anecdotal - the rather interesting glimpse into the world of the mental athletes, amusing to me personally because of my familiarity with (and let's be frank here, membership in) the geeky society at large, Foer also presents the more general - research into memory and amnesia, as well as a historical perspective on the memorisation techniques and learning of the past.In my world, the world of religious Judaism, Torah readings, and extensive familiarity with texts, we still memorize a great deal. So I approached this book with a level of interest especially to the educational and historical aspects of the subject which Foer presents. I also enjoyed the cognitive, but the research he presents is one I am generally familiar with, and thus less interested in, when reading a presentation for the layman. Foer's research is generally good, though oftentimes insufficient. We get a slew of cognitive limitations and some exploration into amnesia - a very interesting chapter in and of itself - but not much about memory research beyond the very generic. We do not see some of the abnormal research into memory done on various sub-populations, except a tiny glimpse into savants, which are a somewhat different phenomenon, and even then the glimpse is mostly one of disillusionment.However, I can't help but agree with Foer intellectually when he makes his educational claims concerning the point that, for any person to think creatively and analytically, he first has to supply himself with basic facts which can be retrieved and analysed. If you do not know the basic material, the ground rules, or the structure of a subject, you then have nothing to analyse, nothing to expand upon, nothing to create with. If you can't remember the shape of an object you can't draw it, and if you can't remember the points of disagreement between two ideologies you cannot judge them.The parts pertaining to the memory sport itself, somehow, interested me less. It is still in the realm of the esoteric - as Foer himself claims - and card memorisation and the ability to recite long poems after fifteen minutes still would not help us - or him - find his car keys, Still, this is an interesting and important book, especially for people without the academic background, because it provides yet another glimpse into how our minds work, or don't work, and what we do, or don't do, with them."
34,159420229X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/80375046-shnila-parveen,2," In Plato’s Phaedrus, Socrates describes how the Egyptian god Theuth, inventor of writing, came to Thamus, the king of Egypt, and offered to bestow his wonderful invention upon the Egyptian people. “Here is a branch of learning that will ... improve their memories,” Theuth said to the Egyptian king. “My discovery provides a recipe for both memory and wisdom.” But Thamus was reluctant to accept the gift. “If men learn this, it will implant forgetfulness in their souls,” he told the god. “They will cease to exercise their memory and become forgetful; they will rely on that which is written, calling things to remembrance no longer from within themselves, but by means of external marks. What you have discovered is a recipe not for memory, but for reminding. And it is no true wisdom that you offer your disciples, but only its semblance, for by telling them of many things without teaching them anything, you will make them seem to know much, while for the most part they will know nothing. And as men filled not with wisdom but with the conceit of wisdom, they will be a burden to their fellow-men. What is the importance of memory in present times of technology making information available on our fingertips? Is it crucial for our cognitive capabilities or just futile endeavor? These are difficult questions that are not answered in this book. The author has however admitted that the memory hacks he learnt for the memory championships do not really improve the memory in general. After securing a good ranking in the European Memory Championship, Author forgot that he drove his car to the party celebrating his victory and took the Subway instead. There is no refuting the fact that the importance of human memory has marginalized in last couple of decades. One of the important reasons why I started writing reviews, first in private notes and then in Goodread is because I started to realize that I do not retain much from the books that I was reading. It seemed like an act of idle indulgence of absorbing someone else’s work without adding anything of my own. My views were there for a moment but would disappear as if I had none. By writing a review, I am not just an idle reader anymore but I am adding something of my own to the reading. Since I usually write my reviews after finishing the book, it also becomes an act of active recall, one of the memory techniques I believe works for me. For how long though, cannot be sure. Few year ago, I used to watch BBC’s Sherlock Holmes TV series where the lead character had mind palaces helping him recall the most miniscule things in excruciating detail. I presumed it as one of the quirks of the eccentric character. It was while reading this book that I got to know that memory palace is a legitimate and widely used memory hack, used by the participants of the memory championships. Although I don’t find a practical use of it in my day to day life. An interesting piece is on the analysis of Odyssey and Illiad. There are theories that claim that these famous poems were not written by one person but rather passed on years after years by way as loose collection of songs. The structure of poems is such that it seems to have been evolved for being memorized and later with the invention of writing, compiled together in its current form. The brain best remembers things that are repeated, rhythmic, rhyming, structured, and above all easily visualized. The only thing I did not like about this book is its deceptive title which would pass it of as a self-help book. This book is not a self-help book. Joshua Foer participated in US and European Memory Championship as part of his article in something called as participatory journalism. He met some unique set of people, discovered unusual things about memory and went on to win the memory championship. There are a lot of negative reviews about this book, which are accurate but are not substantial when you read this book with an open mind to learn something about an unusual subject. Memorizing has earned a bad reputation as an absence of real intellect and just a way to hold on to information for clearing the next exam. Its cause it not helped by the fact that the people with amazing memories have not made much in life and have resorted to self-help guru bluff. Memory does not help you become good at something. Instead mastering something breeds a better memory."

It never occurred to me that there was this kind of mental superpower that we could all have.Told by a journalist intrigued by memory competitions, Moonwalking with Einstein was simple and light to read. This was a story of his own journey into the world of mental athletes, and him taking a go at it himself.We are brought with him in his journey to find out what this is. Before the creation of the printing press, our world did not have the means we have today, to store our information. It was up to us to memorize what we learned especially if we wanted to pass it down onto the next generation. Tales and stories were made to keep these memories alive. Little did I know, that the small memory competitions today are so minuscule compared to the world before where memory palaces and techniques were as common as writing today.What is so empowering about this book is that he shows us, we can all create our own memory palaces if we would just put the time at it. We could know by heart the stories, the quotes, the places we would want to keep in our minds forever. I learned that memory is not a test of intellect but of creativity. We don’t have to be mental athletes who can memorize thousands of numbers or random words in minutes. But we can use these techniques for remembering the things we actually want to remember.Towards the end of the book, we are called on to remember because “how we perceive the world and act In it are products of how and what we remember”And if you feel daunted by the task to establish more memories, remember memory is not as much due to intellect as it is due to creativity. 4.5 Stars"
36,159420229X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5072847-will-ansbacher,2,"No, it isn’t astronauts and relativity; it's an example of a memory technique where you associate information with mnemonics in the form of images that are sufficiently bizarre to be intrinsically memorable; so it could just as well have been called Sexting with Michael Jackson, which was another image I don’t really care to remember. Moonwalking is really not that bad once you get past some utterly boring reportage about a group of obsessives who go in for memory competitions around the world. Foer initially covered one of these competitions as a reporter, became involved himself and determined to win the next year’s US competition. In the process, he delves into sometimes-amusing, but more often tedious, investigations into the place of memory in our society. There are some nice observations - on the difference between knowledge and memory, or about memory once being fundamental to the preservation of knowledge, but no longer being much needed in a literate society with an abundance of stored information (first on scrolls, then books, and now the Internet). But the book suffers from an overly-journalistic style and it reads like an extended magazine article. First-person investigational stuff with some random historical/scientific filler: easy to browse, easy to skip over; but don't look for anything about the art of how to put the memory techniques into practice (it’s apparently a well-known system called “Memory Palace”), this is just Foer’s experience of doing it. So, is it any use? Well Foer himself finds that memory-improving techniques are not much good for anything more than lists and succeeding at memory competitions.I certainly would not find memorizing “memorable” images any easier than remembering the facts themselves – holy crap, how much time and effort would it take to dream up the images, associate them somehow with the thing-to-be-remembered and then recall the connection later, so that one would remember the “thing” and not just the mental image?? In short, not really worth 200 pages. Two stars may sound a little mingy, but it’s ultimately a bit boring."

They do things like memorize 20thousand digits of pi or memorize the order of a deck of cards in a very short amount of time or memorize a long sequence of numbers or letters or words or pretty much anything for almost no reason at all. There's even something called the US Memory Championship (which the author won and that's not even really a spoiler) and also the World Memory Championship (in which Americans always do poorly, to my ever-expanding shame.)Foer escorts the reader on not only a stunt journalism-type memoir of his time training for and competing in these competitions, but also on a journey through the brain, in an Oliver Sacks-esque exploration of all the weird, quirky things a memory does or can do.Did you know that the guy from Rain Man is a real guy? You probably did. He is not the same person as Dustin Hoffman, though. He is his very own person and he is named Kim Peek and despite his ability to multiple huge numbers in his head and to calculate the dates of all the Easter Sundays in the history of Easter Sundays and despite his incredible memory, he had an IQ of only 87. And only just now am I realizing that Peek is now dead, which makes me sad. The point is, Peek was a savant, sometimes even called a megasavant, which is like a savant². Did you know there is another guy named Daniel Tammet who claims to be a megasavant but is probably just a faker?And now you, yes YOU, can fake being a savant if you read this book. You can learn how to construct imaginary things called memory palaces which will give you the incredible power of nigh-perfect memory. Do you want to be able to memorize the order of decks of playing cards? I don't know why you would—but the point is you can. "

So I was pretty shocked to find that this work has almost no ""how to"" information in it. It is mostly just a memoir of getting into a memory competition and what this competitive world looks like.

39,159420229X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4162390-lee,4,"I got to use the non-fiction tag! That shelf looks pretty bare.I saw this book appear in my feeds once and the title certainly caught my attention. This is a story about a journalists journey from reporting on the US and World memory competition one year, to competing in it the following year. In his first year reporting the event, Joshua Foer began to understand that all of the participants at the event weren't savants or incredibly smart, they pretty much all had a system that made remembering pi to the 2000 digit more of a trick than an IQ measure. Armed with this info, Joshua embarks on a journey to see if he can build a memory system to allow him to remember 100 names and faces, recall a deck of cards and report back, (I can't remember how many, ironic i know) a large number chain.THIS IS NOT A SELF HELP BOOK. If you are going to read this to learn how to become better at remembering names when going into meetings (this is me) you are not going to be taught how to do it. What this book does do is give you the history of memory systems, going way way back to the ancient Greeks. He interviews people from the US and the UK with all sorts of fascinating memory disorders, he covers how Tony Buzon has made over 300 million dollars in self help books, using memory techniques that have been around for thousands of years. Joshua spends time with a couple of memory champions and the begin to help him learn his system so that he can compete in the following years memory contest. The system is very simple, what isn't simple is the practice to make it work. So thankfully Foer doesn't spend too much time talking about practice, but he does give the strong impression that he is spending at least an hour a day memorising his system. A third of the way through the book, he does give an example how anyone can learn a system quickly. I was listening to this on audio (which is very well narrated, except for the typically poor english accent that Mike Chamberlain does) whilst driving and we are told how to use the 'loqi' or 'memory palace' to remember some random items. Now this part of the book was day one of a 4 day business trip, it was 6 days ago and I can still recall all ten items mentioned with no problem at all, including 'peat smoked salmon' and 'email Sophia'. My visualization of cottage cheese on the front door step of the house i grew up in is one I enjoy re-visualizing. It involves Nicole Kidman and thats about as much as I am going to divulge here.This is not a how to help improve your memory, but it does give you a big slice of the systems used and everything you would need to help you improve can be found on the mnemonics wiki site. I wasn't sure what to expect when reading this, I was happily surprised to have really enjoyed it. A very well written docu/journalistic article on memory, paced very well with some fascinating facts and figures. This book was much more than I had hoped for and so have no qualms about giving it 4 stars. "
40,159420229X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/38618130-azaa-kh,5,"A very misleading title, but the content was not a disappointment. ""Experience is the sum of our memories and wisdom the sum of our experiences"" If we follow this logic, we gain wisdom through our memories. And yet, memorization has been largely criticized by many school officials and educators that it kills creativity and critical thinking. But what this book points out, which I completely agree, is the fact that memorization is never really taught in schools. Instead, they make students memorize a bunch of unimportant facts through rote memorization without teaching how to retain the information, and that is what is corrupting our education system but not the memorization itself. In fact, the book reasons that learning and memorization come hand-in-hand, so you cannot get one without the other. This has completely changed my perspective on memorization.Another interesting fact pointed out in this book was that we can make our lives seem longer through varying our life experiences. This may sound contradictory at first because when we have fewer things to do, time does not seem to move at all. However, the study shows that it is the contrary: In 1962, a researcher named, Michel Siffre, conducted a self-experimentation by spending two months in a cave without access to a clock, calendars, or the Sun. As time went on, his memory deteriorated and lost track of the passage of time. After two months, when he finally got out of the cave, he thought that only a month had passed. This suggested the hypothesis that the less we experience, the shorter the time seems to fly, so according to this hypothesis, to stretch our psychological time, we will need to create new memories that play as anchor points in our lives.Last but not least, the book also illustrates how we attain new skills and reach beyond our limits. I personally think this was the most important topic discussed in this book. When we learn a new skill, we progress through three stages: cognitive stage, associative stage, and autonomous stage. The cognitive stage is where all the learning occurs and the skill is developed rapidly. In this stage, a person fully focuses on the task consciously and intellectually discovers new strategies to get the task done. But once we pass this stage and become good enough, what we do becomes so autonomous or unconscious that we do not even have to use our intellects anymore. This is what the book calls the OK plateau, the period in which we see almost no growth because we are merely following our unconscious process. So to go beyond our limits, we need to stay in the cognitive stage and continuously develop our capabilities. There's a saying ""Practice makes it perfect"", but how we practice is more important than the amount we practice, and only when it is the concentrated, self-conscious, and deliberated kind of practice, we will not be restrained by our limits anymore.Overall, I'd suggest this book for anyone who wants to improve their learning process.

41,159420229X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4252261-tom-la,4,"Truly excellent work of participatory journalism. The author set out to explore the world of ""memory competitions"", and from there he made himself the subject of a study on skills-improvement, to the point that he won a national memory competition. This book paints a high-level fresco on the subject of human memory: the history of how we recall things, how massively that has changed throughout the centuries, and how some ancient memory techniques (almost forgotten today) are surprisingly efficient still today, and available to anyone, not only for people with a ""strong memory"". - the topic is fascinating and important for our understanding of ourselves;- the book is well written, although a little too MalcolmGladwellesque at points (Oxf. cit. ""to write like Malcom Gladwell"" = to make a big entertaining fuss about something without actually saying much, and make it sound much more exciting than what it actually is through the use of anecdotes, humour and trivia)- I noticed some references to the content of ""Talent is overrated"" by Geoff Colvin, especially for what concerns the topic of skills improvement- some of the techniques described, like the ""memory palace"" technique, were new to me, and... well, unforgettable. Sorry, I was hoping I would get through this review without any stupid pun.- Daniel Tammet, the alleged savant author of ""Born on a blue day"", might be a complete or partial fraud. Difficult to prove, but Foer has a good point there.Important note: if you are looking for a book to teach you some memory techniques, this is probably not the best book for you, because this one includes many general explanations on various related topics and also some personal stories from the author's life. He does quote several other books that are specifically meant to teach memory techniques."
42,159420229X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/159421-shan,4,"Interesting and fun to read, like a longer version of the long-form journalism you find in magazines like the New Yorker. That might be where I previously read a chunk of this book when it came out in 2011, illustrating one of the memory principles it explains: our memories are great at recognizing things we've seen before, even if we wouldn't have been able to recall them otherwise.The title comes from the memory technique Foer learned to compete as a ""mental athlete"" after finding out such a thing existed in the course of researching an article he was writing. The technique is the memory palace, in which you attach vivid mental pictures to specific spots in a location you know well. To memorize esoteric things like the digits of pi or the order of a deck of cards, you first learn to give each digit or card a constant image you'll always associate with it (or three, as Foer learned from European competitors, who use POA - person, object, action).Like those long magazine articles, the book has layers - the memoir of how he went from regular guy to memory champion, the history and science of memory and memorization, and some specifics on how to actually use the techniques. These things are braided together, contributing to the reading experience of being pulled along through the book, but occasionally frustrating when I wanted a deeper dive into a specific, like in the chapter about memorizing poetry that almost seemed like it was going to tell me something new but switched to another strand right before the juicy part.The great takeaway from this book is that anyone can learn to use ancient techniques and take advantage of how our brains evolved to work. The focus of these memory competitors is trivial - who cares about the order of a deck of cards? - but the ideas in the book can be applied anywhere. "
43,159420229X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1881113-andrea,5,"I picked up Joshua Foer’s intriguing study of memory and memory champions out of sheer curiosity. You see I am a big language enthusiast. At one point or another you can find me studying French, Japanese, or Swedish, and as many language students will tell you, learning that pesky grammar or vocabulary can be exhausting. You can be drilling the same set of words entire night, remember them for the next morning’s test, and then forget them completely by suppertime. To our great frustration, human brains are built to form only the fun, unique experiences into long-term memories, and to toss the mundane, boring, rarely-used stuff into the pits of obscurity.

Now the question is asked: Is memory trained or some brain disorders are responsible for ?Kim, savient with special abilities to remember dates, all history events, but IQ 87, and another example of Daniel still undiscovered type of ""savient"" or only hard memory training. I even wathed the documentary for Brainman. Neuroscience has still time to discover.At the end the most important are our memories. They make us human and define us.""Life seems to speed up as we get older because life gets less memorable as we get older. If to remember is to be human, then remembering means being more human."""

I thought Foer explained how we remember, the anomalies of savants and the history of human memory in a very readable, well documented manner. Have we come to a place of the end of memory? Americans seldom win or place in the world memory championship. We have so much information at our fingertips, that we really do not use need to use our memory much at all in today’s world and seemingly find it ‘normal’ to lose words, names and events more frequently. This book definitely got me thinking and I will be more mindful of my own memory......but I’m not likely to train to enter the Championship"

GAR!!Very insightful and useful - more useful than that dumb ""Mastermind: How to Think Like Sherlock Holmes"". I love learning more about how the mind works and even picking up on some helpful tips (though don't be confused: although it's placed in self-help, it's not strictly self-help).About the only bad is how dense it could get and how not useful memorizing random digits and cards are. I just can't help but wonder...why bother???"
48,159420229X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1289001-jen-knox,4,This book was well written and useful. All the useful tricks and background are frontloaded and the latter half is full of meanderings and perspectives on education techniques in general (which felt like a different book). The book inspired me to test my memory and exercise it more often. Now I just need help with ... recall. 
49,159420229X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/16275106-pamela,5,"Josh Foer was a 25-year-old college graduate working as a freelance journalist and living with his parents in his childhood home when he first began the research that eventually led to this book and took him on a personal odyssey on the nature of memory. It began casually with an internet search for the smartest person in the world until he found himself at the USA Memory Championship writing an article for Slate about this little known contest and the collection of memory wizards who participated in it. In the course of the next year, he was to meet a strange collection of American and European, as well as other International memory competitors and learn the secrets of their unique abilities that go all the way back to ancient Greece with only slight changes along the way to our own times. He was even to become a competitor himself but to find out how he did when he finally competed in the USA Championship you will have to read the book yourself.Moonwalking With Einstein is a fascinating look at the brain and how it stores memory. Foer touches on all known aspects of this from history and the whys and hows of oral history and the transmission of knowledge before reading and writing to the impact of Gutenberg on memory. He discusses some strange and bizarre brain problems that have unusual effects on memory and the various techniques that mnemonists use to help them make such amazing feats of memorization. Of particular interest is the memory palace. There is also an interesting discussion of the types of memory and what is known about how they work and why we can recite a complete and complicated piece of poetry but can't find our car keys or even remember where we parked the car in the first place. Or what we had for lunch yesterday or when Grandma's birthday is but can name all the Presidents in order. This was a terrific read but Einstein actually had nothing to do with it except as a memory picture. I thoroughly enjoyed it but don't ask me about it next week because I probably won't remember!"
50,159420229X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5650130-david-sheppard,5,"This is one of those rare books that is not only a joy to read, but also immensely helpful. It can help all of us with something that is at once troublesome and worrisome: our memory. It does this with ease, not teaching us some grueling rote memory technique, but one that is easy, natural and intuitive. Yet Moonwalking with Einstein turns out to not be exclusively a how-to book on memory. So what is it? Well, yes, it is about memory and how to improve it, but it is at once a history of techniques, a description of what memory is and what can go wrong with it, and also a running narrative of how the author, a journalist himself with no special memory skills, becomes one of the most proficient memory athletes in America. I'd learned a mnemonic device to aid memorization decades ago while in college, and found it to be helpful, but for some reason I'd abandoned the technique once I graduated. But Moonwalking with Einstein expands the mnemonic technique I learned back then by use of something of which I'd never heard: the ""Memory Palace."" The Memory Palace exploits our inherent skill for remembering images and spatial locations, harnesses these two abilities we all posses in abundance, and relates them to the memorization of numbers, lists and assortments of other difficult to remember items. The amazing thing is that the Memory Palace not only makes memorization easy, it also makes it fun. What makes the book so interesting is that it is narrative non-fiction and reads like a novel. The author locks his conflict with his own memory early on, gives a sense of rising tension as he accumulates the forces to overcome its limitations, and resolves this internal conflict at the end when he participates in the US Memory Championship. I didn't read it as urgently as I did today's number one bestseller, Laura Hillenbrand's Unbroken, but still, I couldn't put it down. In Chapter Five, I scanned the ""to-do"" list of fifteen items on pages 92/3 that the author had to memorize in his initial attempt, and developed the technique for myself as I read about the author memorizing it. As my Memory Palace, I used an old home of a high school friend with which I was still familiar, constructing useful details as I went. When I had finished reading about the author memorizing the list (took me about five minutes), I had memorized it myself, and I found that the items were not only immediately memorable, but that the list of items and their sequence was still with me days later, and so imbedded in my memory that I'm sure I'll ever forget it. All this, I accomplished effortlessly. This is a truly remarkable feat for me because I'm almost seventy years old and have chronic fatigue syndrome, which adversely affects all aspects of my memory. It has also given me hope that I might finally learn ancient Greek. I tried to learn it several years ago, but found building a vocabulary so difficult that I abandoned the project. Rote memory was just too much trouble. I am interested in all things Greek, and as it turns out, the Memory Palace technique was invented in the fifth century BC by Simonides following his narrow escape from the collapse of a building. This in itself is a story you'll be interested in reading about. The author says that since the time of this ancient Greek, ""the art of memory has been about creating architectural spaces in the imagination."" Having been to Greece twice and written a 480 page travel journal on the subject, (Oedipus On A Pale Horse: Greek Journey In Search Of A Personal Mythology) I have all the makings of a superb Greek Memory Palace. While traveling around Greece and the western coast of Turkey for ten weeks, I visited many cities and islands: Athens, Thebes, Delphi, Ithaca, Mykonos, Delos, Santorini, etc. I can't count all the archaeological sites I visited. What I'm creating isn't just any old Memory Palace but actually a Memory Country. Within each location, I can identify as many locations for storing words and meanings as I need. But not only that, I can also use characters from Greek mythology to create actions and images to reinforce the material, as the author suggests. All this constitutes my Greek Memory Palace: the location where I will store ancient Greek words and meanings as I learn the language, in accordance with the instructions learned in Moonwalking with Einstein. None of it was difficult. I picked it up as I read the book. The author describes how in the past people viewed their minds as something to perfect by loading it with all sorts of intellectual material. ""People used to labor to furnish their minds. They invested in the acquisition of memories the same way we invest in the acquisition of things."" [page 134] Some even believed that ""the art of memory was a secret key to unlocking the occult structure of the universe."" [page 151] This has given me an entirely new view of how to perceive my own mind and nourish it in the future. The author also discusses how we came to lose touch with our ability to remember with the invention of the printed word. The history of that estrangement and how inventions like Wikipedia and the Internet foster that estrangement is a very interesting story. The author makes the reader aware of what is happening to us and provides a way to project ourselves into the future without suffering so much of technology's debilitating effects. Perhaps the reason this book is so successful is that the reader never loses sight of the practical use of the information the author is providing because the author is discovering it himself and actively making use of it in his quest to make it into the US Memory Championship. This is an important book. Everyone can benefit from reading it. "
51,159420229X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/11652288-faye,2,"This was okay but if you know anything at all about memory techniques, you won't really find anything new here. I had hoped to get more background information on the memory techniques, how our brain works, etc. but instead it there was too much information in it that I, personally, just did not find relevant. For example, I'm just not interested in the individual memory champions (if I were, I would read their memoirs), or that he asked Daniel Tammet what the number 9,412 looked to him three times. I get that Foer, a journalist, did this with the intention of finding truth and, possibly, debunking a fraud. Still, while I have no idea whether Tammet is a fraud or not, I can say that this and other behaviours and comments made Foer seem pretty annoying.In another review, I read that this book reads like an overlong magazine article and I guess that's true: it did feel pretty drawn out and like a magazine article that was watered down and stretched out so it could become a book. Meh."
52,159420229X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/72796908-daniel-hageman,5,"Easily one of the best books I've read in a long time, dispelling the myths of 'photographic memory' and instead highlighting the very real and equally exciting truths of memory expertise, truths that Joshua Foer was certainly not alone in judging with intuitive skepticism. The author's journey over the course of one year, from 'journalist scraping by' to America's National Memory Champion, is as exciting as it is informative. Highly recommend for anyone who want to learn about how to improve their memory, understand the research behind 'memory savants', or simply enjoy the unique story of the esoteric competitions between 'mental athletes'."
53,159420229X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/63866052-noor,2,I’d rather drown in a lake than read this again. 
54,159420229X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/8187431-rade,4,"“Forgotten phone numbers and birthdays represent minor erosions of our everyday memory, but they are part of a much larger story of how we've supplanted our own natural memory with a vast superstructure of technological crutches—from the alphabet to the BlackBerry. These technologies of storing information outside our minds have helped make our modern world possible, but they've also changed how we think and how we use our brains.” I loved this book. Not because it offers insights to some unbelievable profound ideas but because it talks about our brains and how we use it to remember things. The thing about our brain is that it is a giant muscle and the more you work on it the bigger it gets. The bigger it gets, the more it remembers. The book is so much more than Foer's journey to understand what it means to be a mental athlete and eventually what it means to think in a way they do. It also goes back to a time when people like monks used various techniques to not only remember stuff short term, but to imprint it in their minds so they can recall it at any time, on any day, making writing new hymns and lectures easier. This was a time when technology was almost nonexistent. Books, while rare were also very hard to have at hand when searching religious text. When one had a copy, he would spend hours if not days going back and fourth trying to put together a sermon. This is one of the reasons people looked into ways of storing this type of information in their brain so life could be a bit easier. One of the techniques that these mental athletes use today is the whole idea of a memory palace, a way of dividing your brain into separate rooms in as many houses as possible and storing things in there so you can recall it later. The way one does it is not to say ""buy a new jacket"" as a to do item, but to make it as descriptive as possible. It is better to imagine an alligator wearing a warm jacket while fishing on a chilly winter day as that sticks better in your mind. Our minds are not bad at remembering but they are bad at recalling because remembering to buy bread and butter at a supermarket is something we did a hundred times therefore, it doesn't stick out, and it is pushed aside and eventually (in a week or even less), forgotten. Some people sometimes had to pray and beg for forgiveness when they found out that using sexual imagery helps them recall information better because it sticks faster. Now in order to remember that I have to buy yogurt, I just need to picture Megan Fox swimming in it while munching an all American burger and I am golden haha Seriously though, it takes a lot of practice and patience to do this type of thing. It is achievable but most people don't have the time or patience to do it. Foer did it but it did not come out of nowhere. He had a help of some of the people who competed in these mental athlete challenges and they pushed him and couched him on what to do and what not to do when one finds himself off track and wondering aimlessly around. SPOILER WARNING: At the end of the book Foer won this mental athlete event but he said that since we have so many ways of writing stuff down (especially phones as most people carry it on them all day long), this use of remembering stuff is not needed. It is nice but he said he does not use his mental techniques any more (at least not much) as we have other ways of keeping records and finding information that was once very hard to track down. Again, this is a great book and I really enjoyed it as the author did not just go into his life but set a bunch of chapters to discuss historical figures who used these types of techniques to make it easier to recall stuff during their every day activities. I kind of wish he went further into it but a succinct summery is better than no summary at all. "
55,159420229X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1231090-jud-barry,4,"You have to love a book written by someone who, fresh from winning the U.S. Memory Championship, takes mass transit home because he’s forgotten that he drove. He didn’t just forget where he parked—he forgot that he drove.In this inspiriting book, Joshua Foer shows how he — a person of decidedly unprodigious memory — learns some well-established mnemonic techniques, practices them for a half hour a day over the course of a year, and winds up winning the national memory contest (by, among other things, memorizing a deck of cards in record time).Along the way to the championship, Foer provides his own color commentary by discussing the phenomenon of memory — and by describing the lives of people who are real memory phenomena, like Kim “Rain Man” Peek, the savant who, despite having an I.Q. of just 87, absorbed information, retained it, and recalled it without effort; or the unnamed individual EP, afflicted with complete amnesia as a result of brain damage caused by herpes simplex.Even more colorful are the idiosyncratic “mental athletes” who steer Foer in the direction of the championship. Among them is Tony Buzan, the flamboyant minter of a “mind mapping” technique that, well, made him a mint and gave him grandiose ideas of reforming education.The techniques, it turns out, have been in use since antiquity. Before the ready availability of and access to books, learning involved training the memory to retrieve information. The ancient Greeks began to explore ways of using the capabilities of the brain to recall “architectural” memories as a means of building virtual “memory palaces” in the mind. These virtual buildings are where memories —often given arbitrary but colorful personalities and attributes — are stored for later retrieval.(One of the most fun aspects of the book is how Foer enlists the reader to use this technique to memorize a shopping list. Read this book and you will effortlessly—and probably forever—recall his list: pickled garlic, cottage cheese, peat-smoked salmon, 6 bottles of white wine, 3 pairs of socks, and email for Sophia.)The process requires focused effort and some creativity, and, when you think that what’s stored isn’t the raw memory itself but a tarted-up decoy that lures you to the place where the memory resides, not everyone has felt the extra baggage to be worth the effort. The Chinese, for example, were exposed to these techniques by Jesuit missionaries in the 16th century but decided that rote learning was “simpler and faster.”In ""Moonwalking with Einstein,"" Foer does a masterful job of using memory (or the lack of it) as the foil for an exploration not only the human brain but the human condition as well. What is consciousness? What is learning? What is creativity? How do we best educate ourselves? How does technology influence the ways in which we think about things, and how do the ways in which we think about things define us?And fortunately, if you don’t have the memory of a London cabdriver but need to navigate your way back to Giordano Bruno’s memory wheel, there is an index."
56,159420229X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/8606081-shanghao,3,"A light, fun read, albeit a little too 'normal' to be memorable.Tells the experiences of a journalist who, in the process of researching on a memory championship event, delved head-first into the world of mnemonics.Several simple techniques were introduced, and it does seem as if anyone is capable of becoming mnemonic experts with enough sustained practice. The case of someone who kept forgetting things the moment they happened (like in the movie Memento), along with the recent reports of Gabriel Garcia Marquez' dementia, also made me concerned about memory's place and role in our lives. The most interesting part for me was about the author voicing his doubts and laying his case over 'savant' Daniel Tammet, of Born on a Blue Day: Inside the Extraordinary Mind of an Autistic Savant. Then again, not that I really care enough about who's right and wrong in this case, since to me, the training required to develop the ability to remember like trained memory experts take out the joy in experiencing natural flow in life. Even as I frustrate over forgetting the most mundane stuff, it reminds me of my faults and to appreciate memories that stick naturally because I know they must've mattered to me, not because they're the after-effects of conscious stamping in my brain. Don't they have a saying, you live for the moments that take your breath away - it wouldn't be the same if those moments were due to you holding your breath would it? Remembering things because they're memorable as opposed to remembering by technique are sort of like that I think.I know I'm saying this because I still have a working and relatively healthy memory. It must be agonizing indeed to have memories slip out of you or your loved ones, but for such cases, I doubt if the techniques mentioned here apply.Definitely overhyped, but I don't feel it's an altogether wasted read either. Feels like a whitewashed Malcolm Gladwell, if you'd asked me. Maybe all journalists write in pretty similar styles?"
57,159420229X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3843117-ensiform,4,"In an instance of participatory journalism (don’t those always seem to lead to much-discussed books?), freelance writer Foer decides to enter the U.S. Memory Championships after covering the event. Under the tutelage of a British memory champ Ed Cook, Foer learns the tricks and techniques that most of the mental athletes use, such as the Major system of pegging letters to numbers, or the PAO system, in which the user associates two-digit numbers with memorable people and actions. Foer does more than just look behind the curtain at the Championships, though; he meets with Anders Ericsson of Florida State, who studies the development of expertise; he meets with Kim Peek, the inspiration for ‘Rain Man;’ he reads the ancients on memory, such as Simonides and his memory palace, or the Rhetorica ad Herennium, which gives tips on memorizing speeches using loci; he meets with guru/PR man Tony Buzan, who claims to help thousands with his Mind Mapping techniques; he reads old case studies, such as that of Russian journalist S who forgot almost nothing; he meets living case studies, such as E.P., who has no working memory.The book is a skilled synthesis of all things related to mnemonics and brain studies, a very readable introduction to the history of memory. Foer tells his story honestly – not always making himself look like the coolest guy in the room in the process – and with an engaging, comfortable prose style. He paces the story well, capping it with his unremarkable showing at the World Championships, but along the way tackles some subjects like a veteran journalist out to break a story: he’s not afraid to show the questionable side of Tony Buzan or supposed Asperger’s savant Daniel Tammet. It’s a compelling narrative as well as a fascinating overview of what we know about memory – and it offers several practical tips to improve the reader’s own memory. It’s well executed and, yes, memorable. "

59,159420229X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/28482493-angus-mckeogh,3,Extremely interesting. The memory is a fickle beast. And this memoir definitely revealed much more of the tricks and techniques that are used to memorize things. Possibly the most fascinating aspect of the book was when he discussed Daniel Tammet. Having already read the latter’s book about his “savant memory” it was incredible to learn Tammet was simply using the same techniques as these other memory performers. Sure wish I wouldn’t have used any space in my brain while reading Tammet’s book. Reminds me a bit of the James Frey debacle with A Million Little Pieces.
60,159420229X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2188450-andrea,4,"I started this one with somewhat lowered expectations, feeling like I was revisiting too-familiar territory. Being the clever woman I am, I had diagnosed a trend of immersive journalism about ""brain sports"" (I just made that term up), profiling the odd sort of people that tend to become obsessive about such things, and learning how to become obsessive oneself. And having spotted this trend, I was (of course) subsequently dismissive, skeptical that this book about memory competition would entertain me any more than similarly themed books like ""Word Freak"" by Stefan Fatsis (about Scrabble) and ""The Kings of New York"" by Michael Weinreb (Chess) already had. (I can't help but assume that, as a journalist, immersing oneself in competitive memory competition would be much more attractive than say, covering Afghanistan or playing for the Detroit Tigers, due to the substantially decreased risk of bodily harm). However, even though the premise was nothing new, I was very entertained by this book. Foer manages to find many fascinating things to say about something that is, at heart, just an extreme version of an everyday human activity - remembering shit. I found myself eager to come back to this book when I had to put it down, and excited to learn more about the subject."
61,159420229X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/26560507-heather,4,"I thoroughly enjoyed this book and couldn't wait to get back into it every time I had to step away. I don't know that it taught me very much (& I have no intention whatsoever to improve my memory using the tactics loosely outlined in this book - not because I don't believe they are effective, but because I don't want to), but it was extremely interesting and kept me engaged the entire time. I also REALLY enjoyed the writing style and hope Joshua Foer plans to write more in the future, because I am eager to read whatever it may be."
62,159420229X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/49415231-amir-tesla,3,"This is not a how-to book as I initially expected but teaches few techniques along the way. It's mostly about the author's quest towards US memory championship. An interesting read, but if you're seeking a manual for memory techniques, it wouldn't suit you. "
63,159420229X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2922699-genia-lukin,3,"Joshua Foer tackles in his book the issues of memory - how it is formed, how it has been lost, and how to improve it. Aside from the anecdotal - the rather interesting glimpse into the world of the mental athletes, amusing to me personally because of my familiarity with (and let's be frank here, membership in) the geeky society at large, Foer also presents the more general - research into memory and amnesia, as well as a historical perspective on the memorisation techniques and learning of the past.In my world, the world of religious Judaism, Torah readings, and extensive familiarity with texts, we still memorize a great deal. So I approached this book with a level of interest especially to the educational and historical aspects of the subject which Foer presents. I also enjoyed the cognitive, but the research he presents is one I am generally familiar with, and thus less interested in, when reading a presentation for the layman. Foer's research is generally good, though oftentimes insufficient. We get a slew of cognitive limitations and some exploration into amnesia - a very interesting chapter in and of itself - but not much about memory research beyond the very generic. We do not see some of the abnormal research into memory done on various sub-populations, except a tiny glimpse into savants, which are a somewhat different phenomenon, and even then the glimpse is mostly one of disillusionment.However, I can't help but agree with Foer intellectually when he makes his educational claims concerning the point that, for any person to think creatively and analytically, he first has to supply himself with basic facts which can be retrieved and analysed. If you do not know the basic material, the ground rules, or the structure of a subject, you then have nothing to analyse, nothing to expand upon, nothing to create with. If you can't remember the shape of an object you can't draw it, and if you can't remember the points of disagreement between two ideologies you cannot judge them.The parts pertaining to the memory sport itself, somehow, interested me less. It is still in the realm of the esoteric - as Foer himself claims - and card memorisation and the ability to recite long poems after fifteen minutes still would not help us - or him - find his car keys, Still, this is an interesting and important book, especially for people without the academic background, because it provides yet another glimpse into how our minds work, or don't work, and what we do, or don't do, with them."
64,159420229X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/80375046-shnila-parveen,2," In Plato’s Phaedrus, Socrates describes how the Egyptian god Theuth, inventor of writing, came to Thamus, the king of Egypt, and offered to bestow his wonderful invention upon the Egyptian people. “Here is a branch of learning that will ... improve their memories,” Theuth said to the Egyptian king. “My discovery provides a recipe for both memory and wisdom.” But Thamus was reluctant to accept the gift. “If men learn this, it will implant forgetfulness in their souls,” he told the god. “They will cease to exercise their memory and become forgetful; they will rely on that which is written, calling things to remembrance no longer from within themselves, but by means of external marks. What you have discovered is a recipe not for memory, but for reminding. And it is no true wisdom that you offer your disciples, but only its semblance, for by telling them of many things without teaching them anything, you will make them seem to know much, while for the most part they will know nothing. And as men filled not with wisdom but with the conceit of wisdom, they will be a burden to their fellow-men. What is the importance of memory in present times of technology making information available on our fingertips? Is it crucial for our cognitive capabilities or just futile endeavor? These are difficult questions that are not answered in this book. The author has however admitted that the memory hacks he learnt for the memory championships do not really improve the memory in general. After securing a good ranking in the European Memory Championship, Author forgot that he drove his car to the party celebrating his victory and took the Subway instead. There is no refuting the fact that the importance of human memory has marginalized in last couple of decades. One of the important reasons why I started writing reviews, first in private notes and then in Goodread is because I started to realize that I do not retain much from the books that I was reading. It seemed like an act of idle indulgence of absorbing someone else’s work without adding anything of my own. My views were there for a moment but would disappear as if I had none. By writing a review, I am not just an idle reader anymore but I am adding something of my own to the reading. Since I usually write my reviews after finishing the book, it also becomes an act of active recall, one of the memory techniques I believe works for me. For how long though, cannot be sure. Few year ago, I used to watch BBC’s Sherlock Holmes TV series where the lead character had mind palaces helping him recall the most miniscule things in excruciating detail. I presumed it as one of the quirks of the eccentric character. It was while reading this book that I got to know that memory palace is a legitimate and widely used memory hack, used by the participants of the memory championships. Although I don’t find a practical use of it in my day to day life. An interesting piece is on the analysis of Odyssey and Illiad. There are theories that claim that these famous poems were not written by one person but rather passed on years after years by way as loose collection of songs. The structure of poems is such that it seems to have been evolved for being memorized and later with the invention of writing, compiled together in its current form. The brain best remembers things that are repeated, rhythmic, rhyming, structured, and above all easily visualized. The only thing I did not like about this book is its deceptive title which would pass it of as a self-help book. This book is not a self-help book. Joshua Foer participated in US and European Memory Championship as part of his article in something called as participatory journalism. He met some unique set of people, discovered unusual things about memory and went on to win the memory championship. There are a lot of negative reviews about this book, which are accurate but are not substantial when you read this book with an open mind to learn something about an unusual subject. Memorizing has earned a bad reputation as an absence of real intellect and just a way to hold on to information for clearing the next exam. Its cause it not helped by the fact that the people with amazing memories have not made much in life and have resorted to self-help guru bluff. Memory does not help you become good at something. Instead mastering something breeds a better memory."

It never occurred to me that there was this kind of mental superpower that we could all have.Told by a journalist intrigued by memory competitions, Moonwalking with Einstein was simple and light to read. This was a story of his own journey into the world of mental athletes, and him taking a go at it himself.We are brought with him in his journey to find out what this is. Before the creation of the printing press, our world did not have the means we have today, to store our information. It was up to us to memorize what we learned especially if we wanted to pass it down onto the next generation. Tales and stories were made to keep these memories alive. Little did I know, that the small memory competitions today are so minuscule compared to the world before where memory palaces and techniques were as common as writing today.What is so empowering about this book is that he shows us, we can all create our own memory palaces if we would just put the time at it. We could know by heart the stories, the quotes, the places we would want to keep in our minds forever. I learned that memory is not a test of intellect but of creativity. We don’t have to be mental athletes who can memorize thousands of numbers or random words in minutes. But we can use these techniques for remembering the things we actually want to remember.Towards the end of the book, we are called on to remember because “how we perceive the world and act In it are products of how and what we remember”And if you feel daunted by the task to establish more memories, remember memory is not as much due to intellect as it is due to creativity. 4.5 Stars"
66,159420229X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5072847-will-ansbacher,2,"No, it isn’t astronauts and relativity; it's an example of a memory technique where you associate information with mnemonics in the form of images that are sufficiently bizarre to be intrinsically memorable; so it could just as well have been called Sexting with Michael Jackson, which was another image I don’t really care to remember. Moonwalking is really not that bad once you get past some utterly boring reportage about a group of obsessives who go in for memory competitions around the world. Foer initially covered one of these competitions as a reporter, became involved himself and determined to win the next year’s US competition. In the process, he delves into sometimes-amusing, but more often tedious, investigations into the place of memory in our society. There are some nice observations - on the difference between knowledge and memory, or about memory once being fundamental to the preservation of knowledge, but no longer being much needed in a literate society with an abundance of stored information (first on scrolls, then books, and now the Internet). But the book suffers from an overly-journalistic style and it reads like an extended magazine article. First-person investigational stuff with some random historical/scientific filler: easy to browse, easy to skip over; but don't look for anything about the art of how to put the memory techniques into practice (it’s apparently a well-known system called “Memory Palace”), this is just Foer’s experience of doing it. So, is it any use? Well Foer himself finds that memory-improving techniques are not much good for anything more than lists and succeeding at memory competitions.I certainly would not find memorizing “memorable” images any easier than remembering the facts themselves – holy crap, how much time and effort would it take to dream up the images, associate them somehow with the thing-to-be-remembered and then recall the connection later, so that one would remember the “thing” and not just the mental image?? In short, not really worth 200 pages. Two stars may sound a little mingy, but it’s ultimately a bit boring."
67,159420229X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5745485-christopher,4,"So this was a lotta fun, a lotta more fun than I 'spected.Joshua Foer (of the illustrious Foer family, of whom I am envious) ran into some weird people who call themselves ""memory athletes"". They do things like memorize 20thousand digits of pi or memorize the order of a deck of cards in a very short amount of time or memorize a long sequence of numbers or letters or words or pretty much anything for almost no reason at all. There's even something called the US Memory Championship (which the author won and that's not even really a spoiler) and also the World Memory Championship (in which Americans always do poorly, to my ever-expanding shame.)Foer escorts the reader on not only a stunt journalism-type memoir of his time training for and competing in these competitions, but also on a journey through the brain, in an Oliver Sacks-esque exploration of all the weird, quirky things a memory does or can do.Did you know that the guy from Rain Man is a real guy? You probably did. He is not the same person as Dustin Hoffman, though. He is his very own person and he is named Kim Peek and despite his ability to multiple huge numbers in his head and to calculate the dates of all the Easter Sundays in the history of Easter Sundays and despite his incredible memory, he had an IQ of only 87. And only just now am I realizing that Peek is now dead, which makes me sad. The point is, Peek was a savant, sometimes even called a megasavant, which is like a savant². Did you know there is another guy named Daniel Tammet who claims to be a megasavant but is probably just a faker?And now you, yes YOU, can fake being a savant if you read this book. You can learn how to construct imaginary things called memory palaces which will give you the incredible power of nigh-perfect memory. Do you want to be able to memorize the order of decks of playing cards? I don't know why you would—but the point is you can. "

So I was pretty shocked to find that this work has almost no ""how to"" information in it. It is mostly just a memoir of getting into a memory competition and what this competitive world looks like. It does convey a fascination with memory and was fairly fun to read anyway. It gets an extra star for what it helped motivate my father to accomplish. "
69,159420229X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4162390-lee,4,"I got to use the non-fiction tag! That shelf looks pretty bare.I saw this book appear in my feeds once and the title certainly caught my attention. This is a story about a journalists journey from reporting on the US and World memory competition one year, to competing in it the following year. In his first year reporting the event, Joshua Foer began to understand that all of the participants at the event weren't savants or incredibly smart, they pretty much all had a system that made remembering pi to the 2000 digit more of a trick than an IQ measure. Armed with this info, Joshua embarks on a journey to see if he can build a memory system to allow him to remember 100 names and faces, recall a deck of cards and report back, (I can't remember how many, ironic i know) a large number chain.THIS IS NOT A SELF HELP BOOK. If you are going to read this to learn how to become better at remembering names when going into meetings (this is me) you are not going to be taught how to do it. What this book does do is give you the history of memory systems, going way way back to the ancient Greeks. He interviews people from the US and the UK with all sorts of fascinating memory disorders, he covers how Tony Buzon has made over 300 million dollars in self help books, using memory techniques that have been around for thousands of years. Joshua spends time with a couple of memory champions and the begin to help him learn his system so that he can compete in the following years memory contest. The system is very simple, what isn't simple is the practice to make it work. So thankfully Foer doesn't spend too much time talking about practice, but he does give the strong impression that he is spending at least an hour a day memorising his system. A third of the way through the book, he does give an example how anyone can learn a system quickly. I was listening to this on audio (which is very well narrated, except for the typically poor english accent that Mike Chamberlain does) whilst driving and we are told how to use the 'loqi' or 'memory palace' to remember some random items. Now this part of the book was day one of a 4 day business trip, it was 6 days ago and I can still recall all ten items mentioned with no problem at all, including 'peat smoked salmon' and 'email Sophia'. My visualization of cottage cheese on the front door step of the house i grew up in is one I enjoy re-visualizing. It involves Nicole Kidman and thats about as much as I am going to divulge here.This is not a how to help improve your memory, but it does give you a big slice of the systems used and everything you would need to help you improve can be found on the mnemonics wiki site. I wasn't sure what to expect when reading this, I was happily surprised to have really enjoyed it. A very well written docu/journalistic article on memory, paced very well with some fascinating facts and figures. This book was much more than I had hoped for and so have no qualms about giving it 4 stars. "
70,159420229X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/38618130-azaa-kh,5,"A very misleading title, but the content was not a disappointment. ""Experience is the sum of our memories and wisdom the sum of our experiences"" If we follow this logic, we gain wisdom through our memories. And yet, memorization has been largely criticized by many school officials and educators that it kills creativity and critical thinking. But what this book points out, which I completely agree, is the fact that memorization is never really taught in schools. Instead, they make students memorize a bunch of unimportant facts through rote memorization without teaching how to retain the information, and that is what is corrupting our education system but not the memorization itself. In fact, the book reasons that learning and memorization come hand-in-hand, so you cannot get one without the other. This has completely changed my perspective on memorization.Another interesting fact pointed out in this book was that we can make our lives seem longer through varying our life experiences. This may sound contradictory at first because when we have fewer things to do, time does not seem to move at all. However, the study shows that it is the contrary: In 1962, a researcher named, Michel Siffre, conducted a self-experimentation by spending two months in a cave without access to a clock, calendars, or the Sun. As time went on, his memory deteriorated and lost track of the passage of time. After two months, when he finally got out of the cave, he thought that only a month had passed. This suggested the hypothesis that the less we experience, the shorter the time seems to fly, so according to this hypothesis, to stretch our psychological time, we will need to create new memories that play as anchor points in our lives.Last but not least, the book also illustrates how we attain new skills and reach beyond our limits. I personally think this was the most important topic discussed in this book. When we learn a new skill, we progress through three stages: cognitive stage, associative stage, and autonomous stage. The cognitive stage is where all the learning occurs and the skill is developed rapidly. In this stage, a person fully focuses on the task consciously and intellectually discovers new strategies to get the task done. But once we pass this stage and become good enough, what we do becomes so autonomous or unconscious that we do not even have to use our intellects anymore. This is what the book calls the OK plateau, the period in which we see almost no growth because we are merely following our unconscious process. So to go beyond our limits, we need to stay in the cognitive stage and continuously develop our capabilities. There's a saying ""Practice makes it perfect"", but how we practice is more important than the amount we practice, and only when it is the concentrated, self-conscious, and deliberated kind of practice, we will not be restrained by our limits anymore.Overall, I'd suggest this book for anyone who wants to improve their learning process.

71,159420229X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4252261-tom-la,4,"Truly excellent work of participatory journalism. The author set out to explore the world of ""memory competitions"", and from there he made himself the subject of a study on skills-improvement, to the point that he won a national memory competition. This book paints a high-level fresco on the subject of human memory: the history of how we recall things, how massively that has changed throughout the centuries, and how some ancient memory techniques (almost forgotten today) are surprisingly efficient still today, and available to anyone, not only for people with a ""strong memory"". - the topic is fascinating and important for our understanding of ourselves;- the book is well written, although a little too MalcolmGladwellesque at points (Oxf. cit. ""to write like Malcom Gladwell"" = to make a big entertaining fuss about something without actually saying much, and make it sound much more exciting than what it actually is through the use of anecdotes, humour and trivia)- I noticed some references to the content of ""Talent is overrated"" by Geoff Colvin, especially for what concerns the topic of skills improvement- some of the techniques described, like the ""memory palace"" technique, were new to me, and... well, unforgettable. Sorry, I was hoping I would get through this review without any stupid pun.- Daniel Tammet, the alleged savant author of ""Born on a blue day"", might be a complete or partial fraud. Difficult to prove, but Foer has a good point there.Important note: if you are looking for a book to teach you some memory techniques, this is probably not the best book for you, because this one includes many general explanations on various related topics and also some personal stories from the author's life. He does quote several other books that are specifically meant to teach memory techniques."
72,159420229X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/159421-shan,4,"Interesting and fun to read, like a longer version of the long-form journalism you find in magazines like the New Yorker. That might be where I previously read a chunk of this book when it came out in 2011, illustrating one of the memory principles it explains: our memories are great at recognizing things we've seen before, even if we wouldn't have been able to recall them otherwise.The title comes from the memory technique Foer learned to compete as a ""mental athlete"" after finding out such a thing existed in the course of researching an article he was writing. The technique is the memory palace, in which you attach vivid mental pictures to specific spots in a location you know well. To memorize esoteric things like the digits of pi or the order of a deck of cards, you first learn to give each digit or card a constant image you'll always associate with it (or three, as Foer learned from European competitors, who use POA - person, object, action).Like those long magazine articles, the book has layers - the memoir of how he went from regular guy to memory champion, the history and science of memory and memorization, and some specifics on how to actually use the techniques. These things are braided together, contributing to the reading experience of being pulled along through the book, but occasionally frustrating when I wanted a deeper dive into a specific, like in the chapter about memorizing poetry that almost seemed like it was going to tell me something new but switched to another strand right before the juicy part.The great takeaway from this book is that anyone can learn to use ancient techniques and take advantage of how our brains evolved to work. The focus of these memory competitors is trivial - who cares about the order of a deck of cards? - but the ideas in the book can be applied anywhere. "

You see I am a big language enthusiast. At one point or another you can find me studying French, Japanese, or Swedish, and as many language students will tell you, learning that pesky grammar or vocabulary can be exhausting. You can be drilling the same set of words entire night, remember them for the next morning’s test, and then forget them completely by suppertime. To our great frustration, human brains are built to form only the fun, unique experiences into long-term memories, and to toss the mundane, boring, rarely-used stuff into the pits of obscurity.

Americans seldom win or place in the world memory championship. We have so much information at our fingertips, that we really do not use need to use our memory much at all in today’s world and seemingly find it ‘normal’ to lose words, names and events more frequently.

79,159420229X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/16275106-pamela,5,"Josh Foer was a 25-year-old college graduate working as a freelance journalist and living with his parents in his childhood home when he first began the research that eventually led to this book and took him on a personal odyssey on the nature of memory. It began casually with an internet search for the smartest person in the world until he found himself at the USA Memory Championship writing an article for Slate about this little known contest and the collection of memory wizards who participated in it. In the course of the next year, he was to meet a strange collection of American and European, as well as other International memory competitors and learn the secrets of their unique abilities that go all the way back to ancient Greece with only slight changes along the way to our own times. He was even to become a competitor himself but to find out how he did when he finally competed in the USA Championship you will have to read the book yourself.Moonwalking With Einstein is a fascinating look at the brain and how it stores memory. Foer touches on all known aspects of this from history and the whys and hows of oral history and the transmission of knowledge before reading and writing to the impact of Gutenberg on memory. He discusses some strange and bizarre brain problems that have unusual effects on memory and the various techniques that mnemonists use to help them make such amazing feats of memorization. Of particular interest is the memory palace. There is also an interesting discussion of the types of memory and what is known about how they work and why we can recite a complete and complicated piece of poetry but can't find our car keys or even remember where we parked the car in the first place. Or what we had for lunch yesterday or when Grandma's birthday is but can name all the Presidents in order. This was a terrific read but Einstein actually had nothing to do with it except as a memory picture. I thoroughly enjoyed it but don't ask me about it next week because I probably won't remember!"
80,159420229X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5650130-david-sheppard,5,"This is one of those rare books that is not only a joy to read, but also immensely helpful. It can help all of us with something that is at once troublesome and worrisome: our memory. It does this with ease, not teaching us some grueling rote memory technique, but one that is easy, natural and intuitive. Yet Moonwalking with Einstein turns out to not be exclusively a how-to book on memory. So what is it? Well, yes, it is about memory and how to improve it, but it is at once a history of techniques, a description of what memory is and what can go wrong with it, and also a running narrative of how the author, a journalist himself with no special memory skills, becomes one of the most proficient memory athletes in America. I'd learned a mnemonic device to aid memorization decades ago while in college, and found it to be helpful, but for some reason I'd abandoned the technique once I graduated. But Moonwalking with Einstein expands the mnemonic technique I learned back then by use of something of which I'd never heard: the ""Memory Palace."" The Memory Palace exploits our inherent skill for remembering images and spatial locations, harnesses these two abilities we all posses in abundance, and relates them to the memorization of numbers, lists and assortments of other difficult to remember items. The amazing thing is that the Memory Palace not only makes memorization easy, it also makes it fun. What makes the book so interesting is that it is narrative non-fiction and reads like a novel. The author locks his conflict with his own memory early on, gives a sense of rising tension as he accumulates the forces to overcome its limitations, and resolves this internal conflict at the end when he participates in the US Memory Championship. I didn't read it as urgently as I did today's number one bestseller, Laura Hillenbrand's Unbroken, but still, I couldn't put it down. In Chapter Five, I scanned the ""to-do"" list of fifteen items on pages 92/3 that the author had to memorize in his initial attempt, and developed the technique for myself as I read about the author memorizing it. As my Memory Palace, I used an old home of a high school friend with which I was still familiar, constructing useful details as I went. When I had finished reading about the author memorizing the list (took me about five minutes), I had memorized it myself, and I found that the items were not only immediately memorable, but that the list of items and their sequence was still with me days later, and so imbedded in my memory that I'm sure I'll ever forget it. All this, I accomplished effortlessly. This is a truly remarkable feat for me because I'm almost seventy years old and have chronic fatigue syndrome, which adversely affects all aspects of my memory. It has also given me hope that I might finally learn ancient Greek. I tried to learn it several years ago, but found building a vocabulary so difficult that I abandoned the project. Rote memory was just too much trouble. I am interested in all things Greek, and as it turns out, the Memory Palace technique was invented in the fifth century BC by Simonides following his narrow escape from the collapse of a building. This in itself is a story you'll be interested in reading about. The author says that since the time of this ancient Greek, ""the art of memory has been about creating architectural spaces in the imagination."" Having been to Greece twice and written a 480 page travel journal on the subject, (Oedipus On A Pale Horse: Greek Journey In Search Of A Personal Mythology) I have all the makings of a superb Greek Memory Palace. While traveling around Greece and the western coast of Turkey for ten weeks, I visited many cities and islands: Athens, Thebes, Delphi, Ithaca, Mykonos, Delos, Santorini, etc. I can't count all the archaeological sites I visited. What I'm creating isn't just any old Memory Palace but actually a Memory Country. Within each location, I can identify as many locations for storing words and meanings as I need. But not only that, I can also use characters from Greek mythology to create actions and images to reinforce the material, as the author suggests. All this constitutes my Greek Memory Palace: the location where I will store ancient Greek words and meanings as I learn the language, in accordance with the instructions learned in Moonwalking with Einstein. None of it was difficult. I picked it up as I read the book. The author describes how in the past people viewed their minds as something to perfect by loading it with all sorts of intellectual material. ""People used to labor to furnish their minds. They invested in the acquisition of memories the same way we invest in the acquisition of things."" [page 134] Some even believed that ""the art of memory was a secret key to unlocking the occult structure of the universe."" [page 151] This has given me an entirely new view of how to perceive my own mind and nourish it in the future. The author also discusses how we came to lose touch with our ability to remember with the invention of the printed word. The history of that estrangement and how inventions like Wikipedia and the Internet foster that estrangement is a very interesting story. The author makes the reader aware of what is happening to us and provides a way to project ourselves into the future without suffering so much of technology's debilitating effects. Perhaps the reason this book is so successful is that the reader never loses sight of the practical use of the information the author is providing because the author is discovering it himself and actively making use of it in his quest to make it into the US Memory Championship. This is an important book. Everyone can benefit from reading it. "
81,159420229X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/11652288-faye,2,"This was okay but if you know anything at all about memory techniques, you won't really find anything new here. I had hoped to get more background information on the memory techniques, how our brain works, etc. but instead it there was too much information in it that I, personally, just did not find relevant. For example, I'm just not interested in the individual memory champions (if I were, I would read their memoirs), or that he asked Daniel Tammet what the number 9,412 looked to him three times. I get that Foer, a journalist, did this with the intention of finding truth and, possibly, debunking a fraud. Still, while I have no idea whether Tammet is a fraud or not, I can say that this and other behaviours and comments made Foer seem pretty annoying.In another review, I read that this book reads like an overlong magazine article and I guess that's true: it did feel pretty drawn out and like a magazine article that was watered down and stretched out so it could become a book.

The author's journey over the course of one year, from 'journalist scraping by' to America's National Memory Champion, is as exciting as it is informative. Highly recommend for anyone who want to learn about how to improve their memory, understand the research behind 'memory savants', or simply enjoy the unique story of the esoteric competitions between 'mental athletes'."

84,159420229X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/8187431-rade,4,"“Forgotten phone numbers and birthdays represent minor erosions of our everyday memory, but they are part of a much larger story of how we've supplanted our own natural memory with a vast superstructure of technological crutches—from the alphabet to the BlackBerry. These technologies of storing information outside our minds have helped make our modern world possible, but they've also changed how we think and how we use our brains.” I loved this book. Not because it offers insights to some unbelievable profound ideas but because it talks about our brains and how we use it to remember things. The thing about our brain is that it is a giant muscle and the more you work on it the bigger it gets. The bigger it gets, the more it remembers. The book is so much more than Foer's journey to understand what it means to be a mental athlete and eventually what it means to think in a way they do. It also goes back to a time when people like monks used various techniques to not only remember stuff short term, but to imprint it in their minds so they can recall it at any time, on any day, making writing new hymns and lectures easier. This was a time when technology was almost nonexistent. Books, while rare were also very hard to have at hand when searching religious text. When one had a copy, he would spend hours if not days going back and fourth trying to put together a sermon. This is one of the reasons people looked into ways of storing this type of information in their brain so life could be a bit easier. One of the techniques that these mental athletes use today is the whole idea of a memory palace, a way of dividing your brain into separate rooms in as many houses as possible and storing things in there so you can recall it later. The way one does it is not to say ""buy a new jacket"" as a to do item, but to make it as descriptive as possible. It is better to imagine an alligator wearing a warm jacket while fishing on a chilly winter day as that sticks better in your mind. Our minds are not bad at remembering but they are bad at recalling because remembering to buy bread and butter at a supermarket is something we did a hundred times therefore, it doesn't stick out, and it is pushed aside and eventually (in a week or even less), forgotten. Some people sometimes had to pray and beg for forgiveness when they found out that using sexual imagery helps them recall information better because it sticks faster. Now in order to remember that I have to buy yogurt, I just need to picture Megan Fox swimming in it while munching an all American burger and I am golden haha Seriously though, it takes a lot of practice and patience to do this type of thing. It is achievable but most people don't have the time or patience to do it. Foer did it but it did not come out of nowhere. He had a help of some of the people who competed in these mental athlete challenges and they pushed him and couched him on what to do and what not to do when one finds himself off track and wondering aimlessly around. SPOILER WARNING: At the end of the book Foer won this mental athlete event but he said that since we have so many ways of writing stuff down (especially phones as most people carry it on them all day long), this use of remembering stuff is not needed. It is nice but he said he does not use his mental techniques any more (at least not much) as we have other ways of keeping records and finding information that was once very hard to track down. Again, this is a great book and I really enjoyed it as the author did not just go into his life but set a bunch of chapters to discuss historical figures who used these types of techniques to make it easier to recall stuff during their every day activities. I kind of wish he went further into it but a succinct summery is better than no summary at all. "

He didn’t just forget where he parked—he forgot that he drove.In this inspiriting book, Joshua Foer shows how he — a person of decidedly unprodigious memory — learns some well-established mnemonic techniques, practices them for a half hour a day over the course of a year, and winds up winning the national memory contest (by, among other things, memorizing a deck of cards in record time).Along the way to the championship, Foer provides his own color commentary by discussing the phenomenon of memory — and by describing the lives of people who are real memory phenomena, like Kim “Rain Man” Peek, the savant who, despite having an I.Q. of just 87, absorbed information, retained it, and recalled it without effort; or the unnamed individual EP, afflicted with complete amnesia as a result of brain damage caused by herpes simplex.Even more colorful are the idiosyncratic “mental athletes” who steer Foer in the direction of the championship. Among them is Tony Buzan, the flamboyant minter of a “mind mapping” technique that, well, made him a mint and gave him grandiose ideas of reforming education.The techniques, it turns out, have been in use since antiquity. Before the ready availability of and access to books, learning involved training the memory to retrieve information. The ancient Greeks began to explore ways of using the capabilities of the brain to recall “architectural” memories as a means of building virtual “memory palaces” in the mind. These virtual buildings are where memories —often given arbitrary but colorful personalities and attributes — are stored for later retrieval.(One of the most fun aspects of the book is how Foer enlists the reader to use this technique to memorize a shopping list. Read this book and you will effortlessly—and probably forever—recall his list: pickled garlic, cottage cheese, peat-smoked salmon, 6 bottles of white wine, 3 pairs of socks, and email for Sophia.)The process requires focused effort and some creativity, and, when you think that what’s stored isn’t the raw memory itself but a tarted-up decoy that lures you to the place where the memory resides, not everyone has felt the extra baggage to be worth the effort. The Chinese, for example, were exposed to these techniques by Jesuit missionaries in the 16th century but decided that rote learning was “simpler and faster.”In ""Moonwalking with Einstein,"" Foer does a masterful job of using memory (or the lack of it) as the foil for an exploration not only the human brain but the human condition as well. What is consciousness? What is learning? What is creativity? How do we best educate ourselves? How does technology influence the ways in which we think about things, and how do the ways in which we think about things define us?And fortunately, if you don’t have the memory of a London cabdriver but need to navigate your way back to Giordano Bruno’s memory wheel, there is an index."

The case of someone who kept forgetting things the moment they happened (like in the movie Memento), along with the recent reports of Gabriel Garcia Marquez' dementia, also made me concerned about memory's place and role in our lives. The most interesting part for me was about the author voicing his doubts and laying his case over 'savant' Daniel Tammet, of Born on a Blue Day: Inside the Extraordinary Mind of an Autistic Savant. Then again, not that I really care enough about who's right and wrong in this case, since to me, the training required to develop the ability to remember like trained memory experts take out the joy in experiencing natural flow in life. Even as I frustrate over forgetting the most mundane stuff, it reminds me of my faults and to appreciate memories that stick naturally because I know they must've mattered to me, not because they're the after-effects of conscious stamping in my brain. Don't they have a saying, you live for the moments that take your breath away - it wouldn't be the same if those moments were due to you holding your breath would it? Remembering things because they're memorable as opposed to remembering by technique are sort of like that I think.I know I'm saying this because I still have a working and relatively healthy memory. It must be agonizing indeed to have memories slip out of you or your loved ones, but for such cases, I doubt if the techniques mentioned here apply.Definitely overhyped, but I don't feel it's an altogether wasted read either. Feels like a whitewashed Malcolm Gladwell, if you'd asked me. Maybe all journalists write in pretty similar styles?"

Under the tutelage of a British memory champ Ed Cook, Foer learns the tricks and techniques that most of the mental athletes use, such as the Major system of pegging letters to numbers, or the PAO system, in which the user associates two-digit numbers with memorable people and actions. Foer does more than just look behind the curtain at the Championships, though; he meets with Anders Ericsson of Florida State, who studies the development of expertise; he meets with Kim Peek, the inspiration for ‘Rain Man;’ he reads the ancients on memory, such as Simonides and his memory palace, or the Rhetorica ad Herennium, which gives tips on memorizing speeches using loci; he meets with guru/PR man Tony Buzan, who claims to help thousands with his Mind Mapping techniques; he reads old case studies, such as that of Russian journalist S who forgot almost nothing; he meets living case studies, such as E.P., who has no working memory.The book is a skilled synthesis of all things related to mnemonics and brain studies, a very readable introduction to the history of memory. Foer tells his story honestly – not always making himself look like the coolest guy in the room in the process – and with an engaging, comfortable prose style. He paces the story well, capping it with his unremarkable showing at the World Championships, but along the way tackles some subjects like a veteran journalist out to break a story: he’s not afraid to show the questionable side of Tony Buzan or supposed Asperger’s savant Daniel Tammet. It’s a compelling narrative as well as a fascinating overview of what we know about memory – and it offers several practical tips to improve the reader’s own memory. It’s well executed and, yes, memorable. "

89,159420229X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/28482493-angus-mckeogh,3,Extremely interesting. The memory is a fickle beast. And this memoir definitely revealed much more of the tricks and techniques that are used to memorize things. Possibly the most fascinating aspect of the book was when he discussed Daniel Tammet. Having already read the latter’s book about his “savant memory” it was incredible to learn Tammet was simply using the same techniques as these other memory performers. Sure wish I wouldn’t have used any space in my brain while reading Tammet’s book. Reminds me a bit of the James Frey debacle with A Million Little Pieces.
90,159420229X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2188450-andrea,4,"I started this one with somewhat lowered expectations, feeling like I was revisiting too-familiar territory. Being the clever woman I am, I had diagnosed a trend of immersive journalism about ""brain sports"" (I just made that term up), profiling the odd sort of people that tend to become obsessive about such things, and learning how to become obsessive oneself. And having spotted this trend, I was (of course) subsequently dismissive, skeptical that this book about memory competition would entertain me any more than similarly themed books like ""Word Freak"" by Stefan Fatsis (about Scrabble) and ""The Kings of New York"" by Michael Weinreb (Chess) already had. (I can't help but assume that, as a journalist, immersing oneself in competitive memory competition would be much more attractive than say, covering Afghanistan or playing for the Detroit Tigers, due to the substantially decreased risk of bodily harm). However, even though the premise was nothing new, I was very entertained by this book. Foer manages to find many fascinating things to say about something that is, at heart, just an extreme version of an everyday human activity - remembering shit. I found myself eager to come back to this book when I had to put it down, and excited to learn more about the subject."
91,159420229X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/26560507-heather,4,"I thoroughly enjoyed this book and couldn't wait to get back into it every time I had to step away. I don't know that it taught me very much (& I have no intention whatsoever to improve my memory using the tactics loosely outlined in this book - not because I don't believe they are effective, but because I don't want to), but it was extremely interesting and kept me engaged the entire time. I also REALLY enjoyed the writing style and hope Joshua Foer plans to write more in the future, because I am eager to read whatever it may be."

93,159420229X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2922699-genia-lukin,3,"Joshua Foer tackles in his book the issues of memory - how it is formed, how it has been lost, and how to improve it. Aside from the anecdotal - the rather interesting glimpse into the world of the mental athletes, amusing to me personally because of my familiarity with (and let's be frank here, membership in) the geeky society at large, Foer also presents the more general - research into memory and amnesia, as well as a historical perspective on the memorisation techniques and learning of the past.In my world, the world of religious Judaism, Torah readings, and extensive familiarity with texts, we still memorize a great deal. So I approached this book with a level of interest especially to the educational and historical aspects of the subject which Foer presents. I also enjoyed the cognitive, but the research he presents is one I am generally familiar with, and thus less interested in, when reading a presentation for the layman. Foer's research is generally good, though oftentimes insufficient. We get a slew of cognitive limitations and some exploration into amnesia - a very interesting chapter in and of itself - but not much about memory research beyond the very generic. We do not see some of the abnormal research into memory done on various sub-populations, except a tiny glimpse into savants, which are a somewhat different phenomenon, and even then the glimpse is mostly one of disillusionment.However, I can't help but agree with Foer intellectually when he makes his educational claims concerning the point that, for any person to think creatively and analytically, he first has to supply himself with basic facts which can be retrieved and analysed. If you do not know the basic material, the ground rules, or the structure of a subject, you then have nothing to analyse, nothing to expand upon, nothing to create with. If you can't remember the shape of an object you can't draw it, and if you can't remember the points of disagreement between two ideologies you cannot judge them.The parts pertaining to the memory sport itself, somehow, interested me less. It is still in the realm of the esoteric - as Foer himself claims - and card memorisation and the ability to recite long poems after fifteen minutes still would not help us - or him - find his car keys, Still, this is an interesting and important book, especially for people without the academic background, because it provides yet another glimpse into how our minds work, or don't work, and what we do, or don't do, with them."
94,159420229X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/80375046-shnila-parveen,2," In Plato’s Phaedrus, Socrates describes how the Egyptian god Theuth, inventor of writing, came to Thamus, the king of Egypt, and offered to bestow his wonderful invention upon the Egyptian people. “Here is a branch of learning that will ... improve their memories,” Theuth said to the Egyptian king. “My discovery provides a recipe for both memory and wisdom.” But Thamus was reluctant to accept the gift. “If men learn this, it will implant forgetfulness in their souls,” he told the god. “They will cease to exercise their memory and become forgetful; they will rely on that which is written, calling things to remembrance no longer from within themselves, but by means of external marks. What you have discovered is a recipe not for memory, but for reminding. And it is no true wisdom that you offer your disciples, but only its semblance, for by telling them of many things without teaching them anything, you will make them seem to know much, while for the most part they will know nothing. And as men filled not with wisdom but with the conceit of wisdom, they will be a burden to their fellow-men. What is the importance of memory in present times of technology making information available on our fingertips? Is it crucial for our cognitive capabilities or just futile endeavor? These are difficult questions that are not answered in this book. The author has however admitted that the memory hacks he learnt for the memory championships do not really improve the memory in general. After securing a good ranking in the European Memory Championship, Author forgot that he drove his car to the party celebrating his victory and took the Subway instead. There is no refuting the fact that the importance of human memory has marginalized in last couple of decades. One of the important reasons why I started writing reviews, first in private notes and then in Goodread is because I started to realize that I do not retain much from the books that I was reading. It seemed like an act of idle indulgence of absorbing someone else’s work without adding anything of my own. My views were there for a moment but would disappear as if I had none. By writing a review, I am not just an idle reader anymore but I am adding something of my own to the reading. Since I usually write my reviews after finishing the book, it also becomes an act of active recall, one of the memory techniques I believe works for me. For how long though, cannot be sure. Few year ago, I used to watch BBC’s Sherlock Holmes TV series where the lead character had mind palaces helping him recall the most miniscule things in excruciating detail. I presumed it as one of the quirks of the eccentric character. It was while reading this book that I got to know that memory palace is a legitimate and widely used memory hack, used by the participants of the memory championships. Although I don’t find a practical use of it in my day to day life. An interesting piece is on the analysis of Odyssey and Illiad. There are theories that claim that these famous poems were not written by one person but rather passed on years after years by way as loose collection of songs. The structure of poems is such that it seems to have been evolved for being memorized and later with the invention of writing, compiled together in its current form. The brain best remembers things that are repeated, rhythmic, rhyming, structured, and above all easily visualized. The only thing I did not like about this book is its deceptive title which would pass it of as a self-help book. This book is not a self-help book. Joshua Foer participated in US and European Memory Championship as part of his article in something called as participatory journalism. He met some unique set of people, discovered unusual things about memory and went on to win the memory championship. There are a lot of negative reviews about this book, which are accurate but are not substantial when you read this book with an open mind to learn something about an unusual subject. Memorizing has earned a bad reputation as an absence of real intellect and just a way to hold on to information for clearing the next exam. Its cause it not helped by the fact that the people with amazing memories have not made much in life and have resorted to self-help guru bluff. Memory does not help you become good at something. Instead mastering something breeds a better memory."

It never occurred to me that there was this kind of mental superpower that we could all have.Told by a journalist intrigued by memory competitions, Moonwalking with Einstein was simple and light to read. This was a story of his own journey into the world of mental athletes, and him taking a go at it himself.We are brought with him in his journey to find out what this is. Before the creation of the printing press, our world did not have the means we have today, to store our information. It was up to us to memorize what we learned especially if we wanted to pass it down onto the next generation. Tales and stories were made to keep these memories alive. Little did I know, that the small memory competitions today are so minuscule compared to the world before where memory palaces and techniques were as common as writing today.What is so empowering about this book is that he shows us, we can all create our own memory palaces if we would just put the time at it. We could know by heart the stories, the quotes, the places we would want to keep in our minds forever. I learned that memory is not a test of intellect but of creativity. We don’t have to be mental athletes who can memorize thousands of numbers or random words in minutes. But we can use these techniques for remembering the things we actually want to remember.Towards the end of the book, we are called on to remember because “how we perceive the world and act In it are products of how and what we remember”And if you feel daunted by the task to establish more memories, remember memory is not as much due to intellect as it is due to creativity. 4.5 Stars"

Moonwalking is really not that bad once you get past some utterly boring reportage about a group of obsessives who go in for memory competitions around the world. Foer initially covered one of these competitions as a reporter, became involved himself and determined to win the next year’s US competition. In the process, he delves into sometimes-amusing, but more often tedious, investigations into the place of memory in our society. There are some nice observations - on the difference between knowledge and memory, or about memory once being fundamental to the preservation of knowledge, but no longer being much needed in a literate society with an abundance of stored information (first on scrolls, then books, and now the Internet). But the book suffers from an overly-journalistic style and it reads like an extended magazine article. First-person investigational stuff with some random historical/scientific filler: easy to browse, easy to skip over; but don't look for anything about the art of how to put the memory techniques into practice (it’s apparently a well-known system called “Memory Palace”), this is just Foer’s experience of doing it. So, is it any use? Well Foer himself finds that memory-improving techniques are not much good for anything more than lists and succeeding at memory competitions.I certainly would not find memorizing “memorable” images any easier than remembering the facts themselves – holy crap, how much time and effort would it take to dream up the images, associate them somehow with the thing-to-be-remembered and then recall the connection later, so that one would remember the “thing” and not just the mental image?? In short, not really worth 200 pages. Two stars may sound a little mingy, but it’s ultimately a bit boring."

They do things like memorize 20thousand digits of pi or memorize the order of a deck of cards in a very short amount of time or memorize a long sequence of numbers or letters or words or pretty much anything for almost no reason at all. There's even something called the US Memory Championship (which the author won and that's not even really a spoiler) and also the World Memory Championship (in which Americans always do poorly, to my ever-expanding shame.)Foer escorts the reader on not only a stunt journalism-type memoir of his time training for and competing in these competitions, but also on a journey through the brain, in an Oliver Sacks-esque exploration of all the weird, quirky things a memory does or can do.Did you know that the guy from Rain Man is a real guy? You probably did. He is not the same person as Dustin Hoffman, though. He is his very own person and he is named Kim Peek and despite his ability to multiple huge numbers in his head and to calculate the dates of all the Easter Sundays in the history of Easter Sundays and despite his incredible memory, he had an IQ of only 87. And only just now am I realizing that Peek is now dead, which makes me sad. The point is, Peek was a savant, sometimes even called a megasavant, which is like a savant². Did you know there is another guy named Daniel Tammet who claims to be a megasavant but is probably just a faker?And now you, yes YOU, can fake being a savant if you read this book. You can learn how to construct imaginary things called memory palaces which will give you the incredible power of nigh-perfect memory.

That shelf looks pretty bare.I saw this book appear in my feeds once and the title certainly caught my attention. This is a story about a journalists journey from reporting on the US and World memory competition one year, to competing in it the following year. In his first year reporting the event, Joshua Foer began to understand that all of the participants at the event weren't savants or incredibly smart, they pretty much all had a system that made remembering pi to the 2000 digit more of a trick than an IQ measure. Armed with this info, Joshua embarks on a journey to see if he can build a memory system to allow him to remember 100 names and faces, recall a deck of cards and report back, (I can't remember how many, ironic i know) a large number chain.THIS IS NOT A SELF HELP BOOK. If you are going to read this to learn how to become better at remembering names when going into meetings (this is me) you are not going to be taught how to do it. What this book does do is give you the history of memory systems, going way way back to the ancient Greeks. He interviews people from the US and the UK with all sorts of fascinating memory disorders, he covers how Tony Buzon has made over 300 million dollars in self help books, using memory techniques that have been around for thousands of years. Joshua spends time with a couple of memory champions and the begin to help him learn his system so that he can compete in the following years memory contest. The system is very simple, what isn't simple is the practice to make it work. So thankfully Foer doesn't spend too much time talking about practice, but he does give the strong impression that he is spending at least an hour a day memorising his system. A third of the way through the book, he does give an example how anyone can learn a system quickly. I was listening to this on audio (which is very well narrated, except for the typically poor english accent that Mike Chamberlain does) whilst driving and we are told how to use the 'loqi' or 'memory palace' to remember some random items. Now this part of the book was day one of a 4 day business trip, it was 6 days ago and I can still recall all ten items mentioned with no problem at all, including 'peat smoked salmon' and 'email Sophia'. My visualization of cottage cheese on the front door step of the house i grew up in is one I enjoy re-visualizing. It involves Nicole Kidman and thats about as much as I am going to divulge here.This is not a how to help improve your memory, but it does give you a big slice of the systems used and everything you would need to help you improve can be found on the mnemonics wiki site. I wasn't sure what to expect when reading this, I was happily surprised to have really enjoyed it. A very well written docu/journalistic article on memory, paced very well with some fascinating facts and figures. This book was much more than I had hoped for and so have no qualms about giving it 4 stars. "
100,159420229X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/38618130-azaa-kh,5,"A very misleading title, but the content was not a disappointment. ""Experience is the sum of our memories and wisdom the sum of our experiences"" If we follow this logic, we gain wisdom through our memories. And yet, memorization has been largely criticized by many school officials and educators that it kills creativity and critical thinking. But what this book points out, which I completely agree, is the fact that memorization is never really taught in schools. Instead, they make students memorize a bunch of unimportant facts through rote memorization without teaching how to retain the information, and that is what is corrupting our education system but not the memorization itself. In fact, the book reasons that learning and memorization come hand-in-hand, so you cannot get one without the other. This has completely changed my perspective on memorization.Another interesting fact pointed out in this book was that we can make our lives seem longer through varying our life experiences. This may sound contradictory at first because when we have fewer things to do, time does not seem to move at all. However, the study shows that it is the contrary: In 1962, a researcher named, Michel Siffre, conducted a self-experimentation by spending two months in a cave without access to a clock, calendars, or the Sun. As time went on, his memory deteriorated and lost track of the passage of time. After two months, when he finally got out of the cave, he thought that only a month had passed. This suggested the hypothesis that the less we experience, the shorter the time seems to fly, so according to this hypothesis, to stretch our psychological time, we will need to create new memories that play as anchor points in our lives.Last but not least, the book also illustrates how we attain new skills and reach beyond our limits. I personally think this was the most important topic discussed in this book. When we learn a new skill, we progress through three stages: cognitive stage, associative stage, and autonomous stage. The cognitive stage is where all the learning occurs and the skill is developed rapidly. In this stage, a person fully focuses on the task consciously and intellectually discovers new strategies to get the task done. But once we pass this stage and become good enough, what we do becomes so autonomous or unconscious that we do not even have to use our intellects anymore. This is what the book calls the OK plateau, the period in which we see almost no growth because we are merely following our unconscious process. So to go beyond our limits, we need to stay in the cognitive stage and continuously develop our capabilities. There's a saying ""Practice makes it perfect"", but how we practice is more important than the amount we practice, and only when it is the concentrated, self-conscious, and deliberated kind of practice, we will not be restrained by our limits anymore.Overall, I'd suggest this book for anyone who wants to improve their learning process.

101,159420229X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4252261-tom-la,4,"Truly excellent work of participatory journalism. The author set out to explore the world of ""memory competitions"", and from there he made himself the subject of a study on skills-improvement, to the point that he won a national memory competition. This book paints a high-level fresco on the subject of human memory: the history of how we recall things, how massively that has changed throughout the centuries, and how some ancient memory techniques (almost forgotten today) are surprisingly efficient still today, and available to anyone, not only for people with a ""strong memory"". - the topic is fascinating and important for our understanding of ourselves;- the book is well written, although a little too MalcolmGladwellesque at points (Oxf. cit. ""to write like Malcom Gladwell"" = to make a big entertaining fuss about something without actually saying much, and make it sound much more exciting than what it actually is through the use of anecdotes, humour and trivia)- I noticed some references to the content of ""Talent is overrated"" by Geoff Colvin, especially for what concerns the topic of skills improvement- some of the techniques described, like the ""memory palace"" technique, were new to me, and... well, unforgettable. Sorry, I was hoping I would get through this review without any stupid pun.- Daniel Tammet, the alleged savant author of ""Born on a blue day"", might be a complete or partial fraud. Difficult to prove, but Foer has a good point there.Important note: if you are looking for a book to teach you some memory techniques, this is probably not the best book for you, because this one includes many general explanations on various related topics and also some personal stories from the author's life. He does quote several other books that are specifically meant to teach memory techniques."
102,159420229X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/159421-shan,4,"Interesting and fun to read, like a longer version of the long-form journalism you find in magazines like the New Yorker. That might be where I previously read a chunk of this book when it came out in 2011, illustrating one of the memory principles it explains: our memories are great at recognizing things we've seen before, even if we wouldn't have been able to recall them otherwise.The title comes from the memory technique Foer learned to compete as a ""mental athlete"" after finding out such a thing existed in the course of researching an article he was writing. The technique is the memory palace, in which you attach vivid mental pictures to specific spots in a location you know well. To memorize esoteric things like the digits of pi or the order of a deck of cards, you first learn to give each digit or card a constant image you'll always associate with it (or three, as Foer learned from European competitors, who use POA - person, object, action).Like those long magazine articles, the book has layers - the memoir of how he went from regular guy to memory champion, the history and science of memory and memorization, and some specifics on how to actually use the techniques. These things are braided together, contributing to the reading experience of being pulled along through the book, but occasionally frustrating when I wanted a deeper dive into a specific, like in the chapter about memorizing poetry that almost seemed like it was going to tell me something new but switched to another strand right before the juicy part.The great takeaway from this book is that anyone can learn to use ancient techniques and take advantage of how our brains evolved to work. The focus of these memory competitors is trivial - who cares about the order of a deck of cards? - but the ideas in the book can be applied anywhere. "

At one point or another you can find me studying French, Japanese, or Swedish, and as many language students will tell you, learning that pesky grammar or vocabulary can be exhausting. You can be drilling the same set of words entire night, remember them for the next morning’s test, and then forget them completely by suppertime. To our great frustration, human brains are built to form only the fun, unique experiences into long-term memories, and to toss the mundane, boring, rarely-used stuff into the pits of obscurity. If you’ve seen Pixar’s Inside Out, you actually have a pretty good idea about the inner workings of human thought processes.Wouldn’t it be nice to find a book that would unlock the secrets of long-term memorization?Well, Moonwalking with Einstein is not....

The story for Joshua preparing for the Memory Championship is really interesting. All discoveries that he had made, special cases from people with extinguished memory, but very low IQ. Now the question is asked: Is memory trained or some brain disorders are responsible for ?Kim, savient with special abilities to remember dates, all history events, but IQ 87, and another example of Daniel still undiscovered type of ""savient"" or only hard memory training. I even wathed the documentary for Brainman. Neuroscience has still time to discover.At the end the most important are our memories. They make us human and define us.""Life seems to speed up as we get older because life gets less memorable as we get older. If to remember is to be human, then remembering means being more human."""

I thought Foer explained how we remember, the anomalies of savants and the history of human memory in a very readable, well documented manner. Have we come to a place of the end of memory? Americans seldom win or place in the world memory championship. We have so much information at our fingertips, that we really do not use need to use our memory much at all in today’s world and seemingly find it ‘normal’ to lose words, names and events more frequently. This book definitely got me thinking and I will be more mindful of my own memory......but I’m not likely to train to enter the Championship"

GAR!!Very insightful and useful - more useful than that dumb ""Mastermind: How to Think Like Sherlock Holmes"". I love learning more about how the mind works and even picking up on some helpful tips (though don't be confused: although it's placed in self-help, it's not strictly self-help).About the only bad is how dense it could get and how not useful memorizing random digits and cards are. I just can't help but wonder...why bother???"
108,159420229X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1289001-jen-knox,4,This book was well written and useful. All the useful tricks and background are frontloaded and the latter half is full of meanderings and perspectives on education techniques in general (which felt like a different book). The book inspired me to test my memory and exercise it more often. Now I just need help with ... recall. 
109,159420229X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/16275106-pamela,5,"Josh Foer was a 25-year-old college graduate working as a freelance journalist and living with his parents in his childhood home when he first began the research that eventually led to this book and took him on a personal odyssey on the nature of memory. It began casually with an internet search for the smartest person in the world until he found himself at the USA Memory Championship writing an article for Slate about this little known contest and the collection of memory wizards who participated in it. In the course of the next year, he was to meet a strange collection of American and European, as well as other International memory competitors and learn the secrets of their unique abilities that go all the way back to ancient Greece with only slight changes along the way to our own times. He was even to become a competitor himself but to find out how he did when he finally competed in the USA Championship you will have to read the book yourself.Moonwalking With Einstein is a fascinating look at the brain and how it stores memory. Foer touches on all known aspects of this from history and the whys and hows of oral history and the transmission of knowledge before reading and writing to the impact of Gutenberg on memory. He discusses some strange and bizarre brain problems that have unusual effects on memory and the various techniques that mnemonists use to help them make such amazing feats of memorization. Of particular interest is the memory palace. There is also an interesting discussion of the types of memory and what is known about how they work and why we can recite a complete and complicated piece of poetry but can't find our car keys or even remember where we parked the car in the first place. Or what we had for lunch yesterday or when Grandma's birthday is but can name all the Presidents in order. This was a terrific read but Einstein actually had nothing to do with it except as a memory picture. I thoroughly enjoyed it but don't ask me about it next week because I probably won't remember!"
110,159420229X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5650130-david-sheppard,5,"This is one of those rare books that is not only a joy to read, but also immensely helpful. It can help all of us with something that is at once troublesome and worrisome: our memory. It does this with ease, not teaching us some grueling rote memory technique, but one that is easy, natural and intuitive. Yet Moonwalking with Einstein turns out to not be exclusively a how-to book on memory. So what is it? Well, yes, it is about memory and how to improve it, but it is at once a history of techniques, a description of what memory is and what can go wrong with it, and also a running narrative of how the author, a journalist himself with no special memory skills, becomes one of the most proficient memory athletes in America. I'd learned a mnemonic device to aid memorization decades ago while in college, and found it to be helpful, but for some reason I'd abandoned the technique once I graduated. But Moonwalking with Einstein expands the mnemonic technique I learned back then by use of something of which I'd never heard: the ""Memory Palace."" The Memory Palace exploits our inherent skill for remembering images and spatial locations, harnesses these two abilities we all posses in abundance, and relates them to the memorization of numbers, lists and assortments of other difficult to remember items. The amazing thing is that the Memory Palace not only makes memorization easy, it also makes it fun. What makes the book so interesting is that it is narrative non-fiction and reads like a novel. The author locks his conflict with his own memory early on, gives a sense of rising tension as he accumulates the forces to overcome its limitations, and resolves this internal conflict at the end when he participates in the US Memory Championship. I didn't read it as urgently as I did today's number one bestseller, Laura Hillenbrand's Unbroken, but still, I couldn't put it down. In Chapter Five, I scanned the ""to-do"" list of fifteen items on pages 92/3 that the author had to memorize in his initial attempt, and developed the technique for myself as I read about the author memorizing it. As my Memory Palace, I used an old home of a high school friend with which I was still familiar, constructing useful details as I went. When I had finished reading about the author memorizing the list (took me about five minutes), I had memorized it myself, and I found that the items were not only immediately memorable, but that the list of items and their sequence was still with me days later, and so imbedded in my memory that I'm sure I'll ever forget it. All this, I accomplished effortlessly. This is a truly remarkable feat for me because I'm almost seventy years old and have chronic fatigue syndrome, which adversely affects all aspects of my memory. It has also given me hope that I might finally learn ancient Greek. I tried to learn it several years ago, but found building a vocabulary so difficult that I abandoned the project. Rote memory was just too much trouble. I am interested in all things Greek, and as it turns out, the Memory Palace technique was invented in the fifth century BC by Simonides following his narrow escape from the collapse of a building. This in itself is a story you'll be interested in reading about. The author says that since the time of this ancient Greek, ""the art of memory has been about creating architectural spaces in the imagination."" Having been to Greece twice and written a 480 page travel journal on the subject, (Oedipus On A Pale Horse: Greek Journey In Search Of A Personal Mythology) I have all the makings of a superb Greek Memory Palace. While traveling around Greece and the western coast of Turkey for ten weeks, I visited many cities and islands: Athens, Thebes, Delphi, Ithaca, Mykonos, Delos, Santorini, etc. I can't count all the archaeological sites I visited. What I'm creating isn't just any old Memory Palace but actually a Memory Country. Within each location, I can identify as many locations for storing words and meanings as I need. But not only that, I can also use characters from Greek mythology to create actions and images to reinforce the material, as the author suggests. All this constitutes my Greek Memory Palace: the location where I will store ancient Greek words and meanings as I learn the language, in accordance with the instructions learned in Moonwalking with Einstein. None of it was difficult. I picked it up as I read the book. The author describes how in the past people viewed their minds as something to perfect by loading it with all sorts of intellectual material. ""People used to labor to furnish their minds. They invested in the acquisition of memories the same way we invest in the acquisition of things."" [page 134] Some even believed that ""the art of memory was a secret key to unlocking the occult structure of the universe."" [page 151] This has given me an entirely new view of how to perceive my own mind and nourish it in the future. The author also discusses how we came to lose touch with our ability to remember with the invention of the printed word. The history of that estrangement and how inventions like Wikipedia and the Internet foster that estrangement is a very interesting story. The author makes the reader aware of what is happening to us and provides a way to project ourselves into the future without suffering so much of technology's debilitating effects. Perhaps the reason this book is so successful is that the reader never loses sight of the practical use of the information the author is providing because the author is discovering it himself and actively making use of it in his quest to make it into the US Memory Championship. This is an important book. Everyone can benefit from reading it. "
111,159420229X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/11652288-faye,2,"This was okay but if you know anything at all about memory techniques, you won't really find anything new here. I had hoped to get more background information on the memory techniques, how our brain works, etc. but instead it there was too much information in it that I, personally, just did not find relevant. For example, I'm just not interested in the individual memory champions (if I were, I would read their memoirs), or that he asked Daniel Tammet what the number 9,412 looked to him three times. I get that Foer, a journalist, did this with the intention of finding truth and, possibly, debunking a fraud. Still, while I have no idea whether Tammet is a fraud or not, I can say that this and other behaviours and comments made Foer seem pretty annoying.In another review, I read that this book reads like an overlong magazine article and I guess that's true: it did feel pretty drawn out and like a magazine article that was watered down and stretched out so it could become a book. Meh."

The author's journey over the course of one year, from 'journalist scraping by' to America's National Memory Champion, is as exciting as it is informative. Highly recommend for anyone who want to learn about how to improve their memory, understand the research behind 'memory savants', or simply enjoy the unique story of the esoteric competitions between 'mental athletes'."
113,159420229X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/63866052-noor,2,I’d rather drown in a lake than read this again. 
114,159420229X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/8187431-rade,4,"“Forgotten phone numbers and birthdays represent minor erosions of our everyday memory, but they are part of a much larger story of how we've supplanted our own natural memory with a vast superstructure of technological crutches—from the alphabet to the BlackBerry. These technologies of storing information outside our minds have helped make our modern world possible, but they've also changed how we think and how we use our brains.” I loved this book. Not because it offers insights to some unbelievable profound ideas but because it talks about our brains and how we use it to remember things. The thing about our brain is that it is a giant muscle and the more you work on it the bigger it gets. The bigger it gets, the more it remembers. The book is so much more than Foer's journey to understand what it means to be a mental athlete and eventually what it means to think in a way they do. It also goes back to a time when people like monks used various techniques to not only remember stuff short term, but to imprint it in their minds so they can recall it at any time, on any day, making writing new hymns and lectures easier. This was a time when technology was almost nonexistent. Books, while rare were also very hard to have at hand when searching religious text. When one had a copy, he would spend hours if not days going back and fourth trying to put together a sermon. This is one of the reasons people looked into ways of storing this type of information in their brain so life could be a bit easier. One of the techniques that these mental athletes use today is the whole idea of a memory palace, a way of dividing your brain into separate rooms in as many houses as possible and storing things in there so you can recall it later. The way one does it is not to say ""buy a new jacket"" as a to do item, but to make it as descriptive as possible. It is better to imagine an alligator wearing a warm jacket while fishing on a chilly winter day as that sticks better in your mind. Our minds are not bad at remembering but they are bad at recalling because remembering to buy bread and butter at a supermarket is something we did a hundred times therefore, it doesn't stick out, and it is pushed aside and eventually (in a week or even less), forgotten. Some people sometimes had to pray and beg for forgiveness when they found out that using sexual imagery helps them recall information better because it sticks faster. Now in order to remember that I have to buy yogurt, I just need to picture Megan Fox swimming in it while munching an all American burger and I am golden haha Seriously though, it takes a lot of practice and patience to do this type of thing. It is achievable but most people don't have the time or patience to do it. Foer did it but it did not come out of nowhere. He had a help of some of the people who competed in these mental athlete challenges and they pushed him and couched him on what to do and what not to do when one finds himself off track and wondering aimlessly around. SPOILER WARNING: At the end of the book Foer won this mental athlete event but he said that since we have so many ways of writing stuff down (especially phones as most people carry it on them all day long), this use of remembering stuff is not needed. It is nice but he said he does not use his mental techniques any more (at least not much) as we have other ways of keeping records and finding information that was once very hard to track down. Again, this is a great book and I really enjoyed it as the author did not just go into his life but set a bunch of chapters to discuss historical figures who used these types of techniques to make it easier to recall stuff during their every day activities. I kind of wish he went further into it but a succinct summery is better than no summary at all. "
115,159420229X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1231090-jud-barry,4,"You have to love a book written by someone who, fresh from winning the U.S. Memory Championship, takes mass transit home because he’s forgotten that he drove. He didn’t just forget where he parked—he forgot that he drove.In this inspiriting book, Joshua Foer shows how he — a person of decidedly unprodigious memory — learns some well-established mnemonic techniques, practices them for a half hour a day over the course of a year, and winds up winning the national memory contest (by, among other things, memorizing a deck of cards in record time).Along the way to the championship, Foer provides his own color commentary by discussing the phenomenon of memory — and by describing the lives of people who are real memory phenomena, like Kim “Rain Man” Peek, the savant who, despite having an I.Q. of just 87, absorbed information, retained it, and recalled it without effort; or the unnamed individual EP, afflicted with complete amnesia as a result of brain damage caused by herpes simplex.Even more colorful are the idiosyncratic “mental athletes” who steer Foer in the direction of the championship. Among them is Tony Buzan, the flamboyant minter of a “mind mapping” technique that, well, made him a mint and gave him grandiose ideas of reforming education.The techniques, it turns out, have been in use since antiquity. Before the ready availability of and access to books, learning involved training the memory to retrieve information. The ancient Greeks began to explore ways of using the capabilities of the brain to recall “architectural” memories as a means of building virtual “memory palaces” in the mind. These virtual buildings are where memories —often given arbitrary but colorful personalities and attributes — are stored for later retrieval.(One of the most fun aspects of the book is how Foer enlists the reader to use this technique to memorize a shopping list. Read this book and you will effortlessly—and probably forever—recall his list: pickled garlic, cottage cheese, peat-smoked salmon, 6 bottles of white wine, 3 pairs of socks, and email for Sophia.)The process requires focused effort and some creativity, and, when you think that what’s stored isn’t the raw memory itself but a tarted-up decoy that lures you to the place where the memory resides, not everyone has felt the extra baggage to be worth the effort. The Chinese, for example, were exposed to these techniques by Jesuit missionaries in the 16th century but decided that rote learning was “simpler and faster.”In ""Moonwalking with Einstein,"" Foer does a masterful job of using memory (or the lack of it) as the foil for an exploration not only the human brain but the human condition as well. What is consciousness? What is learning? What is creativity? How do we best educate ourselves? How does technology influence the ways in which we think about things, and how do the ways in which we think about things define us?And fortunately, if you don’t have the memory of a London cabdriver but need to navigate your way back to Giordano Bruno’s memory wheel, there is an index."

The case of someone who kept forgetting things the moment they happened (like in the movie Memento), along with the recent reports of Gabriel Garcia Marquez' dementia, also made me concerned about memory's place and role in our lives. The most interesting part for me was about the author voicing his doubts and laying his case over 'savant' Daniel Tammet, of Born on a Blue Day: Inside the Extraordinary Mind of an Autistic Savant. Then again, not that I really care enough about who's right and wrong in this case, since to me, the training required to develop the ability to remember like trained memory experts take out the joy in experiencing natural flow in life. Even as I frustrate over forgetting the most mundane stuff, it reminds me of my faults and to appreciate memories that stick naturally because I know they must've mattered to me, not because they're the after-effects of conscious stamping in my brain. Don't they have a saying, you live for the moments that take your breath away - it wouldn't be the same if those moments were due to you holding your breath would it? Remembering things because they're memorable as opposed to remembering by technique are sort of like that I think.I know I'm saying this because I still have a working and relatively healthy memory. It must be agonizing indeed to have memories slip out of you or your loved ones, but for such cases, I doubt if the techniques mentioned here apply.Definitely overhyped, but I don't feel it's an altogether wasted read either. Feels like a whitewashed Malcolm Gladwell, if you'd asked me. Maybe all journalists write in pretty similar styles?"

Under the tutelage of a British memory champ Ed Cook, Foer learns the tricks and techniques that most of the mental athletes use, such as the Major system of pegging letters to numbers, or the PAO system, in which the user associates two-digit numbers with memorable people and actions. Foer does more than just look behind the curtain at the Championships, though; he meets with Anders Ericsson of Florida State, who studies the development of expertise; he meets with Kim Peek, the inspiration for ‘Rain Man;’ he reads the ancients on memory, such as Simonides and his memory palace, or the Rhetorica ad Herennium, which gives tips on memorizing speeches using loci; he meets with guru/PR man Tony Buzan, who claims to help thousands with his Mind Mapping techniques; he reads old case studies, such as that of Russian journalist S who forgot almost nothing; he meets living case studies, such as E.P., who has no working memory.The book is a skilled synthesis of all things related to mnemonics and brain studies, a very readable introduction to the history of memory. Foer tells his story honestly – not always making himself look like the coolest guy in the room in the process – and with an engaging, comfortable prose style. He paces the story well, capping it with his unremarkable showing at the World Championships, but along the way tackles some subjects like a veteran journalist out to break a story: he’s not afraid to show the questionable side of Tony Buzan or supposed Asperger’s savant Daniel Tammet. It’s a compelling narrative as well as a fascinating overview of what we know about memory – and it offers several practical tips to improve the reader’s own memory. It’s well executed and, yes, memorable. "

119,159420229X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/28482493-angus-mckeogh,3,Extremely interesting. The memory is a fickle beast. And this memoir definitely revealed much more of the tricks and techniques that are used to memorize things. Possibly the most fascinating aspect of the book was when he discussed Daniel Tammet. Having already read the latter’s book about his “savant memory” it was incredible to learn Tammet was simply using the same techniques as these other memory performers. Sure wish I wouldn’t have used any space in my brain while reading Tammet’s book. Reminds me a bit of the James Frey debacle with A Million Little Pieces.
120,159420229X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2188450-andrea,4,"I started this one with somewhat lowered expectations, feeling like I was revisiting too-familiar territory. Being the clever woman I am, I had diagnosed a trend of immersive journalism about ""brain sports"" (I just made that term up), profiling the odd sort of people that tend to become obsessive about such things, and learning how to become obsessive oneself. And having spotted this trend, I was (of course) subsequently dismissive, skeptical that this book about memory competition would entertain me any more than similarly themed books like ""Word Freak"" by Stefan Fatsis (about Scrabble) and ""The Kings of New York"" by Michael Weinreb (Chess) already had. (I can't help but assume that, as a journalist, immersing oneself in competitive memory competition would be much more attractive than say, covering Afghanistan or playing for the Detroit Tigers, due to the substantially decreased risk of bodily harm). However, even though the premise was nothing new, I was very entertained by this book. Foer manages to find many fascinating things to say about something that is, at heart, just an extreme version of an everyday human activity - remembering shit. I found myself eager to come back to this book when I had to put it down, and excited to learn more about the subject."
121,159420229X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/26560507-heather,4,"I thoroughly enjoyed this book and couldn't wait to get back into it every time I had to step away. I don't know that it taught me very much (& I have no intention whatsoever to improve my memory using the tactics loosely outlined in this book - not because I don't believe they are effective, but because I don't want to), but it was extremely interesting and kept me engaged the entire time. I also REALLY enjoyed the writing style and hope Joshua Foer plans to write more in the future, because I am eager to read whatever it may be."
122,159420229X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/49415231-amir-tesla,3,"This is not a how-to book as I initially expected but teaches few techniques along the way. It's mostly about the author's quest towards US memory championship. An interesting read, but if you're seeking a manual for memory techniques, it wouldn't suit you. "
123,159420229X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2922699-genia-lukin,3,"Joshua Foer tackles in his book the issues of memory - how it is formed, how it has been lost, and how to improve it. Aside from the anecdotal - the rather interesting glimpse into the world of the mental athletes, amusing to me personally because of my familiarity with (and let's be frank here, membership in) the geeky society at large, Foer also presents the more general - research into memory and amnesia, as well as a historical perspective on the memorisation techniques and learning of the past.In my world, the world of religious Judaism, Torah readings, and extensive familiarity with texts, we still memorize a great deal. So I approached this book with a level of interest especially to the educational and historical aspects of the subject which Foer presents. I also enjoyed the cognitive, but the research he presents is one I am generally familiar with, and thus less interested in, when reading a presentation for the layman. Foer's research is generally good, though oftentimes insufficient. We get a slew of cognitive limitations and some exploration into amnesia - a very interesting chapter in and of itself - but not much about memory research beyond the very generic. We do not see some of the abnormal research into memory done on various sub-populations, except a tiny glimpse into savants, which are a somewhat different phenomenon, and even then the glimpse is mostly one of disillusionment.However, I can't help but agree with Foer intellectually when he makes his educational claims concerning the point that, for any person to think creatively and analytically, he first has to supply himself with basic facts which can be retrieved and analysed. If you do not know the basic material, the ground rules, or the structure of a subject, you then have nothing to analyse, nothing to expand upon, nothing to create with. If you can't remember the shape of an object you can't draw it, and if you can't remember the points of disagreement between two ideologies you cannot judge them.The parts pertaining to the memory sport itself, somehow, interested me less. It is still in the realm of the esoteric - as Foer himself claims - and card memorisation and the ability to recite long poems after fifteen minutes still would not help us - or him - find his car keys, Still, this is an interesting and important book, especially for people without the academic background, because it provides yet another glimpse into how our minds work, or don't work, and what we do, or don't do, with them."
124,159420229X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/80375046-shnila-parveen,2," In Plato’s Phaedrus, Socrates describes how the Egyptian god Theuth, inventor of writing, came to Thamus, the king of Egypt, and offered to bestow his wonderful invention upon the Egyptian people. “Here is a branch of learning that will ... improve their memories,” Theuth said to the Egyptian king. “My discovery provides a recipe for both memory and wisdom.” But Thamus was reluctant to accept the gift. “If men learn this, it will implant forgetfulness in their souls,” he told the god. “They will cease to exercise their memory and become forgetful; they will rely on that which is written, calling things to remembrance no longer from within themselves, but by means of external marks. What you have discovered is a recipe not for memory, but for reminding. And it is no true wisdom that you offer your disciples, but only its semblance, for by telling them of many things without teaching them anything, you will make them seem to know much, while for the most part they will know nothing. And as men filled not with wisdom but with the conceit of wisdom, they will be a burden to their fellow-men. What is the importance of memory in present times of technology making information available on our fingertips? Is it crucial for our cognitive capabilities or just futile endeavor? These are difficult questions that are not answered in this book. The author has however admitted that the memory hacks he learnt for the memory championships do not really improve the memory in general. After securing a good ranking in the European Memory Championship, Author forgot that he drove his car to the party celebrating his victory and took the Subway instead. There is no refuting the fact that the importance of human memory has marginalized in last couple of decades. One of the important reasons why I started writing reviews, first in private notes and then in Goodread is because I started to realize that I do not retain much from the books that I was reading. It seemed like an act of idle indulgence of absorbing someone else’s work without adding anything of my own. My views were there for a moment but would disappear as if I had none. By writing a review, I am not just an idle reader anymore but I am adding something of my own to the reading. Since I usually write my reviews after finishing the book, it also becomes an act of active recall, one of the memory techniques I believe works for me. For how long though, cannot be sure. Few year ago, I used to watch BBC’s Sherlock Holmes TV series where the lead character had mind palaces helping him recall the most miniscule things in excruciating detail. I presumed it as one of the quirks of the eccentric character. It was while reading this book that I got to know that memory palace is a legitimate and widely used memory hack, used by the participants of the memory championships. Although I don’t find a practical use of it in my day to day life. An interesting piece is on the analysis of Odyssey and Illiad. There are theories that claim that these famous poems were not written by one person but rather passed on years after years by way as loose collection of songs. The structure of poems is such that it seems to have been evolved for being memorized and later with the invention of writing, compiled together in its current form. The brain best remembers things that are repeated, rhythmic, rhyming, structured, and above all easily visualized. The only thing I did not like about this book is its deceptive title which would pass it of as a self-help book. This book is not a self-help book. Joshua Foer participated in US and European Memory Championship as part of his article in something called as participatory journalism. He met some unique set of people, discovered unusual things about memory and went on to win the memory championship. There are a lot of negative reviews about this book, which are accurate but are not substantial when you read this book with an open mind to learn something about an unusual subject. Memorizing has earned a bad reputation as an absence of real intellect and just a way to hold on to information for clearing the next exam. Its cause it not helped by the fact that the people with amazing memories have not made much in life and have resorted to self-help guru bluff. Memory does not help you become good at something. Instead mastering something breeds a better memory."

It never occurred to me that there was this kind of mental superpower that we could all have.Told by a journalist intrigued by memory competitions, Moonwalking with Einstein was simple and light to read. This was a story of his own journey into the world of mental athletes, and him taking a go at it himself.We are brought with him in his journey to find out what this is. Before the creation of the printing press, our world did not have the means we have today, to store our information. It was up to us to memorize what we learned especially if we wanted to pass it down onto the next generation. Tales and stories were made to keep these memories alive. Little did I know, that the small memory competitions today are so minuscule compared to the world before where memory palaces and techniques were as common as writing today.What is so empowering about this book is that he shows us, we can all create our own memory palaces if we would just put the time at it. We could know by heart the stories, the quotes, the places we would want to keep in our minds forever. I learned that memory is not a test of intellect but of creativity. We don’t have to be mental athletes who can memorize thousands of numbers or random words in minutes. But we can use these techniques for remembering the things we actually want to remember.Towards the end of the book, we are called on to remember because “how we perceive the world and act In it are products of how and what we remember”And if you feel daunted by the task to establish more memories, remember memory is not as much due to intellect as it is due to creativity. 4.5 Stars"

Moonwalking is really not that bad once you get past some utterly boring reportage about a group of obsessives who go in for memory competitions around the world. Foer initially covered one of these competitions as a reporter, became involved himself and determined to win the next year’s US competition. In the process, he delves into sometimes-amusing, but more often tedious, investigations into the place of memory in our society. There are some nice observations - on the difference between knowledge and memory, or about memory once being fundamental to the preservation of knowledge, but no longer being much needed in a literate society with an abundance of stored information (first on scrolls, then books, and now the Internet). But the book suffers from an overly-journalistic style and it reads like an extended magazine article. First-person investigational stuff with some random historical/scientific filler: easy to browse, easy to skip over; but don't look for anything about the art of how to put the memory techniques into practice (it’s apparently a well-known system called “Memory Palace”), this is just Foer’s experience of doing it. So, is it any use? Well Foer himself finds that memory-improving techniques are not much good for anything more than lists and succeeding at memory competitions.I certainly would not find memorizing “memorable” images any easier than remembering the facts themselves – holy crap, how much time and effort would it take to dream up the images, associate them somehow with the thing-to-be-remembered and then recall the connection later, so that one would remember the “thing” and not just the mental image?? In short, not really worth 200 pages. Two stars may sound a little mingy, but it’s ultimately a bit boring."

They do things like memorize 20thousand digits of pi or memorize the order of a deck of cards in a very short amount of time or memorize a long sequence of numbers or letters or words or pretty much anything for almost no reason at all. There's even something called the US Memory Championship (which the author won and that's not even really a spoiler) and also the World Memory Championship (in which Americans always do poorly, to my ever-expanding shame.)Foer escorts the reader on not only a stunt journalism-type memoir of his time training for and competing in these competitions, but also on a journey through the brain, in an Oliver Sacks-esque exploration of all the weird, quirky things a memory does or can do.Did you know that the guy from Rain Man is a real guy? You probably did. He is not the same person as Dustin Hoffman, though. He is his very own person and he is named Kim Peek and despite his ability to multiple huge numbers in his head and to calculate the dates of all the Easter Sundays in the history of Easter Sundays and despite his incredible memory, he had an IQ of only 87. And only just now am I realizing that Peek is now dead, which makes me sad. The point is, Peek was a savant, sometimes even called a megasavant, which is like a savant². Did you know there is another guy named Daniel Tammet who claims to be a megasavant but is probably just a faker?And now you, yes YOU, can fake being a savant if you read this book. You can learn how to construct imaginary things called memory palaces which will give you the incredible power of nigh-perfect memory. Do you want to be able to memorize the order of decks of playing cards? I don't know why you would—but the point is you can. "

So I was pretty shocked to find that this work has almost no ""how to"" information in it. It is mostly just a memoir of getting into a memory competition and what this competitive world looks like. It does convey a fascination with memory and was fairly fun to read anyway. It gets an extra star for what it helped motivate my father to accomplish. "
129,159420229X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4162390-lee,4,"I got to use the non-fiction tag! That shelf looks pretty bare.I saw this book appear in my feeds once and the title certainly caught my attention. This is a story about a journalists journey from reporting on the US and World memory competition one year, to competing in it the following year. In his first year reporting the event, Joshua Foer began to understand that all of the participants at the event weren't savants or incredibly smart, they pretty much all had a system that made remembering pi to the 2000 digit more of a trick than an IQ measure. Armed with this info, Joshua embarks on a journey to see if he can build a memory system to allow him to remember 100 names and faces, recall a deck of cards and report back, (I can't remember how many, ironic i know) a large number chain.THIS IS NOT A SELF HELP BOOK. If you are going to read this to learn how to become better at remembering names when going into meetings (this is me) you are not going to be taught how to do it. What this book does do is give you the history of memory systems, going way way back to the ancient Greeks. He interviews people from the US and the UK with all sorts of fascinating memory disorders, he covers how Tony Buzon has made over 300 million dollars in self help books, using memory techniques that have been around for thousands of years. Joshua spends time with a couple of memory champions and the begin to help him learn his system so that he can compete in the following years memory contest. The system is very simple, what isn't simple is the practice to make it work. So thankfully Foer doesn't spend too much time talking about practice, but he does give the strong impression that he is spending at least an hour a day memorising his system. A third of the way through the book, he does give an example how anyone can learn a system quickly. I was listening to this on audio (which is very well narrated, except for the typically poor english accent that Mike Chamberlain does) whilst driving and we are told how to use the 'loqi' or 'memory palace' to remember some random items. Now this part of the book was day one of a 4 day business trip, it was 6 days ago and I can still recall all ten items mentioned with no problem at all, including 'peat smoked salmon' and 'email Sophia'. My visualization of cottage cheese on the front door step of the house i grew up in is one I enjoy re-visualizing. It involves Nicole Kidman and thats about as much as I am going to divulge here.This is not a how to help improve your memory, but it does give you a big slice of the systems used and everything you would need to help you improve can be found on the mnemonics wiki site. I wasn't sure what to expect when reading this, I was happily surprised to have really enjoyed it. A very well written docu/journalistic article on memory, paced very well with some fascinating facts and figures. This book was much more than I had hoped for and so have no qualms about giving it 4 stars. "
130,159420229X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/38618130-azaa-kh,5,"A very misleading title, but the content was not a disappointment. ""Experience is the sum of our memories and wisdom the sum of our experiences"" If we follow this logic, we gain wisdom through our memories. And yet, memorization has been largely criticized by many school officials and educators that it kills creativity and critical thinking. But what this book points out, which I completely agree, is the fact that memorization is never really taught in schools. Instead, they make students memorize a bunch of unimportant facts through rote memorization without teaching how to retain the information, and that is what is corrupting our education system but not the memorization itself. In fact, the book reasons that learning and memorization come hand-in-hand, so you cannot get one without the other. This has completely changed my perspective on memorization.Another interesting fact pointed out in this book was that we can make our lives seem longer through varying our life experiences. This may sound contradictory at first because when we have fewer things to do, time does not seem to move at all. However, the study shows that it is the contrary: In 1962, a researcher named, Michel Siffre, conducted a self-experimentation by spending two months in a cave without access to a clock, calendars, or the Sun. As time went on, his memory deteriorated and lost track of the passage of time. After two months, when he finally got out of the cave, he thought that only a month had passed. This suggested the hypothesis that the less we experience, the shorter the time seems to fly, so according to this hypothesis, to stretch our psychological time, we will need to create new memories that play as anchor points in our lives.Last but not least, the book also illustrates how we attain new skills and reach beyond our limits. I personally think this was the most important topic discussed in this book. When we learn a new skill, we progress through three stages: cognitive stage, associative stage, and autonomous stage. The cognitive stage is where all the learning occurs and the skill is developed rapidly. In this stage, a person fully focuses on the task consciously and intellectually discovers new strategies to get the task done. But once we pass this stage and become good enough, what we do becomes so autonomous or unconscious that we do not even have to use our intellects anymore. This is what the book calls the OK plateau, the period in which we see almost no growth because we are merely following our unconscious process. So to go beyond our limits, we need to stay in the cognitive stage and continuously develop our capabilities. There's a saying ""Practice makes it perfect"", but how we practice is more important than the amount we practice, and only when it is the concentrated, self-conscious, and deliberated kind of practice, we will not be restrained by our limits anymore.Overall, I'd suggest this book for anyone who wants to improve their learning process.

131,159420229X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4252261-tom-la,4,"Truly excellent work of participatory journalism. The author set out to explore the world of ""memory competitions"", and from there he made himself the subject of a study on skills-improvement, to the point that he won a national memory competition. This book paints a high-level fresco on the subject of human memory: the history of how we recall things, how massively that has changed throughout the centuries, and how some ancient memory techniques (almost forgotten today) are surprisingly efficient still today, and available to anyone, not only for people with a ""strong memory"". - the topic is fascinating and important for our understanding of ourselves;- the book is well written, although a little too MalcolmGladwellesque at points (Oxf. cit. ""to write like Malcom Gladwell"" = to make a big entertaining fuss about something without actually saying much, and make it sound much more exciting than what it actually is through the use of anecdotes, humour and trivia)- I noticed some references to the content of ""Talent is overrated"" by Geoff Colvin, especially for what concerns the topic of skills improvement- some of the techniques described, like the ""memory palace"" technique, were new to me, and... well, unforgettable. Sorry, I was hoping I would get through this review without any stupid pun.- Daniel Tammet, the alleged savant author of ""Born on a blue day"", might be a complete or partial fraud. Difficult to prove, but Foer has a good point there.Important note: if you are looking for a book to teach you some memory techniques, this is probably not the best book for you, because this one includes many general explanations on various related topics and also some personal stories from the author's life. He does quote several other books that are specifically meant to teach memory techniques."

That might be where I previously read a chunk of this book when it came out in 2011, illustrating one of the memory principles it explains: our memories are great at recognizing things we've seen before, even if we wouldn't have been able to recall them otherwise.The title comes from the memory technique Foer learned to compete as a ""mental athlete"" after finding out such a thing existed in the course of researching an article he was writing. The technique is the memory palace, in which you attach vivid mental pictures to specific spots in a location you know well. To memorize esoteric things like the digits of pi or the order of a deck of cards, you first learn to give each digit or card a constant image you'll always associate with it (or three, as Foer learned from European competitors, who use POA - person, object, action).Like those long magazine articles, the book has layers - the memoir of how he went from regular guy to memory champion, the history and science of memory and memorization, and some specifics on how to actually use the techniques. These things are braided together, contributing to the reading experience of being pulled along through the book, but occasionally frustrating when I wanted a deeper dive into a specific, like in the chapter about memorizing poetry that almost seemed like it was going to tell me something new but switched to another strand right before the juicy part.The great takeaway from this book is that anyone can learn to use ancient techniques and take advantage of how our brains evolved to work. The focus of these memory competitors is trivial - who cares about the order of a deck of cards? - but the ideas in the book can be applied anywhere. "

At one point or another you can find me studying French, Japanese, or Swedish, and as many language students will tell you, learning that pesky grammar or vocabulary can be exhausting. You can be drilling the same set of words entire night, remember them for the next morning’s test, and then forget them completely by suppertime. To our great frustration, human brains are built to form only the fun, unique experiences into long-term memories, and to toss the mundane, boring, rarely-used stuff into the pits of obscurity.

Americans seldom win or place in the world memory championship. We have so much information at our fingertips, that we really do not use need to use our memory much at all in today’s world and seemingly find it ‘normal’ to lose words, names and events more frequently.

139,159420229X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/16275106-pamela,5,"Josh Foer was a 25-year-old college graduate working as a freelance journalist and living with his parents in his childhood home when he first began the research that eventually led to this book and took him on a personal odyssey on the nature of memory. It began casually with an internet search for the smartest person in the world until he found himself at the USA Memory Championship writing an article for Slate about this little known contest and the collection of memory wizards who participated in it. In the course of the next year, he was to meet a strange collection of American and European, as well as other International memory competitors and learn the secrets of their unique abilities that go all the way back to ancient Greece with only slight changes along the way to our own times. He was even to become a competitor himself but to find out how he did when he finally competed in the USA Championship you will have to read the book yourself.Moonwalking With Einstein is a fascinating look at the brain and how it stores memory. Foer touches on all known aspects of this from history and the whys and hows of oral history and the transmission of knowledge before reading and writing to the impact of Gutenberg on memory. He discusses some strange and bizarre brain problems that have unusual effects on memory and the various techniques that mnemonists use to help them make such amazing feats of memorization. Of particular interest is the memory palace. There is also an interesting discussion of the types of memory and what is known about how they work and why we can recite a complete and complicated piece of poetry but can't find our car keys or even remember where we parked the car in the first place. Or what we had for lunch yesterday or when Grandma's birthday is but can name all the Presidents in order. This was a terrific read but Einstein actually had nothing to do with it except as a memory picture. I thoroughly enjoyed it but don't ask me about it next week because I probably won't remember!"
140,159420229X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5650130-david-sheppard,5,"This is one of those rare books that is not only a joy to read, but also immensely helpful. It can help all of us with something that is at once troublesome and worrisome: our memory. It does this with ease, not teaching us some grueling rote memory technique, but one that is easy, natural and intuitive. Yet Moonwalking with Einstein turns out to not be exclusively a how-to book on memory. So what is it? Well, yes, it is about memory and how to improve it, but it is at once a history of techniques, a description of what memory is and what can go wrong with it, and also a running narrative of how the author, a journalist himself with no special memory skills, becomes one of the most proficient memory athletes in America. I'd learned a mnemonic device to aid memorization decades ago while in college, and found it to be helpful, but for some reason I'd abandoned the technique once I graduated. But Moonwalking with Einstein expands the mnemonic technique I learned back then by use of something of which I'd never heard: the ""Memory Palace."" The Memory Palace exploits our inherent skill for remembering images and spatial locations, harnesses these two abilities we all posses in abundance, and relates them to the memorization of numbers, lists and assortments of other difficult to remember items. The amazing thing is that the Memory Palace not only makes memorization easy, it also makes it fun. What makes the book so interesting is that it is narrative non-fiction and reads like a novel. The author locks his conflict with his own memory early on, gives a sense of rising tension as he accumulates the forces to overcome its limitations, and resolves this internal conflict at the end when he participates in the US Memory Championship. I didn't read it as urgently as I did today's number one bestseller, Laura Hillenbrand's Unbroken, but still, I couldn't put it down. In Chapter Five, I scanned the ""to-do"" list of fifteen items on pages 92/3 that the author had to memorize in his initial attempt, and developed the technique for myself as I read about the author memorizing it. As my Memory Palace, I used an old home of a high school friend with which I was still familiar, constructing useful details as I went. When I had finished reading about the author memorizing the list (took me about five minutes), I had memorized it myself, and I found that the items were not only immediately memorable, but that the list of items and their sequence was still with me days later, and so imbedded in my memory that I'm sure I'll ever forget it. All this, I accomplished effortlessly. This is a truly remarkable feat for me because I'm almost seventy years old and have chronic fatigue syndrome, which adversely affects all aspects of my memory. It has also given me hope that I might finally learn ancient Greek. I tried to learn it several years ago, but found building a vocabulary so difficult that I abandoned the project. Rote memory was just too much trouble. I am interested in all things Greek, and as it turns out, the Memory Palace technique was invented in the fifth century BC by Simonides following his narrow escape from the collapse of a building. This in itself is a story you'll be interested in reading about. The author says that since the time of this ancient Greek, ""the art of memory has been about creating architectural spaces in the imagination."" Having been to Greece twice and written a 480 page travel journal on the subject, (Oedipus On A Pale Horse: Greek Journey In Search Of A Personal Mythology) I have all the makings of a superb Greek Memory Palace. While traveling around Greece and the western coast of Turkey for ten weeks, I visited many cities and islands: Athens, Thebes, Delphi, Ithaca, Mykonos, Delos, Santorini, etc. I can't count all the archaeological sites I visited. What I'm creating isn't just any old Memory Palace but actually a Memory Country. Within each location, I can identify as many locations for storing words and meanings as I need. But not only that, I can also use characters from Greek mythology to create actions and images to reinforce the material, as the author suggests. All this constitutes my Greek Memory Palace: the location where I will store ancient Greek words and meanings as I learn the language, in accordance with the instructions learned in Moonwalking with Einstein. None of it was difficult. I picked it up as I read the book. The author describes how in the past people viewed their minds as something to perfect by loading it with all sorts of intellectual material. ""People used to labor to furnish their minds. They invested in the acquisition of memories the same way we invest in the acquisition of things."" [page 134] Some even believed that ""the art of memory was a secret key to unlocking the occult structure of the universe."" [page 151] This has given me an entirely new view of how to perceive my own mind and nourish it in the future. The author also discusses how we came to lose touch with our ability to remember with the invention of the printed word. The history of that estrangement and how inventions like Wikipedia and the Internet foster that estrangement is a very interesting story. The author makes the reader aware of what is happening to us and provides a way to project ourselves into the future without suffering so much of technology's debilitating effects. Perhaps the reason this book is so successful is that the reader never loses sight of the practical use of the information the author is providing because the author is discovering it himself and actively making use of it in his quest to make it into the US Memory Championship. This is an important book. Everyone can benefit from reading it. "

I had hoped to get more background information on the memory techniques, how our brain works, etc. but instead it there was too much information in it that I, personally, just did not find relevant. For example, I'm just not interested in the individual memory champions (if I were, I would read their memoirs), or that he asked Daniel Tammet what the number 9,412 looked to him three times. I get that Foer, a journalist, did this with the intention of finding truth and, possibly, debunking a fraud. Still, while I have no idea whether Tammet is a fraud or not, I can say that this and other behaviours and comments made Foer seem pretty annoying.In another review, I read that this book reads like an overlong magazine article and I guess that's true: it did feel pretty drawn out and like a magazine article that was watered down and stretched out so it could become a book.

The author's journey over the course of one year, from 'journalist scraping by' to America's National Memory Champion, is as exciting as it is informative. Highly recommend for anyone who want to learn about how to improve their memory, understand the research behind 'memory savants', or simply enjoy the unique story of the esoteric competitions between 'mental athletes'."

144,159420229X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/8187431-rade,4,"“Forgotten phone numbers and birthdays represent minor erosions of our everyday memory, but they are part of a much larger story of how we've supplanted our own natural memory with a vast superstructure of technological crutches—from the alphabet to the BlackBerry. These technologies of storing information outside our minds have helped make our modern world possible, but they've also changed how we think and how we use our brains.” I loved this book. Not because it offers insights to some unbelievable profound ideas but because it talks about our brains and how we use it to remember things. The thing about our brain is that it is a giant muscle and the more you work on it the bigger it gets. The bigger it gets, the more it remembers. The book is so much more than Foer's journey to understand what it means to be a mental athlete and eventually what it means to think in a way they do. It also goes back to a time when people like monks used various techniques to not only remember stuff short term, but to imprint it in their minds so they can recall it at any time, on any day, making writing new hymns and lectures easier. This was a time when technology was almost nonexistent. Books, while rare were also very hard to have at hand when searching religious text. When one had a copy, he would spend hours if not days going back and fourth trying to put together a sermon. This is one of the reasons people looked into ways of storing this type of information in their brain so life could be a bit easier. One of the techniques that these mental athletes use today is the whole idea of a memory palace, a way of dividing your brain into separate rooms in as many houses as possible and storing things in there so you can recall it later. The way one does it is not to say ""buy a new jacket"" as a to do item, but to make it as descriptive as possible. It is better to imagine an alligator wearing a warm jacket while fishing on a chilly winter day as that sticks better in your mind. Our minds are not bad at remembering but they are bad at recalling because remembering to buy bread and butter at a supermarket is something we did a hundred times therefore, it doesn't stick out, and it is pushed aside and eventually (in a week or even less), forgotten. Some people sometimes had to pray and beg for forgiveness when they found out that using sexual imagery helps them recall information better because it sticks faster. Now in order to remember that I have to buy yogurt, I just need to picture Megan Fox swimming in it while munching an all American burger and I am golden haha Seriously though, it takes a lot of practice and patience to do this type of thing. It is achievable but most people don't have the time or patience to do it. Foer did it but it did not come out of nowhere. He had a help of some of the people who competed in these mental athlete challenges and they pushed him and couched him on what to do and what not to do when one finds himself off track and wondering aimlessly around. SPOILER WARNING: At the end of the book Foer won this mental athlete event but he said that since we have so many ways of writing stuff down (especially phones as most people carry it on them all day long), this use of remembering stuff is not needed. It is nice but he said he does not use his mental techniques any more (at least not much) as we have other ways of keeping records and finding information that was once very hard to track down. Again, this is a great book and I really enjoyed it as the author did not just go into his life but set a bunch of chapters to discuss historical figures who used these types of techniques to make it easier to recall stuff during their every day activities. I kind of wish he went further into it but a succinct summery is better than no summary at all. "
145,159420229X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1231090-jud-barry,4,"You have to love a book written by someone who, fresh from winning the U.S. Memory Championship, takes mass transit home because he’s forgotten that he drove. He didn’t just forget where he parked—he forgot that he drove.In this inspiriting book, Joshua Foer shows how he — a person of decidedly unprodigious memory — learns some well-established mnemonic techniques, practices them for a half hour a day over the course of a year, and winds up winning the national memory contest (by, among other things, memorizing a deck of cards in record time).Along the way to the championship, Foer provides his own color commentary by discussing the phenomenon of memory — and by describing the lives of people who are real memory phenomena, like Kim “Rain Man” Peek, the savant who, despite having an I.Q. of just 87, absorbed information, retained it, and recalled it without effort; or the unnamed individual EP, afflicted with complete amnesia as a result of brain damage caused by herpes simplex.Even more colorful are the idiosyncratic “mental athletes” who steer Foer in the direction of the championship. Among them is Tony Buzan, the flamboyant minter of a “mind mapping” technique that, well, made him a mint and gave him grandiose ideas of reforming education.The techniques, it turns out, have been in use since antiquity. Before the ready availability of and access to books, learning involved training the memory to retrieve information. The ancient Greeks began to explore ways of using the capabilities of the brain to recall “architectural” memories as a means of building virtual “memory palaces” in the mind. These virtual buildings are where memories —often given arbitrary but colorful personalities and attributes — are stored for later retrieval.(One of the most fun aspects of the book is how Foer enlists the reader to use this technique to memorize a shopping list. Read this book and you will effortlessly—and probably forever—recall his list: pickled garlic, cottage cheese, peat-smoked salmon, 6 bottles of white wine, 3 pairs of socks, and email for Sophia.)The process requires focused effort and some creativity, and, when you think that what’s stored isn’t the raw memory itself but a tarted-up decoy that lures you to the place where the memory resides, not everyone has felt the extra baggage to be worth the effort. The Chinese, for example, were exposed to these techniques by Jesuit missionaries in the 16th century but decided that rote learning was “simpler and faster.”In ""Moonwalking with Einstein,"" Foer does a masterful job of using memory (or the lack of it) as the foil for an exploration not only the human brain but the human condition as well. What is consciousness? What is learning? What is creativity? How do we best educate ourselves? How does technology influence the ways in which we think about things, and how do the ways in which we think about things define us?And fortunately, if you don’t have the memory of a London cabdriver but need to navigate your way back to Giordano Bruno’s memory wheel, there is an index."

The case of someone who kept forgetting things the moment they happened (like in the movie Memento), along with the recent reports of Gabriel Garcia Marquez' dementia, also made me concerned about memory's place and role in our lives. The most interesting part for me was about the author voicing his doubts and laying his case over 'savant' Daniel Tammet, of Born on a Blue Day: Inside the Extraordinary Mind of an Autistic Savant. Then again, not that I really care enough about who's right and wrong in this case, since to me, the training required to develop the ability to remember like trained memory experts take out the joy in experiencing natural flow in life. Even as I frustrate over forgetting the most mundane stuff, it reminds me of my faults and to appreciate memories that stick naturally because I know they must've mattered to me, not because they're the after-effects of conscious stamping in my brain. Don't they have a saying, you live for the moments that take your breath away - it wouldn't be the same if those moments were due to you holding your breath would it? Remembering things because they're memorable as opposed to remembering by technique are sort of like that I think.I know I'm saying this because I still have a working and relatively healthy memory. It must be agonizing indeed to have memories slip out of you or your loved ones, but for such cases, I doubt if the techniques mentioned here apply.Definitely overhyped, but I don't feel it's an altogether wasted read either. Feels like a whitewashed Malcolm Gladwell, if you'd asked me. Maybe all journalists write in pretty similar styles?"
147,159420229X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3843117-ensiform,4,"In an instance of participatory journalism (don’t those always seem to lead to much-discussed books?), freelance writer Foer decides to enter the U.S. Memory Championships after covering the event. Under the tutelage of a British memory champ Ed Cook, Foer learns the tricks and techniques that most of the mental athletes use, such as the Major system of pegging letters to numbers, or the PAO system, in which the user associates two-digit numbers with memorable people and actions. Foer does more than just look behind the curtain at the Championships, though; he meets with Anders Ericsson of Florida State, who studies the development of expertise; he meets with Kim Peek, the inspiration for ‘Rain Man;’ he reads the ancients on memory, such as Simonides and his memory palace, or the Rhetorica ad Herennium, which gives tips on memorizing speeches using loci; he meets with guru/PR man Tony Buzan, who claims to help thousands with his Mind Mapping techniques; he reads old case studies, such as that of Russian journalist S who forgot almost nothing; he meets living case studies, such as E.P., who has no working memory.The book is a skilled synthesis of all things related to mnemonics and brain studies, a very readable introduction to the history of memory. Foer tells his story honestly – not always making himself look like the coolest guy in the room in the process – and with an engaging, comfortable prose style. He paces the story well, capping it with his unremarkable showing at the World Championships, but along the way tackles some subjects like a veteran journalist out to break a story: he’s not afraid to show the questionable side of Tony Buzan or supposed Asperger’s savant Daniel Tammet. It’s a compelling narrative as well as a fascinating overview of what we know about memory – and it offers several practical tips to improve the reader’s own memory. It’s well executed and, yes, memorable. "

149,159420229X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/28482493-angus-mckeogh,3,Extremely interesting. The memory is a fickle beast. And this memoir definitely revealed much more of the tricks and techniques that are used to memorize things. Possibly the most fascinating aspect of the book was when he discussed Daniel Tammet. Having already read the latter’s book about his “savant memory” it was incredible to learn Tammet was simply using the same techniques as these other memory performers. Sure wish I wouldn’t have used any space in my brain while reading Tammet’s book. Reminds me a bit of the James Frey debacle with A Million Little Pieces.
150,159420229X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2188450-andrea,4,"I started this one with somewhat lowered expectations, feeling like I was revisiting too-familiar territory. Being the clever woman I am, I had diagnosed a trend of immersive journalism about ""brain sports"" (I just made that term up), profiling the odd sort of people that tend to become obsessive about such things, and learning how to become obsessive oneself. And having spotted this trend, I was (of course) subsequently dismissive, skeptical that this book about memory competition would entertain me any more than similarly themed books like ""Word Freak"" by Stefan Fatsis (about Scrabble) and ""The Kings of New York"" by Michael Weinreb (Chess) already had. (I can't help but assume that, as a journalist, immersing oneself in competitive memory competition would be much more attractive than say, covering Afghanistan or playing for the Detroit Tigers, due to the substantially decreased risk of bodily harm). However, even though the premise was nothing new, I was very entertained by this book. Foer manages to find many fascinating things to say about something that is, at heart, just an extreme version of an everyday human activity - remembering shit. I found myself eager to come back to this book when I had to put it down, and excited to learn more about the subject."
151,159420229X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/26560507-heather,4,"I thoroughly enjoyed this book and couldn't wait to get back into it every time I had to step away. I don't know that it taught me very much (& I have no intention whatsoever to improve my memory using the tactics loosely outlined in this book - not because I don't believe they are effective, but because I don't want to), but it was extremely interesting and kept me engaged the entire time. I also REALLY enjoyed the writing style and hope Joshua Foer plans to write more in the future, because I am eager to read whatever it may be."
152,159420229X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/49415231-amir-tesla,3,"This is not a how-to book as I initially expected but teaches few techniques along the way. It's mostly about the author's quest towards US memory championship. An interesting read, but if you're seeking a manual for memory techniques, it wouldn't suit you. "
153,159420229X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2922699-genia-lukin,3,"Joshua Foer tackles in his book the issues of memory - how it is formed, how it has been lost, and how to improve it. Aside from the anecdotal - the rather interesting glimpse into the world of the mental athletes, amusing to me personally because of my familiarity with (and let's be frank here, membership in) the geeky society at large, Foer also presents the more general - research into memory and amnesia, as well as a historical perspective on the memorisation techniques and learning of the past.In my world, the world of religious Judaism, Torah readings, and extensive familiarity with texts, we still memorize a great deal. So I approached this book with a level of interest especially to the educational and historical aspects of the subject which Foer presents. I also enjoyed the cognitive, but the research he presents is one I am generally familiar with, and thus less interested in, when reading a presentation for the layman. Foer's research is generally good, though oftentimes insufficient. We get a slew of cognitive limitations and some exploration into amnesia - a very interesting chapter in and of itself - but not much about memory research beyond the very generic. We do not see some of the abnormal research into memory done on various sub-populations, except a tiny glimpse into savants, which are a somewhat different phenomenon, and even then the glimpse is mostly one of disillusionment.However, I can't help but agree with Foer intellectually when he makes his educational claims concerning the point that, for any person to think creatively and analytically, he first has to supply himself with basic facts which can be retrieved and analysed. If you do not know the basic material, the ground rules, or the structure of a subject, you then have nothing to analyse, nothing to expand upon, nothing to create with. If you can't remember the shape of an object you can't draw it, and if you can't remember the points of disagreement between two ideologies you cannot judge them.The parts pertaining to the memory sport itself, somehow, interested me less. It is still in the realm of the esoteric - as Foer himself claims - and card memorisation and the ability to recite long poems after fifteen minutes still would not help us - or him - find his car keys, Still, this is an interesting and important book, especially for people without the academic background, because it provides yet another glimpse into how our minds work, or don't work, and what we do, or don't do, with them."
154,159420229X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/80375046-shnila-parveen,2," In Plato’s Phaedrus, Socrates describes how the Egyptian god Theuth, inventor of writing, came to Thamus, the king of Egypt, and offered to bestow his wonderful invention upon the Egyptian people. “Here is a branch of learning that will ... improve their memories,” Theuth said to the Egyptian king. “My discovery provides a recipe for both memory and wisdom.” But Thamus was reluctant to accept the gift. “If men learn this, it will implant forgetfulness in their souls,” he told the god. “They will cease to exercise their memory and become forgetful; they will rely on that which is written, calling things to remembrance no longer from within themselves, but by means of external marks. What you have discovered is a recipe not for memory, but for reminding. And it is no true wisdom that you offer your disciples, but only its semblance, for by telling them of many things without teaching them anything, you will make them seem to know much, while for the most part they will know nothing. And as men filled not with wisdom but with the conceit of wisdom, they will be a burden to their fellow-men. What is the importance of memory in present times of technology making information available on our fingertips? Is it crucial for our cognitive capabilities or just futile endeavor? These are difficult questions that are not answered in this book. The author has however admitted that the memory hacks he learnt for the memory championships do not really improve the memory in general. After securing a good ranking in the European Memory Championship, Author forgot that he drove his car to the party celebrating his victory and took the Subway instead. There is no refuting the fact that the importance of human memory has marginalized in last couple of decades. One of the important reasons why I started writing reviews, first in private notes and then in Goodread is because I started to realize that I do not retain much from the books that I was reading. It seemed like an act of idle indulgence of absorbing someone else’s work without adding anything of my own. My views were there for a moment but would disappear as if I had none. By writing a review, I am not just an idle reader anymore but I am adding something of my own to the reading. Since I usually write my reviews after finishing the book, it also becomes an act of active recall, one of the memory techniques I believe works for me. For how long though, cannot be sure. Few year ago, I used to watch BBC’s Sherlock Holmes TV series where the lead character had mind palaces helping him recall the most miniscule things in excruciating detail. I presumed it as one of the quirks of the eccentric character. It was while reading this book that I got to know that memory palace is a legitimate and widely used memory hack, used by the participants of the memory championships. Although I don’t find a practical use of it in my day to day life. An interesting piece is on the analysis of Odyssey and Illiad. There are theories that claim that these famous poems were not written by one person but rather passed on years after years by way as loose collection of songs. The structure of poems is such that it seems to have been evolved for being memorized and later with the invention of writing, compiled together in its current form. The brain best remembers things that are repeated, rhythmic, rhyming, structured, and above all easily visualized. The only thing I did not like about this book is its deceptive title which would pass it of as a self-help book. This book is not a self-help book. Joshua Foer participated in US and European Memory Championship as part of his article in something called as participatory journalism. He met some unique set of people, discovered unusual things about memory and went on to win the memory championship. There are a lot of negative reviews about this book, which are accurate but are not substantial when you read this book with an open mind to learn something about an unusual subject. Memorizing has earned a bad reputation as an absence of real intellect and just a way to hold on to information for clearing the next exam. Its cause it not helped by the fact that the people with amazing memories have not made much in life and have resorted to self-help guru bluff. Memory does not help you become good at something. Instead mastering something breeds a better memory."

It never occurred to me that there was this kind of mental superpower that we could all have.Told by a journalist intrigued by memory competitions, Moonwalking with Einstein was simple and light to read. This was a story of his own journey into the world of mental athletes, and him taking a go at it himself.We are brought with him in his journey to find out what this is. Before the creation of the printing press, our world did not have the means we have today, to store our information. It was up to us to memorize what we learned especially if we wanted to pass it down onto the next generation. Tales and stories were made to keep these memories alive. Little did I know, that the small memory competitions today are so minuscule compared to the world before where memory palaces and techniques were as common as writing today.What is so empowering about this book is that he shows us, we can all create our own memory palaces if we would just put the time at it. We could know by heart the stories, the quotes, the places we would want to keep in our minds forever. I learned that memory is not a test of intellect but of creativity. We don’t have to be mental athletes who can memorize thousands of numbers or random words in minutes. But we can use these techniques for remembering the things we actually want to remember.Towards the end of the book, we are called on to remember because “how we perceive the world and act In it are products of how and what we remember”And if you feel daunted by the task to establish more memories, remember memory is not as much due to intellect as it is due to creativity. 4.5 Stars"

Moonwalking is really not that bad once you get past some utterly boring reportage about a group of obsessives who go in for memory competitions around the world. Foer initially covered one of these competitions as a reporter, became involved himself and determined to win the next year’s US competition. In the process, he delves into sometimes-amusing, but more often tedious, investigations into the place of memory in our society. There are some nice observations - on the difference between knowledge and memory, or about memory once being fundamental to the preservation of knowledge, but no longer being much needed in a literate society with an abundance of stored information (first on scrolls, then books, and now the Internet). But the book suffers from an overly-journalistic style and it reads like an extended magazine article. First-person investigational stuff with some random historical/scientific filler: easy to browse, easy to skip over; but don't look for anything about the art of how to put the memory techniques into practice (it’s apparently a well-known system called “Memory Palace”), this is just Foer’s experience of doing it. So, is it any use? Well Foer himself finds that memory-improving techniques are not much good for anything more than lists and succeeding at memory competitions.I certainly would not find memorizing “memorable” images any easier than remembering the facts themselves – holy crap, how much time and effort would it take to dream up the images, associate them somehow with the thing-to-be-remembered and then recall the connection later, so that one would remember the “thing” and not just the mental image?? In short, not really worth 200 pages. Two stars may sound a little mingy, but it’s ultimately a bit boring."

They do things like memorize 20thousand digits of pi or memorize the order of a deck of cards in a very short amount of time or memorize a long sequence of numbers or letters or words or pretty much anything for almost no reason at all. There's even something called the US Memory Championship (which the author won and that's not even really a spoiler) and also the World Memory Championship (in which Americans always do poorly, to my ever-expanding shame.)Foer escorts the reader on not only a stunt journalism-type memoir of his time training for and competing in these competitions, but also on a journey through the brain, in an Oliver Sacks-esque exploration of all the weird, quirky things a memory does or can do.Did you know that the guy from Rain Man is a real guy? You probably did. He is not the same person as Dustin Hoffman, though. He is his very own person and he is named Kim Peek and despite his ability to multiple huge numbers in his head and to calculate the dates of all the Easter Sundays in the history of Easter Sundays and despite his incredible memory, he had an IQ of only 87. And only just now am I realizing that Peek is now dead, which makes me sad. The point is, Peek was a savant, sometimes even called a megasavant, which is like a savant². Did you know there is another guy named Daniel Tammet who claims to be a megasavant but is probably just a faker?And now you, yes YOU, can fake being a savant if you read this book. You can learn how to construct imaginary things called memory palaces which will give you the incredible power of nigh-perfect memory.

That shelf looks pretty bare.I saw this book appear in my feeds once and the title certainly caught my attention. This is a story about a journalists journey from reporting on the US and World memory competition one year, to competing in it the following year. In his first year reporting the event, Joshua Foer began to understand that all of the participants at the event weren't savants or incredibly smart, they pretty much all had a system that made remembering pi to the 2000 digit more of a trick than an IQ measure. Armed with this info, Joshua embarks on a journey to see if he can build a memory system to allow him to remember 100 names and faces, recall a deck of cards and report back, (I can't remember how many, ironic i know) a large number chain.THIS IS NOT A SELF HELP BOOK. If you are going to read this to learn how to become better at remembering names when going into meetings (this is me) you are not going to be taught how to do it. What this book does do is give you the history of memory systems, going way way back to the ancient Greeks. He interviews people from the US and the UK with all sorts of fascinating memory disorders, he covers how Tony Buzon has made over 300 million dollars in self help books, using memory techniques that have been around for thousands of years. Joshua spends time with a couple of memory champions and the begin to help him learn his system so that he can compete in the following years memory contest. The system is very simple, what isn't simple is the practice to make it work. So thankfully Foer doesn't spend too much time talking about practice, but he does give the strong impression that he is spending at least an hour a day memorising his system. A third of the way through the book, he does give an example how anyone can learn a system quickly. I was listening to this on audio (which is very well narrated, except for the typically poor english accent that Mike Chamberlain does) whilst driving and we are told how to use the 'loqi' or 'memory palace' to remember some random items. Now this part of the book was day one of a 4 day business trip, it was 6 days ago and I can still recall all ten items mentioned with no problem at all, including 'peat smoked salmon' and 'email Sophia'. My visualization of cottage cheese on the front door step of the house i grew up in is one I enjoy re-visualizing. It involves Nicole Kidman and thats about as much as I am going to divulge here.This is not a how to help improve your memory, but it does give you a big slice of the systems used and everything you would need to help you improve can be found on the mnemonics wiki site. I wasn't sure what to expect when reading this, I was happily surprised to have really enjoyed it. A very well written docu/journalistic article on memory, paced very well with some fascinating facts and figures. This book was much more than I had hoped for and so have no qualms about giving it 4 stars. "
160,159420229X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/38618130-azaa-kh,5,"A very misleading title, but the content was not a disappointment. ""Experience is the sum of our memories and wisdom the sum of our experiences"" If we follow this logic, we gain wisdom through our memories. And yet, memorization has been largely criticized by many school officials and educators that it kills creativity and critical thinking. But what this book points out, which I completely agree, is the fact that memorization is never really taught in schools. Instead, they make students memorize a bunch of unimportant facts through rote memorization without teaching how to retain the information, and that is what is corrupting our education system but not the memorization itself. In fact, the book reasons that learning and memorization come hand-in-hand, so you cannot get one without the other. This has completely changed my perspective on memorization.Another interesting fact pointed out in this book was that we can make our lives seem longer through varying our life experiences. This may sound contradictory at first because when we have fewer things to do, time does not seem to move at all. However, the study shows that it is the contrary: In 1962, a researcher named, Michel Siffre, conducted a self-experimentation by spending two months in a cave without access to a clock, calendars, or the Sun. As time went on, his memory deteriorated and lost track of the passage of time. After two months, when he finally got out of the cave, he thought that only a month had passed. This suggested the hypothesis that the less we experience, the shorter the time seems to fly, so according to this hypothesis, to stretch our psychological time, we will need to create new memories that play as anchor points in our lives.Last but not least, the book also illustrates how we attain new skills and reach beyond our limits. I personally think this was the most important topic discussed in this book. When we learn a new skill, we progress through three stages: cognitive stage, associative stage, and autonomous stage. The cognitive stage is where all the learning occurs and the skill is developed rapidly. In this stage, a person fully focuses on the task consciously and intellectually discovers new strategies to get the task done. But once we pass this stage and become good enough, what we do becomes so autonomous or unconscious that we do not even have to use our intellects anymore. This is what the book calls the OK plateau, the period in which we see almost no growth because we are merely following our unconscious process. So to go beyond our limits, we need to stay in the cognitive stage and continuously develop our capabilities. There's a saying ""Practice makes it perfect"", but how we practice is more important than the amount we practice, and only when it is the concentrated, self-conscious, and deliberated kind of practice, we will not be restrained by our limits anymore.Overall, I'd suggest this book for anyone who wants to improve their learning process.

161,159420229X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4252261-tom-la,4,"Truly excellent work of participatory journalism. The author set out to explore the world of ""memory competitions"", and from there he made himself the subject of a study on skills-improvement, to the point that he won a national memory competition. This book paints a high-level fresco on the subject of human memory: the history of how we recall things, how massively that has changed throughout the centuries, and how some ancient memory techniques (almost forgotten today) are surprisingly efficient still today, and available to anyone, not only for people with a ""strong memory"". - the topic is fascinating and important for our understanding of ourselves;- the book is well written, although a little too MalcolmGladwellesque at points (Oxf. cit. ""to write like Malcom Gladwell"" = to make a big entertaining fuss about something without actually saying much, and make it sound much more exciting than what it actually is through the use of anecdotes, humour and trivia)- I noticed some references to the content of ""Talent is overrated"" by Geoff Colvin, especially for what concerns the topic of skills improvement- some of the techniques described, like the ""memory palace"" technique, were new to me, and... well, unforgettable. Sorry, I was hoping I would get through this review without any stupid pun.- Daniel Tammet, the alleged savant author of ""Born on a blue day"", might be a complete or partial fraud. Difficult to prove, but Foer has a good point there.Important note: if you are looking for a book to teach you some memory techniques, this is probably not the best book for you, because this one includes many general explanations on various related topics and also some personal stories from the author's life. He does quote several other books that are specifically meant to teach memory techniques."

That might be where I previously read a chunk of this book when it came out in 2011, illustrating one of the memory principles it explains: our memories are great at recognizing things we've seen before, even if we wouldn't have been able to recall them otherwise.The title comes from the memory technique Foer learned to compete as a ""mental athlete"" after finding out such a thing existed in the course of researching an article he was writing. The technique is the memory palace, in which you attach vivid mental pictures to specific spots in a location you know well. To memorize esoteric things like the digits of pi or the order of a deck of cards, you first learn to give each digit or card a constant image you'll always associate with it (or three, as Foer learned from European competitors, who use POA - person, object, action).Like those long magazine articles, the book has layers - the memoir of how he went from regular guy to memory champion, the history and science of memory and memorization, and some specifics on how to actually use the techniques. These things are braided together, contributing to the reading experience of being pulled along through the book, but occasionally frustrating when I wanted a deeper dive into a specific, like in the chapter about memorizing poetry that almost seemed like it was going to tell me something new but switched to another strand right before the juicy part.The great takeaway from this book is that anyone can learn to use ancient techniques and take advantage of how our brains evolved to work. The focus of these memory competitors is trivial - who cares about the order of a deck of cards? - but the ideas in the book can be applied anywhere. "
163,159420229X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1881113-andrea,5,"I picked up Joshua Foer’s intriguing study of memory and memory champions out of sheer curiosity. You see I am a big language enthusiast. At one point or another you can find me studying French, Japanese, or Swedish, and as many language students will tell you, learning that pesky grammar or vocabulary can be exhausting. You can be drilling the same set of words entire night, remember them for the next morning’s test, and then forget them completely by suppertime. To our great frustration, human brains are built to form only the fun, unique experiences into long-term memories, and to toss the mundane, boring, rarely-used stuff into the pits of obscurity. If you’ve seen Pixar’s Inside Out, you actually have a pretty good idea about the inner workings of human thought processes.Wouldn’t it be nice to find a book that would unlock the secrets of long-term memorization?Well, Moonwalking with Einstein is not....

The story for Joshua preparing for the Memory Championship is really interesting. All discoveries that he had made, special cases from people with extinguished memory, but very low IQ. Now the question is asked: Is memory trained or some brain disorders are responsible for ?Kim, savient with special abilities to remember dates, all history events, but IQ 87, and another example of Daniel still undiscovered type of ""savient"" or only hard memory training. I even wathed the documentary for Brainman. Neuroscience has still time to discover.At the end the most important are our memories. They make us human and define us.""Life seems to speed up as we get older because life gets less memorable as we get older. If to remember is to be human, then remembering means being more human."""

I thought Foer explained how we remember, the anomalies of savants and the history of human memory in a very readable, well documented manner. Have we come to a place of the end of memory? Americans seldom win or place in the world memory championship. We have so much information at our fingertips, that we really do not use need to use our memory much at all in today’s world and seemingly find it ‘normal’ to lose words, names and events more frequently. This book definitely got me thinking and I will be more mindful of my own memory......but I’m not likely to train to enter the Championship"

GAR!!Very insightful and useful - more useful than that dumb ""Mastermind: How to Think Like Sherlock Holmes"". I love learning more about how the mind works and even picking up on some helpful tips (though don't be confused: although it's placed in self-help, it's not strictly self-help).About the only bad is how dense it could get and how not useful memorizing random digits and cards are. I just can't help but wonder...why bother???"
168,159420229X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1289001-jen-knox,4,This book was well written and useful. All the useful tricks and background are frontloaded and the latter half is full of meanderings and perspectives on education techniques in general (which felt like a different book). The book inspired me to test my memory and exercise it more often. Now I just need help with ... recall. 
169,159420229X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/16275106-pamela,5,"Josh Foer was a 25-year-old college graduate working as a freelance journalist and living with his parents in his childhood home when he first began the research that eventually led to this book and took him on a personal odyssey on the nature of memory. It began casually with an internet search for the smartest person in the world until he found himself at the USA Memory Championship writing an article for Slate about this little known contest and the collection of memory wizards who participated in it. In the course of the next year, he was to meet a strange collection of American and European, as well as other International memory competitors and learn the secrets of their unique abilities that go all the way back to ancient Greece with only slight changes along the way to our own times. He was even to become a competitor himself but to find out how he did when he finally competed in the USA Championship you will have to read the book yourself.Moonwalking With Einstein is a fascinating look at the brain and how it stores memory. Foer touches on all known aspects of this from history and the whys and hows of oral history and the transmission of knowledge before reading and writing to the impact of Gutenberg on memory. He discusses some strange and bizarre brain problems that have unusual effects on memory and the various techniques that mnemonists use to help them make such amazing feats of memorization. Of particular interest is the memory palace. There is also an interesting discussion of the types of memory and what is known about how they work and why we can recite a complete and complicated piece of poetry but can't find our car keys or even remember where we parked the car in the first place. Or what we had for lunch yesterday or when Grandma's birthday is but can name all the Presidents in order. This was a terrific read but Einstein actually had nothing to do with it except as a memory picture. I thoroughly enjoyed it but don't ask me about it next week because I probably won't remember!"
170,159420229X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5650130-david-sheppard,5,"This is one of those rare books that is not only a joy to read, but also immensely helpful. It can help all of us with something that is at once troublesome and worrisome: our memory. It does this with ease, not teaching us some grueling rote memory technique, but one that is easy, natural and intuitive. Yet Moonwalking with Einstein turns out to not be exclusively a how-to book on memory. So what is it? Well, yes, it is about memory and how to improve it, but it is at once a history of techniques, a description of what memory is and what can go wrong with it, and also a running narrative of how the author, a journalist himself with no special memory skills, becomes one of the most proficient memory athletes in America. I'd learned a mnemonic device to aid memorization decades ago while in college, and found it to be helpful, but for some reason I'd abandoned the technique once I graduated. But Moonwalking with Einstein expands the mnemonic technique I learned back then by use of something of which I'd never heard: the ""Memory Palace."" The Memory Palace exploits our inherent skill for remembering images and spatial locations, harnesses these two abilities we all posses in abundance, and relates them to the memorization of numbers, lists and assortments of other difficult to remember items. The amazing thing is that the Memory Palace not only makes memorization easy, it also makes it fun. What makes the book so interesting is that it is narrative non-fiction and reads like a novel. The author locks his conflict with his own memory early on, gives a sense of rising tension as he accumulates the forces to overcome its limitations, and resolves this internal conflict at the end when he participates in the US Memory Championship. I didn't read it as urgently as I did today's number one bestseller, Laura Hillenbrand's Unbroken, but still, I couldn't put it down. In Chapter Five, I scanned the ""to-do"" list of fifteen items on pages 92/3 that the author had to memorize in his initial attempt, and developed the technique for myself as I read about the author memorizing it. As my Memory Palace, I used an old home of a high school friend with which I was still familiar, constructing useful details as I went. When I had finished reading about the author memorizing the list (took me about five minutes), I had memorized it myself, and I found that the items were not only immediately memorable, but that the list of items and their sequence was still with me days later, and so imbedded in my memory that I'm sure I'll ever forget it. All this, I accomplished effortlessly. This is a truly remarkable feat for me because I'm almost seventy years old and have chronic fatigue syndrome, which adversely affects all aspects of my memory. It has also given me hope that I might finally learn ancient Greek. I tried to learn it several years ago, but found building a vocabulary so difficult that I abandoned the project. Rote memory was just too much trouble. I am interested in all things Greek, and as it turns out, the Memory Palace technique was invented in the fifth century BC by Simonides following his narrow escape from the collapse of a building. This in itself is a story you'll be interested in reading about. The author says that since the time of this ancient Greek, ""the art of memory has been about creating architectural spaces in the imagination."" Having been to Greece twice and written a 480 page travel journal on the subject, (Oedipus On A Pale Horse: Greek Journey In Search Of A Personal Mythology) I have all the makings of a superb Greek Memory Palace. While traveling around Greece and the western coast of Turkey for ten weeks, I visited many cities and islands: Athens, Thebes, Delphi, Ithaca, Mykonos, Delos, Santorini, etc. I can't count all the archaeological sites I visited. What I'm creating isn't just any old Memory Palace but actually a Memory Country. Within each location, I can identify as many locations for storing words and meanings as I need. But not only that, I can also use characters from Greek mythology to create actions and images to reinforce the material, as the author suggests. All this constitutes my Greek Memory Palace: the location where I will store ancient Greek words and meanings as I learn the language, in accordance with the instructions learned in Moonwalking with Einstein. None of it was difficult. I picked it up as I read the book. The author describes how in the past people viewed their minds as something to perfect by loading it with all sorts of intellectual material. ""People used to labor to furnish their minds. They invested in the acquisition of memories the same way we invest in the acquisition of things."" [page 134] Some even believed that ""the art of memory was a secret key to unlocking the occult structure of the universe."" [page 151] This has given me an entirely new view of how to perceive my own mind and nourish it in the future. The author also discusses how we came to lose touch with our ability to remember with the invention of the printed word. The history of that estrangement and how inventions like Wikipedia and the Internet foster that estrangement is a very interesting story. The author makes the reader aware of what is happening to us and provides a way to project ourselves into the future without suffering so much of technology's debilitating effects. Perhaps the reason this book is so successful is that the reader never loses sight of the practical use of the information the author is providing because the author is discovering it himself and actively making use of it in his quest to make it into the US Memory Championship. This is an important book. Everyone can benefit from reading it. "
171,159420229X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/11652288-faye,2,"This was okay but if you know anything at all about memory techniques, you won't really find anything new here. I had hoped to get more background information on the memory techniques, how our brain works, etc. but instead it there was too much information in it that I, personally, just did not find relevant. For example, I'm just not interested in the individual memory champions (if I were, I would read their memoirs), or that he asked Daniel Tammet what the number 9,412 looked to him three times. I get that Foer, a journalist, did this with the intention of finding truth and, possibly, debunking a fraud. Still, while I have no idea whether Tammet is a fraud or not, I can say that this and other behaviours and comments made Foer seem pretty annoying.In another review, I read that this book reads like an overlong magazine article and I guess that's true: it did feel pretty drawn out and like a magazine article that was watered down and stretched out so it could become a book. Meh."

The author's journey over the course of one year, from 'journalist scraping by' to America's National Memory Champion, is as exciting as it is informative. Highly recommend for anyone who want to learn about how to improve their memory, understand the research behind 'memory savants', or simply enjoy the unique story of the esoteric competitions between 'mental athletes'."
173,159420229X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/63866052-noor,2,I’d rather drown in a lake than read this again. 
174,159420229X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/8187431-rade,4,"“Forgotten phone numbers and birthdays represent minor erosions of our everyday memory, but they are part of a much larger story of how we've supplanted our own natural memory with a vast superstructure of technological crutches—from the alphabet to the BlackBerry. These technologies of storing information outside our minds have helped make our modern world possible, but they've also changed how we think and how we use our brains.” I loved this book. Not because it offers insights to some unbelievable profound ideas but because it talks about our brains and how we use it to remember things. The thing about our brain is that it is a giant muscle and the more you work on it the bigger it gets. The bigger it gets, the more it remembers. The book is so much more than Foer's journey to understand what it means to be a mental athlete and eventually what it means to think in a way they do. It also goes back to a time when people like monks used various techniques to not only remember stuff short term, but to imprint it in their minds so they can recall it at any time, on any day, making writing new hymns and lectures easier. This was a time when technology was almost nonexistent. Books, while rare were also very hard to have at hand when searching religious text. When one had a copy, he would spend hours if not days going back and fourth trying to put together a sermon. This is one of the reasons people looked into ways of storing this type of information in their brain so life could be a bit easier. One of the techniques that these mental athletes use today is the whole idea of a memory palace, a way of dividing your brain into separate rooms in as many houses as possible and storing things in there so you can recall it later. The way one does it is not to say ""buy a new jacket"" as a to do item, but to make it as descriptive as possible. It is better to imagine an alligator wearing a warm jacket while fishing on a chilly winter day as that sticks better in your mind. Our minds are not bad at remembering but they are bad at recalling because remembering to buy bread and butter at a supermarket is something we did a hundred times therefore, it doesn't stick out, and it is pushed aside and eventually (in a week or even less), forgotten. Some people sometimes had to pray and beg for forgiveness when they found out that using sexual imagery helps them recall information better because it sticks faster. Now in order to remember that I have to buy yogurt, I just need to picture Megan Fox swimming in it while munching an all American burger and I am golden haha Seriously though, it takes a lot of practice and patience to do this type of thing. It is achievable but most people don't have the time or patience to do it. Foer did it but it did not come out of nowhere. He had a help of some of the people who competed in these mental athlete challenges and they pushed him and couched him on what to do and what not to do when one finds himself off track and wondering aimlessly around. SPOILER WARNING: At the end of the book Foer won this mental athlete event but he said that since we have so many ways of writing stuff down (especially phones as most people carry it on them all day long), this use of remembering stuff is not needed. It is nice but he said he does not use his mental techniques any more (at least not much) as we have other ways of keeping records and finding information that was once very hard to track down. Again, this is a great book and I really enjoyed it as the author did not just go into his life but set a bunch of chapters to discuss historical figures who used these types of techniques to make it easier to recall stuff during their every day activities. I kind of wish he went further into it but a succinct summery is better than no summary at all. "
175,159420229X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1231090-jud-barry,4,"You have to love a book written by someone who, fresh from winning the U.S. Memory Championship, takes mass transit home because he’s forgotten that he drove. He didn’t just forget where he parked—he forgot that he drove.In this inspiriting book, Joshua Foer shows how he — a person of decidedly unprodigious memory — learns some well-established mnemonic techniques, practices them for a half hour a day over the course of a year, and winds up winning the national memory contest (by, among other things, memorizing a deck of cards in record time).Along the way to the championship, Foer provides his own color commentary by discussing the phenomenon of memory — and by describing the lives of people who are real memory phenomena, like Kim “Rain Man” Peek, the savant who, despite having an I.Q. of just 87, absorbed information, retained it, and recalled it without effort; or the unnamed individual EP, afflicted with complete amnesia as a result of brain damage caused by herpes simplex.Even more colorful are the idiosyncratic “mental athletes” who steer Foer in the direction of the championship. Among them is Tony Buzan, the flamboyant minter of a “mind mapping” technique that, well, made him a mint and gave him grandiose ideas of reforming education.The techniques, it turns out, have been in use since antiquity. Before the ready availability of and access to books, learning involved training the memory to retrieve information. The ancient Greeks began to explore ways of using the capabilities of the brain to recall “architectural” memories as a means of building virtual “memory palaces” in the mind. These virtual buildings are where memories —often given arbitrary but colorful personalities and attributes — are stored for later retrieval.(One of the most fun aspects of the book is how Foer enlists the reader to use this technique to memorize a shopping list. Read this book and you will effortlessly—and probably forever—recall his list: pickled garlic, cottage cheese, peat-smoked salmon, 6 bottles of white wine, 3 pairs of socks, and email for Sophia.)The process requires focused effort and some creativity, and, when you think that what’s stored isn’t the raw memory itself but a tarted-up decoy that lures you to the place where the memory resides, not everyone has felt the extra baggage to be worth the effort. The Chinese, for example, were exposed to these techniques by Jesuit missionaries in the 16th century but decided that rote learning was “simpler and faster.”In ""Moonwalking with Einstein,"" Foer does a masterful job of using memory (or the lack of it) as the foil for an exploration not only the human brain but the human condition as well. What is consciousness? What is learning? What is creativity? How do we best educate ourselves? How does technology influence the ways in which we think about things, and how do the ways in which we think about things define us?And fortunately, if you don’t have the memory of a London cabdriver but need to navigate your way back to Giordano Bruno’s memory wheel, there is an index."

The case of someone who kept forgetting things the moment they happened (like in the movie Memento), along with the recent reports of Gabriel Garcia Marquez' dementia, also made me concerned about memory's place and role in our lives. The most interesting part for me was about the author voicing his doubts and laying his case over 'savant' Daniel Tammet, of Born on a Blue Day: Inside the Extraordinary Mind of an Autistic Savant. Then again, not that I really care enough about who's right and wrong in this case, since to me, the training required to develop the ability to remember like trained memory experts take out the joy in experiencing natural flow in life. Even as I frustrate over forgetting the most mundane stuff, it reminds me of my faults and to appreciate memories that stick naturally because I know they must've mattered to me, not because they're the after-effects of conscious stamping in my brain. Don't they have a saying, you live for the moments that take your breath away - it wouldn't be the same if those moments were due to you holding your breath would it? Remembering things because they're memorable as opposed to remembering by technique are sort of like that I think.I know I'm saying this because I still have a working and relatively healthy memory. It must be agonizing indeed to have memories slip out of you or your loved ones, but for such cases, I doubt if the techniques mentioned here apply.Definitely overhyped, but I don't feel it's an altogether wasted read either. Feels like a whitewashed Malcolm Gladwell, if you'd asked me. Maybe all journalists write in pretty similar styles?"

Under the tutelage of a British memory champ Ed Cook, Foer learns the tricks and techniques that most of the mental athletes use, such as the Major system of pegging letters to numbers, or the PAO system, in which the user associates two-digit numbers with memorable people and actions. Foer does more than just look behind the curtain at the Championships, though; he meets with Anders Ericsson of Florida State, who studies the development of expertise; he meets with Kim Peek, the inspiration for ‘Rain Man;’ he reads the ancients on memory, such as Simonides and his memory palace, or the Rhetorica ad Herennium, which gives tips on memorizing speeches using loci; he meets with guru/PR man Tony Buzan, who claims to help thousands with his Mind Mapping techniques; he reads old case studies, such as that of Russian journalist S who forgot almost nothing; he meets living case studies, such as E.P., who has no working memory.The book is a skilled synthesis of all things related to mnemonics and brain studies, a very readable introduction to the history of memory. Foer tells his story honestly – not always making himself look like the coolest guy in the room in the process – and with an engaging, comfortable prose style. He paces the story well, capping it with his unremarkable showing at the World Championships, but along the way tackles some subjects like a veteran journalist out to break a story: he’s not afraid to show the questionable side of Tony Buzan or supposed Asperger’s savant Daniel Tammet. It’s a compelling narrative as well as a fascinating overview of what we know about memory – and it offers several practical tips to improve the reader’s own memory. It’s well executed and, yes, memorable. "

179,159420229X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/28482493-angus-mckeogh,3,Extremely interesting. The memory is a fickle beast. And this memoir definitely revealed much more of the tricks and techniques that are used to memorize things. Possibly the most fascinating aspect of the book was when he discussed Daniel Tammet. Having already read the latter’s book about his “savant memory” it was incredible to learn Tammet was simply using the same techniques as these other memory performers. Sure wish I wouldn’t have used any space in my brain while reading Tammet’s book. Reminds me a bit of the James Frey debacle with A Million Little Pieces.
180,159420229X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2188450-andrea,4,"I started this one with somewhat lowered expectations, feeling like I was revisiting too-familiar territory. Being the clever woman I am, I had diagnosed a trend of immersive journalism about ""brain sports"" (I just made that term up), profiling the odd sort of people that tend to become obsessive about such things, and learning how to become obsessive oneself. And having spotted this trend, I was (of course) subsequently dismissive, skeptical that this book about memory competition would entertain me any more than similarly themed books like ""Word Freak"" by Stefan Fatsis (about Scrabble) and ""The Kings of New York"" by Michael Weinreb (Chess) already had. (I can't help but assume that, as a journalist, immersing oneself in competitive memory competition would be much more attractive than say, covering Afghanistan or playing for the Detroit Tigers, due to the substantially decreased risk of bodily harm). However, even though the premise was nothing new, I was very entertained by this book. Foer manages to find many fascinating things to say about something that is, at heart, just an extreme version of an everyday human activity - remembering shit. I found myself eager to come back to this book when I had to put it down, and excited to learn more about the subject."
181,159420229X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/26560507-heather,4,"I thoroughly enjoyed this book and couldn't wait to get back into it every time I had to step away. I don't know that it taught me very much (& I have no intention whatsoever to improve my memory using the tactics loosely outlined in this book - not because I don't believe they are effective, but because I don't want to), but it was extremely interesting and kept me engaged the entire time. I also REALLY enjoyed the writing style and hope Joshua Foer plans to write more in the future, because I am eager to read whatever it may be."

It's mostly about the author's quest towards US memory championship. An interesting read, but if you're seeking a manual for memory techniques, it wouldn't suit you. "
183,159420229X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2922699-genia-lukin,3,"Joshua Foer tackles in his book the issues of memory - how it is formed, how it has been lost, and how to improve it. Aside from the anecdotal - the rather interesting glimpse into the world of the mental athletes, amusing to me personally because of my familiarity with (and let's be frank here, membership in) the geeky society at large, Foer also presents the more general - research into memory and amnesia, as well as a historical perspective on the memorisation techniques and learning of the past.In my world, the world of religious Judaism, Torah readings, and extensive familiarity with texts, we still memorize a great deal. So I approached this book with a level of interest especially to the educational and historical aspects of the subject which Foer presents. I also enjoyed the cognitive, but the research he presents is one I am generally familiar with, and thus less interested in, when reading a presentation for the layman. Foer's research is generally good, though oftentimes insufficient. We get a slew of cognitive limitations and some exploration into amnesia - a very interesting chapter in and of itself - but not much about memory research beyond the very generic. We do not see some of the abnormal research into memory done on various sub-populations, except a tiny glimpse into savants, which are a somewhat different phenomenon, and even then the glimpse is mostly one of disillusionment.However, I can't help but agree with Foer intellectually when he makes his educational claims concerning the point that, for any person to think creatively and analytically, he first has to supply himself with basic facts which can be retrieved and analysed. If you do not know the basic material, the ground rules, or the structure of a subject, you then have nothing to analyse, nothing to expand upon, nothing to create with. If you can't remember the shape of an object you can't draw it, and if you can't remember the points of disagreement between two ideologies you cannot judge them.The parts pertaining to the memory sport itself, somehow, interested me less. It is still in the realm of the esoteric - as Foer himself claims - and card memorisation and the ability to recite long poems after fifteen minutes still would not help us - or him - find his car keys, Still, this is an interesting and important book, especially for people without the academic background, because it provides yet another glimpse into how our minds work, or don't work, and what we do, or don't do, with them."
184,159420229X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/80375046-shnila-parveen,2," In Plato’s Phaedrus, Socrates describes how the Egyptian god Theuth, inventor of writing, came to Thamus, the king of Egypt, and offered to bestow his wonderful invention upon the Egyptian people. “Here is a branch of learning that will ... improve their memories,” Theuth said to the Egyptian king. “My discovery provides a recipe for both memory and wisdom.” But Thamus was reluctant to accept the gift. “If men learn this, it will implant forgetfulness in their souls,” he told the god. “They will cease to exercise their memory and become forgetful; they will rely on that which is written, calling things to remembrance no longer from within themselves, but by means of external marks. What you have discovered is a recipe not for memory, but for reminding. And it is no true wisdom that you offer your disciples, but only its semblance, for by telling them of many things without teaching them anything, you will make them seem to know much, while for the most part they will know nothing. And as men filled not with wisdom but with the conceit of wisdom, they will be a burden to their fellow-men. What is the importance of memory in present times of technology making information available on our fingertips? Is it crucial for our cognitive capabilities or just futile endeavor? These are difficult questions that are not answered in this book. The author has however admitted that the memory hacks he learnt for the memory championships do not really improve the memory in general. After securing a good ranking in the European Memory Championship, Author forgot that he drove his car to the party celebrating his victory and took the Subway instead. There is no refuting the fact that the importance of human memory has marginalized in last couple of decades. One of the important reasons why I started writing reviews, first in private notes and then in Goodread is because I started to realize that I do not retain much from the books that I was reading. It seemed like an act of idle indulgence of absorbing someone else’s work without adding anything of my own. My views were there for a moment but would disappear as if I had none. By writing a review, I am not just an idle reader anymore but I am adding something of my own to the reading. Since I usually write my reviews after finishing the book, it also becomes an act of active recall, one of the memory techniques I believe works for me. For how long though, cannot be sure. Few year ago, I used to watch BBC’s Sherlock Holmes TV series where the lead character had mind palaces helping him recall the most miniscule things in excruciating detail. I presumed it as one of the quirks of the eccentric character. It was while reading this book that I got to know that memory palace is a legitimate and widely used memory hack, used by the participants of the memory championships. Although I don’t find a practical use of it in my day to day life. An interesting piece is on the analysis of Odyssey and Illiad. There are theories that claim that these famous poems were not written by one person but rather passed on years after years by way as loose collection of songs. The structure of poems is such that it seems to have been evolved for being memorized and later with the invention of writing, compiled together in its current form. The brain best remembers things that are repeated, rhythmic, rhyming, structured, and above all easily visualized. The only thing I did not like about this book is its deceptive title which would pass it of as a self-help book. This book is not a self-help book. Joshua Foer participated in US and European Memory Championship as part of his article in something called as participatory journalism. He met some unique set of people, discovered unusual things about memory and went on to win the memory championship. There are a lot of negative reviews about this book, which are accurate but are not substantial when you read this book with an open mind to learn something about an unusual subject. Memorizing has earned a bad reputation as an absence of real intellect and just a way to hold on to information for clearing the next exam. Its cause it not helped by the fact that the people with amazing memories have not made much in life and have resorted to self-help guru bluff. Memory does not help you become good at something. Instead mastering something breeds a better memory."

It never occurred to me that there was this kind of mental superpower that we could all have.Told by a journalist intrigued by memory competitions, Moonwalking with Einstein was simple and light to read. This was a story of his own journey into the world of mental athletes, and him taking a go at it himself.We are brought with him in his journey to find out what this is. Before the creation of the printing press, our world did not have the means we have today, to store our information. It was up to us to memorize what we learned especially if we wanted to pass it down onto the next generation. Tales and stories were made to keep these memories alive. Little did I know, that the small memory competitions today are so minuscule compared to the world before where memory palaces and techniques were as common as writing today.What is so empowering about this book is that he shows us, we can all create our own memory palaces if we would just put the time at it. We could know by heart the stories, the quotes, the places we would want to keep in our minds forever. I learned that memory is not a test of intellect but of creativity. We don’t have to be mental athletes who can memorize thousands of numbers or random words in minutes. But we can use these techniques for remembering the things we actually want to remember.Towards the end of the book, we are called on to remember because “how we perceive the world and act In it are products of how and what we remember”And if you feel daunted by the task to establish more memories, remember memory is not as much due to intellect as it is due to creativity. 4.5 Stars"

Moonwalking is really not that bad once you get past some utterly boring reportage about a group of obsessives who go in for memory competitions around the world. Foer initially covered one of these competitions as a reporter, became involved himself and determined to win the next year’s US competition. In the process, he delves into sometimes-amusing, but more often tedious, investigations into the place of memory in our society. There are some nice observations - on the difference between knowledge and memory, or about memory once being fundamental to the preservation of knowledge, but no longer being much needed in a literate society with an abundance of stored information (first on scrolls, then books, and now the Internet). But the book suffers from an overly-journalistic style and it reads like an extended magazine article. First-person investigational stuff with some random historical/scientific filler: easy to browse, easy to skip over; but don't look for anything about the art of how to put the memory techniques into practice (it’s apparently a well-known system called “Memory Palace”), this is just Foer’s experience of doing it. So, is it any use? Well Foer himself finds that memory-improving techniques are not much good for anything more than lists and succeeding at memory competitions.I certainly would not find memorizing “memorable” images any easier than remembering the facts themselves – holy crap, how much time and effort would it take to dream up the images, associate them somehow with the thing-to-be-remembered and then recall the connection later, so that one would remember the “thing” and not just the mental image?? In short, not really worth 200 pages. Two stars may sound a little mingy, but it’s ultimately a bit boring."

They do things like memorize 20thousand digits of pi or memorize the order of a deck of cards in a very short amount of time or memorize a long sequence of numbers or letters or words or pretty much anything for almost no reason at all. There's even something called the US Memory Championship (which the author won and that's not even really a spoiler) and also the World Memory Championship (in which Americans always do poorly, to my ever-expanding shame.)Foer escorts the reader on not only a stunt journalism-type memoir of his time training for and competing in these competitions, but also on a journey through the brain, in an Oliver Sacks-esque exploration of all the weird, quirky things a memory does or can do.Did you know that the guy from Rain Man is a real guy? You probably did. He is not the same person as Dustin Hoffman, though. He is his very own person and he is named Kim Peek and despite his ability to multiple huge numbers in his head and to calculate the dates of all the Easter Sundays in the history of Easter Sundays and despite his incredible memory, he had an IQ of only 87. And only just now am I realizing that Peek is now dead, which makes me sad. The point is, Peek was a savant, sometimes even called a megasavant, which is like a savant². Did you know there is another guy named Daniel Tammet who claims to be a megasavant but is probably just a faker?And now you, yes YOU, can fake being a savant if you read this book. You can learn how to construct imaginary things called memory palaces which will give you the incredible power of nigh-perfect memory. Do you want to be able to memorize the order of decks of playing cards? I don't know why you would—but the point is you can. "

So I was pretty shocked to find that this work has almost no ""how to"" information in it. It is mostly just a memoir of getting into a memory competition and what this competitive world looks like. It does convey a fascination with memory and was fairly fun to read anyway. It gets an extra star for what it helped motivate my father to accomplish. "
189,159420229X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4162390-lee,4,"I got to use the non-fiction tag! That shelf looks pretty bare.I saw this book appear in my feeds once and the title certainly caught my attention. This is a story about a journalists journey from reporting on the US and World memory competition one year, to competing in it the following year. In his first year reporting the event, Joshua Foer began to understand that all of the participants at the event weren't savants or incredibly smart, they pretty much all had a system that made remembering pi to the 2000 digit more of a trick than an IQ measure. Armed with this info, Joshua embarks on a journey to see if he can build a memory system to allow him to remember 100 names and faces, recall a deck of cards and report back, (I can't remember how many, ironic i know) a large number chain.THIS IS NOT A SELF HELP BOOK. If you are going to read this to learn how to become better at remembering names when going into meetings (this is me) you are not going to be taught how to do it. What this book does do is give you the history of memory systems, going way way back to the ancient Greeks. He interviews people from the US and the UK with all sorts of fascinating memory disorders, he covers how Tony Buzon has made over 300 million dollars in self help books, using memory techniques that have been around for thousands of years. Joshua spends time with a couple of memory champions and the begin to help him learn his system so that he can compete in the following years memory contest. The system is very simple, what isn't simple is the practice to make it work. So thankfully Foer doesn't spend too much time talking about practice, but he does give the strong impression that he is spending at least an hour a day memorising his system. A third of the way through the book, he does give an example how anyone can learn a system quickly. I was listening to this on audio (which is very well narrated, except for the typically poor english accent that Mike Chamberlain does) whilst driving and we are told how to use the 'loqi' or 'memory palace' to remember some random items. Now this part of the book was day one of a 4 day business trip, it was 6 days ago and I can still recall all ten items mentioned with no problem at all, including 'peat smoked salmon' and 'email Sophia'. My visualization of cottage cheese on the front door step of the house i grew up in is one I enjoy re-visualizing. It involves Nicole Kidman and thats about as much as I am going to divulge here.This is not a how to help improve your memory, but it does give you a big slice of the systems used and everything you would need to help you improve can be found on the mnemonics wiki site. I wasn't sure what to expect when reading this, I was happily surprised to have really enjoyed it. A very well written docu/journalistic article on memory, paced very well with some fascinating facts and figures. This book was much more than I had hoped for and so have no qualms about giving it 4 stars. "
190,159420229X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/38618130-azaa-kh,5,"A very misleading title, but the content was not a disappointment. ""Experience is the sum of our memories and wisdom the sum of our experiences"" If we follow this logic, we gain wisdom through our memories. And yet, memorization has been largely criticized by many school officials and educators that it kills creativity and critical thinking. But what this book points out, which I completely agree, is the fact that memorization is never really taught in schools. Instead, they make students memorize a bunch of unimportant facts through rote memorization without teaching how to retain the information, and that is what is corrupting our education system but not the memorization itself. In fact, the book reasons that learning and memorization come hand-in-hand, so you cannot get one without the other. This has completely changed my perspective on memorization.Another interesting fact pointed out in this book was that we can make our lives seem longer through varying our life experiences. This may sound contradictory at first because when we have fewer things to do, time does not seem to move at all. However, the study shows that it is the contrary: In 1962, a researcher named, Michel Siffre, conducted a self-experimentation by spending two months in a cave without access to a clock, calendars, or the Sun. As time went on, his memory deteriorated and lost track of the passage of time. After two months, when he finally got out of the cave, he thought that only a month had passed. This suggested the hypothesis that the less we experience, the shorter the time seems to fly, so according to this hypothesis, to stretch our psychological time, we will need to create new memories that play as anchor points in our lives.Last but not least, the book also illustrates how we attain new skills and reach beyond our limits. I personally think this was the most important topic discussed in this book. When we learn a new skill, we progress through three stages: cognitive stage, associative stage, and autonomous stage. The cognitive stage is where all the learning occurs and the skill is developed rapidly. In this stage, a person fully focuses on the task consciously and intellectually discovers new strategies to get the task done. But once we pass this stage and become good enough, what we do becomes so autonomous or unconscious that we do not even have to use our intellects anymore. This is what the book calls the OK plateau, the period in which we see almost no growth because we are merely following our unconscious process. So to go beyond our limits, we need to stay in the cognitive stage and continuously develop our capabilities. There's a saying ""Practice makes it perfect"", but how we practice is more important than the amount we practice, and only when it is the concentrated, self-conscious, and deliberated kind of practice, we will not be restrained by our limits anymore.Overall, I'd suggest this book for anyone who wants to improve their learning process.

191,159420229X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4252261-tom-la,4,"Truly excellent work of participatory journalism. The author set out to explore the world of ""memory competitions"", and from there he made himself the subject of a study on skills-improvement, to the point that he won a national memory competition. This book paints a high-level fresco on the subject of human memory: the history of how we recall things, how massively that has changed throughout the centuries, and how some ancient memory techniques (almost forgotten today) are surprisingly efficient still today, and available to anyone, not only for people with a ""strong memory"". - the topic is fascinating and important for our understanding of ourselves;- the book is well written, although a little too MalcolmGladwellesque at points (Oxf. cit. ""to write like Malcom Gladwell"" = to make a big entertaining fuss about something without actually saying much, and make it sound much more exciting than what it actually is through the use of anecdotes, humour and trivia)- I noticed some references to the content of ""Talent is overrated"" by Geoff Colvin, especially for what concerns the topic of skills improvement- some of the techniques described, like the ""memory palace"" technique, were new to me, and... well, unforgettable. Sorry, I was hoping I would get through this review without any stupid pun.- Daniel Tammet, the alleged savant author of ""Born on a blue day"", might be a complete or partial fraud. Difficult to prove, but Foer has a good point there.Important note: if you are looking for a book to teach you some memory techniques, this is probably not the best book for you, because this one includes many general explanations on various related topics and also some personal stories from the author's life. He does quote several other books that are specifically meant to teach memory techniques."
192,159420229X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/159421-shan,4,"Interesting and fun to read, like a longer version of the long-form journalism you find in magazines like the New Yorker. That might be where I previously read a chunk of this book when it came out in 2011, illustrating one of the memory principles it explains: our memories are great at recognizing things we've seen before, even if we wouldn't have been able to recall them otherwise.The title comes from the memory technique Foer learned to compete as a ""mental athlete"" after finding out such a thing existed in the course of researching an article he was writing. The technique is the memory palace, in which you attach vivid mental pictures to specific spots in a location you know well. To memorize esoteric things like the digits of pi or the order of a deck of cards, you first learn to give each digit or card a constant image you'll always associate with it (or three, as Foer learned from European competitors, who use POA - person, object, action).Like those long magazine articles, the book has layers - the memoir of how he went from regular guy to memory champion, the history and science of memory and memorization, and some specifics on how to actually use the techniques. These things are braided together, contributing to the reading experience of being pulled along through the book, but occasionally frustrating when I wanted a deeper dive into a specific, like in the chapter about memorizing poetry that almost seemed like it was going to tell me something new but switched to another strand right before the juicy part.The great takeaway from this book is that anyone can learn to use ancient techniques and take advantage of how our brains evolved to work. The focus of these memory competitors is trivial - who cares about the order of a deck of cards? - but the ideas in the book can be applied anywhere. "

You can be drilling the same set of words entire night, remember them for the next morning’s test, and then forget them completely by suppertime. To our great frustration, human brains are built to form only the fun, unique experiences into long-term memories, and to toss the mundane, boring, rarely-used stuff into the pits of obscurity.

It began casually with an internet search for the smartest person in the world until he found himself at the USA Memory Championship writing an article for Slate about this little known contest and the collection of memory wizards who participated in it. In the course of the next year, he was to meet a strange collection of American and European, as well as other International memory competitors and learn the secrets of their unique abilities that go all the way back to ancient Greece with only slight changes along the way to our own times. He was even to become a competitor himself but to find out how he did when he finally competed in the USA Championship you will have to read the book yourself.Moonwalking With Einstein is a fascinating look at the brain and how it stores memory. Foer touches on all known aspects of this from history and the whys and hows of oral history and the transmission of knowledge before reading and writing to the impact of Gutenberg on memory. He discusses some strange and bizarre brain problems that have unusual effects on memory and the various techniques that mnemonists use to help them make such amazing feats of memorization. Of particular interest is the memory palace. There is also an interesting discussion of the types of memory and what is known about how they work and why we can recite a complete and complicated piece of poetry but can't find our car keys or even remember where we parked the car in the first place. Or what we had for lunch yesterday or when Grandma's birthday is but can name all the Presidents in order. This was a terrific read but Einstein actually had nothing to do with it except as a memory picture. I thoroughly enjoyed it but don't ask me about it next week because I probably won't remember!"
200,159420229X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5650130-david-sheppard,5,"This is one of those rare books that is not only a joy to read, but also immensely helpful. It can help all of us with something that is at once troublesome and worrisome: our memory. It does this with ease, not teaching us some grueling rote memory technique, but one that is easy, natural and intuitive. Yet Moonwalking with Einstein turns out to not be exclusively a how-to book on memory. So what is it? Well, yes, it is about memory and how to improve it, but it is at once a history of techniques, a description of what memory is and what can go wrong with it, and also a running narrative of how the author, a journalist himself with no special memory skills, becomes one of the most proficient memory athletes in America. I'd learned a mnemonic device to aid memorization decades ago while in college, and found it to be helpful, but for some reason I'd abandoned the technique once I graduated. But Moonwalking with Einstein expands the mnemonic technique I learned back then by use of something of which I'd never heard: the ""Memory Palace."" The Memory Palace exploits our inherent skill for remembering images and spatial locations, harnesses these two abilities we all posses in abundance, and relates them to the memorization of numbers, lists and assortments of other difficult to remember items. The amazing thing is that the Memory Palace not only makes memorization easy, it also makes it fun. What makes the book so interesting is that it is narrative non-fiction and reads like a novel. The author locks his conflict with his own memory early on, gives a sense of rising tension as he accumulates the forces to overcome its limitations, and resolves this internal conflict at the end when he participates in the US Memory Championship. I didn't read it as urgently as I did today's number one bestseller, Laura Hillenbrand's Unbroken, but still, I couldn't put it down. In Chapter Five, I scanned the ""to-do"" list of fifteen items on pages 92/3 that the author had to memorize in his initial attempt, and developed the technique for myself as I read about the author memorizing it. As my Memory Palace, I used an old home of a high school friend with which I was still familiar, constructing useful details as I went. When I had finished reading about the author memorizing the list (took me about five minutes), I had memorized it myself, and I found that the items were not only immediately memorable, but that the list of items and their sequence was still with me days later, and so imbedded in my memory that I'm sure I'll ever forget it. All this, I accomplished effortlessly. This is a truly remarkable feat for me because I'm almost seventy years old and have chronic fatigue syndrome, which adversely affects all aspects of my memory. It has also given me hope that I might finally learn ancient Greek. I tried to learn it several years ago, but found building a vocabulary so difficult that I abandoned the project. Rote memory was just too much trouble. I am interested in all things Greek, and as it turns out, the Memory Palace technique was invented in the fifth century BC by Simonides following his narrow escape from the collapse of a building. This in itself is a story you'll be interested in reading about. The author says that since the time of this ancient Greek, ""the art of memory has been about creating architectural spaces in the imagination."" Having been to Greece twice and written a 480 page travel journal on the subject, (Oedipus On A Pale Horse: Greek Journey In Search Of A Personal Mythology) I have all the makings of a superb Greek Memory Palace. While traveling around Greece and the western coast of Turkey for ten weeks, I visited many cities and islands: Athens, Thebes, Delphi, Ithaca, Mykonos, Delos, Santorini, etc. I can't count all the archaeological sites I visited. What I'm creating isn't just any old Memory Palace but actually a Memory Country. Within each location, I can identify as many locations for storing words and meanings as I need. But not only that, I can also use characters from Greek mythology to create actions and images to reinforce the material, as the author suggests. All this constitutes my Greek Memory Palace: the location where I will store ancient Greek words and meanings as I learn the language, in accordance with the instructions learned in Moonwalking with Einstein. None of it was difficult. I picked it up as I read the book. The author describes how in the past people viewed their minds as something to perfect by loading it with all sorts of intellectual material. ""People used to labor to furnish their minds. They invested in the acquisition of memories the same way we invest in the acquisition of things."" [page 134] Some even believed that ""the art of memory was a secret key to unlocking the occult structure of the universe."" [page 151] This has given me an entirely new view of how to perceive my own mind and nourish it in the future. The author also discusses how we came to lose touch with our ability to remember with the invention of the printed word. The history of that estrangement and how inventions like Wikipedia and the Internet foster that estrangement is a very interesting story. The author makes the reader aware of what is happening to us and provides a way to project ourselves into the future without suffering so much of technology's debilitating effects. Perhaps the reason this book is so successful is that the reader never loses sight of the practical use of the information the author is providing because the author is discovering it himself and actively making use of it in his quest to make it into the US Memory Championship. This is an important book. Everyone can benefit from reading it. "

I had hoped to get more background information on the memory techniques, how our brain works, etc. but instead it there was too much information in it that I, personally, just did not find relevant. For example, I'm just not interested in the individual memory champions (if I were, I would read their memoirs), or that he asked Daniel Tammet what the number 9,412 looked to him three times. I get that Foer, a journalist, did this with the intention of finding truth and, possibly, debunking a fraud. Still, while I have no idea whether Tammet is a fraud or not, I can say that this and other behaviours and comments made Foer seem pretty annoying.In another review, I read that this book reads like an overlong magazine article and I guess that's true: it did feel pretty drawn out and like a magazine article that was watered down and stretched out so it could become a book. Meh."
202,159420229X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/72796908-daniel-hageman,5,"Easily one of the best books I've read in a long time, dispelling the myths of 'photographic memory' and instead highlighting the very real and equally exciting truths of memory expertise, truths that Joshua Foer was certainly not alone in judging with intuitive skepticism. The author's journey over the course of one year, from 'journalist scraping by' to America's National Memory Champion, is as exciting as it is informative. Highly recommend for anyone who want to learn about how to improve their memory, understand the research behind 'memory savants', or simply enjoy the unique story of the esoteric competitions between 'mental athletes'."
203,159420229X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/63866052-noor,2,I’d rather drown in a lake than read this again. 
204,159420229X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/8187431-rade,4,"“Forgotten phone numbers and birthdays represent minor erosions of our everyday memory, but they are part of a much larger story of how we've supplanted our own natural memory with a vast superstructure of technological crutches—from the alphabet to the BlackBerry. These technologies of storing information outside our minds have helped make our modern world possible, but they've also changed how we think and how we use our brains.” I loved this book. Not because it offers insights to some unbelievable profound ideas but because it talks about our brains and how we use it to remember things. The thing about our brain is that it is a giant muscle and the more you work on it the bigger it gets. The bigger it gets, the more it remembers. The book is so much more than Foer's journey to understand what it means to be a mental athlete and eventually what it means to think in a way they do. It also goes back to a time when people like monks used various techniques to not only remember stuff short term, but to imprint it in their minds so they can recall it at any time, on any day, making writing new hymns and lectures easier. This was a time when technology was almost nonexistent. Books, while rare were also very hard to have at hand when searching religious text. When one had a copy, he would spend hours if not days going back and fourth trying to put together a sermon. This is one of the reasons people looked into ways of storing this type of information in their brain so life could be a bit easier. One of the techniques that these mental athletes use today is the whole idea of a memory palace, a way of dividing your brain into separate rooms in as many houses as possible and storing things in there so you can recall it later. The way one does it is not to say ""buy a new jacket"" as a to do item, but to make it as descriptive as possible. It is better to imagine an alligator wearing a warm jacket while fishing on a chilly winter day as that sticks better in your mind. Our minds are not bad at remembering but they are bad at recalling because remembering to buy bread and butter at a supermarket is something we did a hundred times therefore, it doesn't stick out, and it is pushed aside and eventually (in a week or even less), forgotten. Some people sometimes had to pray and beg for forgiveness when they found out that using sexual imagery helps them recall information better because it sticks faster. Now in order to remember that I have to buy yogurt, I just need to picture Megan Fox swimming in it while munching an all American burger and I am golden haha Seriously though, it takes a lot of practice and patience to do this type of thing. It is achievable but most people don't have the time or patience to do it. Foer did it but it did not come out of nowhere. He had a help of some of the people who competed in these mental athlete challenges and they pushed him and couched him on what to do and what not to do when one finds himself off track and wondering aimlessly around. SPOILER WARNING: At the end of the book Foer won this mental athlete event but he said that since we have so many ways of writing stuff down (especially phones as most people carry it on them all day long), this use of remembering stuff is not needed. It is nice but he said he does not use his mental techniques any more (at least not much) as we have other ways of keeping records and finding information that was once very hard to track down. Again, this is a great book and I really enjoyed it as the author did not just go into his life but set a bunch of chapters to discuss historical figures who used these types of techniques to make it easier to recall stuff during their every day activities. I kind of wish he went further into it but a succinct summery is better than no summary at all. "
205,159420229X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1231090-jud-barry,4,"You have to love a book written by someone who, fresh from winning the U.S. Memory Championship, takes mass transit home because he’s forgotten that he drove. He didn’t just forget where he parked—he forgot that he drove.In this inspiriting book, Joshua Foer shows how he — a person of decidedly unprodigious memory — learns some well-established mnemonic techniques, practices them for a half hour a day over the course of a year, and winds up winning the national memory contest (by, among other things, memorizing a deck of cards in record time).Along the way to the championship, Foer provides his own color commentary by discussing the phenomenon of memory — and by describing the lives of people who are real memory phenomena, like Kim “Rain Man” Peek, the savant who, despite having an I.Q. of just 87, absorbed information, retained it, and recalled it without effort; or the unnamed individual EP, afflicted with complete amnesia as a result of brain damage caused by herpes simplex.Even more colorful are the idiosyncratic “mental athletes” who steer Foer in the direction of the championship. Among them is Tony Buzan, the flamboyant minter of a “mind mapping” technique that, well, made him a mint and gave him grandiose ideas of reforming education.The techniques, it turns out, have been in use since antiquity. Before the ready availability of and access to books, learning involved training the memory to retrieve information. The ancient Greeks began to explore ways of using the capabilities of the brain to recall “architectural” memories as a means of building virtual “memory palaces” in the mind. These virtual buildings are where memories —often given arbitrary but colorful personalities and attributes — are stored for later retrieval.(One of the most fun aspects of the book is how Foer enlists the reader to use this technique to memorize a shopping list. Read this book and you will effortlessly—and probably forever—recall his list: pickled garlic, cottage cheese, peat-smoked salmon, 6 bottles of white wine, 3 pairs of socks, and email for Sophia.)The process requires focused effort and some creativity, and, when you think that what’s stored isn’t the raw memory itself but a tarted-up decoy that lures you to the place where the memory resides, not everyone has felt the extra baggage to be worth the effort. The Chinese, for example, were exposed to these techniques by Jesuit missionaries in the 16th century but decided that rote learning was “simpler and faster.”In ""Moonwalking with Einstein,"" Foer does a masterful job of using memory (or the lack of it) as the foil for an exploration not only the human brain but the human condition as well. What is consciousness? What is learning? What is creativity? How do we best educate ourselves? How does technology influence the ways in which we think about things, and how do the ways in which we think about things define us?And fortunately, if you don’t have the memory of a London cabdriver but need to navigate your way back to Giordano Bruno’s memory wheel, there is an index."
206,159420229X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/8606081-shanghao,3,"A light, fun read, albeit a little too 'normal' to be memorable.Tells the experiences of a journalist who, in the process of researching on a memory championship event, delved head-first into the world of mnemonics.Several simple techniques were introduced, and it does seem as if anyone is capable of becoming mnemonic experts with enough sustained practice. The case of someone who kept forgetting things the moment they happened (like in the movie Memento), along with the recent reports of Gabriel Garcia Marquez' dementia, also made me concerned about memory's place and role in our lives. The most interesting part for me was about the author voicing his doubts and laying his case over 'savant' Daniel Tammet, of Born on a Blue Day: Inside the Extraordinary Mind of an Autistic Savant. Then again, not that I really care enough about who's right and wrong in this case, since to me, the training required to develop the ability to remember like trained memory experts take out the joy in experiencing natural flow in life. Even as I frustrate over forgetting the most mundane stuff, it reminds me of my faults and to appreciate memories that stick naturally because I know they must've mattered to me, not because they're the after-effects of conscious stamping in my brain. Don't they have a saying, you live for the moments that take your breath away - it wouldn't be the same if those moments were due to you holding your breath would it? Remembering things because they're memorable as opposed to remembering by technique are sort of like that I think.I know I'm saying this because I still have a working and relatively healthy memory. It must be agonizing indeed to have memories slip out of you or your loved ones, but for such cases, I doubt if the techniques mentioned here apply.Definitely overhyped, but I don't feel it's an altogether wasted read either. Feels like a whitewashed Malcolm Gladwell, if you'd asked me. Maybe all journalists write in pretty similar styles?"
207,159420229X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3843117-ensiform,4,"In an instance of participatory journalism (don’t those always seem to lead to much-discussed books?), freelance writer Foer decides to enter the U.S. Memory Championships after covering the event. Under the tutelage of a British memory champ Ed Cook, Foer learns the tricks and techniques that most of the mental athletes use, such as the Major system of pegging letters to numbers, or the PAO system, in which the user associates two-digit numbers with memorable people and actions. Foer does more than just look behind the curtain at the Championships, though; he meets with Anders Ericsson of Florida State, who studies the development of expertise; he meets with Kim Peek, the inspiration for ‘Rain Man;’ he reads the ancients on memory, such as Simonides and his memory palace, or the Rhetorica ad Herennium, which gives tips on memorizing speeches using loci; he meets with guru/PR man Tony Buzan, who claims to help thousands with his Mind Mapping techniques; he reads old case studies, such as that of Russian journalist S who forgot almost nothing; he meets living case studies, such as E.P., who has no working memory.The book is a skilled synthesis of all things related to mnemonics and brain studies, a very readable introduction to the history of memory. Foer tells his story honestly – not always making himself look like the coolest guy in the room in the process – and with an engaging, comfortable prose style. He paces the story well, capping it with his unremarkable showing at the World Championships, but along the way tackles some subjects like a veteran journalist out to break a story: he’s not afraid to show the questionable side of Tony Buzan or supposed Asperger’s savant Daniel Tammet. It’s a compelling narrative as well as a fascinating overview of what we know about memory – and it offers several practical tips to improve the reader’s own memory. It’s well executed and, yes, memorable. "

209,159420229X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/28482493-angus-mckeogh,3,Extremely interesting. The memory is a fickle beast. And this memoir definitely revealed much more of the tricks and techniques that are used to memorize things. Possibly the most fascinating aspect of the book was when he discussed Daniel Tammet. Having already read the latter’s book about his “savant memory” it was incredible to learn Tammet was simply using the same techniques as these other memory performers. Sure wish I wouldn’t have used any space in my brain while reading Tammet’s book. Reminds me a bit of the James Frey debacle with A Million Little Pieces.
210,159420229X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2188450-andrea,4,"I started this one with somewhat lowered expectations, feeling like I was revisiting too-familiar territory. Being the clever woman I am, I had diagnosed a trend of immersive journalism about ""brain sports"" (I just made that term up), profiling the odd sort of people that tend to become obsessive about such things, and learning how to become obsessive oneself. And having spotted this trend, I was (of course) subsequently dismissive, skeptical that this book about memory competition would entertain me any more than similarly themed books like ""Word Freak"" by Stefan Fatsis (about Scrabble) and ""The Kings of New York"" by Michael Weinreb (Chess) already had. (I can't help but assume that, as a journalist, immersing oneself in competitive memory competition would be much more attractive than say, covering Afghanistan or playing for the Detroit Tigers, due to the substantially decreased risk of bodily harm). However, even though the premise was nothing new, I was very entertained by this book. Foer manages to find many fascinating things to say about something that is, at heart, just an extreme version of an everyday human activity - remembering shit. I found myself eager to come back to this book when I had to put it down, and excited to learn more about the subject."
211,159420229X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/26560507-heather,4,"I thoroughly enjoyed this book and couldn't wait to get back into it every time I had to step away. I don't know that it taught me very much (& I have no intention whatsoever to improve my memory using the tactics loosely outlined in this book - not because I don't believe they are effective, but because I don't want to), but it was extremely interesting and kept me engaged the entire time. I also REALLY enjoyed the writing style and hope Joshua Foer plans to write more in the future, because I am eager to read whatever it may be."
212,159420229X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/49415231-amir-tesla,3,"This is not a how-to book as I initially expected but teaches few techniques along the way. It's mostly about the author's quest towards US memory championship. An interesting read, but if you're seeking a manual for memory techniques, it wouldn't suit you. "
213,159420229X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2922699-genia-lukin,3,"Joshua Foer tackles in his book the issues of memory - how it is formed, how it has been lost, and how to improve it. Aside from the anecdotal - the rather interesting glimpse into the world of the mental athletes, amusing to me personally because of my familiarity with (and let's be frank here, membership in) the geeky society at large, Foer also presents the more general - research into memory and amnesia, as well as a historical perspective on the memorisation techniques and learning of the past.In my world, the world of religious Judaism, Torah readings, and extensive familiarity with texts, we still memorize a great deal. So I approached this book with a level of interest especially to the educational and historical aspects of the subject which Foer presents. I also enjoyed the cognitive, but the research he presents is one I am generally familiar with, and thus less interested in, when reading a presentation for the layman. Foer's research is generally good, though oftentimes insufficient. We get a slew of cognitive limitations and some exploration into amnesia - a very interesting chapter in and of itself - but not much about memory research beyond the very generic. We do not see some of the abnormal research into memory done on various sub-populations, except a tiny glimpse into savants, which are a somewhat different phenomenon, and even then the glimpse is mostly one of disillusionment.However, I can't help but agree with Foer intellectually when he makes his educational claims concerning the point that, for any person to think creatively and analytically, he first has to supply himself with basic facts which can be retrieved and analysed. If you do not know the basic material, the ground rules, or the structure of a subject, you then have nothing to analyse, nothing to expand upon, nothing to create with. If you can't remember the shape of an object you can't draw it, and if you can't remember the points of disagreement between two ideologies you cannot judge them.The parts pertaining to the memory sport itself, somehow, interested me less. It is still in the realm of the esoteric - as Foer himself claims - and card memorisation and the ability to recite long poems after fifteen minutes still would not help us - or him - find his car keys, Still, this is an interesting and important book, especially for people without the academic background, because it provides yet another glimpse into how our minds work, or don't work, and what we do, or don't do, with them."
214,159420229X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/80375046-shnila-parveen,2," In Plato’s Phaedrus, Socrates describes how the Egyptian god Theuth, inventor of writing, came to Thamus, the king of Egypt, and offered to bestow his wonderful invention upon the Egyptian people. “Here is a branch of learning that will ... improve their memories,” Theuth said to the Egyptian king. “My discovery provides a recipe for both memory and wisdom.” But Thamus was reluctant to accept the gift. “If men learn this, it will implant forgetfulness in their souls,” he told the god. “They will cease to exercise their memory and become forgetful; they will rely on that which is written, calling things to remembrance no longer from within themselves, but by means of external marks. What you have discovered is a recipe not for memory, but for reminding. And it is no true wisdom that you offer your disciples, but only its semblance, for by telling them of many things without teaching them anything, you will make them seem to know much, while for the most part they will know nothing. And as men filled not with wisdom but with the conceit of wisdom, they will be a burden to their fellow-men. What is the importance of memory in present times of technology making information available on our fingertips? Is it crucial for our cognitive capabilities or just futile endeavor? These are difficult questions that are not answered in this book. The author has however admitted that the memory hacks he learnt for the memory championships do not really improve the memory in general. After securing a good ranking in the European Memory Championship, Author forgot that he drove his car to the party celebrating his victory and took the Subway instead. There is no refuting the fact that the importance of human memory has marginalized in last couple of decades. One of the important reasons why I started writing reviews, first in private notes and then in Goodread is because I started to realize that I do not retain much from the books that I was reading. It seemed like an act of idle indulgence of absorbing someone else’s work without adding anything of my own. My views were there for a moment but would disappear as if I had none. By writing a review, I am not just an idle reader anymore but I am adding something of my own to the reading. Since I usually write my reviews after finishing the book, it also becomes an act of active recall, one of the memory techniques I believe works for me. For how long though, cannot be sure. Few year ago, I used to watch BBC’s Sherlock Holmes TV series where the lead character had mind palaces helping him recall the most miniscule things in excruciating detail. I presumed it as one of the quirks of the eccentric character. It was while reading this book that I got to know that memory palace is a legitimate and widely used memory hack, used by the participants of the memory championships. Although I don’t find a practical use of it in my day to day life. An interesting piece is on the analysis of Odyssey and Illiad. There are theories that claim that these famous poems were not written by one person but rather passed on years after years by way as loose collection of songs. The structure of poems is such that it seems to have been evolved for being memorized and later with the invention of writing, compiled together in its current form. The brain best remembers things that are repeated, rhythmic, rhyming, structured, and above all easily visualized. The only thing I did not like about this book is its deceptive title which would pass it of as a self-help book. This book is not a self-help book. Joshua Foer participated in US and European Memory Championship as part of his article in something called as participatory journalism. He met some unique set of people, discovered unusual things about memory and went on to win the memory championship. There are a lot of negative reviews about this book, which are accurate but are not substantial when you read this book with an open mind to learn something about an unusual subject. Memorizing has earned a bad reputation as an absence of real intellect and just a way to hold on to information for clearing the next exam. Its cause it not helped by the fact that the people with amazing memories have not made much in life and have resorted to self-help guru bluff. Memory does not help you become good at something. Instead mastering something breeds a better memory."

It never occurred to me that there was this kind of mental superpower that we could all have.Told by a journalist intrigued by memory competitions, Moonwalking with Einstein was simple and light to read. This was a story of his own journey into the world of mental athletes, and him taking a go at it himself.We are brought with him in his journey to find out what this is. Before the creation of the printing press, our world did not have the means we have today, to store our information. It was up to us to memorize what we learned especially if we wanted to pass it down onto the next generation. Tales and stories were made to keep these memories alive. Little did I know, that the small memory competitions today are so minuscule compared to the world before where memory palaces and techniques were as common as writing today.What is so empowering about this book is that he shows us, we can all create our own memory palaces if we would just put the time at it. We could know by heart the stories, the quotes, the places we would want to keep in our minds forever. I learned that memory is not a test of intellect but of creativity. We don’t have to be mental athletes who can memorize thousands of numbers or random words in minutes. But we can use these techniques for remembering the things we actually want to remember.Towards the end of the book, we are called on to remember because “how we perceive the world and act In it are products of how and what we remember”And if you feel daunted by the task to establish more memories, remember memory is not as much due to intellect as it is due to creativity. 4.5 Stars"

Moonwalking is really not that bad once you get past some utterly boring reportage about a group of obsessives who go in for memory competitions around the world. Foer initially covered one of these competitions as a reporter, became involved himself and determined to win the next year’s US competition. In the process, he delves into sometimes-amusing, but more often tedious, investigations into the place of memory in our society. There are some nice observations - on the difference between knowledge and memory, or about memory once being fundamental to the preservation of knowledge, but no longer being much needed in a literate society with an abundance of stored information (first on scrolls, then books, and now the Internet). But the book suffers from an overly-journalistic style and it reads like an extended magazine article. First-person investigational stuff with some random historical/scientific filler: easy to browse, easy to skip over; but don't look for anything about the art of how to put the memory techniques into practice (it’s apparently a well-known system called “Memory Palace”), this is just Foer’s experience of doing it. So, is it any use? Well Foer himself finds that memory-improving techniques are not much good for anything more than lists and succeeding at memory competitions.I certainly would not find memorizing “memorable” images any easier than remembering the facts themselves – holy crap, how much time and effort would it take to dream up the images, associate them somehow with the thing-to-be-remembered and then recall the connection later, so that one would remember the “thing” and not just the mental image?? In short, not really worth 200 pages. Two stars may sound a little mingy, but it’s ultimately a bit boring."

They do things like memorize 20thousand digits of pi or memorize the order of a deck of cards in a very short amount of time or memorize a long sequence of numbers or letters or words or pretty much anything for almost no reason at all. There's even something called the US Memory Championship (which the author won and that's not even really a spoiler) and also the World Memory Championship (in which Americans always do poorly, to my ever-expanding shame.)Foer escorts the reader on not only a stunt journalism-type memoir of his time training for and competing in these competitions, but also on a journey through the brain, in an Oliver Sacks-esque exploration of all the weird, quirky things a memory does or can do.Did you know that the guy from Rain Man is a real guy? You probably did. He is not the same person as Dustin Hoffman, though. He is his very own person and he is named Kim Peek and despite his ability to multiple huge numbers in his head and to calculate the dates of all the Easter Sundays in the history of Easter Sundays and despite his incredible memory, he had an IQ of only 87. And only just now am I realizing that Peek is now dead, which makes me sad. The point is, Peek was a savant, sometimes even called a megasavant, which is like a savant². Did you know there is another guy named Daniel Tammet who claims to be a megasavant but is probably just a faker?And now you, yes YOU, can fake being a savant if you read this book. You can learn how to construct imaginary things called memory palaces which will give you the incredible power of nigh-perfect memory. Do you want to be able to memorize the order of decks of playing cards? I don't know why you would—but the point is you can. "

That shelf looks pretty bare.I saw this book appear in my feeds once and the title certainly caught my attention. This is a story about a journalists journey from reporting on the US and World memory competition one year, to competing in it the following year. In his first year reporting the event, Joshua Foer began to understand that all of the participants at the event weren't savants or incredibly smart, they pretty much all had a system that made remembering pi to the 2000 digit more of a trick than an IQ measure. Armed with this info, Joshua embarks on a journey to see if he can build a memory system to allow him to remember 100 names and faces, recall a deck of cards and report back, (I can't remember how many, ironic i know) a large number chain.THIS IS NOT A SELF HELP BOOK. If you are going to read this to learn how to become better at remembering names when going into meetings (this is me) you are not going to be taught how to do it. What this book does do is give you the history of memory systems, going way way back to the ancient Greeks. He interviews people from the US and the UK with all sorts of fascinating memory disorders, he covers how Tony Buzon has made over 300 million dollars in self help books, using memory techniques that have been around for thousands of years. Joshua spends time with a couple of memory champions and the begin to help him learn his system so that he can compete in the following years memory contest. The system is very simple, what isn't simple is the practice to make it work. So thankfully Foer doesn't spend too much time talking about practice, but he does give the strong impression that he is spending at least an hour a day memorising his system. A third of the way through the book, he does give an example how anyone can learn a system quickly. I was listening to this on audio (which is very well narrated, except for the typically poor english accent that Mike Chamberlain does) whilst driving and we are told how to use the 'loqi' or 'memory palace' to remember some random items. Now this part of the book was day one of a 4 day business trip, it was 6 days ago and I can still recall all ten items mentioned with no problem at all, including 'peat smoked salmon' and 'email Sophia'. My visualization of cottage cheese on the front door step of the house i grew up in is one I enjoy re-visualizing. It involves Nicole Kidman and thats about as much as I am going to divulge here.This is not a how to help improve your memory, but it does give you a big slice of the systems used and everything you would need to help you improve can be found on the mnemonics wiki site. I wasn't sure what to expect when reading this, I was happily surprised to have really enjoyed it. A very well written docu/journalistic article on memory, paced very well with some fascinating facts and figures. This book was much more than I had hoped for and so have no qualms about giving it 4 stars. "
220,159420229X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/38618130-azaa-kh,5,"A very misleading title, but the content was not a disappointment. ""Experience is the sum of our memories and wisdom the sum of our experiences"" If we follow this logic, we gain wisdom through our memories. And yet, memorization has been largely criticized by many school officials and educators that it kills creativity and critical thinking. But what this book points out, which I completely agree, is the fact that memorization is never really taught in schools. Instead, they make students memorize a bunch of unimportant facts through rote memorization without teaching how to retain the information, and that is what is corrupting our education system but not the memorization itself. In fact, the book reasons that learning and memorization come hand-in-hand, so you cannot get one without the other. This has completely changed my perspective on memorization.Another interesting fact pointed out in this book was that we can make our lives seem longer through varying our life experiences. This may sound contradictory at first because when we have fewer things to do, time does not seem to move at all. However, the study shows that it is the contrary: In 1962, a researcher named, Michel Siffre, conducted a self-experimentation by spending two months in a cave without access to a clock, calendars, or the Sun. As time went on, his memory deteriorated and lost track of the passage of time. After two months, when he finally got out of the cave, he thought that only a month had passed. This suggested the hypothesis that the less we experience, the shorter the time seems to fly, so according to this hypothesis, to stretch our psychological time, we will need to create new memories that play as anchor points in our lives.Last but not least, the book also illustrates how we attain new skills and reach beyond our limits. I personally think this was the most important topic discussed in this book. When we learn a new skill, we progress through three stages: cognitive stage, associative stage, and autonomous stage. The cognitive stage is where all the learning occurs and the skill is developed rapidly. In this stage, a person fully focuses on the task consciously and intellectually discovers new strategies to get the task done. But once we pass this stage and become good enough, what we do becomes so autonomous or unconscious that we do not even have to use our intellects anymore. This is what the book calls the OK plateau, the period in which we see almost no growth because we are merely following our unconscious process. So to go beyond our limits, we need to stay in the cognitive stage and continuously develop our capabilities. There's a saying ""Practice makes it perfect"", but how we practice is more important than the amount we practice, and only when it is the concentrated, self-conscious, and deliberated kind of practice, we will not be restrained by our limits anymore.Overall, I'd suggest this book for anyone who wants to improve their learning process.

221,159420229X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4252261-tom-la,4,"Truly excellent work of participatory journalism. The author set out to explore the world of ""memory competitions"", and from there he made himself the subject of a study on skills-improvement, to the point that he won a national memory competition. This book paints a high-level fresco on the subject of human memory: the history of how we recall things, how massively that has changed throughout the centuries, and how some ancient memory techniques (almost forgotten today) are surprisingly efficient still today, and available to anyone, not only for people with a ""strong memory"". - the topic is fascinating and important for our understanding of ourselves;- the book is well written, although a little too MalcolmGladwellesque at points (Oxf. cit. ""to write like Malcom Gladwell"" = to make a big entertaining fuss about something without actually saying much, and make it sound much more exciting than what it actually is through the use of anecdotes, humour and trivia)- I noticed some references to the content of ""Talent is overrated"" by Geoff Colvin, especially for what concerns the topic of skills improvement- some of the techniques described, like the ""memory palace"" technique, were new to me, and... well, unforgettable. Sorry, I was hoping I would get through this review without any stupid pun.- Daniel Tammet, the alleged savant author of ""Born on a blue day"", might be a complete or partial fraud. Difficult to prove, but Foer has a good point there.Important note: if you are looking for a book to teach you some memory techniques, this is probably not the best book for you, because this one includes many general explanations on various related topics and also some personal stories from the author's life. He does quote several other books that are specifically meant to teach memory techniques."
222,159420229X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/159421-shan,4,"Interesting and fun to read, like a longer version of the long-form journalism you find in magazines like the New Yorker. That might be where I previously read a chunk of this book when it came out in 2011, illustrating one of the memory principles it explains: our memories are great at recognizing things we've seen before, even if we wouldn't have been able to recall them otherwise.The title comes from the memory technique Foer learned to compete as a ""mental athlete"" after finding out such a thing existed in the course of researching an article he was writing. The technique is the memory palace, in which you attach vivid mental pictures to specific spots in a location you know well. To memorize esoteric things like the digits of pi or the order of a deck of cards, you first learn to give each digit or card a constant image you'll always associate with it (or three, as Foer learned from European competitors, who use POA - person, object, action).Like those long magazine articles, the book has layers - the memoir of how he went from regular guy to memory champion, the history and science of memory and memorization, and some specifics on how to actually use the techniques. These things are braided together, contributing to the reading experience of being pulled along through the book, but occasionally frustrating when I wanted a deeper dive into a specific, like in the chapter about memorizing poetry that almost seemed like it was going to tell me something new but switched to another strand right before the juicy part.The great takeaway from this book is that anyone can learn to use ancient techniques and take advantage of how our brains evolved to work. The focus of these memory competitors is trivial - who cares about the order of a deck of cards? - but the ideas in the book can be applied anywhere. "

You see I am a big language enthusiast. At one point or another you can find me studying French, Japanese, or Swedish, and as many language students will tell you, learning that pesky grammar or vocabulary can be exhausting. You can be drilling the same set of words entire night, remember them for the next morning’s test, and then forget them completely by suppertime. To our great frustration, human brains are built to form only the fun, unique experiences into long-term memories, and to toss the mundane, boring, rarely-used stuff into the pits of obscurity.

The story for Joshua preparing for the Memory Championship is really interesting. All discoveries that he had made, special cases from people with extinguished memory, but very low IQ. Now the question is asked: Is memory trained or some brain disorders are responsible for ?Kim, savient with special abilities to remember dates, all history events, but IQ 87, and another example of Daniel still undiscovered type of ""savient"" or only hard memory training. I even wathed the documentary for Brainman. Neuroscience has still time to discover.At the end the most important are our memories.

I thought Foer explained how we remember, the anomalies of savants and the history of human memory in a very readable, well documented manner. Have we come to a place of the end of memory? Americans seldom win or place in the world memory championship. We have so much information at our fingertips, that we really do not use need to use our memory much at all in today’s world and seemingly find it ‘normal’ to lose words, names and events more frequently. This book definitely got me thinking and I will be more mindful of my own memory......but I’m not likely to train to enter the Championship"

229,159420229X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/16275106-pamela,5,"Josh Foer was a 25-year-old college graduate working as a freelance journalist and living with his parents in his childhood home when he first began the research that eventually led to this book and took him on a personal odyssey on the nature of memory. It began casually with an internet search for the smartest person in the world until he found himself at the USA Memory Championship writing an article for Slate about this little known contest and the collection of memory wizards who participated in it. In the course of the next year, he was to meet a strange collection of American and European, as well as other International memory competitors and learn the secrets of their unique abilities that go all the way back to ancient Greece with only slight changes along the way to our own times. He was even to become a competitor himself but to find out how he did when he finally competed in the USA Championship you will have to read the book yourself.Moonwalking With Einstein is a fascinating look at the brain and how it stores memory. Foer touches on all known aspects of this from history and the whys and hows of oral history and the transmission of knowledge before reading and writing to the impact of Gutenberg on memory. He discusses some strange and bizarre brain problems that have unusual effects on memory and the various techniques that mnemonists use to help them make such amazing feats of memorization. Of particular interest is the memory palace. There is also an interesting discussion of the types of memory and what is known about how they work and why we can recite a complete and complicated piece of poetry but can't find our car keys or even remember where we parked the car in the first place. Or what we had for lunch yesterday or when Grandma's birthday is but can name all the Presidents in order. This was a terrific read but Einstein actually had nothing to do with it except as a memory picture. I thoroughly enjoyed it but don't ask me about it next week because I probably won't remember!"
230,159420229X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5650130-david-sheppard,5,"This is one of those rare books that is not only a joy to read, but also immensely helpful. It can help all of us with something that is at once troublesome and worrisome: our memory. It does this with ease, not teaching us some grueling rote memory technique, but one that is easy, natural and intuitive. Yet Moonwalking with Einstein turns out to not be exclusively a how-to book on memory. So what is it? Well, yes, it is about memory and how to improve it, but it is at once a history of techniques, a description of what memory is and what can go wrong with it, and also a running narrative of how the author, a journalist himself with no special memory skills, becomes one of the most proficient memory athletes in America. I'd learned a mnemonic device to aid memorization decades ago while in college, and found it to be helpful, but for some reason I'd abandoned the technique once I graduated. But Moonwalking with Einstein expands the mnemonic technique I learned back then by use of something of which I'd never heard: the ""Memory Palace."" The Memory Palace exploits our inherent skill for remembering images and spatial locations, harnesses these two abilities we all posses in abundance, and relates them to the memorization of numbers, lists and assortments of other difficult to remember items. The amazing thing is that the Memory Palace not only makes memorization easy, it also makes it fun. What makes the book so interesting is that it is narrative non-fiction and reads like a novel. The author locks his conflict with his own memory early on, gives a sense of rising tension as he accumulates the forces to overcome its limitations, and resolves this internal conflict at the end when he participates in the US Memory Championship. I didn't read it as urgently as I did today's number one bestseller, Laura Hillenbrand's Unbroken, but still, I couldn't put it down. In Chapter Five, I scanned the ""to-do"" list of fifteen items on pages 92/3 that the author had to memorize in his initial attempt, and developed the technique for myself as I read about the author memorizing it. As my Memory Palace, I used an old home of a high school friend with which I was still familiar, constructing useful details as I went. When I had finished reading about the author memorizing the list (took me about five minutes), I had memorized it myself, and I found that the items were not only immediately memorable, but that the list of items and their sequence was still with me days later, and so imbedded in my memory that I'm sure I'll ever forget it. All this, I accomplished effortlessly. This is a truly remarkable feat for me because I'm almost seventy years old and have chronic fatigue syndrome, which adversely affects all aspects of my memory. It has also given me hope that I might finally learn ancient Greek. I tried to learn it several years ago, but found building a vocabulary so difficult that I abandoned the project. Rote memory was just too much trouble. I am interested in all things Greek, and as it turns out, the Memory Palace technique was invented in the fifth century BC by Simonides following his narrow escape from the collapse of a building. This in itself is a story you'll be interested in reading about. The author says that since the time of this ancient Greek, ""the art of memory has been about creating architectural spaces in the imagination."" Having been to Greece twice and written a 480 page travel journal on the subject, (Oedipus On A Pale Horse: Greek Journey In Search Of A Personal Mythology) I have all the makings of a superb Greek Memory Palace. While traveling around Greece and the western coast of Turkey for ten weeks, I visited many cities and islands: Athens, Thebes, Delphi, Ithaca, Mykonos, Delos, Santorini, etc. I can't count all the archaeological sites I visited. What I'm creating isn't just any old Memory Palace but actually a Memory Country. Within each location, I can identify as many locations for storing words and meanings as I need. But not only that, I can also use characters from Greek mythology to create actions and images to reinforce the material, as the author suggests. All this constitutes my Greek Memory Palace: the location where I will store ancient Greek words and meanings as I learn the language, in accordance with the instructions learned in Moonwalking with Einstein. None of it was difficult. I picked it up as I read the book. The author describes how in the past people viewed their minds as something to perfect by loading it with all sorts of intellectual material. ""People used to labor to furnish their minds. They invested in the acquisition of memories the same way we invest in the acquisition of things."" [page 134] Some even believed that ""the art of memory was a secret key to unlocking the occult structure of the universe."" [page 151] This has given me an entirely new view of how to perceive my own mind and nourish it in the future. The author also discusses how we came to lose touch with our ability to remember with the invention of the printed word. The history of that estrangement and how inventions like Wikipedia and the Internet foster that estrangement is a very interesting story. The author makes the reader aware of what is happening to us and provides a way to project ourselves into the future without suffering so much of technology's debilitating effects. Perhaps the reason this book is so successful is that the reader never loses sight of the practical use of the information the author is providing because the author is discovering it himself and actively making use of it in his quest to make it into the US Memory Championship. This is an important book. Everyone can benefit from reading it. "
231,159420229X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/11652288-faye,2,"This was okay but if you know anything at all about memory techniques, you won't really find anything new here. I had hoped to get more background information on the memory techniques, how our brain works, etc. but instead it there was too much information in it that I, personally, just did not find relevant. For example, I'm just not interested in the individual memory champions (if I were, I would read their memoirs), or that he asked Daniel Tammet what the number 9,412 looked to him three times. I get that Foer, a journalist, did this with the intention of finding truth and, possibly, debunking a fraud. Still, while I have no idea whether Tammet is a fraud or not, I can say that this and other behaviours and comments made Foer seem pretty annoying.In another review, I read that this book reads like an overlong magazine article and I guess that's true: it did feel pretty drawn out and like a magazine article that was watered down and stretched out so it could become a book.

The author's journey over the course of one year, from 'journalist scraping by' to America's National Memory Champion, is as exciting as it is informative. Highly recommend for anyone who want to learn about how to improve their memory, understand the research behind 'memory savants', or simply enjoy the unique story of the esoteric competitions between 'mental athletes'."

234,159420229X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/8187431-rade,4,"“Forgotten phone numbers and birthdays represent minor erosions of our everyday memory, but they are part of a much larger story of how we've supplanted our own natural memory with a vast superstructure of technological crutches—from the alphabet to the BlackBerry. These technologies of storing information outside our minds have helped make our modern world possible, but they've also changed how we think and how we use our brains.” I loved this book. Not because it offers insights to some unbelievable profound ideas but because it talks about our brains and how we use it to remember things. The thing about our brain is that it is a giant muscle and the more you work on it the bigger it gets. The bigger it gets, the more it remembers. The book is so much more than Foer's journey to understand what it means to be a mental athlete and eventually what it means to think in a way they do. It also goes back to a time when people like monks used various techniques to not only remember stuff short term, but to imprint it in their minds so they can recall it at any time, on any day, making writing new hymns and lectures easier. This was a time when technology was almost nonexistent. Books, while rare were also very hard to have at hand when searching religious text. When one had a copy, he would spend hours if not days going back and fourth trying to put together a sermon. This is one of the reasons people looked into ways of storing this type of information in their brain so life could be a bit easier. One of the techniques that these mental athletes use today is the whole idea of a memory palace, a way of dividing your brain into separate rooms in as many houses as possible and storing things in there so you can recall it later. The way one does it is not to say ""buy a new jacket"" as a to do item, but to make it as descriptive as possible. It is better to imagine an alligator wearing a warm jacket while fishing on a chilly winter day as that sticks better in your mind. Our minds are not bad at remembering but they are bad at recalling because remembering to buy bread and butter at a supermarket is something we did a hundred times therefore, it doesn't stick out, and it is pushed aside and eventually (in a week or even less), forgotten. Some people sometimes had to pray and beg for forgiveness when they found out that using sexual imagery helps them recall information better because it sticks faster. Now in order to remember that I have to buy yogurt, I just need to picture Megan Fox swimming in it while munching an all American burger and I am golden haha Seriously though, it takes a lot of practice and patience to do this type of thing. It is achievable but most people don't have the time or patience to do it. Foer did it but it did not come out of nowhere. He had a help of some of the people who competed in these mental athlete challenges and they pushed him and couched him on what to do and what not to do when one finds himself off track and wondering aimlessly around. SPOILER WARNING: At the end of the book Foer won this mental athlete event but he said that since we have so many ways of writing stuff down (especially phones as most people carry it on them all day long), this use of remembering stuff is not needed. It is nice but he said he does not use his mental techniques any more (at least not much) as we have other ways of keeping records and finding information that was once very hard to track down. Again, this is a great book and I really enjoyed it as the author did not just go into his life but set a bunch of chapters to discuss historical figures who used these types of techniques to make it easier to recall stuff during their every day activities. I kind of wish he went further into it but a succinct summery is better than no summary at all. "
235,159420229X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1231090-jud-barry,4,"You have to love a book written by someone who, fresh from winning the U.S. Memory Championship, takes mass transit home because he’s forgotten that he drove. He didn’t just forget where he parked—he forgot that he drove.In this inspiriting book, Joshua Foer shows how he — a person of decidedly unprodigious memory — learns some well-established mnemonic techniques, practices them for a half hour a day over the course of a year, and winds up winning the national memory contest (by, among other things, memorizing a deck of cards in record time).Along the way to the championship, Foer provides his own color commentary by discussing the phenomenon of memory — and by describing the lives of people who are real memory phenomena, like Kim “Rain Man” Peek, the savant who, despite having an I.Q. of just 87, absorbed information, retained it, and recalled it without effort; or the unnamed individual EP, afflicted with complete amnesia as a result of brain damage caused by herpes simplex.Even more colorful are the idiosyncratic “mental athletes” who steer Foer in the direction of the championship. Among them is Tony Buzan, the flamboyant minter of a “mind mapping” technique that, well, made him a mint and gave him grandiose ideas of reforming education.The techniques, it turns out, have been in use since antiquity. Before the ready availability of and access to books, learning involved training the memory to retrieve information. The ancient Greeks began to explore ways of using the capabilities of the brain to recall “architectural” memories as a means of building virtual “memory palaces” in the mind. These virtual buildings are where memories —often given arbitrary but colorful personalities and attributes — are stored for later retrieval.(One of the most fun aspects of the book is how Foer enlists the reader to use this technique to memorize a shopping list. Read this book and you will effortlessly—and probably forever—recall his list: pickled garlic, cottage cheese, peat-smoked salmon, 6 bottles of white wine, 3 pairs of socks, and email for Sophia.)The process requires focused effort and some creativity, and, when you think that what’s stored isn’t the raw memory itself but a tarted-up decoy that lures you to the place where the memory resides, not everyone has felt the extra baggage to be worth the effort. The Chinese, for example, were exposed to these techniques by Jesuit missionaries in the 16th century but decided that rote learning was “simpler and faster.”In ""Moonwalking with Einstein,"" Foer does a masterful job of using memory (or the lack of it) as the foil for an exploration not only the human brain but the human condition as well. What is consciousness? What is learning? What is creativity? How do we best educate ourselves? How does technology influence the ways in which we think about things, and how do the ways in which we think about things define us?And fortunately, if you don’t have the memory of a London cabdriver but need to navigate your way back to Giordano Bruno’s memory wheel, there is an index."

The case of someone who kept forgetting things the moment they happened (like in the movie Memento), along with the recent reports of Gabriel Garcia Marquez' dementia, also made me concerned about memory's place and role in our lives. The most interesting part for me was about the author voicing his doubts and laying his case over 'savant' Daniel Tammet, of Born on a Blue Day: Inside the Extraordinary Mind of an Autistic Savant. Then again, not that I really care enough about who's right and wrong in this case, since to me, the training required to develop the ability to remember like trained memory experts take out the joy in experiencing natural flow in life. Even as I frustrate over forgetting the most mundane stuff, it reminds me of my faults and to appreciate memories that stick naturally because I know they must've mattered to me, not because they're the after-effects of conscious stamping in my brain. Don't they have a saying, you live for the moments that take your breath away - it wouldn't be the same if those moments were due to you holding your breath would it? Remembering things because they're memorable as opposed to remembering by technique are sort of like that I think.I know I'm saying this because I still have a working and relatively healthy memory. It must be agonizing indeed to have memories slip out of you or your loved ones, but for such cases, I doubt if the techniques mentioned here apply.Definitely overhyped, but I don't feel it's an altogether wasted read either. Feels like a whitewashed Malcolm Gladwell, if you'd asked me. Maybe all journalists write in pretty similar styles?"

Under the tutelage of a British memory champ Ed Cook, Foer learns the tricks and techniques that most of the mental athletes use, such as the Major system of pegging letters to numbers, or the PAO system, in which the user associates two-digit numbers with memorable people and actions. Foer does more than just look behind the curtain at the Championships, though; he meets with Anders Ericsson of Florida State, who studies the development of expertise; he meets with Kim Peek, the inspiration for ‘Rain Man;’ he reads the ancients on memory, such as Simonides and his memory palace, or the Rhetorica ad Herennium, which gives tips on memorizing speeches using loci; he meets with guru/PR man Tony Buzan, who claims to help thousands with his Mind Mapping techniques; he reads old case studies, such as that of Russian journalist S who forgot almost nothing; he meets living case studies, such as E.P., who has no working memory.The book is a skilled synthesis of all things related to mnemonics and brain studies, a very readable introduction to the history of memory. Foer tells his story honestly – not always making himself look like the coolest guy in the room in the process – and with an engaging, comfortable prose style. He paces the story well, capping it with his unremarkable showing at the World Championships, but along the way tackles some subjects like a veteran journalist out to break a story: he’s not afraid to show the questionable side of Tony Buzan or supposed Asperger’s savant Daniel Tammet. It’s a compelling narrative as well as a fascinating overview of what we know about memory – and it offers several practical tips to improve the reader’s own memory. It’s well executed and, yes, memorable. "

239,159420229X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/28482493-angus-mckeogh,3,Extremely interesting. The memory is a fickle beast. And this memoir definitely revealed much more of the tricks and techniques that are used to memorize things. Possibly the most fascinating aspect of the book was when he discussed Daniel Tammet. Having already read the latter’s book about his “savant memory” it was incredible to learn Tammet was simply using the same techniques as these other memory performers. Sure wish I wouldn’t have used any space in my brain while reading Tammet’s book. Reminds me a bit of the James Frey debacle with A Million Little Pieces.
240,159420229X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2188450-andrea,4,"I started this one with somewhat lowered expectations, feeling like I was revisiting too-familiar territory. Being the clever woman I am, I had diagnosed a trend of immersive journalism about ""brain sports"" (I just made that term up), profiling the odd sort of people that tend to become obsessive about such things, and learning how to become obsessive oneself. And having spotted this trend, I was (of course) subsequently dismissive, skeptical that this book about memory competition would entertain me any more than similarly themed books like ""Word Freak"" by Stefan Fatsis (about Scrabble) and ""The Kings of New York"" by Michael Weinreb (Chess) already had. (I can't help but assume that, as a journalist, immersing oneself in competitive memory competition would be much more attractive than say, covering Afghanistan or playing for the Detroit Tigers, due to the substantially decreased risk of bodily harm). However, even though the premise was nothing new, I was very entertained by this book. Foer manages to find many fascinating things to say about something that is, at heart, just an extreme version of an everyday human activity - remembering shit. I found myself eager to come back to this book when I had to put it down, and excited to learn more about the subject."

I don't know that it taught me very much (& I have no intention whatsoever to improve my memory using the tactics loosely outlined in this book - not because I don't believe they are effective, but because I don't want to), but it was extremely interesting and kept me engaged the entire time. I also REALLY enjoyed the writing style and hope Joshua Foer plans to write more in the future, because I am eager to read whatever it may be."

It's mostly about the author's quest towards US memory championship. An interesting read, but if you're seeking a manual for memory techniques, it wouldn't suit you. "
243,159420229X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2922699-genia-lukin,3,"Joshua Foer tackles in his book the issues of memory - how it is formed, how it has been lost, and how to improve it. Aside from the anecdotal - the rather interesting glimpse into the world of the mental athletes, amusing to me personally because of my familiarity with (and let's be frank here, membership in) the geeky society at large, Foer also presents the more general - research into memory and amnesia, as well as a historical perspective on the memorisation techniques and learning of the past.In my world, the world of religious Judaism, Torah readings, and extensive familiarity with texts, we still memorize a great deal. So I approached this book with a level of interest especially to the educational and historical aspects of the subject which Foer presents. I also enjoyed the cognitive, but the research he presents is one I am generally familiar with, and thus less interested in, when reading a presentation for the layman. Foer's research is generally good, though oftentimes insufficient. We get a slew of cognitive limitations and some exploration into amnesia - a very interesting chapter in and of itself - but not much about memory research beyond the very generic. We do not see some of the abnormal research into memory done on various sub-populations, except a tiny glimpse into savants, which are a somewhat different phenomenon, and even then the glimpse is mostly one of disillusionment.However, I can't help but agree with Foer intellectually when he makes his educational claims concerning the point that, for any person to think creatively and analytically, he first has to supply himself with basic facts which can be retrieved and analysed. If you do not know the basic material, the ground rules, or the structure of a subject, you then have nothing to analyse, nothing to expand upon, nothing to create with. If you can't remember the shape of an object you can't draw it, and if you can't remember the points of disagreement between two ideologies you cannot judge them.The parts pertaining to the memory sport itself, somehow, interested me less. It is still in the realm of the esoteric - as Foer himself claims - and card memorisation and the ability to recite long poems after fifteen minutes still would not help us - or him - find his car keys, Still, this is an interesting and important book, especially for people without the academic background, because it provides yet another glimpse into how our minds work, or don't work, and what we do, or don't do, with them."
244,159420229X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/80375046-shnila-parveen,2," In Plato’s Phaedrus, Socrates describes how the Egyptian god Theuth, inventor of writing, came to Thamus, the king of Egypt, and offered to bestow his wonderful invention upon the Egyptian people. “Here is a branch of learning that will ... improve their memories,” Theuth said to the Egyptian king. “My discovery provides a recipe for both memory and wisdom.” But Thamus was reluctant to accept the gift. “If men learn this, it will implant forgetfulness in their souls,” he told the god. “They will cease to exercise their memory and become forgetful; they will rely on that which is written, calling things to remembrance no longer from within themselves, but by means of external marks. What you have discovered is a recipe not for memory, but for reminding. And it is no true wisdom that you offer your disciples, but only its semblance, for by telling them of many things without teaching them anything, you will make them seem to know much, while for the most part they will know nothing. And as men filled not with wisdom but with the conceit of wisdom, they will be a burden to their fellow-men. What is the importance of memory in present times of technology making information available on our fingertips? Is it crucial for our cognitive capabilities or just futile endeavor? These are difficult questions that are not answered in this book. The author has however admitted that the memory hacks he learnt for the memory championships do not really improve the memory in general. After securing a good ranking in the European Memory Championship, Author forgot that he drove his car to the party celebrating his victory and took the Subway instead. There is no refuting the fact that the importance of human memory has marginalized in last couple of decades. One of the important reasons why I started writing reviews, first in private notes and then in Goodread is because I started to realize that I do not retain much from the books that I was reading. It seemed like an act of idle indulgence of absorbing someone else’s work without adding anything of my own. My views were there for a moment but would disappear as if I had none. By writing a review, I am not just an idle reader anymore but I am adding something of my own to the reading. Since I usually write my reviews after finishing the book, it also becomes an act of active recall, one of the memory techniques I believe works for me. For how long though, cannot be sure. Few year ago, I used to watch BBC’s Sherlock Holmes TV series where the lead character had mind palaces helping him recall the most miniscule things in excruciating detail. I presumed it as one of the quirks of the eccentric character. It was while reading this book that I got to know that memory palace is a legitimate and widely used memory hack, used by the participants of the memory championships. Although I don’t find a practical use of it in my day to day life. An interesting piece is on the analysis of Odyssey and Illiad. There are theories that claim that these famous poems were not written by one person but rather passed on years after years by way as loose collection of songs. The structure of poems is such that it seems to have been evolved for being memorized and later with the invention of writing, compiled together in its current form. The brain best remembers things that are repeated, rhythmic, rhyming, structured, and above all easily visualized. The only thing I did not like about this book is its deceptive title which would pass it of as a self-help book. This book is not a self-help book. Joshua Foer participated in US and European Memory Championship as part of his article in something called as participatory journalism. He met some unique set of people, discovered unusual things about memory and went on to win the memory championship. There are a lot of negative reviews about this book, which are accurate but are not substantial when you read this book with an open mind to learn something about an unusual subject. Memorizing has earned a bad reputation as an absence of real intellect and just a way to hold on to information for clearing the next exam. Its cause it not helped by the fact that the people with amazing memories have not made much in life and have resorted to self-help guru bluff. Memory does not help you become good at something. Instead mastering something breeds a better memory."

It never occurred to me that there was this kind of mental superpower that we could all have.Told by a journalist intrigued by memory competitions, Moonwalking with Einstein was simple and light to read. This was a story of his own journey into the world of mental athletes, and him taking a go at it himself.We are brought with him in his journey to find out what this is. Before the creation of the printing press, our world did not have the means we have today, to store our information. It was up to us to memorize what we learned especially if we wanted to pass it down onto the next generation. Tales and stories were made to keep these memories alive. Little did I know, that the small memory competitions today are so minuscule compared to the world before where memory palaces and techniques were as common as writing today.What is so empowering about this book is that he shows us, we can all create our own memory palaces if we would just put the time at it. We could know by heart the stories, the quotes, the places we would want to keep in our minds forever. I learned that memory is not a test of intellect but of creativity. We don’t have to be mental athletes who can memorize thousands of numbers or random words in minutes. But we can use these techniques for remembering the things we actually want to remember.Towards the end of the book, we are called on to remember because “how we perceive the world and act In it are products of how and what we remember”And if you feel daunted by the task to establish more memories, remember memory is not as much due to intellect as it is due to creativity. 4.5 Stars"

Moonwalking is really not that bad once you get past some utterly boring reportage about a group of obsessives who go in for memory competitions around the world. Foer initially covered one of these competitions as a reporter, became involved himself and determined to win the next year’s US competition. In the process, he delves into sometimes-amusing, but more often tedious, investigations into the place of memory in our society. There are some nice observations - on the difference between knowledge and memory, or about memory once being fundamental to the preservation of knowledge, but no longer being much needed in a literate society with an abundance of stored information (first on scrolls, then books, and now the Internet). But the book suffers from an overly-journalistic style and it reads like an extended magazine article. First-person investigational stuff with some random historical/scientific filler: easy to browse, easy to skip over; but don't look for anything about the art of how to put the memory techniques into practice (it’s apparently a well-known system called “Memory Palace”), this is just Foer’s experience of doing it. So, is it any use? Well Foer himself finds that memory-improving techniques are not much good for anything more than lists and succeeding at memory competitions.I certainly would not find memorizing “memorable” images any easier than remembering the facts themselves – holy crap, how much time and effort would it take to dream up the images, associate them somehow with the thing-to-be-remembered and then recall the connection later, so that one would remember the “thing” and not just the mental image?? In short, not really worth 200 pages. Two stars may sound a little mingy, but it’s ultimately a bit boring."

They do things like memorize 20thousand digits of pi or memorize the order of a deck of cards in a very short amount of time or memorize a long sequence of numbers or letters or words or pretty much anything for almost no reason at all. There's even something called the US Memory Championship (which the author won and that's not even really a spoiler) and also the World Memory Championship (in which Americans always do poorly, to my ever-expanding shame.)Foer escorts the reader on not only a stunt journalism-type memoir of his time training for and competing in these competitions, but also on a journey through the brain, in an Oliver Sacks-esque exploration of all the weird, quirky things a memory does or can do.Did you know that the guy from Rain Man is a real guy? You probably did. He is not the same person as Dustin Hoffman, though. He is his very own person and he is named Kim Peek and despite his ability to multiple huge numbers in his head and to calculate the dates of all the Easter Sundays in the history of Easter Sundays and despite his incredible memory, he had an IQ of only 87. And only just now am I realizing that Peek is now dead, which makes me sad. The point is, Peek was a savant, sometimes even called a megasavant, which is like a savant². Did you know there is another guy named Daniel Tammet who claims to be a megasavant but is probably just a faker?And now you, yes YOU, can fake being a savant if you read this book. You can learn how to construct imaginary things called memory palaces which will give you the incredible power of nigh-perfect memory. Do you want to be able to memorize the order of decks of playing cards? I don't know why you would—but the point is you can. "

So I was pretty shocked to find that this work has almost no ""how to"" information in it. It is mostly just a memoir of getting into a memory competition and what this competitive world looks like. It does convey a fascination with memory and was fairly fun to read anyway. It gets an extra star for what it helped motivate my father to accomplish. "
249,159420229X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4162390-lee,4,"I got to use the non-fiction tag! That shelf looks pretty bare.I saw this book appear in my feeds once and the title certainly caught my attention. This is a story about a journalists journey from reporting on the US and World memory competition one year, to competing in it the following year. In his first year reporting the event, Joshua Foer began to understand that all of the participants at the event weren't savants or incredibly smart, they pretty much all had a system that made remembering pi to the 2000 digit more of a trick than an IQ measure. Armed with this info, Joshua embarks on a journey to see if he can build a memory system to allow him to remember 100 names and faces, recall a deck of cards and report back, (I can't remember how many, ironic i know) a large number chain.THIS IS NOT A SELF HELP BOOK. If you are going to read this to learn how to become better at remembering names when going into meetings (this is me) you are not going to be taught how to do it. What this book does do is give you the history of memory systems, going way way back to the ancient Greeks. He interviews people from the US and the UK with all sorts of fascinating memory disorders, he covers how Tony Buzon has made over 300 million dollars in self help books, using memory techniques that have been around for thousands of years. Joshua spends time with a couple of memory champions and the begin to help him learn his system so that he can compete in the following years memory contest. The system is very simple, what isn't simple is the practice to make it work. So thankfully Foer doesn't spend too much time talking about practice, but he does give the strong impression that he is spending at least an hour a day memorising his system. A third of the way through the book, he does give an example how anyone can learn a system quickly. I was listening to this on audio (which is very well narrated, except for the typically poor english accent that Mike Chamberlain does) whilst driving and we are told how to use the 'loqi' or 'memory palace' to remember some random items. Now this part of the book was day one of a 4 day business trip, it was 6 days ago and I can still recall all ten items mentioned with no problem at all, including 'peat smoked salmon' and 'email Sophia'. My visualization of cottage cheese on the front door step of the house i grew up in is one I enjoy re-visualizing. It involves Nicole Kidman and thats about as much as I am going to divulge here.This is not a how to help improve your memory, but it does give you a big slice of the systems used and everything you would need to help you improve can be found on the mnemonics wiki site. I wasn't sure what to expect when reading this, I was happily surprised to have really enjoyed it. A very well written docu/journalistic article on memory, paced very well with some fascinating facts and figures. This book was much more than I had hoped for and so have no qualms about giving it 4 stars. "
250,159420229X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/38618130-azaa-kh,5,"A very misleading title, but the content was not a disappointment. ""Experience is the sum of our memories and wisdom the sum of our experiences"" If we follow this logic, we gain wisdom through our memories. And yet, memorization has been largely criticized by many school officials and educators that it kills creativity and critical thinking. But what this book points out, which I completely agree, is the fact that memorization is never really taught in schools. Instead, they make students memorize a bunch of unimportant facts through rote memorization without teaching how to retain the information, and that is what is corrupting our education system but not the memorization itself. In fact, the book reasons that learning and memorization come hand-in-hand, so you cannot get one without the other. This has completely changed my perspective on memorization.Another interesting fact pointed out in this book was that we can make our lives seem longer through varying our life experiences. This may sound contradictory at first because when we have fewer things to do, time does not seem to move at all. However, the study shows that it is the contrary: In 1962, a researcher named, Michel Siffre, conducted a self-experimentation by spending two months in a cave without access to a clock, calendars, or the Sun. As time went on, his memory deteriorated and lost track of the passage of time. After two months, when he finally got out of the cave, he thought that only a month had passed. This suggested the hypothesis that the less we experience, the shorter the time seems to fly, so according to this hypothesis, to stretch our psychological time, we will need to create new memories that play as anchor points in our lives.Last but not least, the book also illustrates how we attain new skills and reach beyond our limits. I personally think this was the most important topic discussed in this book. When we learn a new skill, we progress through three stages: cognitive stage, associative stage, and autonomous stage. The cognitive stage is where all the learning occurs and the skill is developed rapidly. In this stage, a person fully focuses on the task consciously and intellectually discovers new strategies to get the task done. But once we pass this stage and become good enough, what we do becomes so autonomous or unconscious that we do not even have to use our intellects anymore. This is what the book calls the OK plateau, the period in which we see almost no growth because we are merely following our unconscious process. So to go beyond our limits, we need to stay in the cognitive stage and continuously develop our capabilities. There's a saying ""Practice makes it perfect"", but how we practice is more important than the amount we practice, and only when it is the concentrated, self-conscious, and deliberated kind of practice, we will not be restrained by our limits anymore.Overall, I'd suggest this book for anyone who wants to improve their learning process.

251,159420229X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4252261-tom-la,4,"Truly excellent work of participatory journalism. The author set out to explore the world of ""memory competitions"", and from there he made himself the subject of a study on skills-improvement, to the point that he won a national memory competition. This book paints a high-level fresco on the subject of human memory: the history of how we recall things, how massively that has changed throughout the centuries, and how some ancient memory techniques (almost forgotten today) are surprisingly efficient still today, and available to anyone, not only for people with a ""strong memory"". - the topic is fascinating and important for our understanding of ourselves;- the book is well written, although a little too MalcolmGladwellesque at points (Oxf. cit. ""to write like Malcom Gladwell"" = to make a big entertaining fuss about something without actually saying much, and make it sound much more exciting than what it actually is through the use of anecdotes, humour and trivia)- I noticed some references to the content of ""Talent is overrated"" by Geoff Colvin, especially for what concerns the topic of skills improvement- some of the techniques described, like the ""memory palace"" technique, were new to me, and... well, unforgettable. Sorry, I was hoping I would get through this review without any stupid pun.- Daniel Tammet, the alleged savant author of ""Born on a blue day"", might be a complete or partial fraud. Difficult to prove, but Foer has a good point there.Important note: if you are looking for a book to teach you some memory techniques, this is probably not the best book for you, because this one includes many general explanations on various related topics and also some personal stories from the author's life. He does quote several other books that are specifically meant to teach memory techniques."

That might be where I previously read a chunk of this book when it came out in 2011, illustrating one of the memory principles it explains: our memories are great at recognizing things we've seen before, even if we wouldn't have been able to recall them otherwise.The title comes from the memory technique Foer learned to compete as a ""mental athlete"" after finding out such a thing existed in the course of researching an article he was writing. The technique is the memory palace, in which you attach vivid mental pictures to specific spots in a location you know well. To memorize esoteric things like the digits of pi or the order of a deck of cards, you first learn to give each digit or card a constant image you'll always associate with it (or three, as Foer learned from European competitors, who use POA - person, object, action).Like those long magazine articles, the book has layers - the memoir of how he went from regular guy to memory champion, the history and science of memory and memorization, and some specifics on how to actually use the techniques. These things are braided together, contributing to the reading experience of being pulled along through the book, but occasionally frustrating when I wanted a deeper dive into a specific, like in the chapter about memorizing poetry that almost seemed like it was going to tell me something new but switched to another strand right before the juicy part.The great takeaway from this book is that anyone can learn to use ancient techniques and take advantage of how our brains evolved to work. The focus of these memory competitors is trivial - who cares about the order of a deck of cards? - but the ideas in the book can be applied anywhere. "

You can be drilling the same set of words entire night, remember them for the next morning’s test, and then forget them completely by suppertime.

It began casually with an internet search for the smartest person in the world until he found himself at the USA Memory Championship writing an article for Slate about this little known contest and the collection of memory wizards who participated in it. In the course of the next year, he was to meet a strange collection of American and European, as well as other International memory competitors and learn the secrets of their unique abilities that go all the way back to ancient Greece with only slight changes along the way to our own times. He was even to become a competitor himself but to find out how he did when he finally competed in the USA Championship you will have to read the book yourself.Moonwalking With Einstein is a fascinating look at the brain and how it stores memory. Foer touches on all known aspects of this from history and the whys and hows of oral history and the transmission of knowledge before reading and writing to the impact of Gutenberg on memory. He discusses some strange and bizarre brain problems that have unusual effects on memory and the various techniques that mnemonists use to help them make such amazing feats of memorization. Of particular interest is the memory palace. There is also an interesting discussion of the types of memory and what is known about how they work and why we can recite a complete and complicated piece of poetry but can't find our car keys or even remember where we parked the car in the first place. Or what we had for lunch yesterday or when Grandma's birthday is but can name all the Presidents in order. This was a terrific read but Einstein actually had nothing to do with it except as a memory picture. I thoroughly enjoyed it but don't ask me about it next week because I probably won't remember!"
260,159420229X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5650130-david-sheppard,5,"This is one of those rare books that is not only a joy to read, but also immensely helpful. It can help all of us with something that is at once troublesome and worrisome: our memory. It does this with ease, not teaching us some grueling rote memory technique, but one that is easy, natural and intuitive. Yet Moonwalking with Einstein turns out to not be exclusively a how-to book on memory. So what is it? Well, yes, it is about memory and how to improve it, but it is at once a history of techniques, a description of what memory is and what can go wrong with it, and also a running narrative of how the author, a journalist himself with no special memory skills, becomes one of the most proficient memory athletes in America. I'd learned a mnemonic device to aid memorization decades ago while in college, and found it to be helpful, but for some reason I'd abandoned the technique once I graduated. But Moonwalking with Einstein expands the mnemonic technique I learned back then by use of something of which I'd never heard: the ""Memory Palace."" The Memory Palace exploits our inherent skill for remembering images and spatial locations, harnesses these two abilities we all posses in abundance, and relates them to the memorization of numbers, lists and assortments of other difficult to remember items. The amazing thing is that the Memory Palace not only makes memorization easy, it also makes it fun. What makes the book so interesting is that it is narrative non-fiction and reads like a novel. The author locks his conflict with his own memory early on, gives a sense of rising tension as he accumulates the forces to overcome its limitations, and resolves this internal conflict at the end when he participates in the US Memory Championship. I didn't read it as urgently as I did today's number one bestseller, Laura Hillenbrand's Unbroken, but still, I couldn't put it down. In Chapter Five, I scanned the ""to-do"" list of fifteen items on pages 92/3 that the author had to memorize in his initial attempt, and developed the technique for myself as I read about the author memorizing it. As my Memory Palace, I used an old home of a high school friend with which I was still familiar, constructing useful details as I went. When I had finished reading about the author memorizing the list (took me about five minutes), I had memorized it myself, and I found that the items were not only immediately memorable, but that the list of items and their sequence was still with me days later, and so imbedded in my memory that I'm sure I'll ever forget it. All this, I accomplished effortlessly. This is a truly remarkable feat for me because I'm almost seventy years old and have chronic fatigue syndrome, which adversely affects all aspects of my memory. It has also given me hope that I might finally learn ancient Greek. I tried to learn it several years ago, but found building a vocabulary so difficult that I abandoned the project. Rote memory was just too much trouble. I am interested in all things Greek, and as it turns out, the Memory Palace technique was invented in the fifth century BC by Simonides following his narrow escape from the collapse of a building. This in itself is a story you'll be interested in reading about. The author says that since the time of this ancient Greek, ""the art of memory has been about creating architectural spaces in the imagination."" Having been to Greece twice and written a 480 page travel journal on the subject, (Oedipus On A Pale Horse: Greek Journey In Search Of A Personal Mythology) I have all the makings of a superb Greek Memory Palace. While traveling around Greece and the western coast of Turkey for ten weeks, I visited many cities and islands: Athens, Thebes, Delphi, Ithaca, Mykonos, Delos, Santorini, etc. I can't count all the archaeological sites I visited. What I'm creating isn't just any old Memory Palace but actually a Memory Country. Within each location, I can identify as many locations for storing words and meanings as I need. But not only that, I can also use characters from Greek mythology to create actions and images to reinforce the material, as the author suggests. All this constitutes my Greek Memory Palace: the location where I will store ancient Greek words and meanings as I learn the language, in accordance with the instructions learned in Moonwalking with Einstein. None of it was difficult. I picked it up as I read the book. The author describes how in the past people viewed their minds as something to perfect by loading it with all sorts of intellectual material. ""People used to labor to furnish their minds. They invested in the acquisition of memories the same way we invest in the acquisition of things."" [page 134] Some even believed that ""the art of memory was a secret key to unlocking the occult structure of the universe."" [page 151] This has given me an entirely new view of how to perceive my own mind and nourish it in the future. The author also discusses how we came to lose touch with our ability to remember with the invention of the printed word. The history of that estrangement and how inventions like Wikipedia and the Internet foster that estrangement is a very interesting story. The author makes the reader aware of what is happening to us and provides a way to project ourselves into the future without suffering so much of technology's debilitating effects. Perhaps the reason this book is so successful is that the reader never loses sight of the practical use of the information the author is providing because the author is discovering it himself and actively making use of it in his quest to make it into the US Memory Championship. This is an important book. Everyone can benefit from reading it. "

I had hoped to get more background information on the memory techniques, how our brain works, etc. but instead it there was too much information in it that I, personally, just did not find relevant. For example, I'm just not interested in the individual memory champions (if I were, I would read their memoirs), or that he asked Daniel Tammet what the number 9,412 looked to him three times. I get that Foer, a journalist, did this with the intention of finding truth and, possibly, debunking a fraud. Still, while I have no idea whether Tammet is a fraud or not, I can say that this and other behaviours and comments made Foer seem pretty annoying.In another review, I read that this book reads like an overlong magazine article and I guess that's true: it did feel pretty drawn out and like a magazine article that was watered down and stretched out so it could become a book. Meh."
262,159420229X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/72796908-daniel-hageman,5,"Easily one of the best books I've read in a long time, dispelling the myths of 'photographic memory' and instead highlighting the very real and equally exciting truths of memory expertise, truths that Joshua Foer was certainly not alone in judging with intuitive skepticism. The author's journey over the course of one year, from 'journalist scraping by' to America's National Memory Champion, is as exciting as it is informative. Highly recommend for anyone who want to learn about how to improve their memory, understand the research behind 'memory savants', or simply enjoy the unique story of the esoteric competitions between 'mental athletes'."
263,159420229X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/63866052-noor,2,I’d rather drown in a lake than read this again. 
264,159420229X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/8187431-rade,4,"“Forgotten phone numbers and birthdays represent minor erosions of our everyday memory, but they are part of a much larger story of how we've supplanted our own natural memory with a vast superstructure of technological crutches—from the alphabet to the BlackBerry. These technologies of storing information outside our minds have helped make our modern world possible, but they've also changed how we think and how we use our brains.” I loved this book. Not because it offers insights to some unbelievable profound ideas but because it talks about our brains and how we use it to remember things. The thing about our brain is that it is a giant muscle and the more you work on it the bigger it gets. The bigger it gets, the more it remembers. The book is so much more than Foer's journey to understand what it means to be a mental athlete and eventually what it means to think in a way they do. It also goes back to a time when people like monks used various techniques to not only remember stuff short term, but to imprint it in their minds so they can recall it at any time, on any day, making writing new hymns and lectures easier. This was a time when technology was almost nonexistent. Books, while rare were also very hard to have at hand when searching religious text. When one had a copy, he would spend hours if not days going back and fourth trying to put together a sermon. This is one of the reasons people looked into ways of storing this type of information in their brain so life could be a bit easier. One of the techniques that these mental athletes use today is the whole idea of a memory palace, a way of dividing your brain into separate rooms in as many houses as possible and storing things in there so you can recall it later. The way one does it is not to say ""buy a new jacket"" as a to do item, but to make it as descriptive as possible. It is better to imagine an alligator wearing a warm jacket while fishing on a chilly winter day as that sticks better in your mind. Our minds are not bad at remembering but they are bad at recalling because remembering to buy bread and butter at a supermarket is something we did a hundred times therefore, it doesn't stick out, and it is pushed aside and eventually (in a week or even less), forgotten. Some people sometimes had to pray and beg for forgiveness when they found out that using sexual imagery helps them recall information better because it sticks faster. Now in order to remember that I have to buy yogurt, I just need to picture Megan Fox swimming in it while munching an all American burger and I am golden haha Seriously though, it takes a lot of practice and patience to do this type of thing. It is achievable but most people don't have the time or patience to do it. Foer did it but it did not come out of nowhere. He had a help of some of the people who competed in these mental athlete challenges and they pushed him and couched him on what to do and what not to do when one finds himself off track and wondering aimlessly around. SPOILER WARNING: At the end of the book Foer won this mental athlete event but he said that since we have so many ways of writing stuff down (especially phones as most people carry it on them all day long), this use of remembering stuff is not needed. It is nice but he said he does not use his mental techniques any more (at least not much) as we have other ways of keeping records and finding information that was once very hard to track down. Again, this is a great book and I really enjoyed it as the author did not just go into his life but set a bunch of chapters to discuss historical figures who used these types of techniques to make it easier to recall stuff during their every day activities. I kind of wish he went further into it but a succinct summery is better than no summary at all. "
265,159420229X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1231090-jud-barry,4,"You have to love a book written by someone who, fresh from winning the U.S. Memory Championship, takes mass transit home because he’s forgotten that he drove. He didn’t just forget where he parked—he forgot that he drove.In this inspiriting book, Joshua Foer shows how he — a person of decidedly unprodigious memory — learns some well-established mnemonic techniques, practices them for a half hour a day over the course of a year, and winds up winning the national memory contest (by, among other things, memorizing a deck of cards in record time).Along the way to the championship, Foer provides his own color commentary by discussing the phenomenon of memory — and by describing the lives of people who are real memory phenomena, like Kim “Rain Man” Peek, the savant who, despite having an I.Q. of just 87, absorbed information, retained it, and recalled it without effort; or the unnamed individual EP, afflicted with complete amnesia as a result of brain damage caused by herpes simplex.Even more colorful are the idiosyncratic “mental athletes” who steer Foer in the direction of the championship. Among them is Tony Buzan, the flamboyant minter of a “mind mapping” technique that, well, made him a mint and gave him grandiose ideas of reforming education.The techniques, it turns out, have been in use since antiquity. Before the ready availability of and access to books, learning involved training the memory to retrieve information. The ancient Greeks began to explore ways of using the capabilities of the brain to recall “architectural” memories as a means of building virtual “memory palaces” in the mind. These virtual buildings are where memories —often given arbitrary but colorful personalities and attributes — are stored for later retrieval.(One of the most fun aspects of the book is how Foer enlists the reader to use this technique to memorize a shopping list. Read this book and you will effortlessly—and probably forever—recall his list: pickled garlic, cottage cheese, peat-smoked salmon, 6 bottles of white wine, 3 pairs of socks, and email for Sophia.)The process requires focused effort and some creativity, and, when you think that what’s stored isn’t the raw memory itself but a tarted-up decoy that lures you to the place where the memory resides, not everyone has felt the extra baggage to be worth the effort. The Chinese, for example, were exposed to these techniques by Jesuit missionaries in the 16th century but decided that rote learning was “simpler and faster.”In ""Moonwalking with Einstein,"" Foer does a masterful job of using memory (or the lack of it) as the foil for an exploration not only the human brain but the human condition as well. What is consciousness? What is learning? What is creativity? How do we best educate ourselves? How does technology influence the ways in which we think about things, and how do the ways in which we think about things define us?And fortunately, if you don’t have the memory of a London cabdriver but need to navigate your way back to Giordano Bruno’s memory wheel, there is an index."
266,159420229X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/8606081-shanghao,3,"A light, fun read, albeit a little too 'normal' to be memorable.Tells the experiences of a journalist who, in the process of researching on a memory championship event, delved head-first into the world of mnemonics.Several simple techniques were introduced, and it does seem as if anyone is capable of becoming mnemonic experts with enough sustained practice. The case of someone who kept forgetting things the moment they happened (like in the movie Memento), along with the recent reports of Gabriel Garcia Marquez' dementia, also made me concerned about memory's place and role in our lives. The most interesting part for me was about the author voicing his doubts and laying his case over 'savant' Daniel Tammet, of Born on a Blue Day: Inside the Extraordinary Mind of an Autistic Savant. Then again, not that I really care enough about who's right and wrong in this case, since to me, the training required to develop the ability to remember like trained memory experts take out the joy in experiencing natural flow in life. Even as I frustrate over forgetting the most mundane stuff, it reminds me of my faults and to appreciate memories that stick naturally because I know they must've mattered to me, not because they're the after-effects of conscious stamping in my brain. Don't they have a saying, you live for the moments that take your breath away - it wouldn't be the same if those moments were due to you holding your breath would it? Remembering things because they're memorable as opposed to remembering by technique are sort of like that I think.I know I'm saying this because I still have a working and relatively healthy memory. It must be agonizing indeed to have memories slip out of you or your loved ones, but for such cases, I doubt if the techniques mentioned here apply.Definitely overhyped, but I don't feel it's an altogether wasted read either. Feels like a whitewashed Malcolm Gladwell, if you'd asked me. Maybe all journalists write in pretty similar styles?"
267,159420229X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3843117-ensiform,4,"In an instance of participatory journalism (don’t those always seem to lead to much-discussed books?), freelance writer Foer decides to enter the U.S. Memory Championships after covering the event. Under the tutelage of a British memory champ Ed Cook, Foer learns the tricks and techniques that most of the mental athletes use, such as the Major system of pegging letters to numbers, or the PAO system, in which the user associates two-digit numbers with memorable people and actions. Foer does more than just look behind the curtain at the Championships, though; he meets with Anders Ericsson of Florida State, who studies the development of expertise; he meets with Kim Peek, the inspiration for ‘Rain Man;’ he reads the ancients on memory, such as Simonides and his memory palace, or the Rhetorica ad Herennium, which gives tips on memorizing speeches using loci; he meets with guru/PR man Tony Buzan, who claims to help thousands with his Mind Mapping techniques; he reads old case studies, such as that of Russian journalist S who forgot almost nothing; he meets living case studies, such as E.P., who has no working memory.The book is a skilled synthesis of all things related to mnemonics and brain studies, a very readable introduction to the history of memory. Foer tells his story honestly – not always making himself look like the coolest guy in the room in the process – and with an engaging, comfortable prose style. He paces the story well, capping it with his unremarkable showing at the World Championships, but along the way tackles some subjects like a veteran journalist out to break a story: he’s not afraid to show the questionable side of Tony Buzan or supposed Asperger’s savant Daniel Tammet. It’s a compelling narrative as well as a fascinating overview of what we know about memory – and it offers several practical tips to improve the reader’s own memory. It’s well executed and, yes, memorable. "

269,159420229X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/28482493-angus-mckeogh,3,Extremely interesting. The memory is a fickle beast. And this memoir definitely revealed much more of the tricks and techniques that are used to memorize things. Possibly the most fascinating aspect of the book was when he discussed Daniel Tammet. Having already read the latter’s book about his “savant memory” it was incredible to learn Tammet was simply using the same techniques as these other memory performers. Sure wish I wouldn’t have used any space in my brain while reading Tammet’s book. Reminds me a bit of the James Frey debacle with A Million Little Pieces.
270,159420229X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2188450-andrea,4,"I started this one with somewhat lowered expectations, feeling like I was revisiting too-familiar territory. Being the clever woman I am, I had diagnosed a trend of immersive journalism about ""brain sports"" (I just made that term up), profiling the odd sort of people that tend to become obsessive about such things, and learning how to become obsessive oneself. And having spotted this trend, I was (of course) subsequently dismissive, skeptical that this book about memory competition would entertain me any more than similarly themed books like ""Word Freak"" by Stefan Fatsis (about Scrabble) and ""The Kings of New York"" by Michael Weinreb (Chess) already had. (I can't help but assume that, as a journalist, immersing oneself in competitive memory competition would be much more attractive than say, covering Afghanistan or playing for the Detroit Tigers, due to the substantially decreased risk of bodily harm). However, even though the premise was nothing new, I was very entertained by this book. Foer manages to find many fascinating things to say about something that is, at heart, just an extreme version of an everyday human activity - remembering shit. I found myself eager to come back to this book when I had to put it down, and excited to learn more about the subject."
271,159420229X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/26560507-heather,4,"I thoroughly enjoyed this book and couldn't wait to get back into it every time I had to step away. I don't know that it taught me very much (& I have no intention whatsoever to improve my memory using the tactics loosely outlined in this book - not because I don't believe they are effective, but because I don't want to), but it was extremely interesting and kept me engaged the entire time. I also REALLY enjoyed the writing style and hope Joshua Foer plans to write more in the future, because I am eager to read whatever it may be."
272,159420229X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/49415231-amir-tesla,3,"This is not a how-to book as I initially expected but teaches few techniques along the way. It's mostly about the author's quest towards US memory championship. An interesting read, but if you're seeking a manual for memory techniques, it wouldn't suit you. "
273,159420229X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2922699-genia-lukin,3,"Joshua Foer tackles in his book the issues of memory - how it is formed, how it has been lost, and how to improve it. Aside from the anecdotal - the rather interesting glimpse into the world of the mental athletes, amusing to me personally because of my familiarity with (and let's be frank here, membership in) the geeky society at large, Foer also presents the more general - research into memory and amnesia, as well as a historical perspective on the memorisation techniques and learning of the past.In my world, the world of religious Judaism, Torah readings, and extensive familiarity with texts, we still memorize a great deal. So I approached this book with a level of interest especially to the educational and historical aspects of the subject which Foer presents. I also enjoyed the cognitive, but the research he presents is one I am generally familiar with, and thus less interested in, when reading a presentation for the layman. Foer's research is generally good, though oftentimes insufficient. We get a slew of cognitive limitations and some exploration into amnesia - a very interesting chapter in and of itself - but not much about memory research beyond the very generic. We do not see some of the abnormal research into memory done on various sub-populations, except a tiny glimpse into savants, which are a somewhat different phenomenon, and even then the glimpse is mostly one of disillusionment.However, I can't help but agree with Foer intellectually when he makes his educational claims concerning the point that, for any person to think creatively and analytically, he first has to supply himself with basic facts which can be retrieved and analysed. If you do not know the basic material, the ground rules, or the structure of a subject, you then have nothing to analyse, nothing to expand upon, nothing to create with. If you can't remember the shape of an object you can't draw it, and if you can't remember the points of disagreement between two ideologies you cannot judge them.The parts pertaining to the memory sport itself, somehow, interested me less. It is still in the realm of the esoteric - as Foer himself claims - and card memorisation and the ability to recite long poems after fifteen minutes still would not help us - or him - find his car keys, Still, this is an interesting and important book, especially for people without the academic background, because it provides yet another glimpse into how our minds work, or don't work, and what we do, or don't do, with them."
274,159420229X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/80375046-shnila-parveen,2," In Plato’s Phaedrus, Socrates describes how the Egyptian god Theuth, inventor of writing, came to Thamus, the king of Egypt, and offered to bestow his wonderful invention upon the Egyptian people. “Here is a branch of learning that will ... improve their memories,” Theuth said to the Egyptian king. “My discovery provides a recipe for both memory and wisdom.” But Thamus was reluctant to accept the gift. “If men learn this, it will implant forgetfulness in their souls,” he told the god. “They will cease to exercise their memory and become forgetful; they will rely on that which is written, calling things to remembrance no longer from within themselves, but by means of external marks. What you have discovered is a recipe not for memory, but for reminding. And it is no true wisdom that you offer your disciples, but only its semblance, for by telling them of many things without teaching them anything, you will make them seem to know much, while for the most part they will know nothing. And as men filled not with wisdom but with the conceit of wisdom, they will be a burden to their fellow-men. What is the importance of memory in present times of technology making information available on our fingertips? Is it crucial for our cognitive capabilities or just futile endeavor? These are difficult questions that are not answered in this book. The author has however admitted that the memory hacks he learnt for the memory championships do not really improve the memory in general. After securing a good ranking in the European Memory Championship, Author forgot that he drove his car to the party celebrating his victory and took the Subway instead. There is no refuting the fact that the importance of human memory has marginalized in last couple of decades. One of the important reasons why I started writing reviews, first in private notes and then in Goodread is because I started to realize that I do not retain much from the books that I was reading. It seemed like an act of idle indulgence of absorbing someone else’s work without adding anything of my own. My views were there for a moment but would disappear as if I had none. By writing a review, I am not just an idle reader anymore but I am adding something of my own to the reading. Since I usually write my reviews after finishing the book, it also becomes an act of active recall, one of the memory techniques I believe works for me. For how long though, cannot be sure. Few year ago, I used to watch BBC’s Sherlock Holmes TV series where the lead character had mind palaces helping him recall the most miniscule things in excruciating detail. I presumed it as one of the quirks of the eccentric character. It was while reading this book that I got to know that memory palace is a legitimate and widely used memory hack, used by the participants of the memory championships. Although I don’t find a practical use of it in my day to day life. An interesting piece is on the analysis of Odyssey and Illiad. There are theories that claim that these famous poems were not written by one person but rather passed on years after years by way as loose collection of songs. The structure of poems is such that it seems to have been evolved for being memorized and later with the invention of writing, compiled together in its current form. The brain best remembers things that are repeated, rhythmic, rhyming, structured, and above all easily visualized. The only thing I did not like about this book is its deceptive title which would pass it of as a self-help book. This book is not a self-help book. Joshua Foer participated in US and European Memory Championship as part of his article in something called as participatory journalism. He met some unique set of people, discovered unusual things about memory and went on to win the memory championship. There are a lot of negative reviews about this book, which are accurate but are not substantial when you read this book with an open mind to learn something about an unusual subject. Memorizing has earned a bad reputation as an absence of real intellect and just a way to hold on to information for clearing the next exam. Its cause it not helped by the fact that the people with amazing memories have not made much in life and have resorted to self-help guru bluff. Memory does not help you become good at something. Instead mastering something breeds a better memory."

It never occurred to me that there was this kind of mental superpower that we could all have.Told by a journalist intrigued by memory competitions, Moonwalking with Einstein was simple and light to read. This was a story of his own journey into the world of mental athletes, and him taking a go at it himself.We are brought with him in his journey to find out what this is. Before the creation of the printing press, our world did not have the means we have today, to store our information. It was up to us to memorize what we learned especially if we wanted to pass it down onto the next generation. Tales and stories were made to keep these memories alive. Little did I know, that the small memory competitions today are so minuscule compared to the world before where memory palaces and techniques were as common as writing today.What is so empowering about this book is that he shows us, we can all create our own memory palaces if we would just put the time at it. We could know by heart the stories, the quotes, the places we would want to keep in our minds forever. I learned that memory is not a test of intellect but of creativity. We don’t have to be mental athletes who can memorize thousands of numbers or random words in minutes. But we can use these techniques for remembering the things we actually want to remember.Towards the end of the book, we are called on to remember because “how we perceive the world and act In it are products of how and what we remember”And if you feel daunted by the task to establish more memories, remember memory is not as much due to intellect as it is due to creativity. 4.5 Stars"

Moonwalking is really not that bad once you get past some utterly boring reportage about a group of obsessives who go in for memory competitions around the world. Foer initially covered one of these competitions as a reporter, became involved himself and determined to win the next year’s US competition. In the process, he delves into sometimes-amusing, but more often tedious, investigations into the place of memory in our society. There are some nice observations - on the difference between knowledge and memory, or about memory once being fundamental to the preservation of knowledge, but no longer being much needed in a literate society with an abundance of stored information (first on scrolls, then books, and now the Internet). But the book suffers from an overly-journalistic style and it reads like an extended magazine article. First-person investigational stuff with some random historical/scientific filler: easy to browse, easy to skip over; but don't look for anything about the art of how to put the memory techniques into practice (it’s apparently a well-known system called “Memory Palace”), this is just Foer’s experience of doing it. So, is it any use? Well Foer himself finds that memory-improving techniques are not much good for anything more than lists and succeeding at memory competitions.I certainly would not find memorizing “memorable” images any easier than remembering the facts themselves – holy crap, how much time and effort would it take to dream up the images, associate them somehow with the thing-to-be-remembered and then recall the connection later, so that one would remember the “thing” and not just the mental image?? In short, not really worth 200 pages. Two stars may sound a little mingy, but it’s ultimately a bit boring."

They do things like memorize 20thousand digits of pi or memorize the order of a deck of cards in a very short amount of time or memorize a long sequence of numbers or letters or words or pretty much anything for almost no reason at all. There's even something called the US Memory Championship (which the author won and that's not even really a spoiler) and also the World Memory Championship (in which Americans always do poorly, to my ever-expanding shame.)Foer escorts the reader on not only a stunt journalism-type memoir of his time training for and competing in these competitions, but also on a journey through the brain, in an Oliver Sacks-esque exploration of all the weird, quirky things a memory does or can do.Did you know that the guy from Rain Man is a real guy? You probably did. He is not the same person as Dustin Hoffman, though. He is his very own person and he is named Kim Peek and despite his ability to multiple huge numbers in his head and to calculate the dates of all the Easter Sundays in the history of Easter Sundays and despite his incredible memory, he had an IQ of only 87. And only just now am I realizing that Peek is now dead, which makes me sad. The point is, Peek was a savant, sometimes even called a megasavant, which is like a savant². Did you know there is another guy named Daniel Tammet who claims to be a megasavant but is probably just a faker?And now you, yes YOU, can fake being a savant if you read this book. You can learn how to construct imaginary things called memory palaces which will give you the incredible power of nigh-perfect memory.

That shelf looks pretty bare.I saw this book appear in my feeds once and the title certainly caught my attention. This is a story about a journalists journey from reporting on the US and World memory competition one year, to competing in it the following year. In his first year reporting the event, Joshua Foer began to understand that all of the participants at the event weren't savants or incredibly smart, they pretty much all had a system that made remembering pi to the 2000 digit more of a trick than an IQ measure. Armed with this info, Joshua embarks on a journey to see if he can build a memory system to allow him to remember 100 names and faces, recall a deck of cards and report back, (I can't remember how many, ironic i know) a large number chain.THIS IS NOT A SELF HELP BOOK. If you are going to read this to learn how to become better at remembering names when going into meetings (this is me) you are not going to be taught how to do it. What this book does do is give you the history of memory systems, going way way back to the ancient Greeks. He interviews people from the US and the UK with all sorts of fascinating memory disorders, he covers how Tony Buzon has made over 300 million dollars in self help books, using memory techniques that have been around for thousands of years. Joshua spends time with a couple of memory champions and the begin to help him learn his system so that he can compete in the following years memory contest. The system is very simple, what isn't simple is the practice to make it work. So thankfully Foer doesn't spend too much time talking about practice, but he does give the strong impression that he is spending at least an hour a day memorising his system. A third of the way through the book, he does give an example how anyone can learn a system quickly. I was listening to this on audio (which is very well narrated, except for the typically poor english accent that Mike Chamberlain does) whilst driving and we are told how to use the 'loqi' or 'memory palace' to remember some random items. Now this part of the book was day one of a 4 day business trip, it was 6 days ago and I can still recall all ten items mentioned with no problem at all, including 'peat smoked salmon' and 'email Sophia'. My visualization of cottage cheese on the front door step of the house i grew up in is one I enjoy re-visualizing. It involves Nicole Kidman and thats about as much as I am going to divulge here.This is not a how to help improve your memory, but it does give you a big slice of the systems used and everything you would need to help you improve can be found on the mnemonics wiki site. I wasn't sure what to expect when reading this, I was happily surprised to have really enjoyed it. A very well written docu/journalistic article on memory, paced very well with some fascinating facts and figures. This book was much more than I had hoped for and so have no qualms about giving it 4 stars. "
280,159420229X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/38618130-azaa-kh,5,"A very misleading title, but the content was not a disappointment. ""Experience is the sum of our memories and wisdom the sum of our experiences"" If we follow this logic, we gain wisdom through our memories. And yet, memorization has been largely criticized by many school officials and educators that it kills creativity and critical thinking. But what this book points out, which I completely agree, is the fact that memorization is never really taught in schools. Instead, they make students memorize a bunch of unimportant facts through rote memorization without teaching how to retain the information, and that is what is corrupting our education system but not the memorization itself. In fact, the book reasons that learning and memorization come hand-in-hand, so you cannot get one without the other. This has completely changed my perspective on memorization.Another interesting fact pointed out in this book was that we can make our lives seem longer through varying our life experiences. This may sound contradictory at first because when we have fewer things to do, time does not seem to move at all. However, the study shows that it is the contrary: In 1962, a researcher named, Michel Siffre, conducted a self-experimentation by spending two months in a cave without access to a clock, calendars, or the Sun. As time went on, his memory deteriorated and lost track of the passage of time. After two months, when he finally got out of the cave, he thought that only a month had passed. This suggested the hypothesis that the less we experience, the shorter the time seems to fly, so according to this hypothesis, to stretch our psychological time, we will need to create new memories that play as anchor points in our lives.Last but not least, the book also illustrates how we attain new skills and reach beyond our limits. I personally think this was the most important topic discussed in this book. When we learn a new skill, we progress through three stages: cognitive stage, associative stage, and autonomous stage. The cognitive stage is where all the learning occurs and the skill is developed rapidly. In this stage, a person fully focuses on the task consciously and intellectually discovers new strategies to get the task done. But once we pass this stage and become good enough, what we do becomes so autonomous or unconscious that we do not even have to use our intellects anymore. This is what the book calls the OK plateau, the period in which we see almost no growth because we are merely following our unconscious process. So to go beyond our limits, we need to stay in the cognitive stage and continuously develop our capabilities. There's a saying ""Practice makes it perfect"", but how we practice is more important than the amount we practice, and only when it is the concentrated, self-conscious, and deliberated kind of practice, we will not be restrained by our limits anymore.Overall, I'd suggest this book for anyone who wants to improve their learning process.

281,159420229X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4252261-tom-la,4,"Truly excellent work of participatory journalism. The author set out to explore the world of ""memory competitions"", and from there he made himself the subject of a study on skills-improvement, to the point that he won a national memory competition. This book paints a high-level fresco on the subject of human memory: the history of how we recall things, how massively that has changed throughout the centuries, and how some ancient memory techniques (almost forgotten today) are surprisingly efficient still today, and available to anyone, not only for people with a ""strong memory"". - the topic is fascinating and important for our understanding of ourselves;- the book is well written, although a little too MalcolmGladwellesque at points (Oxf. cit. ""to write like Malcom Gladwell"" = to make a big entertaining fuss about something without actually saying much, and make it sound much more exciting than what it actually is through the use of anecdotes, humour and trivia)- I noticed some references to the content of ""Talent is overrated"" by Geoff Colvin, especially for what concerns the topic of skills improvement- some of the techniques described, like the ""memory palace"" technique, were new to me, and... well, unforgettable. Sorry, I was hoping I would get through this review without any stupid pun.- Daniel Tammet, the alleged savant author of ""Born on a blue day"", might be a complete or partial fraud. Difficult to prove, but Foer has a good point there.Important note: if you are looking for a book to teach you some memory techniques, this is probably not the best book for you, because this one includes many general explanations on various related topics and also some personal stories from the author's life. He does quote several other books that are specifically meant to teach memory techniques."

That might be where I previously read a chunk of this book when it came out in 2011, illustrating one of the memory principles it explains: our memories are great at recognizing things we've seen before, even if we wouldn't have been able to recall them otherwise.The title comes from the memory technique Foer learned to compete as a ""mental athlete"" after finding out such a thing existed in the course of researching an article he was writing. The technique is the memory palace, in which you attach vivid mental pictures to specific spots in a location you know well. To memorize esoteric things like the digits of pi or the order of a deck of cards, you first learn to give each digit or card a constant image you'll always associate with it (or three, as Foer learned from European competitors, who use POA - person, object, action).Like those long magazine articles, the book has layers - the memoir of how he went from regular guy to memory champion, the history and science of memory and memorization, and some specifics on how to actually use the techniques. These things are braided together, contributing to the reading experience of being pulled along through the book, but occasionally frustrating when I wanted a deeper dive into a specific, like in the chapter about memorizing poetry that almost seemed like it was going to tell me something new but switched to another strand right before the juicy part.The great takeaway from this book is that anyone can learn to use ancient techniques and take advantage of how our brains evolved to work. The focus of these memory competitors is trivial - who cares about the order of a deck of cards? - but the ideas in the book can be applied anywhere. "

You see I am a big language enthusiast. At one point or another you can find me studying French, Japanese, or Swedish, and as many language students will tell you, learning that pesky grammar or vocabulary can be exhausting. You can be drilling the same set of words entire night, remember them for the next morning’s test, and then forget them completely by suppertime. To our great frustration, human brains are built to form only the fun, unique experiences into long-term memories, and to toss the mundane, boring, rarely-used stuff into the pits of obscurity.

Americans seldom win or place in the world memory championship. We have so much information at our fingertips, that we really do not use need to use our memory much at all in today’s world and seemingly find it ‘normal’ to lose words, names and events more frequently.

289,159420229X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/16275106-pamela,5,"Josh Foer was a 25-year-old college graduate working as a freelance journalist and living with his parents in his childhood home when he first began the research that eventually led to this book and took him on a personal odyssey on the nature of memory. It began casually with an internet search for the smartest person in the world until he found himself at the USA Memory Championship writing an article for Slate about this little known contest and the collection of memory wizards who participated in it. In the course of the next year, he was to meet a strange collection of American and European, as well as other International memory competitors and learn the secrets of their unique abilities that go all the way back to ancient Greece with only slight changes along the way to our own times. He was even to become a competitor himself but to find out how he did when he finally competed in the USA Championship you will have to read the book yourself.Moonwalking With Einstein is a fascinating look at the brain and how it stores memory. Foer touches on all known aspects of this from history and the whys and hows of oral history and the transmission of knowledge before reading and writing to the impact of Gutenberg on memory. He discusses some strange and bizarre brain problems that have unusual effects on memory and the various techniques that mnemonists use to help them make such amazing feats of memorization. Of particular interest is the memory palace. There is also an interesting discussion of the types of memory and what is known about how they work and why we can recite a complete and complicated piece of poetry but can't find our car keys or even remember where we parked the car in the first place. Or what we had for lunch yesterday or when Grandma's birthday is but can name all the Presidents in order. This was a terrific read but Einstein actually had nothing to do with it except as a memory picture. I thoroughly enjoyed it but don't ask me about it next week because I probably won't remember!"
290,159420229X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5650130-david-sheppard,5,"This is one of those rare books that is not only a joy to read, but also immensely helpful. It can help all of us with something that is at once troublesome and worrisome: our memory. It does this with ease, not teaching us some grueling rote memory technique, but one that is easy, natural and intuitive. Yet Moonwalking with Einstein turns out to not be exclusively a how-to book on memory. So what is it? Well, yes, it is about memory and how to improve it, but it is at once a history of techniques, a description of what memory is and what can go wrong with it, and also a running narrative of how the author, a journalist himself with no special memory skills, becomes one of the most proficient memory athletes in America. I'd learned a mnemonic device to aid memorization decades ago while in college, and found it to be helpful, but for some reason I'd abandoned the technique once I graduated. But Moonwalking with Einstein expands the mnemonic technique I learned back then by use of something of which I'd never heard: the ""Memory Palace."" The Memory Palace exploits our inherent skill for remembering images and spatial locations, harnesses these two abilities we all posses in abundance, and relates them to the memorization of numbers, lists and assortments of other difficult to remember items. The amazing thing is that the Memory Palace not only makes memorization easy, it also makes it fun. What makes the book so interesting is that it is narrative non-fiction and reads like a novel. The author locks his conflict with his own memory early on, gives a sense of rising tension as he accumulates the forces to overcome its limitations, and resolves this internal conflict at the end when he participates in the US Memory Championship. I didn't read it as urgently as I did today's number one bestseller, Laura Hillenbrand's Unbroken, but still, I couldn't put it down. In Chapter Five, I scanned the ""to-do"" list of fifteen items on pages 92/3 that the author had to memorize in his initial attempt, and developed the technique for myself as I read about the author memorizing it. As my Memory Palace, I used an old home of a high school friend with which I was still familiar, constructing useful details as I went. When I had finished reading about the author memorizing the list (took me about five minutes), I had memorized it myself, and I found that the items were not only immediately memorable, but that the list of items and their sequence was still with me days later, and so imbedded in my memory that I'm sure I'll ever forget it. All this, I accomplished effortlessly. This is a truly remarkable feat for me because I'm almost seventy years old and have chronic fatigue syndrome, which adversely affects all aspects of my memory. It has also given me hope that I might finally learn ancient Greek. I tried to learn it several years ago, but found building a vocabulary so difficult that I abandoned the project. Rote memory was just too much trouble. I am interested in all things Greek, and as it turns out, the Memory Palace technique was invented in the fifth century BC by Simonides following his narrow escape from the collapse of a building. This in itself is a story you'll be interested in reading about. The author says that since the time of this ancient Greek, ""the art of memory has been about creating architectural spaces in the imagination."" Having been to Greece twice and written a 480 page travel journal on the subject, (Oedipus On A Pale Horse: Greek Journey In Search Of A Personal Mythology) I have all the makings of a superb Greek Memory Palace. While traveling around Greece and the western coast of Turkey for ten weeks, I visited many cities and islands: Athens, Thebes, Delphi, Ithaca, Mykonos, Delos, Santorini, etc. I can't count all the archaeological sites I visited. What I'm creating isn't just any old Memory Palace but actually a Memory Country. Within each location, I can identify as many locations for storing words and meanings as I need. But not only that, I can also use characters from Greek mythology to create actions and images to reinforce the material, as the author suggests. All this constitutes my Greek Memory Palace: the location where I will store ancient Greek words and meanings as I learn the language, in accordance with the instructions learned in Moonwalking with Einstein. None of it was difficult. I picked it up as I read the book. The author describes how in the past people viewed their minds as something to perfect by loading it with all sorts of intellectual material. ""People used to labor to furnish their minds. They invested in the acquisition of memories the same way we invest in the acquisition of things."" [page 134] Some even believed that ""the art of memory was a secret key to unlocking the occult structure of the universe."" [page 151] This has given me an entirely new view of how to perceive my own mind and nourish it in the future. The author also discusses how we came to lose touch with our ability to remember with the invention of the printed word. The history of that estrangement and how inventions like Wikipedia and the Internet foster that estrangement is a very interesting story. The author makes the reader aware of what is happening to us and provides a way to project ourselves into the future without suffering so much of technology's debilitating effects. Perhaps the reason this book is so successful is that the reader never loses sight of the practical use of the information the author is providing because the author is discovering it himself and actively making use of it in his quest to make it into the US Memory Championship. This is an important book. Everyone can benefit from reading it. "

I had hoped to get more background information on the memory techniques, how our brain works, etc. but instead it there was too much information in it that I, personally, just did not find relevant. For example, I'm just not interested in the individual memory champions (if I were, I would read their memoirs), or that he asked Daniel Tammet what the number 9,412 looked to him three times. I get that Foer, a journalist, did this with the intention of finding truth and, possibly, debunking a fraud. Still, while I have no idea whether Tammet is a fraud or not, I can say that this and other behaviours and comments made Foer seem pretty annoying.In another review, I read that this book reads like an overlong magazine article and I guess that's true: it did feel pretty drawn out and like a magazine article that was watered down and stretched out so it could become a book.

The author's journey over the course of one year, from 'journalist scraping by' to America's National Memory Champion, is as exciting as it is informative. Highly recommend for anyone who want to learn about how to improve their memory, understand the research behind 'memory savants', or simply enjoy the unique story of the esoteric competitions between 'mental athletes'."

294,159420229X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/8187431-rade,4,"“Forgotten phone numbers and birthdays represent minor erosions of our everyday memory, but they are part of a much larger story of how we've supplanted our own natural memory with a vast superstructure of technological crutches—from the alphabet to the BlackBerry. These technologies of storing information outside our minds have helped make our modern world possible, but they've also changed how we think and how we use our brains.” I loved this book. Not because it offers insights to some unbelievable profound ideas but because it talks about our brains and how we use it to remember things. The thing about our brain is that it is a giant muscle and the more you work on it the bigger it gets. The bigger it gets, the more it remembers. The book is so much more than Foer's journey to understand what it means to be a mental athlete and eventually what it means to think in a way they do. It also goes back to a time when people like monks used various techniques to not only remember stuff short term, but to imprint it in their minds so they can recall it at any time, on any day, making writing new hymns and lectures easier. This was a time when technology was almost nonexistent. Books, while rare were also very hard to have at hand when searching religious text. When one had a copy, he would spend hours if not days going back and fourth trying to put together a sermon. This is one of the reasons people looked into ways of storing this type of information in their brain so life could be a bit easier. One of the techniques that these mental athletes use today is the whole idea of a memory palace, a way of dividing your brain into separate rooms in as many houses as possible and storing things in there so you can recall it later. The way one does it is not to say ""buy a new jacket"" as a to do item, but to make it as descriptive as possible. It is better to imagine an alligator wearing a warm jacket while fishing on a chilly winter day as that sticks better in your mind. Our minds are not bad at remembering but they are bad at recalling because remembering to buy bread and butter at a supermarket is something we did a hundred times therefore, it doesn't stick out, and it is pushed aside and eventually (in a week or even less), forgotten. Some people sometimes had to pray and beg for forgiveness when they found out that using sexual imagery helps them recall information better because it sticks faster. Now in order to remember that I have to buy yogurt, I just need to picture Megan Fox swimming in it while munching an all American burger and I am golden haha Seriously though, it takes a lot of practice and patience to do this type of thing. It is achievable but most people don't have the time or patience to do it. Foer did it but it did not come out of nowhere. He had a help of some of the people who competed in these mental athlete challenges and they pushed him and couched him on what to do and what not to do when one finds himself off track and wondering aimlessly around. SPOILER WARNING: At the end of the book Foer won this mental athlete event but he said that since we have so many ways of writing stuff down (especially phones as most people carry it on them all day long), this use of remembering stuff is not needed. It is nice but he said he does not use his mental techniques any more (at least not much) as we have other ways of keeping records and finding information that was once very hard to track down. Again, this is a great book and I really enjoyed it as the author did not just go into his life but set a bunch of chapters to discuss historical figures who used these types of techniques to make it easier to recall stuff during their every day activities. I kind of wish he went further into it but a succinct summery is better than no summary at all. "
295,159420229X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1231090-jud-barry,4,"You have to love a book written by someone who, fresh from winning the U.S. Memory Championship, takes mass transit home because he’s forgotten that he drove. He didn’t just forget where he parked—he forgot that he drove.In this inspiriting book, Joshua Foer shows how he — a person of decidedly unprodigious memory — learns some well-established mnemonic techniques, practices them for a half hour a day over the course of a year, and winds up winning the national memory contest (by, among other things, memorizing a deck of cards in record time).Along the way to the championship, Foer provides his own color commentary by discussing the phenomenon of memory — and by describing the lives of people who are real memory phenomena, like Kim “Rain Man” Peek, the savant who, despite having an I.Q. of just 87, absorbed information, retained it, and recalled it without effort; or the unnamed individual EP, afflicted with complete amnesia as a result of brain damage caused by herpes simplex.Even more colorful are the idiosyncratic “mental athletes” who steer Foer in the direction of the championship. Among them is Tony Buzan, the flamboyant minter of a “mind mapping” technique that, well, made him a mint and gave him grandiose ideas of reforming education.The techniques, it turns out, have been in use since antiquity. Before the ready availability of and access to books, learning involved training the memory to retrieve information. The ancient Greeks began to explore ways of using the capabilities of the brain to recall “architectural” memories as a means of building virtual “memory palaces” in the mind. These virtual buildings are where memories —often given arbitrary but colorful personalities and attributes — are stored for later retrieval.(One of the most fun aspects of the book is how Foer enlists the reader to use this technique to memorize a shopping list. Read this book and you will effortlessly—and probably forever—recall his list: pickled garlic, cottage cheese, peat-smoked salmon, 6 bottles of white wine, 3 pairs of socks, and email for Sophia.)The process requires focused effort and some creativity, and, when you think that what’s stored isn’t the raw memory itself but a tarted-up decoy that lures you to the place where the memory resides, not everyone has felt the extra baggage to be worth the effort. The Chinese, for example, were exposed to these techniques by Jesuit missionaries in the 16th century but decided that rote learning was “simpler and faster.”In ""Moonwalking with Einstein,"" Foer does a masterful job of using memory (or the lack of it) as the foil for an exploration not only the human brain but the human condition as well. What is consciousness? What is learning? What is creativity? How do we best educate ourselves? How does technology influence the ways in which we think about things, and how do the ways in which we think about things define us?And fortunately, if you don’t have the memory of a London cabdriver but need to navigate your way back to Giordano Bruno’s memory wheel, there is an index."

The case of someone who kept forgetting things the moment they happened (like in the movie Memento), along with the recent reports of Gabriel Garcia Marquez' dementia, also made me concerned about memory's place and role in our lives. The most interesting part for me was about the author voicing his doubts and laying his case over 'savant' Daniel Tammet, of Born on a Blue Day: Inside the Extraordinary Mind of an Autistic Savant. Then again, not that I really care enough about who's right and wrong in this case, since to me, the training required to develop the ability to remember like trained memory experts take out the joy in experiencing natural flow in life. Even as I frustrate over forgetting the most mundane stuff, it reminds me of my faults and to appreciate memories that stick naturally because I know they must've mattered to me, not because they're the after-effects of conscious stamping in my brain. Don't they have a saying, you live for the moments that take your breath away - it wouldn't be the same if those moments were due to you holding your breath would it? Remembering things because they're memorable as opposed to remembering by technique are sort of like that I think.I know I'm saying this because I still have a working and relatively healthy memory. It must be agonizing indeed to have memories slip out of you or your loved ones, but for such cases, I doubt if the techniques mentioned here apply.Definitely overhyped, but I don't feel it's an altogether wasted read either. Feels like a whitewashed Malcolm Gladwell, if you'd asked me. Maybe all journalists write in pretty similar styles?"

Under the tutelage of a British memory champ Ed Cook, Foer learns the tricks and techniques that most of the mental athletes use, such as the Major system of pegging letters to numbers, or the PAO system, in which the user associates two-digit numbers with memorable people and actions. Foer does more than just look behind the curtain at the Championships, though; he meets with Anders Ericsson of Florida State, who studies the development of expertise; he meets with Kim Peek, the inspiration for ‘Rain Man;’ he reads the ancients on memory, such as Simonides and his memory palace, or the Rhetorica ad Herennium, which gives tips on memorizing speeches using loci; he meets with guru/PR man Tony Buzan, who claims to help thousands with his Mind Mapping techniques; he reads old case studies, such as that of Russian journalist S who forgot almost nothing; he meets living case studies, such as E.P., who has no working memory.The book is a skilled synthesis of all things related to mnemonics and brain studies, a very readable introduction to the history of memory. Foer tells his story honestly – not always making himself look like the coolest guy in the room in the process – and with an engaging, comfortable prose style. He paces the story well, capping it with his unremarkable showing at the World Championships, but along the way tackles some subjects like a veteran journalist out to break a story: he’s not afraid to show the questionable side of Tony Buzan or supposed Asperger’s savant Daniel Tammet. It’s a compelling narrative as well as a fascinating overview of what we know about memory – and it offers several practical tips to improve the reader’s own memory.

And this memoir definitely revealed much more of the tricks and techniques that are used to memorize things. Possibly the most fascinating aspect of the book was when he discussed Daniel Tammet. Having already read the latter’s book about his “savant memory” it was incredible to learn Tammet was simply using the same techniques as these other memory performers. Sure wish I wouldn’t have used any space in my brain while reading Tammet’s book. Reminds me a bit of the James Frey debacle with A Million Little Pieces.
