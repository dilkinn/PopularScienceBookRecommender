0,0393350363,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4213258-bradley,3,"Like all of Tyson's books, it's very well written, explaining any number of difficult subjects with clarity and ease, but unfortunately, with this subject, we devolve into a catalogue of cultural significance for the poor demoted Pluto and a very long list of rather humorous emails and letters all sent to Tyson because of his role in the decision.If that's what you're looking for, then, by all means, enjoy this book!But if you're looking for an in-depth rather than an adequate focus on Pluto rather than our cultural reactions to the planet, then perhaps you should look elsewhere.I'm not saying this book wasn't fun... and the politics of science and all those pooooooor schoolchildren writing Tyson was both humorous and slightly off-putting at the same time... but it wasn't so much about science as it was about justifying (rightly so, in my opinion,) the need to pluto Pluto. RIP.Or rather... go play with your new Kuiper buddies. ;)"
1,0393350363,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3461034-trish,4,"I wanted to read something by Neil deGrasse Tyson for a long time. I like how he can break complex matters up and present them in a way that children and laymen can understand them (there is a famous quote saying that you yourself have only understood a matter if you're capable of explaining it in simple terms).This is probably the lightest of books by this author and people should know that going it. It's ""only"" about Pluto and that whole mess after it got declassified from ""planet"" to ""dwarf planet"".Seriously though?! I don't know what the problem is. In fact, I didn't even know about all the controversy and the backlash until I saw an interview about three weeks ago in which deGrasse Tyson made jokes about it! Sure, the declassification itself was on the news here as well, but it was backed with scientific reasons so nobody had a real problem with it. It just meant that the old mnemonic rhyme didn't work anymore. It's the way of science: it's not infallible and theories/classifications/procedures have to be adapted or even abandoned, deal with it! *shrugs*In the US, however, people apparently lost their shit and had to exaggerate again. Thus, this book is full of letters the author received from school children to their teachers and other adults, of articles and other stuff in which deGrasse Tyson was blamed and even downright attacked (almost treated as if he had killed Pluto, in fact). It also contains a lot of cartoons from around the time the declassification took place. One of them is a real gem:BWAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA!However, the book is not only about pop culture and social backlash, it's also about Pluto's history and some scientific background about the dwarf planet, though I have to admit that the history and science could have been a little more dominant.Overall, it's a funny book (yes, I'm laughing at other people's stupidity, sue me) that has a nice design and is easy and fast to read. Nothing like a real science book but that is also neither its purpose nor what it was advertised as."
2,0393350363,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1072582-kaethe-douglas,5,"Here's a topic that isn't often covered: how museums design their exhibits. You know what else isn't often covered: how science happens. There are myriad books about discoverers and discoveries, and many about new fields as they develop. But this is the only time I can recall reading a book on the evolving science behind an issue like Is Pluto a planet? And although the book isn't specifically targeting a young readership, I think it could be wonderfully popular with middle school readers, because 1) Neil deGrasse Tyson is amusing 2) he is very good at explaining things, and 3) students are featured commentators.I'm not going to try to summarize the book, because it's a quick read, and highly enjoyable, and is itself a summary of more than a hundred years of astronomy. I loved it, as did my middle-school child who wants to design robots for NASA one day.Word of warning, though: don't read the absurdly long photo captions if you're actually reading the text.Library copy"
3,0393350363,http://goodreads.com/user/show/119361-ken,1,"ugh... awfully light book on what really be a weighty tome. felt like a long article in time magazine or something, where it might scratch the surface of a subject, but you don't really get a whole understanding of the topic. filled with way too many 'extras': political cartoons, appendixes of song lyrics, full page portraits of the little girl who suggested the name, etc... i mean seriously, just get on with it. when you remove the quotes and pictures and figures, it's what, maybe like 50 pages or so, of a very large font. cheaply designed as well, almost as if it was actually designed in microsoft word.oh, and content? author seems really defensive at times. what did he expect, really. it was his decisions at the american museum of natural history that more or less got the controversy going.now, i was always pro-pluto, but i was looking forward to reading a hefty tome on the reasoning behind the reclassification. what i got what was an amateurish-feeling publication.i say skip it and read wikipedia instead."
4,0393350363,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5204784-vonia,3,"I admit I did not thoroughly read this. I am not a science person at all (Yes, I realize I appear to be Asian). Most of the information went over my head. I recognize that Tyson is not only one of the foremost scientists today, but also one of the more easily understood ones. I suppose I am that dense when it comes to the hard sciences. Give me psychology, sociology, philosophy, I would stun you with my brain. Start giving me numbers and symbols, the solar system, energy, elements, gravity, I will fade into the background. It is saying something, then, that at least the vague themes discussed were not lost on me. Maybe one day I will invest a lot more time and effort into studying this, but until then the magnificent illustrations and Tyson's picture with Pluto the Dog made my day. "
5,0393350363,http://goodreads.com/user/show/19115189-dj,4,"deGrasse Tyson proves that while he might not be the smartest man in the United States, he is one of the best scientist at making what at first glance could be a daunting project for the uninitiated to read both understandable and enjoyable. With this the second of this Astrophysicists books and it has determined me to read anything that I can find under his pen. His delivery makes it easy to read some of the most complex subjects in a clear and easy to read manner. While this book is about the discussion/argument on whether or not Pluto is a planet. It also brings out the more important and for my own part the lack of solid definition of what a planet is. While the emotion seems to be centered on Pluto, which I must admit if I was ever asked would probably have been listed as my favorite planet, and since it is now called a Dwarf Planet, could still be that. This bias is only due to reading a book on the search for Planet X when I was in Grade School. This book also touches on what to define the other occupants of our Solar System. Since Jupiter is so obviously different from Earth a change of nomenclature certainly wouldn't be out of hand. While the author stated early on that he was in favor of demoting Pluto from a planet, he doesn't present a one sided discussion of the case and, with a few exceptions, presents those on both sides of the argument with an even hand. The descriptions of some of the emails and letters he received in the process of this debate go a long way to adding a sense of the unreal as well as a great deal of humor on the subject. All in all, whether you care if Pluto is a planet or not, this is a fun read. I recommend it highly. "

7,0393350363,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1787047-carolyn-stein,4,"Another guilty pleasure. Neil deGrasse Tyson always writes well. This time he is less concerned with science education than he is with describing the shared cultural mania that resulted from rebranding Pluto a plutoid. The story begins with the fallout of the exhibit he put together at the Hayden Planetarium in the new Rose Center for Earth and Space. His team presented the planets as members of families of object with similar properties rather than as orbs to be memorized. Pluto was firmly placed amongst the Kuiper Belt objects. This exhibit launched a rancorous debate on whether Pluto should be designated as a planet or something else after a headline in the New York Times read: ""Pluto's Not a Planet? Only in New York"". Surprisingly the public took sides in the debate and he received hate mail about his contribution to the discussion from elementary school children and others around the world. He reports that he was ""branded a public enemy of Pluto lovers the world over"". It is a very entertaining read and laugh-out-loud funny in spots. He describes the history and discovery of Pluto, what is known about the planet itself, and he describes the viewpoints of the various sides in the scientific and cultural debate quite well. He quotes headlines, comics, and cites other sources that illustrates the zeitgeist surrounding the demotion of Pluto.My favorite bit comes toward the end of the book:""Meanwhile, those people in society who would credit or blame the cosmos, and not themselves, for their financial affairs and love life were split on what impact an official statement to demote Pluto would have on their horoscope casting. The day after the IAU vote, a story in the Wall Street Journal by Jane Spencer appeared, under the title “Pluto’s Demotion Divides Astrologers.” The widely reprinted article cites the American Federation of Astrologers and the Astrological Association of Great Britain as standing firmly by Pluto, asserting that the icy orb is a full-blown planet, maintaining a powerful pull on our psyche, despite the IAU vote to the contrary. Then comes my favorite line: ""'Whether he’s a planet, an asteroid, or a radioactive matzo ball, Pluto has proven himself worthy of a permanent place in all horoscopes,' says Shelley Ackerman, columnist for the spirituality Web site Beliefnet.com. ""The article goes on to quote Ms. Ackerman criticizing the IAU for not including astrologers in its decision. It further quotes Eric Francis, of Planetwaves.net, which represents a subgroup of these medieval prognosticators known as minor-planet astrologers: 'This is a moment that I’ve been waiting for for a long time,' Francis remarks as he welcomes Ceres, Eris, and Charon to the ranks of dwarf planets, granting horoscope charts extra ways for believers to cede control of their lives to the universe.""I cannot see reading the book again. It's really not the sort of book you plan to go back to, but I don't regret a minute of the enjoyable time I spent with it."
8,0393350363,http://goodreads.com/user/show/21324-amanda,5,"Tyson is always a favorite guest on The Daily Show and this book was discussed on his last interview with Jon Stewart. Library to the rescue!There are 9 chapters to this fairly short book, all done with wit and an obvious love of science. Tyson goes over Pluto's history, how Pluto was received in our culture, and the descent of how Pluto lost his status as our 9th planet.Apparently Americans really love Pluto, not only because of it's association with Disney's dog, but because an American discovered Pluto back in 1930 by New Mexican Clyde Tombaugh, a 24 year old farmboy. Tombaugh lived to his 90s to see how Pluto was about to be reclassified and fought it tooth and nail. Ergo, America discovered a planet and it shouldn't be taken away.The trouble with planets is...a definition for planets was never ever set in stone. In the '00s, the International Astronomical Union began devising a concrete definition for a planet. In 2006, it was determined that Pluto did not meet the new definition - mostly because it didn't clear its own orbit of debris.This is an excellent book that makes science a lot easier to understand and offsets the jargon with comical letters from outraged children. Tyson has an opinion at the end that suggests a new way of teaching kids about the solar system so that its not only planets that get their day in the sun...so to speak."
9,0393350363,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1360862-bry,5,"Dr. Neil deGrasse Tyson was voted Sexiest Astrophysicist Alive by people magazine - who would have known such a stud muffin was also an crazy intelligent, funny, and witty writer?! This book details the history of Pluto's place in both science and people's hearts from the time of it's discovery and naming as a planet all the way to its demotion to a dwarf planet within the Kuiper Belt. Plus it is full of satirical comics and extremely angry and often misspelled letters from damn near homicidal third graders. If you have ever had a soft spot for the tiny little underdog of a planet or was just curious as to how and why a topic centered around pure science was able to knock 'Brangelina' and Iraq from the front page of the news then you should read this book. Who knew an astrophysicist could speak/write like a normal human being - plus be totally funny to boot?! "
10,0393350363,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1215302-nancy,4,"Neil deGrasse Tyson is a very entertaining science communicator and astrophysicist. This little book outlines the whole Pluto debate as it unfolded in the US (I don't think most people in other countries cared quite so much). It makes for entertaining reading, but I can't help but think 'seriously? It's science. Science changes constantly. And frankly, all the debate concerns is a linguistically constructed classification system. The universe doesn't really care.' Still, it is a fun and very accessible read."

Informative by telling the reasoning and procedures to define Pluto as a dwarf planet and entertaining to read the reactions to it - everyone from elementary school students to respected journalists are covered. An enjoyable read."
13,0393350363,http://goodreads.com/user/show/8619016-christina,3,"I'm reminded of that quote from a child's review of a book that said: ""This book told me more about penguins than I cared to know."" Only substitute penguins for Pluto. I KID, I KID. No, I feel very informed about Pluto as a planetary object, and this was really a fascinating read, but I have to say, I came out of this book with Dr. Tyson's same conclusion: WHY DID THIS CAUSE SO MUCH CONTROVERSY? The book ends with a cartoon of a news bulletin proclaiming Pluto was no longer a planet, with a picture of Pluto thinking ""Like I'm supposed to give a shit?"" It's fascinating that some people devoted so much anger and effort into defending Pluto's status as a planet, invoking sentimentality and tradition, when the very nature of science is objectivity and the pursuit of FACTS. Classification and random distinction of labels doesn't change anything about Pluto, it's still out there, spinning around, so the people that got so vitriolic and emotional that we were demoting Pluto, we were shaming it, we were ruining childhoods -- for crying out loud! Who cares? The analogy to Ceres is spot-on -- astronomers thought Ceres was a small planet between Mars and Jupiter. Then, oh shit, it's surrounded by all these other small planetoid objects, what's going on? Ohhh, they realized, Ceres is just one object of many in what we'll call the asteroid belt. When Pluto was discovered, it was figured, like Ceres to be a planet, the only difference was that it was so far away, and space technology at the time had so far to advance, that we didn't see the rest of the ice chunks and orbital dregs floating out there that made Pluto not so much a planet, as one of the largest bodies in a newfound region called the Kuiper Belt (basically the trans-Neptunian version of the asteroid belt, more ice chunk than space rock because of its vast distance from the sun.) I DON'T KNOW, THAT ALL SEEMS SO SCIENCE-Y AND OF SOUND LOGIC, that the idea that these learned professionals, pioneers in their fields, were reduced to BICKERING over this distant hunk of rock and ice is ... I was going to say laughable but actually it's kind of adorable. Aw, bless. Look at the Plutophiles, getting all hot and bothered. I think that's what I loved most about this book. Dr. Tyson laid out the history, the facts, the science, the argument, then quoted all the people getting up in arms and replied to each blog post and newspaper article with basically the intellectual equivalent of ""LOL U MAD?"" Watch out, guys, we've got a badass over here."
14,0393350363,http://goodreads.com/user/show/84193733-porter-broyles,3,"deGrasse Tyson’s job is to explain things to the masses. To this extent his work is, by design, somewhat fluff and superficial. There is nothing wrong if that is you purpose. He has a fun personality that comes across in his writing.That being said:While defending the IAU’s vote, he wrote:On “the surface, this argument sounds convincing, but most pollsters would give their eyeteeth for their sample to represent 4 percent of a complete population. So the question should be, What are the chances that the vote would be substantially different if you polled all the world’s astrophysicists? It turns out, if you do the math, that the votes margin of uncertainty is less than 3 percent […] The calculation assumes that the 424 scientist are a random sample. There is no reason to presume otherwise, except that people who favor Pluto’s planethood typically exhibit more energy for their cause than Pluto demoters exhibit for theirs.”Sorry. The people who attend the IAU’s international conference are NOT random nor a statistically valid representative. The people who attend that conference are most likely:1) from the larger more prestigious universities, planetariums, and organizations. The organizations that can afford to send their representatives to an international conference (or pay them enough that they can afford to go on their own). 2) The higher ranking more experienced members of these universities, planetariums, and organizations. 3) Mostly from Europe as the conference was help in Prague. (Professional conventions will have a disproportionate number of people who are local vs from other contries/continents.)These factors are not “random”. To state that “there is no reason to presume” that it isn’t a statistically valid sample displays an appalling lack of understanding of statistics, a blatant attempt to mislead, or an insult to his audience. A much more convincing argument would be that the people who attended the conference are the leaders in their field at the leading astronomical institutions and that the IAU is the organization responsible for defining astronomical nomenclature. Nor would have I have a problem with the notion that a 90% margin from the “vote” really represents a consensus, but that the “vote” was performed to help sell the idea to the public. But to pretend that the voting body was statistically valid? No.That being said, this is simple read with some good information.Still a fun book."
15,0393350363,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3590983-andrewp,4," Before reading this book I had no idea that the author was a major player/instigator in the whole 'Is Pluto a Planet?' situation from the first half of the 2000's. It's pretty amazing how this whole situation and debate blew up over how the Rose Center for Earth and Space decided to depict the planets in their exhibition. Rather than the traditional display of planets listed out from the sun, they categorized them by dividing the solar system up into zones of like objects. Going out from the sun these are: Terrestrial rocky planets, Asteroid belt, Jovian gas giants, Kuiper Belt and Oort cloud. Arranging these like this makes a lot of sense, BUT, leaves no room for Pluto as an actual planet. It's part of the Kuiper belt of icy objects. This all started in the year 2000 and gradually gained more media and public attention until in August 2006 the IAU took a vote and decided that Pluto was not a planet. To come to this decision, the IAU first had to come up with an definition of a planet, something that had really never been done before. Even the actual vote was something of a controversy, as Tyson points out, science is not a democracy. For anyone interested in the subject this makes for fascinating reading. From media and TV takes on the subject up to the various attempts at defining a planet, Tyson adds his own flair and humor to the stories. A rudimentary knowledge of the planets probably helps in understanding. "

17,0393350363,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6027090-david,3,"Basically, this book explores the history of humanity's relationship with Pluto. From discovery, to Disney's hopping on the new planet (at the time) bandwagon, to the AMNH's scandalous reclassification in its exhibits, and eventual demotion to dwarf planet. Offers a look into how people can get let emotion get the better of them on even such mundane matters as the scientific definition of celestial bodies.As this book was written and published several years before New Horizons' encounter with Pluto, you won't get any of the really cool photos that probe produced nor speculation as to what it all means.This is the first book by Tyson that I've read despite my enjoyment for how he talks about science. His normally prolific enthusiasm seen during interviews is tempered here, though you can catch glimpses of it from time-to-time, including the essay he wrote defending the AMNH move that landed him in hot water with Plutophiles. The addition of the satirical cartoons was a good move."
18,0393350363,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1237462-meredith,2,"Audio. This book came on 4 cds, but I think it could have been 2, comfortably. There was a lot of repetition - of content that was phrased identically more than once - so much so that I kept checking that I hadn't repeated a track/disc. Perhaps that doesn't comes across as strongly in print? Anyway, it was a fun little read, very much popular science. I liked the overarching theme of the difference between science (as in scientific thought and logical rigor) and popular science (culturally-led, communal beliefs about the way the universe should be described)...I guess I wanted a little more science than endless descriptions of Mickey's dog, etc. (I really didn't EVER make the connection between the planet and the cartoon before...) And in the end, I kept thinking that the author really thought that the whole Pluto furor was a tempest in a teapot, really not worth all the hubbub...which led me to think it wasn't really worth a whole book about, either.

22,0393350363,http://goodreads.com/user/show/858949-chris,3,"What was the biggest story of 2006? The arrest of the shampoo bombers in England? Small fries. The first World Baseball Classic? YAWN! The death of Don Knotts? Nothin'.No, as interesting as they were, none of these generated nearly as much public interest and argument as the much ballyhooed ""demotion"" of Pluto by the International Astronomical Union in August of 2006. Poor little Pluto, hanging out there on the edge of the solar system, got bumped down to ""Dwarf Planet,"" rousing much ire from people all across the United States. And, in a way, Neil deGrasse Tyson bears some responsibility for it.To be fair, stripping Pluto of its designation as a planet was never on his agenda. No matter what angry elementary school students may have thought, Tyson had no beef against Pluto. It was just that Pluto had the bad fortune to be an oddball planet, and Tyson was working on the redesign of the Rose Center for Earth and Space in the American Museum of Natural History in New York. Whether he wanted to or not - and I'm pretty sure he didn't - he became the public face of this issue, one which gripped the country.That in itself is weird. Americans are not the most scientifically literate of people. Sure, we like to use the fruits of science, but most people don't really pay attention to things like astronomy unless it's a shuttle launch or a pretty Hubble picture. What's more, the public in general has never really gotten involved in matters of taxonomy. If you went up to someone and said, ""Hey, the scientific community is thinking about revising the nomenclature regarding the classification of anaerobic bacteria,"" they'd probably just walk away swiftly, looking back a few times to make sure the crazy person isn't following them. But tell them that the IAU is planning to demote Pluto, and what you have is a firestorm.This book is not so much about Pluto itself, but our relationship with that weird little ball of ice and rock. Tyson takes us through our history with Pluto, from its discovery back in 1930 to its demotion in 2006, and tries to figure out just what it is that has endeared it so to the American public.One possibility, of course, is the fact that Pluto was an American discovery. Percival Lowell was the one to start the hunt, and Clyde Tombaugh finally found it. While the name was suggested by a teenage British girl, everything else about the discovery of Pluto was American, and that was a point of pride. There were only three non-Classical planets in the heavens, and we had claim to one of them. So even if the average American doesn't know the history of Pluto's discovery, we still have a certain love for it.Despite its diminutive size, Pluto has loomed large in the American imagination. Perhaps there's something of the underdog love in there, too. Americans love to see the little guy win, and if you look at a lot of the pro-Pluto artwork from 2006, the theme of big planets ganging up on a little one was very popular. As odd as this perception might seem from a scientific standpoint, I think a lot of Americans were supporting Pluto because it was being pushed down by The Man, as it were.And so the country went a little nuts. Newspapers, blogs, websites - even sports reporting got in their digs on the Pluto controversy. There was something for everyone in this story, and everyone who could manage a Pluto reference did so with gusto. It was a mixed blessing, to be sure - the American public was finally excited about astronomy, but it was the excitement of a bar fight, rather than the highbrow intellectualism that many astronomers might have preferred.What was also interesting about this book was the look at the professional arguments that went on as well. Dispelling the dispassionate image of the astronomer, professionals got really worked up about this, on both sides of the issue. Grown men and women, many of whom were well-versed in many aspects of astronomy, spoke passionately about Pluto. Some called on our sense of tradition and cultural memory, acknowledging that while Pluto may be an oddball, he's our oddball. Others were more than happy to throw Pluto into the Kuiper Belt with the other icy mudballs.So often, Science is assumed to be some monolithic entity that describes the world with a unanimity of voice. It is supposed to be dispassionate and rational, and we don't really think about the reality of scientific progress. To use the analogy often given to marriage, science is like a duck - stately and sure on the surface, but with a whole lot of work going on down below. The history of science is full of more passion, debate and anger than you might suspect. In order to decide the issue, symposiums were convened, meetings were held, and finally the International Astronomical Union was forced to do something that had never occurred to anyone before: precisely define what is and is not a planet.In case you're wondering, the definition is quite simple: It has to orbit the sun, be big enough to have attained a spherical shape, and it has to have cleared out its orbit. Pluto fulfills the first two requirements, but badly fails the third. Therefore, it is not a planet. They created a new designation: dwarf planet, including Ceres in the asteroid belt and Haumea, Makemake and Eris out past Pluto. The public may not like it, but that's how it is.Tyson points out that this is not the first time we have done such a reclassification. With the discovery in the mid-19th century of objects orbiting between Mars and Jupiter, a new class had to be invented in order to keep the number of planets from rocketing into the thousands - and so asteroids were born. The Pluto case is quite similar. Long after Pluto was discovered, more objects, similar in nature, were discovered nearby - some even bigger than Pluto was. The region of rock and ice was named the Kupier Belt, and if Pluto were discovered today, it would most certainly be named as part of it. As much as it pains me to say it, the decision to reclassify Pluto was the right one. At least Tyson and I have revised the Planet Mnemonic the same way: My Very Educated Mother Just Sent Us Nachos.The rise and fall of Pluto is an interesting story, and a lesson for science educators. No matter how bad it may seem for science in the United States, people can still be surprisingly passionate about scientific topics. It's also a warning against resistance to change. With all that we are learning about the Solar System, to just rattle off a list of planets and be done with it is insufficient. There are so many other ways to look at it now, so many ways to group the hundreds of bodies out there, that perhaps Pluto is more comfortable out with the other Trans-Neptunian objects. With its own kind, as it were, instead of being shoehorned in with eight other guys that it doesn't really have anything in common with.Ultimately, of course, Pluto doesn't care what we call it. That point was often made on both sides of the argument, and they're right. We could call it Lord Snuggypants the Fourth and it would keep doing what it does out there in the cold and the dark. But it's important for us, and not just because science needs things to be organized so we know what we're talking about. Being able to reclassify Pluto is an indication of the breadth of our knowledge - had we not made such progress, Pluto's classification would never have been in doubt.The ""demotion"" of Pluto is a sign of our amazing achievements over the last eighty years. We have not lost a planet - we have gained understanding. So in the end, the Great Pluto Debate is one that we should look back upon fondly."
23,0393350363,http://goodreads.com/user/show/9792773-jennifer,4,"I had finished with my formal education by the time the great debate on whether or not Pluto was a planet was being discussed. I never really looked into the topic and was interested to learn more. Neil deGrasse Tyson writes this book with humor and candor, including anecdotes from his own life and a history lesson that includes a trip to Disney. I especially liked the cartoons and correspondence from concerned science fans of all ages. This book also has 9 chapters, which I feel is a proper homage to the space object which is Pluto. One of the more interesting things I learned is that the love for the (former) planet Pluto is a very American thing due to an American astronomer discovering Pluto and Pluto being the name of Mickey's pet."
24,0393350363,http://goodreads.com/user/show/24011982-cynda,5,"5 Stars. NGT once again writes a book that rocks my world. NGT writes in the manner as he speaks. His style remainsCasualConciseKnowledgeableInformativeDescriptiveHumorous.I questioned why Pluto had been demoted to minor planet/planetoid/asteroid status. I was missing Pluto. Now I am in agreement that Pluto is not a planet and never was. Find out if you agree with a developing understanding of what constitutes a planet and if you agree that Pluto be recognozed a large spherical asteroid, maybe a special one, but an asteroid."
25,0393350363,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3837733-joan,3,"This book was not quite what I had expected, but that is more my fault since I was expecting more science than I got in this book. This is a mostly quite personal description from Tyson's point of view of the fuss made by American's over the change in status of Pluto. As Tyson pointed out, ultimately it really wasn't all that important in that it didn't change any of the realities of the world....Pluto is still the same physical spacial body it was before the change in status...but acknowledges that this change was important to many Americans. Well, Pluto is the only American major contribution to the planetary makeup. All other of the large planets were discovered elsewhere, not surprising seeing that many were found well before America became a nation. I did get a better understanding of what the phrase clear their neighborhood around their orbit. That means that when you add up the mass of items striking the planetary body, that it be considerably less than the mass of the body being struck. For example, Earth gets lots of meteors over time but adding up all the mass totals a small percentage of how much mass Earth has. That is not true for Pluto. The amount hitting it will add up to more than Pluto's mass. According to Tyson, a lot of the uproar comes down to the fact that we now need to come up with a nice new mnemonic for remembering the name and order of the planets. He points out that is really the least important part of learning about our solar system and hopes that the lack of a mnemonic might mean greater actual understanding of what we can learn from our solar system for school children. This is very important to him. He quoted from numerous letters from elementary kids on the subject and clearly hopes that they might get a deeper understanding of what we know about our solar system than merely reciting the names of the major spacial bodies in the solar system in correct order from the sun."
26,0393350363,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1409618-mattr76,4,"I received this book as a gift when it was released, and the ""demotion"" of Pluto was still a fairly hot topic. I wasn't terribly interested as I considered the whole thing pretty silly. My reaction was, ""Pluto doesn't care what we call it"" and ""planet is a term humans invented, so there's no real scientific value."" In fact, my opinion was that the term planet should only apply to the classical wanderers of the sky, and thus exclude Uranus and Neptune as well. Anyway, with the impending fly-by of Pluto by the New Horizons spacecraft, I suddenly got the urge to read this book, and I have to say I was surprised by how much I enjoyed it. Dr Tyson's comprehensive yet easy-to-read treatment of the history of Pluto, including its predicted existence (though largely by accident), discovery, sweep into popular culture with the Disney character, and eventual ""downfall"" is entertaining and educational. His writing is as witty as you would expect, and I found it impossible not to hear his baritone voice while I read. He makes an excellent case for dropping this notion that we must enumerate and memorize the ""planets"" and instead group the Solar System bodies in ways that lead to deeper scientific insight. This is an exciting time for space exploration as we are witnessing the crossing of a new frontier, studying the icy realm of Pluto, Charon, Hydra, Nix, and Eris. The Solar System is so much more than a number."
27,0393350363,http://goodreads.com/user/show/952810-michelle-in-libris-veritas,4,"The Pluto Files is a response to the whole argument and battle over what makes a planet a planet and where Pluto falls in that definition.I found this book to be quite entertaining as much of it holds Tyson’s sort of tongue-in-cheek commentary style. It focuses mostly on the relationship between Pluto and the people, from it’s initial discovery to the demotion from planet-hood. It goes more into the social history of the planet as when this was published we didn’t have the plethora of info about Pluto that we do now. The main story regarding the demotion of Pluto was quite interesting to read about and to see how despite the fact that Pluto’s place in the solar system hasn’t changed that people still found it’s demotion as something wholly disrespectful. As humans we often place human qualities on objects and the planets are really no exception (I do it), but to see it in such a wide scale as with the Pluto debate is kind of cool and a little frustrating. I’m all for the redefinition of planets if it means we can streamline our understanding of it, though I do admit to being a little sad that I have to mentally remind myself not to include it anymore.Some of the best moments in this are the letter Tyson receives from other people over the demotion, especially those from kids who took the demotion extremely personal. While this is a book on Pluto and it’s place in our solar system, this leans more towards social commentary."
28,0393350363,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6005734-greg,3,"I read The Pluto Files because I am interested in space science and I am a fan of Neil deGrasse Tyson, and while it is a nice little book, it does not have too much to offer.As a chronicle of the public outcry over the American Museum of Natural History's decision to not include Pluto among the planets exhibited at the Hayden Planetarium, it's interesting. As a discussion of the curious obsession among some people of Pluto, it is also interesting. And as a way to get the reader thinking about what exactly a planet is, it's valuable.But the book is quite repetitive, giving way more examples than are needed of school children writing to Tyson to talk about why they love Pluto, and repeating the same arguments over and over in the debate over Pluto's planethood. It's a simple argument: on one side, planetary scientists in general recognize that Pluto has more in common with a Kuiper Belt asteroid than with any other planet. On the other side, the fact that Pluto has long been (erroneously) categorized with the other planets mean that people have a lot of resistance to changing its status. The book does not go too much deeper than this basic argument, and really just rehashes each side over and over again.So it's got some value, but this book could have told us everything we needed in half the length of what is already a pretty small book."
29,0393350363,http://goodreads.com/user/show/14234350-darren,5,"Neil DeGrasse Tyson is becoming one of my favorite popular science authors - I enjoy his Teaching Company courses, and he was perfect in the COSMOS reboot. His delivery of intriguing topics blends interesting facts with passionate excitement and fervor that is contagious, and all too rare in the scientific education community. I found this book to be an interesting recount of the historical rise and fall of our ninth ""planet"" (it's size is actually less than 0.24 percent that of Earth!), from it's discovery in 1930 (same year as the birth of the Disney canine character of the same name, by the way), to it's 2006 demotion to ""dwarf planet"" and the subsequent media frenzy that ensued. Since there are several other celestial Kuiper belt objects discovered that are slightly smaller than Pluto (now named ""plutinos""), the International Astronomical Union's choice was to either update the solar system map to include these ""extras"" as planets, or demote Pluto. The largest societal impact: our planet order mnemonic changes from ""My Very Educated Mother Just Served Us Nine Pizzas"" to ""My Very Educated Mother Just Served Us Nachos"". Fascinating how many were vehemently opposed to this demotion despite the obvious validity of the decision."
30,0393350363,http://goodreads.com/user/show/14645683-enzo,5,"As a Pluto fan, yes, the planet. I have always wanted to read this book. Neil deGrasse Tyson was the man seen in the front of the controversial reclassification of Pluto. I still remember seeing websites with kids letters and politicians trying to get their 5 cents in on the topic. Pluto as it turns out is the most popular planet. Here is a history of its discovery, its growth in the consciousness of America and the World. The beginning of the cracks, and the fall from planetary grace. As a layman view into a scientific conundrum Tyson describes why Pluto was considered a planet at its discovery and for the better part of a century. Why the need of reclassification. Why it was so incredibly unpopular to demote it as a dwarf planet. How two States, California and New Mexico still consider it a planet. People love the underdog story and this one even has Disney backing it up. We are now just days away from New Horizons reaching its closest distance to Pluto. The expected Flyby and the mountain of data that we hope to get of the little guy. The question will be asked again after this encounter, Is Pluto a planet. Semantics many say some.I have always known it and will continue to say ""My Very Excellent Mother Just Served Us Nine Pizzas"" "
31,0393350363,http://goodreads.com/user/show/115473-siria,3,"A readable, if slight and somewhat repetitive, look at the popular controversy about whether or not Pluto should be designated a planet. Neil deGrasse Tyson was one of the designers behind the Hayden Planetarium display which kicked off the argument in the media back in 2001, and the book is liberally sprinkled with excerpts from the emails and letters which he received from the public about it. Tyson's narrative reveals all the difficulties of trying to untangle ""pure"" science from emotion, nostalgia, and pre-existing cultural constructions—why do we persist in trying to shoe-horn things into an imperfect category just because it's been around for a very long time? It was interesting to read this around the time that reports of a new nine planet appeared, but I couldn't help but feel that The Pluto Files would have been a stronger read if it had been cut down to appear as a long-form article in The Atlantic or a similar publication."
32,0393350363,http://goodreads.com/user/show/40461623-megan-ammer-barefield,5,"I was already bound to like this book due to the subject matter which I can confidently say most Americans I know care about on some level. You can tell through the writing that Neil deGrasse Tyson is not necessarily against Pluto, but that science should prevail, and as a forerunner in the decision to demote Pluto, used that basic belief as a key motivator. The book is a great example of that concept in action. The Pluto Files goes into the historical, pop cultural, and scientific aspects of Pluto and explains the demotion process, all in accessible and slightly humorous language. Points made in the book, mainly that the affection for Pluto comes from how ""American"" it is, are described and dissected well. There's photographs and letter to further explain planetary models and public feedback. Everything is laid out with science lingo but in an understandable way, isolating no one. "
33,0393350363,http://goodreads.com/user/show/617153-caitie,4,"I read this expecting to be convinced that Pluto was not a planet, and I totally was. But by the end of the book Dr. Tyson also managed to convince me that it doesn't matter either way. I enjoyed this very much, and the account of the scientific community's back-and-forth on Pluto was fun and rather a lot more human a depiction of scientists and scientific deliberations than I'm used to reading. I tend to idolize scientists as these strange, dispassionate, inherently rational creatures who live amongst us and answer to some sort of higher calling, except instead of God it's Science, and obviously I am just extremely silly. (And the picture on the back makes me laugh so hard, except I'm not sure it's intentional.)"
34,0393350363,http://goodreads.com/user/show/11201030-greg,3,"The first half of the book functions rather well, as an examination of Pluto, its discovery, origins of the name and its cultural impact on America, and inevitably Neil deGrasse Tyson's role in Pluto's demotion in our categorization of the universe. As the second half loses steam as the book begins pulling more headlines, quotes, letter's from students and song lyrics that reference Pluto my interest started to wane. While the later certainly illustrates the extent of the sentimental value that Pluto held in the hearts and minds of the American populace, it slowly starts to lose its impact. Overall, the-always-charismatic, Tyson does a good job of being amiable, even in the face of mass criticism. Accessible, friendly, and lighthearted. "
35,0393350363,http://goodreads.com/user/show/917269-thomas,3,"I waffled on whether to give this book 3 or 4 stars (and I keep waffling as I write this). Honestly, the book is very entertaining and full of interesting info, yet the majority of it seems to be about the near soap opera like debate about Pluto's standing as planet and the furor that erupted based on a simple action (or lack of action, in some sense) by the designers/planners of the Hayden Planetarium in Manhattan. Tyson was a central figure in this with his role as director of the planetarium. This book is definitely worth picking up for a quick, enjoyable read if you're interested in planetary science, astronomy or just the politics and public perception of science."
36,0393350363,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3488439-daphne,4,"What a fun astronomy book. I read a lot of dry ones, so it was a nice break from that while still giving lots of information. I admit to being one of the people had had initially had a visceral reaction to changing the status of Pluto, but I was also ready to give the actual specialists a chance to figure it out and then explain why they came to the conclusions. It makes such obvious sense now, but I can see that the struggle is real to explain to the average person that science names things to make it easier to understand and study them. Science doesn't care how you feel about something.I do admit to owning a Bring Pluto Back shirt though. ;)"

I can see my Dr. Tyson is such a popular advocate for all things space related. He provided a great overview of why Pluto is no longer a plant. I was impressed by the conversational overtone of the book. Although the terminology in this book was mostly unknown to me, I felt the way the material was present, I was not left to drift in space. I enjoyed learning about the Greek mythology overview and the various letters supporting Pluto. I found this book enlightening and entertaining."
38,0393350363,http://goodreads.com/user/show/833700-kirsten,3,"This was an entertaining and educational book and perfect to take on walk as I did. Tyson has a wonderful sense of humor and apparently didn't take the furor over Pluto's status very seriously. A lesser man could have gotten very angry, defensive, and bitter over it. The book covers not only the furor over the ""is it a planet or isn't it"" story, but also a very interesting overview of the solar system, including the older controversy that occurred over the Planet X thing. This is incredibly entertaining fare, and makes you smarter as well!"

But it took me 10 days to finish it, and it's only 160 pages long, so I obviously didn't like it that much. I did like how it told the story of the people who were arguing over how to classify Pluto as well as Pluto's characteristics. As the final page intimates, Pluto doesn't care what we call it, so this really is a story of people. For what it's worth, I agree that Pluto is not the last of planets but the first of Kuiper Belt Objects."
41,0393350363,http://goodreads.com/user/show/9948521-penny,4,This is actually my second time reading this book and I still think it's great. I'm not all that interested in science but Neil DeGrasse Tyson sets you up with a little Pluto back story and fun facts I already forgot about (like the degree of it's orbit) so you don't need to have some sort of astronomy degree. After that is out of the way the book portrays Pluto's impact on the hearts of all from scientists to elementary school students during and after it's controversial demotion. 
42,0393350363,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1389748-skip,3,"I grew up believing in nine planets, despite the evidence that Pluto is nothing more than a large object in the Kuiper Belt and do not believe that it is better to be King of Kuiper than runt of the planets. There is a lot of interesting information in the book, and Hayden Planetarium director Tyson keeps the tone light, oscillating between science and public opinion; however, the book's wandering overall structure is too weak to justify a higher rating."

I had no idea that Pluto the pup and the planet were related...I learned a lot in the beginning of the book but then it went pretty deep into thesciencetist reasons for Pluto being demoted. A little bit too much technical information. "
44,0393350363,http://goodreads.com/user/show/22053664-nikki-gomez,4,I downloaded this book for Fernando and I to listen to together. The book tells the history of Pluto from it's discover to it's eventual demotion to dwarf planet. The author includes a lot of pop culture information as well as scientific information.

A short history of the (dwarf!!!!) planet Pluto with the main focus on the discussion about what it is. A planet, an astroide, a comet?Except a bit more knowledge about Pluto, there is mainly two things that I bring with me after reading this book. A) as the Author says himself, I wonder how big this argument about Plutos status as a planet would have been if it had been discoverd by someone else then a North american? And if not a Disney dog would have gotten the same name. B) The childishness some People bring with them to what should be a sicentific discussion. And that law makers in some state in USA decide that Pluto is a planet in their state! ""We dont care what you say, we will still say that it is a planet! Boohoo boohoo!"" Cheesus, grow up. I do agree that a definition of what a planet is was needed, and that the way it was done might not have been the best way. But still... ""Cats and dogs are carnivores and give birth to living offspring, so in Our state all cats are dogs! And we are going to make a Law that says so! Bohhoo, bohoo!"" There should be a seperation between state and sciense as well it seeems. Anyway, good book. well worth reading. Wont take you long. "

And yet, when the International Astronomical Union created a formal definition for “Planet” which happened to exclude Pluto, people lost their minds. Astrophysicist and science educator Neil deGrasse Tyson was on the front lines in 2006 of the furor, receiving thousands of letters from indignant adults and despondent children. Tyson had been the object of particular abuse because in previous years, when he began as director of the Hayden Planetarium, he inaugurated a new museum with an exhibit on the scales of the universe which did not include Pluto. In The Pluto Files, he delivers a history of Pluto’s discovery and cultural legacy, even after its demotion. Part science, part history, and part memory, the work is a tribute to a little place with an outside importance to people’s affection, and our growing understanding of the solar system. Although those looking for a detailed history of Pluto’s demotion would be better served by How I Killed Pluto and Why It Had it Coming, Tyson’s book works perfectly fine as the elevator version, and is arguably worth encountering just for the cultural aspects. I had no idea that a Holst scholar had written an addition to The Planets suite, called “Pluto the Renewer”, for instance. Although most of Tyson’s excerpts are of scientific debate, the included letters written by those demanding Tyson single-handedly restore Pluto to the planetary python are amusing and charming in their own rights."

The important takeaway is just because you don't believe a fact doesn't make it any less true. When I first heard that Pluto was no longer a planet, nostalgia kicked in and I felt bad.

We accepted it because of the scientific method and tireless work done by scientists that proved these acceptances. 15 years ago, the scientific method turned one of these acceptances on its ear. That's what is wonderful about science. It can be used to disprove the ""proven"" due to re-examining what we accept is truth. "

It is the most exciting book about Pluto you will ever read in your life."" from Jon Stewart is definitely not the case. It was boring and flat and read like, well, a science document. The only ""exciting"" parts of the book were the letters (though shitty some of them were) and the comics.I preferred How I Killed Pluto and Why It Had It Coming by Mike Brown much much more. It gave almost the same information (about Pluto/Solar System, minus the much mentioned Rose Center) but with much more heart and interest. That reawakened my love of the solar system, if I had read this book first, I would have been put to sleep and turned off of it. It was alright, I was expecting better / more. "
55,0393350363,http://goodreads.com/user/show/150648-tiffany,3,"The book was a nice overview of Pluto's rise and fall as a planet, written for the layman/masses/pop culture. There's an overview of the science involved in why or why not Pluto is a planet, as well as some fun stuff about the Hayden Planetarium and how it structured its new exhibit about the solar system, and Pluto in pop culture (songs about the planet, Disney's Pluto, etc.). Overall, it's a nice, fluffy book about Pluto's ""demotion"" -- not a ton of science, but enough for the commoner to understand the debate.6/7/15:So now that I've finished reading my ""Pluto trilogy"" (the three books I wanted to read about Pluto being demoted from planet status), here's how I rank them, in order of how good the book was, combined with what order they should be read in:1. The Pluto Files: The Rise and Fall of America's Favorite Planet by Neil deGrasse Tyson. It's a good overview of the debate, with a whole lot of pop culture thrown in (Disney, editorial cartoons, protest parades). It's nice and light, so it's a great introduction to the topic. It does have some science thrown in, but nothing scary.2. The Case for Pluto: How a Little Planet Made a Big Difference by Alan Boyle. More in-depth than The Pluto Files, this is where you really focus on the search for Planet X, Pluto, the International Astronomical Union's vote on Pluto's status and how that affects science, the future of science, the future of investigations of space, and disagreements between scientists. I liked this book more than The Pluto Files, but The Pluto Files served as a good introduction, and a light approach to the topic. You still get everything about it, but slightly fluffier.3. How I Killed Pluto and Why It Had It Coming by Mike Brown. This book is less about killing Pluto and more about Mike Brown's discoveries and the affects they had on Pluto. This book is a whole lot less about Pluto's demotion from planet status, and both Tyson's book and especially Boyle's book talk about Brown's discoveries, so this one is the one to miss if you only want to read two books."
56,0393350363,http://goodreads.com/user/show/96664-samantha,4,"Poor Pluto. So underappreciated.Such is the basic premise of this book. Having been discovered by the American astronomer Clyde Tombaugh in 1930, Pluto became numero uno in the hearts of Americans. Walt Disney even named Mickey's dog after the planet, thereby securing Pluto's place in American pop culture forever.But the question remains: Is Pluto really a planet? Does it really deserve the same cosmic status as the rest of the objects categorized as planets in our Solar System?As of August 24, 2006, the answer -- as overwhelmingly decided by the International Astronomical Union -- is NO. Pluto has been demoted to ""dwarf planet"" status. Instead of the ninth planet, it is now King of the Kuiper Belt (although larger objects than Pluto have since been discovered).Dr. Tyson's book cleverly outlines Pluto's rise and fall. School children (and adults) everywhere have adopted Pluto as their favorite planet and ever since Pluto's demotion, they've had trouble coping. Dr. Tyson, whose role as the director of the Hayden Planetarium in New York made him the fall guy when Pluto was left out of the Solar System display, has received thousands of letters and e-mails from frustrated and disgruntled adults and children everywhere lamenting Pluto's demotion.It's really all quite amusing.Because, as Dr. Tyson argues, whether Pluto is a planet, a dwarf planet, an asteroid, a comet, or just a giant ball of ice, it's still a part of the Solar System. Naming and numbering the planets doesn't really contribute anything to the advancement of science. In the long run, does it really matter if there are eight or nine planets? If Pluto is a Kuiper Belt Object or a comet that's too far from the sun to have a tail? No. Because Pluto is Pluto, with its own unique properties and its own satellites, and which is still going to be there for millions (or billions) of years after we're all dead.This book is very entertaining while still being educational. It doesn't surprise me, though, that so many people are still tenaciously fighting to have Pluto reinstated as a planet. It's the only planet to have been discovered by an American, it was the ninth planet for 75 years, and people in general love to classify things (and are resistant to change). When people suddenly learn that what they were taught was an immutable fact is, in fact, not so...well, it makes them uncomfortable.But as Dr. Tyson states, leaving things the way they are simply because that's the way it's always been is poor science and ultimately stifles scientific discovery. Anyone remember when people thought the Earth was the center of the universe? Look where that got us.Here's a question for you: If Pluto was demoted to dwarf planet but no one was there to get the memo, would it suddenly stop revolving around the sun?Great, fun, quick read."
57,0393350363,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7724604-lenny-ankireddi,3,"Not sure what I want to say about this book really. On the one hand, there is some excellent information in it with relation to the discovery of Pluto, the discovery of other celestial objects in the solar system and the efforts, successful, partially so or otherwise that were made to appropriately classify them. On the other hand there is all this build up and background on why Pluto's planet-hood was of such great personal importance to a lot of people and the memes and mores that bound the consciousness of a great many to that concept. This latter part of the book was something I couldn't understand, much as I tried. The author states in a very matter of fact way the reasons why people were emotionally attached to Pluto but makes no attempt, not even the feeblest to dismiss emotional attachments or personal opinions as irrelevant to the scientific process. Although Neil Tyson makes a pretty strong case for the way the Rose Center at the Hayden Planetarium at the AMNH in New York ""treated"" Pluto and all of it makes perfect sense from a scientific point of view, he still seems to allow for some outrage expressed at this as if it was OK for people to have an attachment to an idea they had grown up with and didn't want to let go of in spite of there being massive scientific arguments against it.While it is alright for a scientist to offer arguments in favor of or against an idea and let the recipient of those arguments make up their own mind about it, the approach Dr. Tyson takes in this book does not project any strong conviction of his own or due reverence for the scientific method over personal opinions. He states that ""as citizen Tyson"", he would want Pluto to maintain its planet status but ""as astrophysicist Dr. Tyson"", he would have to vote to declassify it as a planet. This is kind of wishy-washy and places unsubstantiated and foolhardy personal opinion, which when extrapolated over a larger sampling of like-minded individuals, could easily transcend into dogma, on the same level as scientific and logical reasoning. The whole book revolves around and expresses no small measure of amazement at, how much unwarranted outrage has been caused around the whole Pluto episode. However, it never once calls out all the noise made for what it truly is. Given that it is the author's choice on whether or not, they want to be moderate about their entire approach, it made for very uncomfortable reading in a lot of places where the letters and emails he received are presented with utterly ridiculous arguments but he never calls out how ridiculous they are or why. This makes the reader cringe because either a well-known astrophysicist is balking at dismissing unscientific arguments, which is bad or he is presenting the arguments as plausible and noteworthy, which is worse."

Hopefully you all are aware of this, either because you’ve known for years, or because you caught the fantastic Cosmos this year. About three years ago I was lucky enough to see him speak at the local university, where he told vivid stories that helped me understand the scale of things in the universe and on earth, including one story that aided me in fully grasping how much money Bill Gates really has. Mr. Tyson is coming back to Seattle this fall and the shows are already sold out, which makes me so, so sad. But at least I have his books, and honestly that’s saying a lot, because the books are awesome. “The Pluto Files” tells the story of Pluto and the drama surrounding its reclassification. Now, I love science, but my last formal education in the field was over 15 years ago. Sometimes I fear I won’t be able to follow science books, but Mr. Tyson has this lovely way of explaining things that makes them understandable but somehow doesn’t make me feel like he’s talking down to me. He’s clearly a brilliant scientist, but I think he’s brilliant writer as well. The book provides a history of Pluto’s discovery, and is full of fun facts, like why moons of planets usually follow the convention of characters from the myths of the gods the planets were named for, but one’s moons are named for characters from Shakespeare. I love these trivia nuggets (I find they come in handy during pub quizzes), and they are dropped throughout in a manner that keeps what could have been dry material interesting and even light.Part of the story around the reclassification ties in with the opening of the Hayden Planetarium in NYC, and Mr. Tyson describes in some detail all the thought that was put into building this lovely facility. Understanding the nature of science and the fact that some things change, he shares how they addressed the more concrete versus the more likely to change elements of the exhibit. It's an interesting story because the planetarium staff had to make a call on how to address Pluto while the discussion about classification was going on. Because of Mr. Tyson’s opinion on the topic, as well as his association with the Hayden Planetarium, he has been subjected to many letters – often with an angry tone, and often from whole classes of children – decrying the decision to remove Pluto from the list of planets, and he shares them with us. He clearly has a sense of humor about all of it while avoiding being condescending to people who don’t have the level of knowledge he has.If you like science, pick this book up. Shoot, if you just like a good story, pick it up. It’s a pretty quick read, and it’s highly entertaining. "

I'm listening to Startalk, watching Cosmos, and reading his writings. The dude's just brilliant. Obviously, his scientific knowledge is great, but even more so, is his ability to effectively communicate with ""non-sciencey"" people. He's funny. He's passionate. He stirs up a sense of child-like wonder and curiosity in his audience. I read several reviews of this book before reading the book first. It's funny. You'll have the ""It's not science. It's just cartoons and fluff"" comments and the ""It's too much science and I don't get it"" comments. But, those commenters are all missing the point. It's a story. Yes, its factual, and there is some science, but it's a fun story. I just finished reading Mike Brown's ""How I Killed Pluto"" and it was the same thing. His was a bit more scientific, but I was wrapped up in his story, his experience, his passion for these little ice-balls. My imagination doesn't take me to the places these guys go. Prior to watching the Cosmos, I had no personal preference or consideration (or even knowledge) of the Kuiper Belt Objects. I didn't even know the name of Eris, or Charon, or our former asteroid belt planet, Ceres. I remember loving the idea of the solar system as a child, but somewhere along the way, we stop dreaming of the universe, and instead only focus on the limits of our immediate environment. Now that my children are getting to elementary age, I've suddenly found myself back to a child-like curiosity of ""what's out there"" and we're looking at the stars, reading books, and watching science documentaries. I'm playing off the curiosity and wonder of my children and have found myself jumping right in- in a much deeper way. And, the interest is being aided by these scientists who are willing to ""be real"" with people. They are relevant, they are humorous, they are inspiring. And I. Am. Hooked. Sign me up for more. I would love to learn more about the actual science: the math, the physics, the biology, etc, but there is no way you could throw that all at a ""normal person"" in one book and keep our attention. We have to be drawn in the same way the astronomers are drawn in- by looking out at the sky in awe. I'm learning a little science, a little history, a little mythology, a little math- but it is all wrapped in an experience that is beautiful. Here's my only downside: every time I read one book, I add at least three more to my list. The ""to-read"" shelf is getting longer and longer. I'll never catch up. But, I guess that's not all that bad... ;-) "
