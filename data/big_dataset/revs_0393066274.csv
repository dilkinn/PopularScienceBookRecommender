0,0393066274,http://goodreads.com/user/show/267189-todd-n,5,"At lunch with a friend last week I complained that science is generally considered to be a suitable pursuit for children or child-like adults, from Sid The Science Kid to the manic Bill Nye The Science Guy to the impish Richard Feynman.It's as if American society believes that curiosity about science is merely a phase we go through as we grow up, like playing with Legos. Sure there are some adults who still do it, but it is considered vaguely unseemly. (Meanwhile the over 50% of Americans who believe in angels and the roughly 6% who believe the moon landings were faked live their lives unimpeded.)Then I came across this book, which objectively and simply explains the physics behind some very adult topics like terrorism, nuclear war, and global warming. It begins with a wrenching explanation of the physics behind the 9/11 attacks and how gasoline packs more energy per pound than even TNT.The probable effects of a dirty bomb attack on a major city is analyzed and shown to be relatively minimal. Sure, there will be a slightly increased rate of cancer due to increased radiation, but it the radiation is calculated to be roughly the same that residents of Denver are naturally exposed to. So if we evacuate the area around a dirty bomb attack, shouldn't we also evacuate Denver?For me the bonus in reading this book was the section on global warming. I admit to not paying close attention to this topic, and I also admit that being deeply skeptical about the way both sides of the issue present their case. It turns out Dr. Muller is with me on the skeptical part.He lays out the (few) known facts and the (many) cherry picked facts and anecdotes about global warming that are designed to appeal to emotion rather than reason. While reading this section, I realized that Dr. Muller is slyly including lessons on the scientific method as well as the ethics of science. This is worth the price of the book alone.The important lesson of this book is that we could being making better decisions as a society simply by acknowledging the parts of reality that are completely objective and not up for debate. So it turns out that science is good for something more than just invoking a sense of wonder."
1,0393066274,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1478144-john,1,"The conceit of this book is, obviously, that it's addressed to whoever would win the Obama-McCain race: here are the bits of physics you need to understand if you're going to make the right decisions on terrorism, energy, nukes (both weapons and reactors), space and global warming. There's plenty of good stuff here as well as lots of fascinating facts that I'm sure I'll find myself tossing oh-so-casually into dinner-party conversations. The text is extremely readable, bouncing along at an exhilarating pace. But there are also some silly mistakes:In the Manhattan Project, the scientists initially estimated that the amount needed for a critical mass was about 440 pounds. [. . .:] With a tamper, instead of leaking out, the neutrons are reflected back in, so the critical mass needed for an explosion dropped by about a factor four, down to only 33 pounds. (p129)I've tried and I've tried and I've tried to make sense of that ""factor of four"" calculation, but I still can't get no satisfaction. The ""440 pounds"" is clearly a euphemism for 200kg, and I assume ""33 pounds"" is, in plain English, 15kg . . . but even looking at these somewhat easier-to-work-with numbers, hoping for some sort of four-related relationship between them, I can't imagine what he was talking about. Similarly here:In 1974, the average refrigerator size in the United States had a volume of 18 cubic feet, and the energy it used was 1800 kilowatt-hours per year. That's 130 kilowatt-hours for each cubic foot. (p315)If I divide 1800 by 18, I get 100, not 130. I've checked my calculation every which way, and I still think I'm right on this.I have other concerns. In the long chapter on global warming, Muller adopts the position of being, not a climate change denier, but a denier of the need for draconian action . . . and he claims to produce the physics to support this. He obviously has a beef about Al Gore and the movie An Inconvenient Truth, because he loses no opportunity to carp at them, even in instances where quite clearly Gore's ""error"" was that the science he presented, while perfectly correct as of 2004, has since been amended. Perhaps Gore once farted in front of Muller's wife, or something. Even so, I was prepared to be educated on the subject, but then . . . well, what's this?On page 283 we have a couple of diagrams credited to ""Pielke & Landsea""? On p294 there's an approving mention of a correction to the climatologists' physics from Steve McIntyre and Ross McKitrick? The diagrams seem plausible and the correction to the physics may be fine for all I know, but nowhere is there a mention of the fact that Pielke, McIntyre and McKitrick are extremely controversial figures in the climate debate, being champions of the AGW-denialist movement. I for one would trust nothing emanating from any of these three until I had it confirmed in triplicate by independent authorities, and even then I'd be dubious. Yet Muller, who must have known that to much of his audience the names will mean nothing, fails to alert his readers to the fact that the arguments being produced in general on AGW by Pielke, McIntyre and McKitrick (and, again for all I know, Landsea) are, to euphemize, not universally accepted.Similarly, on pp104-105 Muller discusses the estimated death toll from long-term cancers in the wake of the 1986 Chernobyl disaster, and tells us that the IAEA/UN best estimate for this number is 4000. I was surprised the figure was so low, since I was sure I'd heard of higher ones, but who was I to argue with the IAEA/UN? It was only by chance, in casual e-conversation with a friend a couple of days later, that I discovered there have been several estimates of this death toll, and the IAEA/UN one is controversial. Many of the other estimates, quick research revealed, have reliability problems of their own -- I mean, I love Greenpeace and have given them money, but they're an advocacy group and everyone knows you take with a pinch of salt the statistics produced by advocacy groups -- and it's quite possible the IAEA/UN estimate may be the best; but, for the sake of honesty, Muller should have indicated the existence of these other, far more pessimistic estimates.The laffaloud irony is that, elsewhere, he's really quite strong about people who cherry-pick their information . . .All in all, then, having found a few instances where I did not feel Muller was dealing fairly with his readers, I became uncertain as to how much of the rest of his text I could trust. And that's a pity, because I very much enjoyed the actual process of reading the book."
2,0393066274,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1843184-szplug,3,"Leaving aside the counsel to a potential president conceit which wears out its welcome remarkably early in this egress into scientific realism from a sober and commonsensical physics professor, Muller provides a healthy splash of Chill the fuck out and take another bite of this here Clue Burger, y'all a bunch of Chicken Little motherfuckers. The sky ain't necessarily falling, and there's no need to be crying your pretty little eyes out that it is, chump change water over a bunch of thickly and pungently smoking brushfires that have broken out within various topical communities across the globe—terrorism, nuclear and biological weaponry, nuclear and non-renewable energy, global warming, and the potential of space exploration and utilization—with a linked refrain that shrill ideology and piercing alarmism, ofttimes paired with or stemming from shallow or selective knowledge of the matter in hand, seldom work to produce effective and enduring results, no matter the direction in which your political compass might point. In some cases they are still left smoldering—indeed, cannot be put completely out—but the air seems clearer and smells haler, the horizon starkly creased with all of that smoky plumage impressively and appreciably abated."
3,0393066274,http://goodreads.com/user/show/9496879-michael-o-brien,4,"This was a fascinating book to read, and I really enjoyed it. Dr. Muller examines many of the science issues we hear about increasingly today, and also debunks much of the junk science and media sensationalism that have had a deleterious effect on public policies often purporting to be based on science. The friend of mine who loaned this book to me to read warned me that Dr. Muller was ""somewhat liberal"", but, honestly, I did not see any deliberate bias in his analyses and explanation of the science issues of our day. He is a believer in global warming, and, if I do have one criticism of his book, it is that he hangs his hat greatly in the last part of this book on the IPCC reports on climate change ---- although this body's predictions have been much criticized lately and although this body does not do its own research and has, on some occasions, used materials that have not been peer reviewed (aka so-called ""grey literature""). However, this does not mar the overall worth of this book. It is interesting, fascinating, and a pleasure to read. I recommend this to anyone with an interest or a love of science!"
4,0393066274,http://goodreads.com/user/show/931082-arminius,5,The Physics for Future PresidentsIt is a fascinating book using science to explain and sometimes solve today’s major problems. Estimating future types of terrorist attacks can be calculated by knowing how destructive each potential weapon is. The surprising answer is that gasoline not “smart” nuclear bombs are their weapon of choice.Do you want to know how to bring down oil prices? The answer is to make oil from coal. Coal is our countries most abundant natural resource. The reason why we do not do it is because it is costly to build a coal to oil plant. And when OPEC finds out they immediately drop the price of oil and as a result we switch back to OPEC oil immediately. Is solar power the solution? No. Is nuclear power a good option? Yes. The reasons are presented by the author. Nuclear power and nuclear weapons are explained in detail. Satellites and Rocket Science also have detailed explanations. Global warming is presented in an interesting fashion. He alludes to his belief in it in the early chapters. But when we get to his section “Global Warming” he gives us a chapter called “Evidence” where he dismisses a host of global warming proving science as distortion and exaggeration. He goes as far as stating that Al Gore’s “Inconvenient Truth” is “propaganda.” He does however state that he believes that global warming is happening and that human activity is likely the cause. But points out that America produce no more CO2 than most of Europe. The real CO2 culprits are India and China. Conservation seems to be his global warming solution. For example he says that there are cool colors that can be used for roof paint that would cool the house below. He also explains why ethanol will not solve the oil crises but butanol made from miscanthus could solve it. For anyone interested in the major issues challenging us today this book is a must read.
5,0393066274,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1490704-trina,5,"This book is a must-read for anyone interested in the current issues of global warming, energy or terrorism. It outlines the reality of the science and its impact on these issues in the public realm. I found it very informative and helpful to be able to follow these issues and determine what my stand is and what course I feel our country ought to take. It also helps to not be easily misled by varying reports."
6,0393066274,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1343245-warren,5,"This book is hands-down the most important book anyone can read this year. If I had the money, I would buy a copy for every person I know: it's that good. The book discusses the science behind topics that would be critical to any presidency: terrorism, the fuel situation, nuclear bombs and other related topics, global warming, alternative energy... and more.What I really like about the book is that it's politics-free. Liberals and conservatives alike stand to learn a lot about themselves and the arguments they make by reading this book. And it's based entirely on science. There's no spin, no hype, no agenda... the book is so refreshing to read after all those talking head books put out by both the left and the right.Anyone who will be voting this November needs to do themselves a favor and read this book from start to finish."
7,0393066274,http://goodreads.com/user/show/747142-ginny,5,"Pretty much everyone should read this, regardless of the presence or absence of designs on the highest office in the land. If you, you know, read the news or vote or anything like that, this book is for you. Not only is it incredibly helpful in contextualizing some of the science-related policy debates currently being waged, it's also just fascinating stuff (for example, the reason plutonium bombs are round and uranium bombs are cylindrical, or the fact that a square yard of sunlight delivers about a horsepower when it hits the ground). And all the complicated math is hidden in the end notes, so you don't even have to pay attention to that if it's not your bag.By the way, I hereby state, and mean all that I say, that I never have been and never will be a candidate for President; that if nominated by either party, I should peremptorily decline; and even if unanimously elected I should decline to serve."
8,0393066274,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1434656-adam,3,"What didn't I learn from this book!?I'd go ahead and list everything that I did but to do so would be to simply paraphrase the wonderfully concise and informative Executive Summaries a the end of each chapter!What a fantastic idea of Muller's that a future President must be aware of a number of basic, scientific principles that he can then use to help shape and guide his agenda. While he (admitedly so) gets a little personal with regards to the use of nuclear power in the States, for the most part, Muller stays politically neutral as he presents 'the facts' about the physics behind the most pressing problems that a future president is likely to face.From terrorirsm to nukes, global warming to space, all scientifically relevant topics are covered. To top it off, Muller declares that the majority of equations and formulas used to arrive at the conclusions he makes are rather irrelevant for a future president (as that is why he hires staffers). Thus, the majority of the book presents the conceptual, theoretical and demonstrable physics behind the these pressing political, and of course, scientific, issues.A fun read for anyone with an interest in science, politics or simply current events as the conclusions drawn by Muller are likely those that will guide public policy in the very near future. As for future presidents, well, it's obviously a must read! If only a specialist in every field could do this. Imagine where we'd be right now if someone had written Economics for Future Presidents. . .think about it!"
9,0393066274,http://goodreads.com/user/show/146952-grumpus,5,"Hmmm...look at the title. Maybe the word ""Future"" should be changed to include ""and Current"". I'm just say'n.Everything that is in the news today from nuclear bombs, to alternative energy sources, to global warming is succinctly covered in layman's language. I used my Kindle to mark some text that I thought was interesting and wanted to share. First regarding nuclear weapons, ""small amounts of radioactivity have such small consequences that they could properly be ignored. Radiological weapons are not the threat that many seem to fear.""Second regarding global warming, ""New Orleans was not struck by a category 4 or 5 storm (the number of these category storms hitting the US have not increased, like the global warming folks would have you believe), and any category 3 storm that hit the city in the past 50 years could equally well have destroyed the city.""The book is filled with examples such as this that run counter-intuitive to what the public has been led to believe. It will absolutely open your eyes and you will view news stories in a new light.Finally, the author doesn't leave you hanging…he puts up his ideas to implement if he were president with conservation of resources leading the way. Being president is not easy but having an understanding of the physics regarding some of the tough issues you'd face could make your job that much easier."
10,0393066274,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1769655-mike,3,"Basic, which is just what I was after. A couple of things are worth noting. He takes a very even-handed approach to global warming. He rightly believes the hysteria on any matter causes a strong overreaction that makes discussing the real merits of the issue very challenging. Another thing that's not really an explicit emphasis of the book that I appreciate is his willingness to differentiate his role as physicist and as citizen. He is very clear and open about when he steps out of physicist role to make a policy recommendation. I think we'd avoid some problems if everyone did not feel compelled to be an expert on everything. Think, for example, of all the nonesense that religious clergy feel obligated to speak about even though they have had no training whatsoever on these areas--biology; economics; geology, etc. Same holds true with politicians. This is not a call to defer mindlessly to experts. It's a call for authority to be respected within its circumscribed roles. But now I risk departing entirely from the book. My real wish for the book, which is stupid, is that it were a ""science"" for future presidents book. a series, followed next by, say, a biologist or chemist, would be very interesting. "
11,0393066274,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3151146-bruce-vines,4,"I feel by this book, in the area of natural law, the way I do about ""Rich Dad,.."" for finance. It discusses the physics that I believe EVERYONE should understand in today's world. It's a non-mathematical presentation of the physics that's applicable to our (the world's) current situation. One of the problems I have with people, in general, in our society (and the world for that matter) is that we're ruled by our prejudices (emotions) rather than our reason. I sincerely do NOT believe that God screwed up when he created the universe. Many people do! If our emotions are inconsistent with natural law (physics) then we only have three choices: we got the physics wrong, God screwed up, or our beliefs are wrong. I don't know about you, but the physics is pretty solid; I'm much more willing to believe that I screwed up than God."
12,0393066274,http://goodreads.com/user/show/845711-taylor,5,"This is an absolute must read, or must listen to. You can get his physics for non scientists podcast also (Dr. Muller teaches at Cal-Berkeley). For those who don't love physics or math, a couple of notes, there are about 2 equations in the whole book (he puts the rest in the appendix) and it is a fun and enjoyable read. It is also the most even handed discussion of the science behind terrorism, energy (including a long section about nuclear), and space exploration that I have read. The best section is on global warming. It changed the way I viewed things by not minimizing the uncertainties, but actually discussing viable solutions that won't cripple us but still prepare us for the scarier scenarios. I really can't recommend this enough. "
13,0393066274,http://goodreads.com/user/show/25353295-carmen,4,"This book explained the physics behind important issues that the President of the United States might have to deal with. Issues like bombs, nuclear energy, spy satellites, and climate change are discussed.I liked this book because it explained physics in a way I could understand. Muller did a good job of breaking the science down into understandable examples and simpler words so that I didn't get lost in a bunch of technical jargon. It's also amusing because he writes the book as if he is talking to the future president. You, the reader, are a future President of the U.S.A. Even if you know that you will never be in the White House, it's fun to imagine while you are reading."
14,0393066274,http://goodreads.com/user/show/19057281-bill,4,"Read this if you want to understand more about the science you see on the news. From an actual scientist rather than a journalist. Written without spin, and using words easily understood by the lay person. "
15,0393066274,http://goodreads.com/user/show/983193-peter,1,"After reading this book and getting onto Goodreads to plop it onto my read shelf, I noticed the 3 star rating I had previously given to ""Black Hole War"". I was prepared to give this book 2 stars, but after seeing my 3 star rating for BHW, a book that is way better, I had to knock this down to 1.I read the whole thing, but it wasn't easy. Not because the physics was too thick - Muller begins the book by stating quite clearly that as President you are probably to stupid or preoccupied to grok why E=mc squared, and so he's leaving out all equations from the text. Reading that line in the opening chapter was incredibly depressing. Have we come to expect so little from our elected officials that we have to dumb things down to the Malibu Stacy level of ""Math is hard!""?It took me a while to realize that the book was actually written prior to the 2008 presidential election. This is really a physics (actually an earth science/general science text book) for sixth graders. Given that perspective I think it's easy to understand that the title of this book should really be - Physics for The Last President: Who was an Idiot and Needed Simple Things Explained Slowly and Repetitively.Add to this premise the very narrow definition of ""the Headlines"" - Nukes, Energy, Global Warming, Terrorism - and you get a good idea gone wrong. The Global Warming section is nothing but a rebuttal of everything in An Inconvenient Truth that just ends up sounding like sour grapes. Like Muller is kicking himself for not playing the Al Gore role in that movie. The Energy section could have added in another couple of pages and then we wouldn't need the exhaustive, scene by scene recreation of Gores movie.There's other things that bother me about the book. The assertion that Yucca Mountain is too small to accept all of our nuclear waste early on in the book, only to counter that later on by saying if we just opened Yucca we'd all be living in a nuclear utopia, is just one example. If you are so afraid or uninterested in science that you need things dumbed down this much, then you probably aren't going to pick up a book like this in the first place. So why was it written and published? I can only assume it was a hurried attempt to cash in on the '08 race."
16,0393066274,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2395515-hilarie,5,"What information does a president of the United States really need to know to make informed decisions about some of the most important issues we are facing as a nation and as a global community? Richard Muller believes that some of this knowledge should be an understanding of the basic principles of physics. I loved the format of this book. Muller writes this book as though the reader was the next president of the United States. The book applies basic physics to a better understanding of five key areas: terrorism, energy, nukes, space, and global warming. I found this book to be truly enlightening. Almost daily I am bombarded by news stories featuring the challenges we are facing in at least one of these areas. Muller presents the facts, in a fair and balanced manner (honestly, I really can't tell which political party he favors) , allowing the reader to draw their own conclusions. For example, Muller explores why the greatest threats we face from terrorists are not ""dirty bombs"" or stolen nuclear weapons, and why solar powered cars are not really feasible, at least with our current technology. Personally, I was especially intrigued by the section on global warming, and I felt that this section alone would have justified the purchase price of the book. In each section he also presents a brief historical perspective with an emphasis on the physics involved in each situation. I was totally fascinated by his exploration of the facts surrounding the anthrax attacks which followed the 911 attacks. Muller's writing style is pleasantly conversational, almost as though you were having a discussion with your own personal science advisor. He also strikes the right balance between simplifying the physics to the level of easy understanding without insulting the intelligence of the reader. I enjoyed this book so much that I lent the copy I borrowed from our local library to my husband, who promptly purchased a copy midway through reading the book. This was a great read, and one that I wouldn't hesitate to recommend, even to our current president."
17,0393066274,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1839090-stephany-wilkes,5,"After reading this book, you'll be tempted to correct people you overhear, comment on a host of news articles with corrections, and go on a Facebook comment rampage on the Walls of less informed friends. Don't say I didn't warn you. This book is so necessary right now, with cherry-picked data and outright propaganda trumping fact-based debate. Muller tells you ""everything you know that just ain't so,"" which you might not even know until reading this book. To name just a few highlights, he explains the physics behind why and how the Twin Towers melted; why we should not be terribly afraid of dirty bombs (you'd likely get more natural, ground-based radiation just from living in Colorado than you would in an urban area if a dirty bomb goes off); all the various types of nuclear energy and yes, why some are in fact quite clean and safe; why the half-lives of nuclear materials make Yucca Mountain storage a very safe idea; why solar energy is so challenging to channel; why global warming is most certainly real (but not perfectly understood, which does not mean it's not real); and why energy conservation, in terms of getting more for the same energy, is the way we need to go (think of the improvements in the efficiency of home appliances now vs. in the 1970s).Those who are, and are determined to remain conspiracy theorists, outright opposed to nuclear energy no matter what, and fans of the idea that ""natural"" radiation is somehow ""different"" or ""better for you"" than ""other"" radiation, and so on may not like this book... but probably need it more than anyone. "
18,0393066274,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5891627-jo-green,5,"This was great, it was not so much over my head. It was a practical book, it explained about the difference in dirty bombs and why so much gasoline was so powerful, liquid gasoline is equal to TONS of TNT, it explained is simple scientific terms how the molecules vibrate creating more energy causing the other molecules to vibrate and gasoline is just about the most powerful explosive around because it ignites in the air- or something like that. He said if the president got a call about a dirty bomb, unless it was in a stadium full of don't evacuate a city because the panic would cause more catastrophe than the bomb. You have to know what kind it is too. It talked about the facts of global warming and the cherry picking both sides do to make their ""agenda"" the valid one. This was a great book just laden with fact and misinformation ladled out to people, possible viable alternatives to fuel use with realistic consequences. The true numbers after Chernobyl and what they meant as a whole after the leak. This was a simple non-biased, if you were president you need to know this so don't get bamboozled. We needed it so we wouldn't have been bamboozled, this ""felt"" like one of the most honest books I've listened to while not boring me to death. It lays out arguments both side of the political spectrum have used while not using numbers that are vital to result. Less scientifically over my head, and way less preachy. This book is just about what is, without excessive embellishment, and what that means in the way of fuel use decisions for the future. etc."
19,0393066274,http://goodreads.com/user/show/742181-kit,5,"Physics for Future Presidents was originally a class taught by the author at UC Berkeley. Students voted it the best class on campus. Then it became a series of podcasts, and now it's this book, which is extremely readable, very interesting, and ought to be required reading for everyone in the US, future presidents included.The book covers the physics of subjects like terrorism, nuclear weapons, nuclear energy, energy policy, and global warming. The genius of this approach is that it cuts through all the political rhetoric on both sides: laws of physics are laws of physics and they aren't budging for anyone, and they make a big difference in what can and should be done on all these issues.A recurring theme in the book is that the real problem isn't complete ignorance on a subject - it's all the things ""well-informed"" people think they know that turn out not to be true. It turns out I had a lot of these - like the ""the real danger is a dirty bomb"" (actually, the radiation in a dirty bomb, which uses conventional explosives to spread radioactive trash over a large area, is only a danger to the terrorists using it, since they're the ones in contact with it *before* it explodes, while the radiation is still concentrated enough to hurt somebody).This is a great popular science book in which the science is actually rigorous, and it can apply to everybody's life, whether you're listening to the news or trying to figure out the best way to lower your fuel bills."

A scientist who writes understandable language for the general public is special, but one who can make you understand difficult subjects in a few lines is even better.This book should be a ""must read"" for politicians, ministers (specially defence, economic affairs and of the interior and naturally our MP Balkenende too!), but journalists would also be a good target audience.With Mullers facts in your head, you'll be able to evaluate opinions by (badly informed) politicians, action groups with their (political) agenda and ordinary citizens who are afraid of subjects like: energy, terrorism, nuclear power or nuclear bombs and climate change.His examples on the risks of nuclear power/waste/bombs and the correlation with cancer are specially enlightning, but also facts like gasoline having 15 times the energetic power of TNT for the same weight and coal being 20 times cheaper than gasoline for the same energy you get from it.Common sense is a rare thing these days, this book is full of it!"

Only a third because I am an engineer by training so the other 2/3 was either boring or ""common"" knowledge and so didn't push me. I think that lay ppl (science is sorta religious, right? With engineers not being real clergy but more like deacons) who like science and/or are interested in the politics of science (environment, nuclear, war, etc) will be interested.The most intersting thing i read was that the whole nuclear danger (energy production not the weapons--they're obviously really dangerous) is blown way out of proportion. Nuclear energy (in the authors estimation) is another viable alternative to carbon sources. Its not that dangerous with the current protocols that are in place."
23,0393066274,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3692137-xing-chen,4,"Works very well as a cheat sheet for non-physicists who want an overview of the hot topics, from the perspective of a recognised expert. Facts that I memorised from this book came in very handy during conversations with a nuclear engineer friend. Like all pop-sci books that distill complex principles down to digestible volumes for the sake of their busy, hard-pressed readers, the claims made are necessarily hard to assess, though they're definitely well-presented and sound balanced and carefully considered. To the extent that I can place my faith in his judgement and years of experience, it's a good investment for the time it takes to read, and an excellent starting point regardless. "
24,0393066274,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3835957-gregory,4,"As a physicist (well, astrophysicist), I give this book my full endorsement. This really should be required reading for all people. Politics has a very nasty way of turning science into, well, politics, but doing it in such a way as to leave the public skeptical of the aims and goals (not to mention results) of scientists. Dr. Muller presents a fairly unbiased analysis of many current issues and addresses everything with the mindset of a scientist - relying on quantitative information to draw logical conclusions. Read this book. Seriously. I don't care what side of the political aisle you are on, your politics have probably blinded your logic. Now read it."
25,0393066274,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5093890-neil,3,"I did enjoy this book but gave it a lower rating that I might have for two reasons, both related to its publication date (2008). Because it was published six years ago, I already knew quite a bit about many of its topics. Also, because of its vintage, some of the information is out of date (e.g., the cost of solar energy technologies).That said, I thoroughly enjoyed the section on ""Nukes"". This was the clearest explanation of radioactivity, nuclear weapons, and nuclear power I've ever encountered. In particular, it dispelled some of myths around nuclear power that had developed in my mind over the years."
26,0393066274,http://goodreads.com/user/show/425987-amy,5,"Despite the title, this book isn't for future presidents. It's for the people who are voting for them, because it's everything you need to know, explained clearly, and it clears away so much of the misinformation, hype, and plain deception by the media. My opinion of journalism isn't exactly high in general, but my views on science journalism is particularly low. I knew a good deal of what was in this book, but it was a very good refresher, and I definitely learned some things as well.Highly recommended."
27,0393066274,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3502690-graeme-roberts,5,"Everyone should read this book. It is an amazingly clear yet detailed exposition of hard science that matters to many policy decisions, including global warming. Muller has no tolerance for sophistry."
28,0393066274,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4152324-leilanadja,5,A book regarding science applications and great reading for general review! Makes me want to go back to school and get that engineering physics degree......
29,0393066274,http://goodreads.com/user/show/291844-jill,4,"I hated Physics in high school. Didn't have a knack for it. Didn't see the point of it. Resolving vectors, calculating the acceleration of this, the force on that - why was this relevant to me? Perhaps if Physics for Future Presidents had been written at the time, and it had been assigned as a reading for physics class, I would have felt differently.The Introduction to Physics for Future Presidents begins with ""Are you intimidated by physics? Are you mystified by global warming, spy satellites, ICBMs, ABMs, fission and fusion? Do you think all nukes, those in bombs and those in power plants, are basically the same? ...Are you confused by the ongoing debate over global warming, when some prestigious scientists say that the debate is over? Are you baffled, bewildered, and befuddled by physics and high technology?"" Yes, yes, yes, yes and yes. Physics for Future Presidents is a primer on the science behind these major policy issues, to help the non-scientist separate fact from spin. The book begins with a riveting dissection of 9-11, explaining that what caused the twin towers of the World Trade Centre to collapse was not the impact of the planes crashing into the towers, but the fire from the airplane fuel weakening the steel structure of the buildings. But it is perhaps the next chapter on Terrorist Nukes that is more surprising - having read so much in the papers about fears of dirty bombs, I was surprised to read Muller's dismissal of this being a viable mode of attack by terrorists. He points out that the resulting radioactivity from a dirty bomb would be far below the threshold for radiation illness. Meanwhile, nukes made by rogue nations are also a relatively unlikely prospect - uranium bombs are relatively simple to make but obtaining enriched uranium-235 is challenging. Meanwhile, plutonium for a plutonium bomb is relatively easy to obtain from nuclear reactors but the bomb itself requires highly sophisticated technological expertise. Muller begins the section on Energy beginning with this list of stats, which helps to explain why our energy needs are met by a few dominant sources:Gasoline delivers 15 times the energy of an equal weight of TNT. Coal is 20 times cheaper than gasoline, for the same energyA square mile of sunlight at midday could provide a gigawatt of electric power - the same as a large coal, electric or nuclear power plantGasoline has 1000 times as much energy as an equal weight of flashlight batteries and 100 times as much as an equal weight of expensive computer batteries.Liquid hydrogen has 4.5 times less energy per gallon than gasoline has.Energy from non rechargeable batteries costs about 10000 times as much as from the wall plug. So we love oil because it contains huge amounts of energy. Unfortunately, we are running out of oil. Coal, while dirty, is cheap and plentiful and developing countries like China and India that are growing rapidly and require huge amounts of energy have large coal deposits. So the incentive for them to switch to cleaner fuels is lower. The section on Nukes unpacks all the misconceptions and (misplaced) fears on radioactivity, which have been stoked by incidents such as Chernobyl, Three Mile Island and Fukushima. Muller explains that when thinking about the dangers of radioactivity, ""the most dangerous materials are often not those with short or long half lives, but those with intermediate half lives. That's because atoms with short half lives disappear rapidly whereas those with long half lives take so long to decay that they don't have many decays per second."" He also reminds us that there is a certain baseline level of radioactivity in our natural environment and a certain baseline level of cancers that will occur in the population. What we should therefore focus on is the additional cancers arising from additional radioactivity (e.g. an X ray, a nuclear accident).On Global Warming, Muller lays out the facts as follows: humans are responsible for a significant increase in atmospheric carbon dioxide. However, it is not clear what the impact of this increase is on global temperatures - carbon dioxide increases the greenhouse effect, but with more warming, more water from the oceans evaporates, increasing cloud cover that reflects sunlight. So what is the net effect? Muller notes that news reports and documentaries like An Inconvenient Truth tend to portray a starker, more definitive picture thanks to cherry picking of data and bias (attributing any negative change to global warming). This doesn't mean that global warming isn't a concern, merely that we don't know enough to say for sure what the eventual impact will be.So what do we do about it? Muller starts by systematically debunking what he calls the ""non solutions"" based on the physics behind them - hydrogen as the new energy source, electric automobiles, fusion, solar, for instance. So what might work, in his opinion? ""Comfortable conservation"" through initiatives like the use of compact fluorescent lights, using cool colours on buildings that reflect heat, improving auto efficiency.An essential read for policymakers."
30,0393066274,http://goodreads.com/user/show/711453-adam-glantz,5,"I know very little about physics, so this book was pretty eye-opening...and it seems unavoidably polemical, as it seeks to guide behavior as well as explain scientific facts. Some of the things I found most interesting:*When it comes to nukes, we can relax a little, because bombs are hard to build. We also shouldn't be too afraid of dirty bombs or storing nuclear waste because there's already a decent amount of ambient radiation in the natural environment and it's not clear that small amounts of radiation increase the risk of cancer. And as for biological weapons like anthrax spores, it's hard to get enough of them airborne long enough to cause significant fatalities. What should we be worried about? Conventional terrorism (e.g., using gasoline like the 9/11 attacks, since it contains a lot of energy) and super-bugs.*The problem with energy is that there are currently few alternatives to fossil fuels that provide a comparable amount of energy for a low price. Unfortunately, coal is plentiful and cheap, but also dirty. Modern nuclear reactor designs are safe, but the public is afraid of nukes after the high profile disasters of the late twentieth century. Conservation and efficiency are good options, but more important are the energy habits of the fast-growing economies of China and India.*Getting into orbit is just a question of hitting the right speed, though this takes a lot of energy. Different functions (e.g., GPS) call for space satellites with different velocities relative to the earth: the spying version has to have the same speed as the earth (i.e., geosynchronous orbit) to work. When it comes to space exploration, robots are less vulnerable than humans, even if sending them is less glamorous.*Hi tech spying, both from the surface and from space, can be achieved by harnessing different kinds of energy, such as infrared light and x-rays. Differences in surface formations can be detected by measuring fluctuations in gravity.*On the topic of the earth's climate and atmosphere, what we do can affect them: e.g., chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs) can deplete the ozone layer and are now regulated. But whereas it's true that we're putting a lot more carbon into the atmosphere than in the past, it's hard to determine what the impact will be, despite often overblown claims. If we want to regulate emissions effectively, we'll need to give China and India an incentive to slow their economic growth."
31,0393066274,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6822042-garret-kruger,4,"An enjoyable book full of a lot of good information, but some information is getting very dated, other information is outright wrong.Muller's area of expertise is clearly nuclear power and those chapters are the most well researched and written. His section on terrorism was also very interesting. However, the section on climate change is incredibly out of date and should be skipped by any modern reader (a quick glance at Wikipedia would be more informative).Similarly, his views on the hydrogen economy/biofuels vs electric vehicles is similarly out of date. Here he also has several major errors. Most notably he leaves out the massive efficiency gains that EVs have realized (regularly achieving 120 mpge+) while assuming that hybrid cars could somehow approach this number in the near future (over a decade later they are at about the same efficiency as when the book was published). This should have been obvious to a physicist, the engine in a hybrid (or any internal combustion vehicle) is far less efficient than the generators that create electricity for EVs. In addition the charge-discharge efficiency of EVs is much higher than that of any non-petroleum based hydrogen generation.Finally, he includes the high cost of battery replacement and a ludicrously low 700 recharges figure in his economical assessment (the number is closer to 2,000 and even then functions at a moderately reduced range). While leaving out the large reduction in maintenance costs due to the relatively simple drivetrain in EVs. This leads to the completely incorrect view that hydrogen will be more useful than batteries in cars. Obviously this has been proved by history so it's easy to see with hindsight, but that doesn't make the section of the book worth reading."
32,0393066274,http://goodreads.com/user/show/10280795-julia,5,"Do you remember Stuxnet and the Iranian centrifuges? Did you ever understand why those centrifuges actually mattered, or what 'enriching uranium' means and why we have to do it? This book explains both these things and so many more topics that I've heard about in the news but never really understood. ""Physics for Future Presidents"" falls into the same category for me as ""Factfulness"": a book that changes how I see the world by enriching my understanding of it. Like how I never thought of shower curtains the same way after learning how airplanes fly (faster moving fluids = less pressure). But instead of toy concepts the book talks about global issues like terrorism, nuclear weapons, and global warming. For example, one of the biggest misconceptions I had was about how dangerous radiation from nuclear power plant meltdown is compared to other human activities (it's less bad than we think, sending radioactive waste to space is a terrible idea, and we should bury radioactive waste in a mountain soon). And I had no idea that the reason that nuclear fusion was hard is because it's difficult to heat up elements to the point that nuclear fusion would occur, or that scientists are still only 90% sure that global warming is caused by humans because clouds are hard. Oh, just a warning: the book might make you want to quit what you're doing and go study physics! You've been warned."
33,0393066274,http://goodreads.com/user/show/56684413-artyom,5,"This is my first book about physics. And I just love it. No fancy equations, no complicated calculations. Richard Muller was able to convey all important issues concerning modern-day physicists and, as the title implies, world leaders. The book is divided in 5 separate chapters - Terrorism, Energy, Nuclear Power, Space, global warming. Each part starts with a tiny introduction and a couple facts that startle you at first. But by the end of the chapter you become knowledgeable in the subject, thus previously amazing facts do not surpise you anymore. No chitchatting, only accurate , science based information. The author also provides more detailed explanation for some facts in the end of the book, mainly for those interested in precise computation. It is a bit outdated since it came out 10 years ago. But 90% of information is still correct. So, I recommend it to anybody interested in non-fiction. I promise - after perusing this book, you will undoubtebly get a better understanding of the world. "
34,0393066274,http://goodreads.com/user/show/63550161-craig,3,"Some really great breakdowns in this book, especially regarding nuclear energy and radiation. It put some historical events into a perspective I could wrap my head around.The Global Warming chapter could use a 2020 refresh, but it was informative based on the data available at the time. I wonder what the section on electric vehicles would look like if rewritten today. There have been some technological advancements that would probably not have been believed in 2008.I would also love a companion book to this one that discusses how the science has impacted past presidential policies (or not). Overall, a very concise and interesting read. I learned a lot, and its content has sparked several discussions with friends. I have no greater desire to run for president after reading it."
35,0393066274,http://goodreads.com/user/show/38660354-alex-wert,4,"Good book, especially for high school and college students looking to get a grip on some basics that will definitely be covered in some physics classes. I had a few qualms with the book, including a chapter titled “the next terrorist attack” which failed to consider anything other than plane based attacks. He spent a bit too much time on terrorism and he repeatedly seemed to imply that we don’t need to do anything about climate change since China and India produce more CO2 than we do. Also the “you’re our next president” theme got old real quick. Overall it gave a good overview of the state of world affairs that you can’t get from news sources due to their need to attract viewers.

The book provides a rational overview of different sources of energy, their uses, and potential dangers. It equips a reader with a non-physics background with an understanding of the first principles, mechanics, costs and risks of nuclear, solar, fusion, and other sources of power. Overall, it's a concise guide to understanding the energy world around us from an economic and political perspective."

Muller cuts through the media dramatics and calmly describes the science behind some of the big issues of the modern world - things like terrorism, spy satellites, the energy crisis, and global warming. And, in case you think it's all death and despair, Muller offers a spark of hope. There are people thinking about these issues and working on real ways to mitigate them.Anyway, if reading the news gives you a panic attack, this is a good place to find a bit of serenity."
