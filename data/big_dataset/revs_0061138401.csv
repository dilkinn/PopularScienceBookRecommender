0,0061138401,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1237196-petra-x,5,"I thought I knew about Evolution, about the random mutation of genes and the success of some mutations that convey an advantage to the host in the environment and could be the beginning of a new species or variety of plant or animal. That is the base. Saying that one and one makes two is at the base of mathematics but tells you very little of the depth and breadth of numbers. And so it is with this book.I can't review it any better except to say it filled my head with ideas and conjectures for the future and is a brilliantly-written and really enjoyable, fulfilling book. Without doubt a 10-star read. Compared to Carl Zimmer's other books, it is second only to She Has Her Mother's Laugh: The Powers, Perversions, and Potential of Heredity. That was the first Carl Zimmer I read and it inspired me to read four more of his books. He is a really excellent communicator and able to put even complex scientific concepts into plain language and inspire thoughts that stay with you long after the book has been finished."
1,0061138401,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5686119-book,4,"Evolution: The Triumph of an Idea by Carl Zimmer A thorough, well researched book that is broken out into four parts: Part One - Slow Victory: Darwin and the Rise of Darwinism, Part Two - Creation and Destruction, Part Three -Evolution's Dance, and Part Four - Humanity's Place in Evolution and: Evolution's Place In Humanity. Positives: 1. Accessible, well written book with an extensive bibliography. 2. Provides a lot more historical references than any other book I have read on the topic. It includes an excellent biography on the life of Darwin and how he came about the theory of evolution and his personal struggles to disclose his findings to the public. 3. Interesting history on the physics of how we determined the antiquity of Earth. Not to mention the order in which new life-forms appeared on Earth, and their actual dates in history. 4. A lot of interesting information regarding evolution: ""A population of birds can evolve into its own species if it gets cut off from its neighbors"". You will find out why. 5. The historical impact of germs...Napoleon found out the hard way. 6. Nothing like mutations to get evolution going. The genetic tool kit is explained in detail. 7. The origin of whales is one of the most interesting examples of evolution. And BTW a whale is no more a fish than a bat is a bird. 8. Everything you wanted to know about extinction and then some. 9. Interesting topics of the arms race between man versus bug, disease (great stuff on AIDS) and the evolution of sex. 10. My favorite chapters have to do with human evolution. Fascinating stuff and worth the price of the book (Kindle). Plenty of monkey business. It's the kind of stuff I go ape over. Negatives: 1. Less technical than other books on this topic. 2. The advancements of science is such that it is outdated in certain parts: genetics, and major recent findings (Tiktaalik comes to mind). That's what I get for waiting for the Kindle version. 3. It's an investment of time, a lot is covered. 4. Too politically correct if you ask me. Let loose a little Mr. Zimmer. In summary, a solid book on evolution that focuses on the history of the idea and how it succeeds to this day. I'm in awe of Darwin, science owes so much to his theory. Entire scientific fields are only possible with the understanding of evolution.

2,0061138401,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7324264-john,5,"Carl Zimmer, one of our finest science writers, has written an elegant companion to the PBS NOVA miniseries which stands on its own as an excellent introduction to evolution, covering topics which should be of interest to all, ranging from the evolution of sex to fighting disease, and of course, the search for humanity's origins as the only extant member of a once-flourishing tribe of hominid species related to the great apes. Each of Zimmer's chapters corresponds with the NOVA episode related to it. He gives us a mesmerizing, compelling portait of Charles Darwin and his intellectual struggles with his understanding of biology, geology and faith, as he recognized that his detailed observations of biotic diversity could only be accounted for by a theory of evolution via natural selection. Zimmer gives a riveting account on the history of life, highlighting such notable episodes as the evolution of multicellular organisms, the Cambrian explosion, the invasion of the land by plants, insects and tetrapods, the Permo-Triasic and Cretaceous-Tertiary boundary mass extinctions, to name but a few. He also notes the significance of chance and constraint in the evolution of animal life, pointing out the significance of tiny changes in certain genes in creating vast differences in the structures of animal skeletons and organs. He emphasizes the importance of co-evolution as a constant struggle between predators and prey. And he clearly shows the importance of natural selection in understanding the spread and control of such virulent diseases as tuberculosis. Zimmer's account of the role of God - if any - with respect to evolution and the widespread appeal of so-called creation science, most notably, ""Intelligent Design"", is replete with excellent arguments and examples demonstrating why Intelligent Design and other forms of creation science are not scientific. This well written, highly engrossing, popular account of evolution deserves to be read by all. (Reposted from my 2004 Amazon review)"
3,0061138401,http://goodreads.com/user/show/821374-nicole,4,"This is an excellent introduction or review of the theory basics. This covers sufficient detail to supply a solid foundation of evidence of change in species without being boring.Only towards the ends does Mr Zimmer seem to begin to present ideas with some bias. I did not read the 'Natural History of Rape"" by Thornhill & Palmer but I did read the original paper on the scorpion fly rape behavior. This paper was given very short shrift by Zimmer despite being good research and well written. Since the paper was not listed in his bibliography I assume he didn't even read it. The scathing review he quotes points to a small portion of the book using a small data sample that may have been of marginal applicability but I remember reading statistic papers with very large data samples relating human behavior and rape victim ages so I know there is far more work being done that is relevant but not mentioned in Mr Zimmer's critique. This type of work by evolutionary biologists is slapped down by Zimmer as being based on minute samples and because their ""samples usually a few dozen American undergraduates- mostly white, mostly affluent, - can hardly be expected to represent the universal human condition."" This statement is implying this was all that was being done but I have read papers with a far broader data base so I know this isn't true.Zimmer is being very loaded in his method of presenting the work he is ctirisizing. So while I may not be utterly familiar with all the work this type of obvious bias makes me hesitate to take other items as being fairly presented. This is me nit picking on one segment of a book I enjoyed but it bothered me."
4,0061138401,http://goodreads.com/user/show/60074558-xander,2,"A decent, well-written introduction to evolution. I like the approach of Zimmer to start the book with two chapters on the origin and context of the ideas of evolution. It's a story of Darwin's travels on the HMS Beagle and his search for evidence to back up his theory. Even the controversial and personal context is treated by Zimmer. Another thing I liked was the incorporation of the developments in geology (especially the importance for biology) and the origin and developments of genetics. Zimmer could have explained some more about the modern synthesis (especially the discovery of DNA and molecular biology), but maybe this would make the story harder to follow for some readers.In parts 2 and 3 Zimmer treats the building blocks of evolution (the tree of life, the building plan of organisms and the role of contingencies like mass extinctions) and the mechanisms of evolution (coevolution/arms races - and their impact on modern medicine! - and the role of sex) respectively.These two parts are the main part of the book and include the basic ingredients of evolution - even though I find some topics unexplained (e.g. Zimmer could have explained Dawkins' revolutionary paradigm shift of the selfish gene/extended phenotype). The last part deals specifically with humanity: the application of evolutionary biology to psychology, linguistics and sociology. This is the most sketchy part of the book, partly because the debate on evolutionary psychology is not clearly explained and might leave the general reader with the impression that it's just a fad. It's also this part that the Arrow of time shows itself: in the 17 years since its publication a lot of new insights on humanity's origins came to light and the amazing discoveries in neurosciences support (and build on) evolutionary psychology. Zimmer finishes the book with a (long) chapter of the continuous battle of religion against evolution. From the Scopes trial in 1930's via creationism in the 1980's to 21st century's intelligent design and its battle to establish itself as a science and part of high school curriculum. In general, this is a very accessible book on evolution, which shows the full scope and impact of the idea of evolution (a triumph indeed). But this scope also leads to the superficial treatment or absence of some very interesting topics, which is a minor let down, and because of the passing of time the book is a little out-of-date on some subjects."
5,0061138401,http://goodreads.com/user/show/19341029-aur-lien-thomas,4,"Drawing on the Beagle's journey, Carl Zimmer leads us through time and space to tell us how evolution through natural selection came to impose itself in the scientific realm.In this superb book, easy to read yet abounding in details, very well documented, biology waltzes with suitors as diverse as paleontology to geology and prehistory, showing that evolution is more than a explanation for the diversity of life on Earth: its understanding is crucial to our survival, from medicine to environmental issues. Facts are dancing before our wondering eyes, displaying how deep, brillant but also dangerous Darwin's idea was.Indeed, Carl Zimmer deals not only with social darwinism but, also, the existence or not of God in a last chapter where, sparing deism he dares none-the-less brushing off creationism and intelligent design.Here's a golden mine of informations."
6,0061138401,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4582869-katja,5,"Now I am wondering: are there boring books about evolution? I've already read a few (a standard set) and still found this one worth reading. It tells a bit about Darwin, and dinosaurs, and crazy creatures living next and inside us, and some philosophical implications. The least interesting part, especially for those living outside of US, is about the long-standing battle between scientists and evolution opponents who somehow manage to survive, no matter what."
7,0061138401,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6022040-camille,5,A profound read. I encourage everyone to pick up this one. Easily digestible and beautifully written. 
8,0061138401,http://goodreads.com/user/show/32553593-elliott-bignell,5,"Zimmer has once again triumphed with a work of solid erudition and admirable clarity. By turns entertaining and informative, he writes with a clean style. Neither as technical as Dawkins or Dennett, nor as luxurious as Gould, this book nevertheless showers the reader with the gold of understanding, should it be lacking, and new perspectives. For a reader not already steeped in the technicalities of evolutionary writing or the politics of creationism, this is an excellent place to come for a first, sweeping view of the depth and grandeur of this, one of modern science's defining ideas. And for those who sensibilities are sometimes blunted by too much of either, this is a lovely, light way to rekindle the flame of wonder at the fundamentals. (The fundamentalists probably getting on one's nerves by this point.)The triumph of an idea must, of course, start with the inception of an idea, and Zimmer devotes a considerable proportion of the book to its seminal figure, Charles Darwin. In this year of Darwin frenzy one will have been hard-put to avoid reading about this poor man, upon whom I inadvertently trampled in Westminster Abbey last Summer. Don't let that put you off; Zimmer wrote these passages years before the deluge of publications cashing in on the bicentenary and they are part of his narrative.Darwin's character cannot now cast light on the fact of evolution, as we would have known of it through Erasmus, Lamarck and Wallace had he never lived, and the positive flood of information garnered since his death makes this one of the surest bastions of modern science. Still, it is comforting to know what a genial and fair-minded cove he was, and what a thorough scientist. Zimmer's passages covering the tragedies and trials of his life are moving, and one hears with sympathy how this deeply religious man, trained as a pastor, had his faith shaken and mostly beaten away not by his work but by his losses. Darwin has made life easier for us atheists by eliminating the largest single Gap for Gods, but is was never his intention.I have read dozens of books of science in general and evolution in particular, but there always seems to be something new and striking to report, especially with an author of Zimmer's accomplishment. The one that made me laugh out loud on a Swiss train, possibly pleasing the shade of Zwingli, is the nugget that the farmers of Berne in 1478 sued a plague of beetles in the ecclesiastical court, winning a Ban of Anathema and the beetles being bound over to keep the peace. Or that the African bottleneck of 60,000 to 170,000 years ago leaves humanity with less genetic diversity that he chimpanzees of a single forest. This casts perhaps less light on our evolution than that the trend towards 2.4 children is reducing selection pressure and therefore, presumably, both contributing to the accumulation of bad genes and reducing rates of progressive change.One insight that I found both striking and delightful was the observation that documented rates of change in the fossil record, such as the rather well-covered evolution of whales, are several orders of magnitude lower than the rates of evolution that can be observed in the field, such as in guppy fish. Part of this can probably be explained in terms of changes of frequency in existing mutations, but it turns the creationist canard about ""microevolution"" and ""macroevolution"" right on its head. What we need to explain in the fossil record, based on ""microevolution"" is why so little change is seen over geological time!Oh, dear. I said the ""c""-word. Yes, Zimmer expends a penultimate section on the sadly and tediously necessary refutation of creationist nonsense and their antics in courts and classrooms in the USA. It doesn't spoil the book and is yet another litany of triumphs, but one cannot help but mourn that a triumph was ever necessary. He deals with these frustrating and infuriating episodes lightly and with less vitriol than I might have mustered. At the end of the Day-Age, evolution is necessary understanding in a range of fields, not least agriculture, medicine and petrochemicals extraction, and is becoming an engineering field in its own right as it is applied not only in selective breeding but in creating novel software and electronics. Software agents have for some time been able to defeat human fighter pilots in simulation, and it is evolution that got them there. Don't leave home without it!Zimmer is a wonderful science writer and his triumph, like that of Darwin himself, is complete. "
9,0061138401,http://goodreads.com/user/show/826429-sj-loria,4,"""Are we a biological accident or a cosmic imperative?"" -383A very interesting book on the history of evolution and the effects of evolution in our everyday lives. What I appreciated about this book is that it did not just cover the biological implications of evolution (it did do this by the way, and very well) but it also discussed social, cultural and psychological aspects of the human species that are deeply rooted in evolution. The bond of language, the role of sexuality, the origin of emotions such as jealousy or behaviors such as altruism are all discussed. The history of planet earth, cellular life, parasites and animals are all shown to be meshed together. Fascinating animal behaviors, grooming, infanticide, sexual activity of bonobos versus the violence of chimpanzees, ants versus virus and our pathetic use of parasites, and other mind blowing ideas are learned. The connection between ecology and evolution is demonstrated time and again.Human evolution is one topic that is covered in depth, but the book also discusses many others. The history of Darwin and the conditions of England at the time of his life provide a more clear picture of the publication and public reaction to his theories. It is amazing to see how opposition came immediately but how it was not rooted in science, but rather a result of our fear in response to the idea that we too evolved. The reaction at the Oxford convention where the book was discussed publically for the first time is incredible. The story of the argument and shouting match that followed is worthy of a play. The struggle between religion and science persists, with the mystic attackers constantly tinkering their argument to try to drape their fear in something resembling a reasoned position. However, as the book points out “we never get anywhere by labeling our ignorance god,” and opposing theories say much more about those who develop them than they possibly could on factual issues. After reading this story, I think you walk away with a deeper understanding of life, and a greater awe for our position in the web of life. We are perhaps the most coevoloved species ever, a part of a web of connections and unity with life in general. This book helps you understand this, presenting a very through and well written frame of reference for understanding our place in this thing we call life."
10,0061138401,http://goodreads.com/user/show/362447-karen,4,"Of all the books on evolution at the local library, I went with this one because I wanted a fairly objective, accurate YET thoroughly readable survey of the theory of evolution since Darwin's time. I was not disappointed. The preface even brought it bang up to date by summarising the main breakthroughs between 2001 (when the first edition was published) and 2006.Let's start with ""objective"": I didn't want Richard Dawkins, whose rampant atheism sometimes betrays the quality of his science. Zimmer is, in comparison, even-handed. The book puts the evolution theory forward as the best explanation we currently have that fits the known facts about life on Earth. Accurate: the book dispelled plenty of misconceptions about evolution (most people are thinking about completely different things when they think ""evolution"") and is very careful to explain exactly where modern science is, with regard to forming hypotheses based on evolution theory and to testing these hypotheses. Packed with fascinating case studies (the virgin lizard that reproduces by cloning itself; Arctic fish that have evolved antifreeze properties; the ""bad design"" of the human eye), it shows evolution at work in bacteria, animals and humans. I did have occasional questions along the lines of ""How did they know this was the controlling factor rather than that?"" and ""How did they rule out this other possibility?"" that the book didn't answer -- this served somewhat to dilute my satisfaction with the book.Thoroughly readable: I loved that the book began and ended with Charles Darwin and that it was almost as much about him as about his ideas and where modern science has taken them. Darwin comes across as a bookish, brilliant but slightly awkward scholar who had mixed feelings about his own ideas--he advanced them almost with embarrassment, so much was he a product of Victorian culture and education.So, is there room for God in the theory of evolution? Zimmer gives both good science and good theology due definition and recognition. Since science is the study of natural phenomena and God is outside its domain, Zimmer points out that there doesn't have to be a conflict between science and religion. Religion that ignores the facts, however, does so at its own peril. Hear hear."
11,0061138401,http://goodreads.com/user/show/554991-stacey,4,"It's heavy but definitely good. There's something kind of humbling about reading about the way life on earth unfolding to become what it was over the course of billions of years, only to be drastically altered in only of few generations by humans. Reading the chapter about mass extinctions occurring thanks to the human race made me want to vomit. Coming across the figure that 2/3 of all living species live in tropical forests, 1/2 of which were gone by the year 2000 made me want to punch myself in the face. Maybe Brett and I will just start recycling instead. Anyhow, not just depressing, also fascinating - lots a stuff to make you go ""huh!""...highly recommend this one. "
12,0061138401,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2354274-smruthi,5,"I can't recommend this book enough. This is possibly the first non-fiction book that's had me at the edge of my seat, furiously flipping page after page because it's so interesting. It's helped me piece together bits of scattered understanding into a cohesive overview. It has so many cool little pieces of information that you can actually remember and hang on to because it suddenly makes more sense."
13,0061138401,http://goodreads.com/user/show/71114463-jim-davis,5,"Excellent overview of evolutionClear, provides summaries and links to detailed evidence and discusses controversies such as sociobiology, racism, social Darwinism and teaching of evolution (controversial in the USA).

15,0061138401,http://goodreads.com/user/show/78162759-ixan,5,Best book of 2019. So far.
16,0061138401,http://goodreads.com/user/show/36069918-ramon-van-dam,4,"I have read quite a lot of books about evolution, which proves to me more and more how difficult it is to do that in both a clear and original way. With ""Evolution: The Triumph of an Idea"" Carl Zimmer manages to do both. Not only does he explain the basic ideas of evolution and natural selection, he goes several steps further by explorer areas that I have not seen discussed in a lot of other works.This includes going beyond ""just"" the regular animal kingdom that we often exclusively think of, while there is so much more out there where evolution thrives that might be even more interesting and important. The fact that he also discusses the life of Charles Darwin himself besides his scientific adventures might not be as interesting to everybody, but for me it brought some welcome variation.Some examples that Zimmer uses have been explored many times before in other works, but luckily he has several fresh ideas in this area as well. That combined with his highly enjoyable writing style make this one of the better works about a subject of which I think that everybody should at least get familiar with its basic notions.Recommended both to readers who are new to evolution and to others that have already read a lot about the field."
17,0061138401,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4625787-bill,3,"This is the first book I have read explaining the theory of evolution. This is a good, easy, primer.I've always understood evolution as 'survival of the fittest' but after reading the book I now understand it in terms of 'natural selection'.Before, I saw evolution as the development of traits enhancing prospects for survival which come by way of some sort of struggle. Now I see it more as development of order and functionality by way of numerous random mutations, of which a very few, statistically, are preserved due to coincidental environmental requirements for improved survival. In other words, the individual organisms struggle to survive, or even how healthy it is, has little do with evolution. If the individual has inherited an uncommon trait that enhances its chances for survival, then its progeny which inherits that trait will eventually outnumber all competitors due to increased opportunities to reproduce.A lot of examples of evolutionary phenomena are given in clear layman's terms.One fascinating example of how a snapshot evolution of species can be viewed is in the 'ring of species' phenomona.Orchid evolution is a fascinating example used. Bacterial evolution is explained. Along with many other examples.The book also includes a short, but well done, and very interesting, biography of Charles Darwin. Both as a young man and adventurer, with intentions to be a pastor, but gradually becomes a naturalist and accepts an assignment on a ship, as a naturalist, travelling around the world in great danger, collecting many specimens and fossils. It includes, as well, a moving account of the end of his life as he, as we all do, faces human loss and death, and questions about God. This is an excellent book. I recommend it to anyone who knows nothing or little about evolution."
18,0061138401,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5318877-elliott,3,"Overall, this book is a very good introduction to evolutionary biology. The book does touch on Richard Dawkins' idea that memes evolve through a natural process, but the book is otherwise all about biological evolution, as should be expected. Those who produced the audiobook were wise to get Peter Thomas as the reader (you may have heard him on Cold Case Files). His tone is perfect to remind us of just how dramatic the Darwinian Revolution really was.There was one big problem with the book, however. Predictably, Stephen Jay Gould used the Introduction to this book as another opportunity to advance his completely untenable view that science and religion represent “nonoverlapping magesteria” (NOMA). Although Gould has in many ways increased the public understanding of science, NOMA is a meme that may be fit, but is simply false. It's unfortunate that those encountering evolution for the first time in this book may be misled by Gould into thinking that science and religion are in some unclear way compatible. Thankfully, Gould's idea has been totally refuted by Jerry Coyne, Richard Dawkins, and other scientists even more knowledgeable than Gould. In my opinion, NOMA is best put to rest in Sam Harris' book The Moral Landscape: How Science Can Determine Human Values."
19,0061138401,http://goodreads.com/user/show/8156215-ann,5,"Another excellent and readable book by Zimmer. This book has great examples well explained and brings in much of the historical context, including the misuses of Darwin's idea and the more current Creationist/Intelligent Design response. The book has an introduction by Stephen Jay Gould, a nice section of further reading by chapter and an index."
20,0061138401,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5826059-michel,4,"I love the way Carl Zimmer writes his books, he takes you into details without making you feel bored. I would love to see a new edition of this book especially after so many new discoveries in the field of human ancestry."

22,0061138401,http://goodreads.com/user/show/16550554-iszam,5,One of the best book to understand evolution. I stopped reading crap by Harun Yahya after reading this book.
23,0061138401,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5619631-chris-demer,5,"This is a thorough and brilliant book that captures the essence of the theory of evolution in a way that most moderately educated people can understand. The writing is clear and follows a historical path in the development of the concept, which is basic to the understanding of biological science.Zimmer does a great job of describing Darwin's work and its meaning as the theory is developed and is bolstered by developments in geology, paleontology and later genetics. He discusses the time frames of these developments--the fact the as Darwin was slowly and carefully providing data to bolster his ideas, Mendel was doing experiments on pea plants which was the foundation of genetic theory. The connection between the two was not identified until the early 1900s. From there, rapid progress was made in clarification and experiments were pursued. Work in related fields (geology, paleontology) supported the theory and eventually the identification of the structure and later, the function of DNA in the cell all supported and helped explain how evolution occurs. Zimmer includes interesting chapters on co-evolution of organisms, sexual selection and evolution and humanity's place in evolution.This is a wonderful book, beautifully written and extensively researched. I highly recommend it!"
24,0061138401,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4996855-timothy-riley,5,This is a brilliantly written book that is very accessible to the science non-expert. The best chapter is the one on Coevolution that explains the relationships that animals and plants and fungi have with each other that gave each a niche to survive. The idea is nto that every species is perfect for its environment but that they are good enough to survive all the time working slowly on their imperfections. The diverse species-genetically-is most likely to be successful and able to adapt in the long term to changing environments. I recommend this book. 
25,0061138401,http://goodreads.com/user/show/10138542-chris-leuchtenburg,5,"This clear and concise overview of the development of the science of evolution covers not only the development of Darwinism, but also the subsequent scientific challenges leading eventually to the modern synthesis in the 1940s and 50s. Zimmer focuses on the discoveries and controversies in the scientific community, but also presents the early religious objections, the eugenics movement and the modern religious resistance. "
26,0061138401,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1879990-adam,0,This seems fine and great but having already read Quammen's Tangled Tree and Zimmer's own She Has Her Mother's Laugh within the last two years (the latter of which arguably supplants this whole book) I just don't think it's worth my time rn.

27,0061138401,http://goodreads.com/user/show/66906861-megawhoppingcosmicbookwyrm,5,"The absolute best book on explaining evolution to a layman audience. As visually stunning as the best coffee table books, yet full to the brim with information.

34,0061138401,http://goodreads.com/user/show/61742938-viktor,3,"A well rounded book, that goes into some of the details of evolution, without loosing sight of the big picture. The vocabulary was simple enough to understand (so no overly complicated technical terms, which makes it readable for everyone even if they lack the scientific background). It started where evolution began (well... where the theory 'began'), by Darwin. We started off with his theories regarding evolution (and geology). From there on we moved from the origin of cells, to the different periods in evolution, to extinctions, and watched the world evolve. Zimmer used many good examples of where evolution can be observed, ranging from bacteria and antibiotic resistance, to whales and their mammalian features. All in all, I enjoyed reading it, however in my opinion I would have liked something more detailed (which I can understand is nearly impossible to achieve due to the vastness of this subject)"

I read several evolution books before Zimmer and i like each of them. The different with this book by Carl Zimmer is, it allows me, someone who doesn't have any science background to get a good grasp of what he was saying because sometimes when i read other books i just lost it.There are many quotes from the book that worth to remember and that i think represent evolution well. The world burned; smoke hid the sun. Plants and phytoplankton died in the prolonged darkness, and the ecosystem that were build on them collapsed. When the skies cleared after the impact, the Cretaceous period was over. The giants were gone. i think this represent well of the evolution process, the extinction that happened, and how life will rebuild itself completely new afterward. The one think that i don't really like and make me give only 4 stars instead of 5 is because the final chapter that Zimmer dedicate to counterattack creationist or intelligent design. I honestly think that creationist or intelligent design as they call it right now doesn't warrant the energy of an attack. It clearly not a science and has no basic of science. Creationist is about faith, it is about what you believe with your heart. And when it comes down to that there is no need to attack it because it is an individual decisions and one that everyone has to respect. Finally the book end with a closure of life of a man who started all this. Darwin was lowered into the floor of the abbey, close to Newton. He had left us behind, in the natural world he had unveiled. It is an ancient world, in which we are an infant species; a braided river of genes flows around us and through us, its course altered by asteroids and glaciers, by raising mountains and spreading seas.

I struggled through half of Dawkin's ""Ancestor's Tale"" which inadvertently turned an inherently interesting subject into a drawn out process with just too many details, and too much speculation. That book was in need of an editor.Zimmer's book is packed with information, and a lay reader with a passing interest in the science of evolution will learn a lot. I learned a great deal, and was engrossed from beginning to end. The book begins with a nicely packed narrative of Darwin's voyages and exposition of the theory of natural selection. A theme throughout the book is how the science of genetics have subsequently moved beyond the results of Darwin's observations of the natural world, to provide a greater understanding of the mechanics of random mutation and natural selection in the animal world, but also with viruses and bacteria.Until I read this book I didn't really understand why I needed to use all of my prescription for antibiotics. I thought it was solely to prevent the bacteria making a comeback in my system, but that's only part of the story. The real reason is to prevent bacteria from mutating into every more virulent, resistant forms. It isn't just about me.And, I also obtained a clear picture of the problems with mono-culture, massive fields of one crop, and the problem with current pesticide practices. Find out why cotton growers are required to not use pesticides on 20% of their crops.Or that whales evolved from land based species and once had legs, and that there is evidence of this in the fossil record.

It starts with the fascinating story of Charles Darwin on the BEAGLE to introduce the reader to the origins of the idea of evolution. It traces that line of history from Darwin to the contemporary period. Then in the second part, the author pays attention to extinction, history of life and the gene toolkit, so to speak. Throughout the book is very much detailed, interesting and readable. The third section delves into the concept of coevolution, the use of Darwin's theory in our medicine and how sex developed and continues to play such an important role. The fourth part focuses on the humanity. How we are connected to this grandeur, to this history of life and how we view evolution in our current society. The book comes with a website (http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/evolution) which is full of multi-media material and a TV series which overlaps with the material in the book to a great extent. These will help the reader digest evolution much more. The series is particularly fascinating. I found the episode on the humans extremely intriguing. I think the only fault with the book is that it sometimes becomes overwhelmingly filled out with information without much of a story line. I understand that this is a science book not designed to entertain but mostly to inform and enlighten but I think more scientific anecdotes would make it more readable and enjoyable. However, this is forgivable and the book really pays off constant attention. Great job Mr. Zimmer !!"
38,0061138401,http://goodreads.com/user/show/53614-emily-kay,5,"In the winter of 2007 I led weekly one-hour discussions about evolution for an introductory biology class at the University of Chicago. When the course director handed me a free copy of Carl Zimmer’s book, Evolution: the Triumph of an Idea, my initial thought was “sweet! I can get paid to read about evolution.” Although I was only asked to lead discussions on the first four chapters of Evolution, I couldn’t stop reading the remainder of the book. Zimmer’s book weaves together the major evolutionary theories about natural, sexual, & kin selection, adaptation, and coevolution with fun stories about evolution—from cannibalistic spiders to the evolution of HIV and human resistance to it. This book is so easy to read and surveys many evolutionary topics that it is well worth the 5-6 hours to read it. You’ll get a digestible introduction to evolutionary theory that both non-scientists and die-hard evolutionists can appreciate.As a future evolutionary biologist I sometimes worry that my work on speciation may be too esoteric to be applied to the “real world.” Reading Evolution has proven to me that, on the contrary, evolution is fundamental to the way we understand our surrounding biodiversity, the human species, and our role in evolution today.

The book starts out discussing Darwin's origins and how he ended up studying evolution and continues to refer to him throughout the book and what he would have thought about where we are today. I particularly liked that Zimmer closed with a discussion of the 'creationism'/'intelligent design' insanity (calling it a 'controversy' suggests those who advocate teaching intelligent design side by side with evolution have a point...and I don't think they do...at all). It was a bit dry at times, but I think its just one of those books you can't expect to read all in one sitting. I definitely feel better armed to engage in a discussion about evolution now. "

The vocabulary was simple enough to understand (so no overly complicated technical terms, which makes it readable for everyone even if they lack the scientific background). It started where evolution began (well... where the theory 'began'), by Darwin. We started off with his theories regarding evolution (and geology). From there on we moved from the origin of cells, to the different periods in evolution, to extinctions, and watched the world evolve. Zimmer used many good examples of where evolution can be observed, ranging from bacteria and antibiotic resistance, to whales and their mammalian features. All in all, I enjoyed reading it, however in my opinion I would have liked something more detailed (which I can understand is nearly impossible to achieve due to the vastness of this subject)"

94,0061138401,http://goodreads.com/user/show/61742938-viktor,3,"A well rounded book, that goes into some of the details of evolution, without loosing sight of the big picture. The vocabulary was simple enough to understand (so no overly complicated technical terms, which makes it readable for everyone even if they lack the scientific background). It started where evolution began (well... where the theory 'began'), by Darwin. We started off with his theories regarding evolution (and geology). From there on we moved from the origin of cells, to the different periods in evolution, to extinctions, and watched the world evolve. Zimmer used many good examples of where evolution can be observed, ranging from bacteria and antibiotic resistance, to whales and their mammalian features. All in all, I enjoyed reading it, however in my opinion I would have liked something more detailed (which I can understand is nearly impossible to achieve due to the vastness of this subject)"
95,0061138401,http://goodreads.com/user/show/161317-lia,4,"I feel lucky that i stumble into this book by accident and decided to read it instantly. Since the first time i know about evolution, i always believe in it because it make more sense than any other explanation of how life comes about on earth. I read several evolution books before Zimmer and i like each of them. The different with this book by Carl Zimmer is, it allows me, someone who doesn't have any science background to get a good grasp of what he was saying because sometimes when i read other books i just lost it.There are many quotes from the book that worth to remember and that i think represent evolution well. The world burned; smoke hid the sun. Plants and phytoplankton died in the prolonged darkness, and the ecosystem that were build on them collapsed. When the skies cleared after the impact, the Cretaceous period was over. The giants were gone. i think this represent well of the evolution process, the extinction that happened, and how life will rebuild itself completely new afterward. The one think that i don't really like and make me give only 4 stars instead of 5 is because the final chapter that Zimmer dedicate to counterattack creationist or intelligent design. I honestly think that creationist or intelligent design as they call it right now doesn't warrant the energy of an attack. It clearly not a science and has no basic of science. Creationist is about faith, it is about what you believe with your heart. And when it comes down to that there is no need to attack it because it is an individual decisions and one that everyone has to respect. Finally the book end with a closure of life of a man who started all this. Darwin was lowered into the floor of the abbey, close to Newton. He had left us behind, in the natural world he had unveiled. It is an ancient world, in which we are an infant species; a braided river of genes flows around us and through us, its course altered by asteroids and glaciers, by raising mountains and spreading seas. He began the exploration of this remarkable world, and he left us to walk deeper into it, without him."
96,0061138401,http://goodreads.com/user/show/10745244-henry,5,"If I was to recommend one book on the subject of evolution this would be it. I struggled through half of Dawkin's ""Ancestor's Tale"" which inadvertently turned an inherently interesting subject into a drawn out process with just too many details, and too much speculation. That book was in need of an editor.Zimmer's book is packed with information, and a lay reader with a passing interest in the science of evolution will learn a lot. I learned a great deal, and was engrossed from beginning to end. The book begins with a nicely packed narrative of Darwin's voyages and exposition of the theory of natural selection. A theme throughout the book is how the science of genetics have subsequently moved beyond the results of Darwin's observations of the natural world, to provide a greater understanding of the mechanics of random mutation and natural selection in the animal world, but also with viruses and bacteria.Until I read this book I didn't really understand why I needed to use all of my prescription for antibiotics. I thought it was solely to prevent the bacteria making a comeback in my system, but that's only part of the story. The real reason is to prevent bacteria from mutating into every more virulent, resistant forms. It isn't just about me.And, I also obtained a clear picture of the problems with mono-culture, massive fields of one crop, and the problem with current pesticide practices. Find out why cotton growers are required to not use pesticides on 20% of their crops.Or that whales evolved from land based species and once had legs, and that there is evidence of this in the fossil record. As there is of more and more intermediary species which were once purely the object of speculation.I highly recommend this book, just on the basis of the quality of writing, breadth of coverage of the subject and interest generated."

It starts with the fascinating story of Charles Darwin on the BEAGLE to introduce the reader to the origins of the idea of evolution. It traces that line of history from Darwin to the contemporary period. Then in the second part, the author pays attention to extinction, history of life and the gene toolkit, so to speak. Throughout the book is very much detailed, interesting and readable. The third section delves into the concept of coevolution, the use of Darwin's theory in our medicine and how sex developed and continues to play such an important role. The fourth part focuses on the humanity. How we are connected to this grandeur, to this history of life and how we view evolution in our current society. The book comes with a website (http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/evolution) which is full of multi-media material and a TV series which overlaps with the material in the book to a great extent. These will help the reader digest evolution much more. The series is particularly fascinating. I found the episode on the humans extremely intriguing. I think the only fault with the book is that it sometimes becomes overwhelmingly filled out with information without much of a story line. I understand that this is a science book not designed to entertain but mostly to inform and enlighten but I think more scientific anecdotes would make it more readable and enjoyable. However, this is forgivable and the book really pays off constant attention. Great job Mr. Zimmer !!"
98,0061138401,http://goodreads.com/user/show/53614-emily-kay,5,"In the winter of 2007 I led weekly one-hour discussions about evolution for an introductory biology class at the University of Chicago. When the course director handed me a free copy of Carl Zimmer’s book, Evolution: the Triumph of an Idea, my initial thought was “sweet! I can get paid to read about evolution.” Although I was only asked to lead discussions on the first four chapters of Evolution, I couldn’t stop reading the remainder of the book. Zimmer’s book weaves together the major evolutionary theories about natural, sexual, & kin selection, adaptation, and coevolution with fun stories about evolution—from cannibalistic spiders to the evolution of HIV and human resistance to it. This book is so easy to read and surveys many evolutionary topics that it is well worth the 5-6 hours to read it. You’ll get a digestible introduction to evolutionary theory that both non-scientists and die-hard evolutionists can appreciate.As a future evolutionary biologist I sometimes worry that my work on speciation may be too esoteric to be applied to the “real world.” Reading Evolution has proven to me that, on the contrary, evolution is fundamental to the way we understand our surrounding biodiversity, the human species, and our role in evolution today.

The vocabulary was simple enough to understand (so no overly complicated technical terms, which makes it readable for everyone even if they lack the scientific background). It started where evolution began (well... where the theory 'began'), by Darwin. We started off with his theories regarding evolution (and geology). From there on we moved from the origin of cells, to the different periods in evolution, to extinctions, and watched the world evolve. Zimmer used many good examples of where evolution can be observed, ranging from bacteria and antibiotic resistance, to whales and their mammalian features. All in all, I enjoyed reading it, however in my opinion I would have liked something more detailed (which I can understand is nearly impossible to achieve due to the vastness of this subject)"

Since the first time i know about evolution, i always believe in it because it make more sense than any other explanation of how life comes about on earth. I read several evolution books before Zimmer and i like each of them. The different with this book by Carl Zimmer is, it allows me, someone who doesn't have any science background to get a good grasp of what he was saying because sometimes when i read other books i just lost it.There are many quotes from the book that worth to remember and that i think represent evolution well. The world burned; smoke hid the sun. Plants and phytoplankton died in the prolonged darkness, and the ecosystem that were build on them collapsed. When the skies cleared after the impact, the Cretaceous period was over. The giants were gone. i think this represent well of the evolution process, the extinction that happened, and how life will rebuild itself completely new afterward. The one think that i don't really like and make me give only 4 stars instead of 5 is because the final chapter that Zimmer dedicate to counterattack creationist or intelligent design. I honestly think that creationist or intelligent design as they call it right now doesn't warrant the energy of an attack. It clearly not a science and has no basic of science. Creationist is about faith, it is about what you believe with your heart. And when it comes down to that there is no need to attack it because it is an individual decisions and one that everyone has to respect. Finally the book end with a closure of life of a man who started all this. Darwin was lowered into the floor of the abbey, close to Newton. He had left us behind, in the natural world he had unveiled. It is an ancient world, in which we are an infant species; a braided river of genes flows around us and through us, its course altered by asteroids and glaciers, by raising mountains and spreading seas.

A theme throughout the book is how the science of genetics have subsequently moved beyond the results of Darwin's observations of the natural world, to provide a greater understanding of the mechanics of random mutation and natural selection in the animal world, but also with viruses and bacteria.Until I read this book I didn't really understand why I needed to use all of my prescription for antibiotics. I thought it was solely to prevent the bacteria making a comeback in my system, but that's only part of the story. The real reason is to prevent bacteria from mutating into every more virulent, resistant forms. It isn't just about me.And, I also obtained a clear picture of the problems with mono-culture, massive fields of one crop, and the problem with current pesticide practices. Find out why cotton growers are required to not use pesticides on 20% of their crops.Or that whales evolved from land based species and once had legs, and that there is evidence of this in the fossil record.

It traces that line of history from Darwin to the contemporary period. Then in the second part, the author pays attention to extinction, history of life and the gene toolkit, so to speak. Throughout the book is very much detailed, interesting and readable. The third section delves into the concept of coevolution, the use of Darwin's theory in our medicine and how sex developed and continues to play such an important role.

These will help the reader digest evolution much more. The series is particularly fascinating. I found the episode on the humans extremely intriguing. I think the only fault with the book is that it sometimes becomes overwhelmingly filled out with information without much of a story line.

I can get paid to read about evolution.” Although I was only asked to lead discussions on the first four chapters of Evolution, I couldn’t stop reading the remainder of the book. Zimmer’s book weaves together the major evolutionary theories about natural, sexual, & kin selection, adaptation, and coevolution with fun stories about evolution—from cannibalistic spiders to the evolution of HIV and human resistance to it. This book is so easy to read and surveys many evolutionary topics that it is well worth the 5-6 hours to read it.

Carl Zimmer's writing is very accessible and friendly, and he manages to cover a huge amount of material in a scant 423 pages. To be sure, what the book offers is an overview, but it is an overview with an excellent level of resolution; Zimmer captures just the right details needed to convey a good sense of the subject."

We have reaped so much benefits from what this knowledge brought us, which is modern medicine. Yet, we know so little about the theory. I think that's hypocrite.So, if you wanna start somewhere, if you wanna learn a thing or two about the theory -- this might just be the book."

So I thought maybe I would just read a contemporary, semi-popular treatment as a refresher. This one was cheap at Walden's, has pretty pictures, and does a serviceable job. The material on Darwin's life was unexpectedly entertaining, the rest was (reassuringly) mostly familiar territory. A nice primer."
164,0061138401,http://goodreads.com/user/show/12018120-colin,5,"This was not quite the book I expected. I was looking for a book to explain what evolution is, how it works, and describe the evidence for it. This appeared to be the best along those lines that my father owned, so I borrowed it from him. There was a little more history of the idea of evolution and Darwin's personal life than I anticipated. That was a nice way of bookending the overall story. And I did find all the discussion of the hows and whys of evolution that I was looking for."

The different with this book by Carl Zimmer is, it allows me, someone who doesn't have any science background to get a good grasp of what he was saying because sometimes when i read other books i just lost it.There are many quotes from the book that worth to remember and that i think represent evolution well.

I honestly think that creationist or intelligent design as they call it right now doesn't warrant the energy of an attack. It clearly not a science and has no basic of science. Creationist is about faith, it is about what you believe with your heart. And when it comes down to that there is no need to attack it because it is an individual decisions and one that everyone has to respect. Finally the book end with a closure of life of a man who started all this. Darwin was lowered into the floor of the abbey, close to Newton. He had left us behind, in the natural world he had unveiled. It is an ancient world, in which we are an infant species; a braided river of genes flows around us and through us, its course altered by asteroids and glaciers, by raising mountains and spreading seas.

It starts with the fascinating story of Charles Darwin on the BEAGLE to introduce the reader to the origins of the idea of evolution. It traces that line of history from Darwin to the contemporary period. Then in the second part, the author pays attention to extinction, history of life and the gene toolkit, so to speak. Throughout the book is very much detailed, interesting and readable. The third section delves into the concept of coevolution, the use of Darwin's theory in our medicine and how sex developed and continues to play such an important role. The fourth part focuses on the humanity. How we are connected to this grandeur, to this history of life and how we view evolution in our current society. The book comes with a website (http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/evolution) which is full of multi-media material and a TV series which overlaps with the material in the book to a great extent. These will help the reader digest evolution much more. The series is particularly fascinating. I found the episode on the humans extremely intriguing. I think the only fault with the book is that it sometimes becomes overwhelmingly filled out with information without much of a story line. I understand that this is a science book not designed to entertain but mostly to inform and enlighten but I think more scientific anecdotes would make it more readable and enjoyable. However, this is forgivable and the book really pays off constant attention. Great job Mr. Zimmer !!"
218,0061138401,http://goodreads.com/user/show/53614-emily-kay,5,"In the winter of 2007 I led weekly one-hour discussions about evolution for an introductory biology class at the University of Chicago. When the course director handed me a free copy of Carl Zimmer’s book, Evolution: the Triumph of an Idea, my initial thought was “sweet! I can get paid to read about evolution.” Although I was only asked to lead discussions on the first four chapters of Evolution, I couldn’t stop reading the remainder of the book. Zimmer’s book weaves together the major evolutionary theories about natural, sexual, & kin selection, adaptation, and coevolution with fun stories about evolution—from cannibalistic spiders to the evolution of HIV and human resistance to it. This book is so easy to read and surveys many evolutionary topics that it is well worth the 5-6 hours to read it. You’ll get a digestible introduction to evolutionary theory that both non-scientists and die-hard evolutionists can appreciate.As a future evolutionary biologist I sometimes worry that my work on speciation may be too esoteric to be applied to the “real world.” Reading Evolution has proven to me that, on the contrary, evolution is fundamental to the way we understand our surrounding biodiversity, the human species, and our role in evolution today.

219,0061138401,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1006453-robin-miller,4,"As someone whose scientific background is limited to high school bio, chem, and physics, and undergraduate horticulture, I found this book did a great job walking the fine line between lots of detailed information and coherence (if not actual 'plot'). The book starts out discussing Darwin's origins and how he ended up studying evolution and continues to refer to him throughout the book and what he would have thought about where we are today. I particularly liked that Zimmer closed with a discussion of the 'creationism'/'intelligent design' insanity (calling it a 'controversy' suggests those who advocate teaching intelligent design side by side with evolution have a point...and I don't think they do...at all). It was a bit dry at times, but I think its just one of those books you can't expect to read all in one sitting. I definitely feel better armed to engage in a discussion about evolution now. "
220,0061138401,http://goodreads.com/user/show/853510-frederik,4,Brilliant non-technical summary of the history and modern advances in evolutionary science.

I learned a great deal about the origin of mankind (I did not know for example that we were an entirely different branch of the hominids than the homo erectus). In the last chapter Zimmer does a great job revealing the hidden agenda of creationists in the USA and why their vision of the world is not only wrong but also dangerous. This is a great book.

248,0061138401,http://goodreads.com/user/show/53614-emily-kay,5,"In the winter of 2007 I led weekly one-hour discussions about evolution for an introductory biology class at the University of Chicago. When the course director handed me a free copy of Carl Zimmer’s book, Evolution: the Triumph of an Idea, my initial thought was “sweet! I can get paid to read about evolution.” Although I was only asked to lead discussions on the first four chapters of Evolution, I couldn’t stop reading the remainder of the book. Zimmer’s book weaves together the major evolutionary theories about natural, sexual, & kin selection, adaptation, and coevolution with fun stories about evolution—from cannibalistic spiders to the evolution of HIV and human resistance to it. This book is so easy to read and surveys many evolutionary topics that it is well worth the 5-6 hours to read it. You’ll get a digestible introduction to evolutionary theory that both non-scientists and die-hard evolutionists can appreciate.As a future evolutionary biologist I sometimes worry that my work on speciation may be too esoteric to be applied to the “real world.” Reading Evolution has proven to me that, on the contrary, evolution is fundamental to the way we understand our surrounding biodiversity, the human species, and our role in evolution today.

I particularly liked that Zimmer closed with a discussion of the 'creationism'/'intelligent design' insanity (calling it a 'controversy' suggests those who advocate teaching intelligent design side by side with evolution have a point...and I don't think they do...at all).

273,0061138401,http://goodreads.com/user/show/70950891-david,5,An interesting and diverse study of the nature of evolution. A must for animal lovers and the inquisitive.
274,0061138401,http://goodreads.com/user/show/61742938-viktor,3,"A well rounded book, that goes into some of the details of evolution, without loosing sight of the big picture. The vocabulary was simple enough to understand (so no overly complicated technical terms, which makes it readable for everyone even if they lack the scientific background). It started where evolution began (well... where the theory 'began'), by Darwin. We started off with his theories regarding evolution (and geology). From there on we moved from the origin of cells, to the different periods in evolution, to extinctions, and watched the world evolve. Zimmer used many good examples of where evolution can be observed, ranging from bacteria and antibiotic resistance, to whales and their mammalian features. All in all, I enjoyed reading it, however in my opinion I would have liked something more detailed (which I can understand is nearly impossible to achieve due to the vastness of this subject)"
275,0061138401,http://goodreads.com/user/show/161317-lia,4,"I feel lucky that i stumble into this book by accident and decided to read it instantly. Since the first time i know about evolution, i always believe in it because it make more sense than any other explanation of how life comes about on earth. I read several evolution books before Zimmer and i like each of them. The different with this book by Carl Zimmer is, it allows me, someone who doesn't have any science background to get a good grasp of what he was saying because sometimes when i read other books i just lost it.There are many quotes from the book that worth to remember and that i think represent evolution well. The world burned; smoke hid the sun. Plants and phytoplankton died in the prolonged darkness, and the ecosystem that were build on them collapsed. When the skies cleared after the impact, the Cretaceous period was over. The giants were gone. i think this represent well of the evolution process, the extinction that happened, and how life will rebuild itself completely new afterward. The one think that i don't really like and make me give only 4 stars instead of 5 is because the final chapter that Zimmer dedicate to counterattack creationist or intelligent design. I honestly think that creationist or intelligent design as they call it right now doesn't warrant the energy of an attack. It clearly not a science and has no basic of science. Creationist is about faith, it is about what you believe with your heart. And when it comes down to that there is no need to attack it because it is an individual decisions and one that everyone has to respect. Finally the book end with a closure of life of a man who started all this. Darwin was lowered into the floor of the abbey, close to Newton. He had left us behind, in the natural world he had unveiled. It is an ancient world, in which we are an infant species; a braided river of genes flows around us and through us, its course altered by asteroids and glaciers, by raising mountains and spreading seas. He began the exploration of this remarkable world, and he left us to walk deeper into it, without him."
276,0061138401,http://goodreads.com/user/show/10745244-henry,5,"If I was to recommend one book on the subject of evolution this would be it. I struggled through half of Dawkin's ""Ancestor's Tale"" which inadvertently turned an inherently interesting subject into a drawn out process with just too many details, and too much speculation. That book was in need of an editor.Zimmer's book is packed with information, and a lay reader with a passing interest in the science of evolution will learn a lot. I learned a great deal, and was engrossed from beginning to end. The book begins with a nicely packed narrative of Darwin's voyages and exposition of the theory of natural selection. A theme throughout the book is how the science of genetics have subsequently moved beyond the results of Darwin's observations of the natural world, to provide a greater understanding of the mechanics of random mutation and natural selection in the animal world, but also with viruses and bacteria.Until I read this book I didn't really understand why I needed to use all of my prescription for antibiotics. I thought it was solely to prevent the bacteria making a comeback in my system, but that's only part of the story. The real reason is to prevent bacteria from mutating into every more virulent, resistant forms. It isn't just about me.And, I also obtained a clear picture of the problems with mono-culture, massive fields of one crop, and the problem with current pesticide practices. Find out why cotton growers are required to not use pesticides on 20% of their crops.Or that whales evolved from land based species and once had legs, and that there is evidence of this in the fossil record. As there is of more and more intermediary species which were once purely the object of speculation.I highly recommend this book, just on the basis of the quality of writing, breadth of coverage of the subject and interest generated."
277,0061138401,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2181524-farshad,5,"I finished the book some while ago and now I am re-reading it. I think it is a wonderful introduction to the concept of evolution. It starts with the fascinating story of Charles Darwin on the BEAGLE to introduce the reader to the origins of the idea of evolution. It traces that line of history from Darwin to the contemporary period. Then in the second part, the author pays attention to extinction, history of life and the gene toolkit, so to speak. Throughout the book is very much detailed, interesting and readable. The third section delves into the concept of coevolution, the use of Darwin's theory in our medicine and how sex developed and continues to play such an important role. The fourth part focuses on the humanity. How we are connected to this grandeur, to this history of life and how we view evolution in our current society. The book comes with a website (http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/evolution) which is full of multi-media material and a TV series which overlaps with the material in the book to a great extent. These will help the reader digest evolution much more. The series is particularly fascinating. I found the episode on the humans extremely intriguing. I think the only fault with the book is that it sometimes becomes overwhelmingly filled out with information without much of a story line. I understand that this is a science book not designed to entertain but mostly to inform and enlighten but I think more scientific anecdotes would make it more readable and enjoyable.
