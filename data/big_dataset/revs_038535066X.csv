For me, this book was — like  Why Nations Fail,  Guns, Germs, and Steel and Orlando Figes’s  The Whisperers— a keystone narrative that linked up many formerly disparate threads of my personal reading. Such books are rare pleasures. I had always known that Alexander von Humboldt’s story was a link missing from my general knowledge. The praises of Oliver Sacks and Stephen Jay Gould alone told me as much. But I didn't know this was generally due to anti-German sentiment so powerful in the U.S. and Europe after World War II.During his Latin American explorations (1799-1804), Humboldt was front page news in the West. He and his team climbed volcanoes, pressed plants, murdered fascinating new animal species, reset the coordinates, often grossly incorrect, for scores of cartographic features (rivers, mountains, etc.), slept on the shores of the Orinoco River, dodged leopards, crocodiles and other predators, and were eaten alive by mosquitoes. This was a time when his name was a byword for adventure on the lips of every schoolboy, even in the U.S.Afterward Humboldt returned to Europe, settling in Paris, where he wrote up his findings. What resulted was a series of paradigm-smashing publications for both scientists and general readers. He is the first true naturalist as we understand that term today. It helped that Humboldt was a writer of startling clarity and concision. Until then, it seems, writing for the masses was not considered a career-expanding opportunity by men of science. Author Andrea Wulf does not say why, but I think it probably had something to do with the presumed loss of reputation for so craven an act of moneymaking. Humboldt changed all that. Sacks and Gould and countless other writers would become beneficiaries of his breakthrough.But his insight into the unplumbed market for science writing is secondary to his real achievement. Humboldt’s revolutionary act was to view nature as a unified force dependent upon myriad interactions and mutual reciprocities, not reduced to mind-numbing categories as taxonomists and other systematists were then doing. Humboldt saw the full ecological impact of forests; therefore, he was the first to warn about deforestation. He saw how greedy cash crops (monoculture), cleared needed forest, leeched the ground of minerals and emptied aquifers, thus touching the fates of countless animal species, including humans. Moreover, he saw the importance of expressing one’s personal emotional responses to nature and he wrote with a passion that repelled some cold men of science, but enlisted scores of readers from all walks of life. He had as personal acquaintances Simón Bolívar, Johann Wolfgang von Goethe, U.S. presidents Thomas Jefferson and John Adams, and Napoleon Bonaparte, who had him arrested briefly as a German spy. They all read him. His works constituted an epiphany for Charles Darwin, who took Humboldt’s  Personal Narrative on board H.M.S. Beagle with him and who later met his hero. Henry David Thoreau could not have written  Walden without Humboldt's example. The English Romantic poets William Wordsworth, Samuel Taylor Coleridge and Lord Byron all read and were influenced by him; as was Edgar Allan Poe, who dedicated his Eureka: A Prose Poem to him.The major figures succeeding Humboldt and carrying his torch, if you will, include George Perkins Marsh, whose  Man and Nature coalesced Humboldt’s environmental warnings, previously scattered throughout many volumes, into a clarion call for the conservation of the natural world; Ernst Haeckel, the prolific marine biologist, who virtually broadcast the Humboldtian sensibility to countless millions through his own popular books and articles; and John Muir, the almost comically ecstatic naturalist largely responsible for creating the U.S. federal parks system.P.S. Humboldt was almost certainly homosexual. He usually had some slender young man with him in the guise of assistant. He avoided women like the plague, except those who could talk science, and he was said, if we are to believe Wulf (I do), to have disappointed entire cities of women who thought he'd make a fine match. His life was, in part, another bullet to the gizzard of that ridiculous fiction, the celibate bachelor."

Today, in the United States, his name is practically unknown, despite being a world-wide celebrity in his day. Humboldt was a great explorer and scientist. He saw nature as a unified whole, an ""organism in which parts only worked in relation to each other."" His approach was holistic, and was entirely against the reductionist approach to science. Perhaps because of the influence of Goethe, Humboldt strongly advocated merging of art and science. In 1806, his writings were about evolutionary ideas, long before Darwin. In fact, Darwin took Humboldt's seven-volume book Personal Narrative of a Journey to the Equinoctial Regions of the New Continent along with him during his voyage aboard the Beagle. In his book Views of Nature, Humboldt wrote about how weather and geography influence the moods of people--and this was a revelation. He inspired generations of scientists, writers and poets, including Thoreau, Emerson, Darwin, and Jules Verne. Humboldt was also a strident abolitionist: He equated colonialism with slavery and ""European barbarism."" He befriended and greatly influenced Simón Bolívar's efforts to free South America from the tyranny of its colonial status. He was the world's foremost expert on Latin America.When Humboldt was young, he yearned to participate in adventures and exploration. At the age of 27, he went off on an exploration of South America, an adventure that lasted five years. He survived terrible conditions, jungle heat, mountain cold, high-altitude sickness, and the torment of mosquitos. He did not take a large retinue, but only traveled with one scientist friend and a couple of guides. Along the way he took copious notes, a multitude of measurements with his scientific instruments, and lots of specimens of flora and fauna. He sent them back to Europe at regular intervals, in case he never made it back home alive.Humboldt invented the concept of isotherms, that enabled a global understanding of climate. Back in Europe, he gave many free lectures in Berlin, encouraging people of all classes to attend. Half of the attendees were women. His lectures were unique, connecting ""seemingly disparate disciplines and facts."" He talked about the complex web of nature with ""extraordinary clarity."" He organized a remarkable conference of 500 scientists from all across Europe. When Humboldt was 59 years old, he went on an expedition to Siberia. After analyzing the geology of certain areas in the Ural mountains, he predicted that he would find diamonds, and everyone thought he was crazy. But, he did find them!He was at heart an environmentalist. He wrote a lot about the destruction of forests and long-term changes to the environment. He described three ways in which humans change the climate; deforestation, ruthless irrigation, and through steam and gas in industrial centers. He proposed a global network of stations to measure the Earth's magnetic field, and when it came about, he collected two million measurements over a three-year period.Humboldt was a great explorer. He strongly encouraged explorers and artists to travel. He decried people who tried to do arm-chair science. He aided less fortunate scientists and explorers, giving them funds even though his own financial position was precarious. One American travel writer wrote that he ""came to Berlin not to see museums and galleries, but 'for the sake of seeing and speaking with the world's greatest living man.'""In this book, Andrea Wulf does much more that merely narrate the life of Humboldt. She also goes to great lengths to give the biographies of some other amazing people who were strongly influenced by Humboldt. In this way, we get a picture of how important Humboldt was, and still is. Humboldt was one of the first environmentalists and wrote so much about ecology. The book is well-written, well-organized, and fun to read. The descriptions of Humboldt's travels are gripping, as she writes about the dangerous climbs, diseases, and predators all around. I highly recommend it to everyone interested in nature, science, and exploration."

And Alexander …… a most unusual man „since the deluge”. I’m delighted Andrea Wulf decided to write this book, which, in fact, is a homage to the scientist who undertook most extraordinary expeditions, who was interested in how nature works, and whose detailed observations regarding wildlife laid foundations for modern science and environmental studies. I’m not going to repeat what’s in the book, but let me just say that von Humboldt’s life was not monotonous in the least … In a nutshell, great respect and admiration for Herr Alexander. Many thanks to my GR Friend Olaf who recommended this book to me."
3,038535066X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5617661-jan-maat,0,"Overall a nice book. If I was giving star ratings then at times this book for me soared into five stars, at others it dredged through three star territory but because of the charm and vivacity and surprisingly upbeat approach to the book's subject I would not begrudge the book four stars and would generally encourage others to read it.However I feel that Wulf's mind was pregnant with two books and in this one, both are conjoined and stillborn. There is the oddly optimistic and breezy book about Humboldt, then the serious if not dismal book about the development of ecology and ecological thinking branching off into conservation and environmental destruction. The conjuncture of the two pulled the book into three star territory as structurally it meant that the Humboldt story fizzled out damply while the mini chapter length studies of how Thoreau radically rewrote Walden under the influence of his writing followed by chapters each on the influence of Humboldt upon George Perkins Marsh, Ernst Haeckel and John Muir don't rise to the same level.So Andrea Wulf positions Alexander von Humboldt as a pivotal figure who has been largely forgotten despite or because of having been hugely influential, she argues his insights are so main stream that they no longer stand out as exceptional and that the anti-German trend starting from WWI has tended to cause a conscious effort to forget him.Her story I found oddly upbeat because his life was a story of frustration - his huge experience was his time in South America in the early years of the nineteenth century, however after this he struggled to get permission from the British east India company to travel in India (view spoiler)[ possibly the Honourable company feared the release of commercial sensitive information (view spoiler)[ or the collecting of commercially sensitive seeds and their distribution to more or less mad scientists round the world (hide spoiler)] or indeed an expose of their rule in India (hide spoiler)] and apart from a trip through Russia as far as the Altai was not again to have the intense excitements of an explorer but was limited to writing about his experiences while his personal friends died. Loneliness and disappointments are however not the dominant flavours in this lively assertion of Humboldt's importance linking the subjective response to nature to the Romantics, inspiring Lyell and Darwin with his vision of Nature, devising Isotherms (Humboldt had a powerful visual sense(view spoiler)[ devises isotherms to be able to see the pattern of world temperature variation that he had been studying (p.177 (hide spoiler)]), an early popular science writer through his publications Humboldt came to influence the other figures mentioned above and so shaped early ecological thinking. Wulf stresses Humboldt's vision of the devastation caused on the environment by Capitalism changes to the climate caused by the clearing of forests and the introduction of cash crop monocultures (view spoiler)[ he was particularly critically of Indigo and sugar (hide spoiler)] and the human damage they caused - slavery, colonialism, later dictatorship, transplantation of human populations even after the end of the slave trade, his vision Wulf shows in a sense did not go far enough because Jefferson's sturdy republic of yeoman farmers(view spoiler)[ Humboldt had met Jefferson and had been impressed by his Republic (hide spoiler)] itself depended upon cash crop countries not only for colonial goods but also to provide a market place for their own export crops - the ecology of human interdependences was as densely interwoven as that of the plant kingdom. Implicitly Wulf's presentations goes against her argument, Humboldt was a bestseller, suffering from pirated editions while publishers claimed there were fights to obtain early copies of his latest publications, however his critique did not challenge and has not led to a change to an exploitative if not suicidal extractive and agricultural world economic system with concomitant human damage. The curious absence from this book is Potosi which was the exemplar of his vision. Reading was particularly resonant with news from Venezuela (view spoiler)[ petrodemocracy suffering as collateral damage in Saudi Arabia's price war against Iran, US frackers and insufficiently submissive Gulf states  (hide spoiler)] and mudslides in Sierra Leone in the background extractive economies and destroyed environments remain ever green I suppose. science-like bitAt the same time Humboldt was a prophet of Nature as sublime and how it is only through emotional responses to the flight of a condor that we can ,even in science, fully hope to understand it. In this he was encouraged by his friendship with Goethe, who in turn Wulf says wrote him into his portrayal of the eponymous hero of Faust.Looking at Humboldt's influence upon Lyell, Darwin and so on, I felt first how even evolutionary thinking was not a sudden intellectual breakthrough - half the thinking world appeared to be pregnant with the concept well before Darwin, it just took time to articulate it explicitly, then it struck me that science does not progress one funereal at a time but rather is like desert flowers. The seeds fall but have to wait dormant until rains fall again before they can shoot forth into new life. The influence here Wulf traces back to Goethe's search for an urform from which more complex forms and manifestation of life develop, Darwin we can see was double Humboldted, reading him directly and indirectly via Lyell. Possibly the evolutionary potential of Humboldt's vision had a great and theory making impact upon Darwin because of the influence of the Second Great Awakening upon Anglo-Saxon intellectual life, if as that movement insisted , it was God what had done it all and exactly as it said in the Bible (and the King James version at that) , evolution and interdependence between life form and environment become revolutionary ideas. All through all one sensed how deeply the author engaged and enjoyed her subject, a passion that she effectively transfers to and shares with the reader.At the same time I would not describe this as a scientific biography - we don't read a discussion of his scientific influences beyond Goethe nor an evaluation of his collection technique or of the instruments he used. Above all we see how he strived, almost intuitively, to understand each phenomenon and to look and to understand the connections that link all life together in a web of interdependencies. This had implications for his understanding of human societies, economics and politics but also geology so he predicted based on finds of gold and platinum in Russia that diamonds were present in those strata, and shortly after some were discovered.The relationship between life and environment led Humboldt to become deeply aware of similarities, so he noticed that plants on Latin American mountains were like those he had seen on the Alps, so he could describe the earth in terms of zones of vegetation or indeed temperature zones, drawing attention to the impact on regional climates caused by mountains or the sea. His graphical representations of this are to us familiar but radical in his day. PoliticsYears ago reading the The General in his Labyrinth which was an attempt to present Bolivar as a ancestral figure for the political left in Latin America, that struck me as an interesting but Quixotic (view spoiler)[ which is a way maybe of saying, the best (hide spoiler)] exercise. An interesting effect of Wulf's book is that effort becomes in retrospect both natural, necessary and overdue.Bolivar was heavily influenced by Humboldt - his championing of the majesty and glories of the natural world came as a counterpoint to those scientists who like Buffon who in the eighteenth century had argued that nature was degenerate and inferior in the new world, a position which implicitly justified its subordinate colonial position. Humboldt also directly addressed himself to colonialism praising the capabilities and cultures of indigenous peoples pointing out the destruction caused and in progress due to the unsympathetic imposition of European agricultural practices. The political implication of Humboldt's nature writing was that Latin America was inherently great, but to realise that greatness it needed to liberate itself from European controls and come to terms with its self, both parts of this programme one might observe have proved elusive. The flip side of this was that Humboldt became a chamberlain of Prussian kings and was dependent on them for his income - as he had burned his way through his inheritance on his South American expedition - in part on porterage for his barometers(view spoiler)[ only one survived the journey (hide spoiler)] and other equipment, and so he was a hanger on of kings, encouraging them to construct observatories even as he approved of Republics and hoped for the breaking up of colonial empires.I came to read this book in the following wayI had noticed this book when it came out in hardback as something I felt I would like to read, but I decided to trust in the tides of fate which in time bring curious books to me. And it came to pass that I was walking up hill away from a hospital appointment and I came across a bookshop that I had never seen before. Naturally overcome by the rational spirit of scientific enquiry I stepped inside. It was a handsome bookshop and after a while flittering about its shelves I settled on buying this book. I praised the bookshop to the cashier and asked how long the bookshop had been here - imagining quickly the romantic story of some city types who had lost their jobs in 2008 and decided to do penance for their financial sins by opening a bookshop and so working for the moral betterment of humanity - the cashier replied dryly seventy years. Deeply wounded in my ability to sense a bookshop at 200 paces since at one time I had worked just round the corner I stumbled into the next bookshop and bought something else."

He saw the earth as one great living organism where everything was connected, conceiving a bold new vision of nature that still influences the way that we understand the natural world.
I immensely appreciated reading this narrative. The Invention of Nature portrays polymath Alexander von Humboldt in the wider scheme of things, linking his expeditions and research to the times of swift and radical economical transformations, of lasting and growing social unrest, of wars and revolutions he lived in. The set of maps, drawings, landscape paintings, portraits, and all manner of print spread throughout the book provide a rich and revelant illustration of what the eventful, fast-paced text is about.To me, Andrea Wulf manages aptly to put the very spirit of universal interconnectedness advocated by her hero in this compelling presentation of Humboldt's life and legacy.

Other portrayals feature in this book, outlining Charles Darwin, George Perkins Marsh (representing the Conservation Movement), Ernst Haeckel (who coined the word 'ecology'), John Muir (founder of the Sierra Club, part of the Preservation Movements).Recommended Soundtrack :Le Carnaval des Animaux - Claude Debussy"
5,038535066X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4086118-michael,4,"This biography of Alexander von Humboldt was a revelation and a fun ride for me. This German scientist is credited with developing core concepts of ecology and documenting impacts of human development on the environment in early part of the 19th century. Wulf, who studied history of design and has written previously on the history of horticulture, aims with this accessible and well-illustrated account to rectify the near absence of recognition of Humboldt’s accomplishments in U.S. science education. Indeed, he didn’t come up in my studies of biology, and I only became aware of him through a recent read of Holme’s popular history of 18th and early 19th century science, “The Age of Wonder.” Through Wulf’s book I came to learn how he justifiably become the most well-known and respected scientist of his age and inspired so many other scientific developments and cultural movements more readily recognized today. The book delves into Humboldt’s childhood in Prussia at the end of the 18th century. Though bookish and eager to study the natural sciences, he was pushed by his father toward more practical education and career in as a mining engineer while his older brother, Wilhelm, was supported in taking a more academic track. At least the work he subsequently engaged in for a mining company allowed him to dig into the fields of geology, chemistry, and metallurgy and fulfilled some of his interests in travel and exploration. Great minds attracted him like a magnet, and through a visit to his brother in Jena he soon immersed himself in the great ferment of culture and science there that led to the birth of German Romanticism. He formed a seminal friendship with Goethe, who lived nearby, and together they worked on experiments in ‘animal electricity’, theories of botany and geology, and digested the powerful ideas of Kant. The latter’s “Critique of Pure Reason” pointed a way for them for the subjective self to create knowledge and not just to passively mirror and reflect on external reality through the senses. The creative force of the mind and emotions became for them a key to knowledge and making a valid model of reality knowledge. This form of systems thinking was a foundation for his revelations on nature as an interconnected whole and man’s integral part within it.After his father died, he inherited enough money to fund his keen desire to explore great unknowns in the world. The teeming life of equatorial jungles especially hungered him. However, a proper expedition required more money than he had and the colonial empires were proprietary about their new possessions. After getting shut out of a chance at French territories he eventually wangled permissions and financial support for an expedition to Venezuela. In his five years away, he supplemented his studies of botany and zoology in the rainforest with systematic approaches to climate and biogeography through study of progression from the lowlands to high altitudes of volcanic peaks. He consolidated his theories with further explorations in the Andes, Central America, and Cuba. Through ethnographic observations he came to appreciate the integrity and wisdom of indigenous peoples and become disturbed with the common vision of them as savages suitable for slavery and exploitation in colonial enterprise. He saw clearly the connection of colonialism, with its deforestation, focus on cash crops, and destructive mining practices, to degradation of the environment and prospects for extinction of species and native cultures. On his way back to Europe, he found a good ear for his discoveries in a stop in America with President Jefferson, who also favored progressive agrarian approaches and responsible stewardship for vast new territories acquired from France and just explored by Lewis and Clark.Humboldt’s great skills in public speaking and marshalling his ideas into accessible writing made him an instant worldwide star in both intellectual circles and the populace at large. His non-stop talking and flitting from soiree to soiree in Paris inspired many significant thinkers and scientists who came into his path (others found him to be a egocentric bore). His work over decades in writing many volumes based on his field work was subsidized by King Friedrich Wilhelm III, who allowed him to set up shop in Paris, despite France being a frequent enemy in conflicts over these years. His successor forced him to work in Berlin, where he was led to found a university to make up for a gap in centers of learning. Eventually he was able to talk Wilhelm IV into subsidizing a scientific expedition to Russia, ostensibly to review mining practices but which Humboldt used as a platform for a jaunt of his own interest into remote regions of Siberia.His magnum opus, Cosmos, written over a long swath of his later years, harnessed the work of many other scientists in a synthesis of many fields of science with their political, economic, and philosophical implications. Wulf works to bring his personality and personal life alive, but his choice to never marry or forge serious romantic relationships leaves the question of his sexuality or general deficiencies in sustaining intimate relationships a mystery. Wulf spends the last third of the book making a story of how his inspiration and seminal influences contributed to Darwin’s theory of evolution and Lyell’s formulation of geological principles. Direct links to Thoreau’s concepts of man’s integral part of nature and contribution to Transcendentalism are documented. The work of George Marsh in his book “Man and Nature” follows Humboldt’s footsteps in its revelations of environmental degradations from exploitive agricultural practices and overfishing in Egypt and the Mideast. The German biologist Hoeckel was inspired by Humboldt’s thinking about ecology and comparative anatomy to advance marine and developmental biology and use the esthetics of his experience of natural form to add ferment to the Art Nouveau movement. Finally. Humboldt’s personal enthusiasm with exploring wilderness and advocacy of conservation of such regions was a foundation for John Muir’s life and accomplishments with respect to establishments of preserves and national parks. Though the absence of a single clear theory on the order of Darwin’s contributed to Humboldt not sustaining a lasting place in the scientific edifice we all are privy to in school, he does deserve the respect Wulf accords him in the history of ideas."
6,038535066X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4213258-bradley,5,"I was never taught a thing about this man in any of my courses, whether HS or college. Odd, right? Especially since he was a man so unambiguously RIGHT about so many things, had universal acclaim in his lifetime and for a long time afterward, but has, since WWI and WWII, been relegated to the dustbin of history because he HAPPENS to have grown up Prussian. That's Germany for you young whippersnappers not hip to what they called themselves back in Mozart's time.So, WTF? Here are some really cool bits, yo. He almost single-handedly spawned the travelogue industry... I mean, the Naturalist movement, those wandering scientist/athletes who cataloged and drew and took umpteen samples all around the world and did the job of classification, theorizing, and understanding the world we live in. This polymath of a man was also of a mind that all sciences should interact, that inclusiveness and interconnectedness in all branches of thought, processes, and nature ought to be the top goal. Details are important, but the big picture is even MORE important. He was good friends with Goethe and many poets and influential writers. Thoreau. He heavily influenced Darwin. Humboldt was known around the world as one of the most well-loved scientists of all time. He was a walking encyclopedia. When he died, he was mourned around the world.A little more interesting to us, in this modern day, he was also warning everyone, in a serious manner, about the dangers of an oncoming ecological disaster. He saw how, by our greed and demands, we destroy nature and the systems within it. How we cause the extinction of species. He was one of the first environmentalists. That's enough to love... but for me, I personally love the fact he was one of the most hardcore proponents of interconnectedness and systems theory. :) Yes, science and poetry get along VERY well. :)"
7,038535066X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/14046996-roy-lotz,3,"Alexander von Humboldt was a remarkable man. Simultaneously a savant and an explorer, he knew everyone, studied everything, and did his best to travel everywhere. Andrea Wulf brings together the many seemingly divergent worlds that he bridged: the worlds of Thomas Jefferson, Simón Bolívar, Napoleon, Goethe, Charles Darwin, and even Isambard Kingdom Brunel. He left his fingerprints on the worlds of science, literature, art, and even politics. Yet today he is (or was, before Wulf) a fairly obscure figure in the English-speaking world.Thus this book is not simply a biography, but an attempt at rehabilitation. Wulf wishes to restore Humboldt to his place of honor; and she does this by arguing that his influence has been fundamental and pervasive. But before she can deal with Humboldt’s reputation, she must first narrate the scientist’s own coming of age. Humboldt was one of these figures with seemingly boundless energy, who threw himself into his work with complete abandon. We watch the young Humboldt as he struggles with, and finally throws off, the expectations of his upbringing, and then dashes away to South America. Once he embarks on his voyage, it does not take a strong writer—which Wulf is—to make his story exciting. Humboldt’s own travelogues were bestsellers. Humboldt emerges from his travels with a concept of nature which, Wulf argues, was revolutionary and which became extremely influential. Wulf identifies three new elements of Humboldt’s approach to nature: First, that nature cannot be understood without both the scientific and the poetic eye; analysis and sentiment are necessary to do justice to the natural world. Second, that the living world must be understood as a gestalt, with organisms depending on one another in an intimate set of relationships that boggles the intellect. And third, that scientists must think on a global scale if they wish to understand the complex interactions between plants, animals, and climates. This is the meat of the book. Yet it is here that I began to shift from enchantment to disappointment. For Wulf does not do nearly enough work to convince the skeptical reader that Humboldt’s view of nature was so entirely new. I would have appreciated far more background on previous conceptualizations of the natural world. Without this, it is hard to tell where Humboldt was innovative. Further, Wulf is always rather vague with Humboldt’s actual scientific contributions. She elects to keep the narrative pace driving forward, which doubtless helped her sales; yet I would have appreciated an explanation of Humboldt’s thought in more detail, with a good deal more quoting of the man.Conversely, Wulf could have greatly reduced the space devoted to the men Humboldt influenced. She has individual chapters for John Muir, Henry David Thoreau, Charles Darwin, George Perkins Marsh, and Ernst Haeckel—space that she uses as opportunities to prove her thesis that Humboldt’s writings were fundamental to their success. But I found the level of biographical detail excessive, and her point overstated. She makes it seem as if these men owed their accomplishments—if not wholly, at least in large part—to Humboldt’s influence. But you cannot measure influence, and you cannot prove a counterfactual (what would they have done without Humboldt?). In any case, the point is entirely abstract without a more careful discussion of Humboldt’s ideas; lacking that, it is not possible to say where his influence begins or ends.By now I am convinced that Humboldt was an important and compelling figure in the history of science. But I am far from convinced that his late obscurity was a mere result of anti-German sentiment caused by the two World Wars, as Wulf claims in the Epilogue. Too many other German scientists and philosophers remained famous. Rather, I think Humboldt may have fallen into obscurity because it is difficult to do justice to the nature of his contribution. Unlike Darwin, he did not originate any major scientific theory that could unify a great many phenomena under a simple explanation. Humboldt’s major contributions seems to be perspectival: seeing nature as complex yet whole, as godless yet beautiful, as vast and inhuman yet spiritually refreshing. And it is difficult to work that into a textbook."
8,038535066X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/31384949-ian,4,"I had heard of Alexander von Humboldt prior to starting this – just about – though like most people I knew almost nothing about him. With this book, author Andrea Wulf has gone a long way towards rescuing her subject from undeserved obscurity.The central event of Humboldt’s life was an almost unbelievably demanding 4-year journey through South America at the beginning of the 19th century, and it was this experience that most shaped his world view. The story of that journey is vividly told, as is that of a later journey through Russia to Central Asia. I found some other parts of the book to be a slower read.It’s the author’s contention that Humboldt was the first person to explain the interconnectedness of the natural world - the concept of the “web of life” - as well as to recognise the risks of over-exploitation of the environment by humans. She argues therefore, that he can be considered the originator of the modern-day environmental movement. She goes on to show that he directly influenced prominent 19th century figures such as Simón Bolivar, Charles Darwin, Henry David Thoreau, George Perkins Marsh, Ernst Haeckel, and John Muir. Wulf makes a persuasive case, but I always have reservations about accepting an argument from reading a single book. It didn’t help that I’ve not read any of the numerous original sources the author cites, whether from Humboldt or the others featured. To be honest, I’d never heard of either George Perkins Marsh or Ernst Haeckel, though I quite enjoyed the chapters featuring these and other later figures. I take my hat off to John Muir for what he achieved, but based on the description in this book I wouldn’t like to have met him. The same can be said of Humboldt himself.As a biographer, Andrea Wulf is mostly generous to her subject. She praises Humboldt not just for his work as a naturalist, but also for being anti-slavery, for defending the rights of indigenous peoples, and for being generally liberal in outlook. All well and good, but at the same time he apparently had the ridiculous notion that the world economy should be based on subsistence farming, and the author doesn’t challenge that. She does concede that he compromised his liberal principles by accepting court appointments from the autocratic kings of Prussia, (for financial reasons) and it seems that on a personal level he was often unpleasant. I felt the author downplayed the less attractive aspects of Humboldt’s character. She also rather danced around the issue of his sexuality. Throughout his life Humboldt avoided women and formed intensely emotional “friendships” with young men, with whom he would share a room, a tent or even a bed. Wulf suggests in her book that “Humboldt never explicitly explained the nature of these male friendships, but it’s likely they remained platonic…”, a remark that caused me to raise a sceptical eyebrow. I appreciate though, that the author could argue her book was about assessing Humboldt as a scientist, and his sexuality was irrelevant to that.In fairness, she conclusively demonstrates that Humboldt was immensely famous and well-respected in his own lifetime. It’s remarkable how his fame has diminished. Wulf argues that Humboldt’s “vision of nature has passed into our consciousness as if by osmosis. It is almost as if his ideas have become so manifest that the man behind them has disappeared.”I found this a slightly uneven book, but I did enjoy it, and I’ve certainly learned plenty from it. A thank you to my GR Friend Beata, whose review first alerted me to it."
9,038535066X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/99765491-jimz,5,"A Goodreads friend of mine gave a very favorable review of this book, so I made a note to try and obtain it, which I did from my local library. At around that same time, by coincidence I also got the book, Measuring the World, by Daniel Kehlmann. Both deal with Alexander von Humboldt. I was not enamored with Kehlmann’s book although I was in the minority both with Goodreads reviewers and other reviewers. So on my table of books after I was done reading Measuring the World was this tome (473 pages) staring me in the face and I hemmed and hawed whether I should tackle it or not. Well I did and it was certainly worth it. Sometimes I think I have lived under a rock all my life. After reading this book, and learning of this fellow’s life, and everything that he did in his life, how could I NOT have heard of him? Well better late than never. And as the author of this book said in her epilogue, “Alexander von Humboldt has been largely forgotten in the English-speaking world”. So now I don’t feel so bad. 😊 Wow, does Andrea Wulf know how to write! The chapters are just the right length, about 20 pages. Packed with information but the prose is so engaging and lively. Not a mere recitation of facts. This book has won a ton of awards, and I can see why. I am now interested in reading other books by this most talented author. Alexander von Humboldt appears to me to have had a major impact on a number of sciences, and also to some degree the arts and philosophy. He was well known to kings and government ministers, to other scientists, to religious leaders and to the common man. His major stomping grounds (where he resided) appeared to be Germany (Prussia) and France, but he was known by many movers and shakers in the fledgling United States in the late 1700s and early 1800s. He was an ardent abolitionist of slavery, both here and elsewhere. A major chunk of the book is Wulf detailing his explorations of South America and Russia…which were just incredible. It’s amazing what he went through in his desire to explore and to record his explorations and to conduct scientific experiments. I was very interested in his prescient concerns about the destruction of the environment that he encountered in South America (deforestation, irrigation) and how he observed that such actions contributed to a change in the atmosphere/climate. After reading this book it has made me less likely to point fingers at poachers and people who are destroying rain forests and other habitats…we in America did such things on a large scale in the 1800s. I’m still willing to point fingers at poachers and people who are destroying habitats but less with a sense of outrageousness and more with asking what incentives can be used to encourage people to stop doing these things (the very things my ancestors have done). One minor point about this book that I was not jazzed about were the last three chapters of the book, involving men who were informed by Humboldt’s books and observations so that they made major contributions to different disciplines: George Perkins Marsh, Ernst Haeckel, and John Muir. Maybe because this was the last part of the long book my attention span was flagging but it also seemed that at this point Wulf started doing something she had studiously avoided in the prior 20 chapters of the book — including footnotes within the text. I appreciated that she placed the footnotes at the back of the book, but in the last 3 chapters there just seemed to be an excessive number that slowed down my reading (because I felt I had to read each of the footnotes, even though I did not want to. And at least to me the exploits of these men although heavily influenced by Humboldt, were less interesting (to me). I was going to give this book 4 stars rather than 5 because of my last comments, but I just feel this is a 5-star book in pretty much every way, shape, and form. While we should be grateful for a person liked Alexander von Humboldt to have done what he did in his lifetime and to record what he did for his peers and for personkind, I am grateful for the writer, Andrea Wulf, who did a stellar job in describing his remarkable feats. 😊Oh one more thing — the cover art (front and back) captivated me too!"
10,038535066X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/9281934-louise,5,"Alexander von Humboldt was the first to demonstrate the global unity and co-dependence of plants, animals, land, sea and atmosphere. In this way, he first posed the idea of what we come to view as ""nature"".His beginnings may have been usual for the German upper classes of the time. His wealthy but absent parents saw to an education that prepared him for a gentleman’s career. His eventual inheritance financed his expedition to South America. Wulf shows the difficulty of planning the trip, getting clearances as well as actually traveling, documenting, measuring, recording and observing an untamed environment. His charmed life could have ended by crocodiles, volcanoes (he explored two while active) or knife edge hikes in thin air and punishing weather.The books that resulted were used by scientists, businessmen and governments and they opened the imagination of the general public. Humboldt was meticulous about these books, sparing no expense for the artisans who made the eventual volumes. They inspired generations of scientists and those who have become known as environmentalists. He developed lifelong associations with colleagues and staff. His brother was his best friend and supporter. He met and knew on varying levels the notables of his time, such as Simon Bolivar (before either were famous); Thomas Jefferson (Humboldt’s respect was mitigated by Jefferson’s slave ownership), Johann Wolfgang Goethe (a friend of his brother’s), Freiderich Willhelm II (King of Prussia who supported Humboldt, despite his republican ideals) and many more.Because Humboldt was frank about the conditions of colonialism, despite years of efforts, the British crown would not issue him a passport to India to document the Himalayas. It took 30 years for another expedition, this one to Russia, a great adventure at age 60 showing not only his physical fortitude, but also his determination. He ignored the edits of the ruler of all Russia by going where his studies took him including a trip into anthrax infested areas.Part V, the last part of the book, describes Humboldt’s lasting influence. He is a hero to Charles Darwin, George Perkin Marsh (an early advocate for preservation), Ernst Haeckel (who carried on his work and aggressively supported Darwin) and John Muir. All cite him in their work. A copy of Muir's notes to his copy of a Humboldt work is reproduced on p. 325.Like Humboldt, Wulf integrates many disciplines in her writing. Unlike some biographers, whom I suspect have read sufficient paragraphs and chapters from items listed in their notes, you get the idea that Wulf has read and absorbed all original historical and literary material (as well as Humboldt’s work) she cites. This is a very comprehensive work. While not a page turner, it is highly readable and keeps your attention."
11,038535066X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/10770371-dan,5,"A wonderful biography on Alexander von Humboldt, the world’s first environmentalist. It is hard to overstate his lasting significance and his direct impact on 19th century scientists like Darwin and naturalists like Muir. It said in this bio that the uber productive Alexander read three thousand letters a year and wrote two thousand a year, that is when he wasn’t away on field expeditions. 4.5 stars. The writing in this lengthy bio is 4 stars while the content is 5 stars. The depth of the chapters were excellent for a lay person like myself."
12,038535066X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2531665-charlene,5,"This book is now #1 on my list of favorite books of all time. When I was 16 I was an unwavering atheist and became incredibly obsessed with my own personal holy trinity: Charles Darwin, Henry David Thoreau, and Edgar Allen Poe. I loved Darwin's writing style and how he used facts over belief to understand the world. Thoreau's depiction of the world was depressing and heartbreakingly beautiful, just the RX my confused teenage brain needed at that time. It was a fantastic mindgasm to come to understand how Thoreau felt himself outside of the world to a certain extent, while still being in it, so much so, that he saw its beauty so keenly and felt it on a visceral level. Thoreau, to me, was almost a real life Zarathustra (though I am not sure I would agree with my younger self about that anymore). Poe simply excited me to my core. Funny enough, I can only enjoy Darwin in my adulthood. Both Thoreau and Poe lost their hold on me long ago. But for so long, I tried to live my life through their eyes, imagining I was them; the scientist, the transcendental lover of Earth, and the creative writer. I had no idea, until reading this book, that all three of my idols held von Humboldt as their idol and had inspired each of Darwin and Thoreau's major works and inspired Poe's Eureka. To a certain degree, since I consumed those works with such intensity, I feel as if I had been idolizing von Humboldt for so long without ever knowing it. Until reading this book, my knowledge of von Humboldt had come from reading about other scientists, especially Darwin. Everyone knows who Darwin is, what he studied, and what came of that study. He is credited for effecting one of the most major paradigm shifts in the history of science. Yet, how many people have heard of von Humboldt? How many of those who have heard of him were able to retain what they knew of him? How was he depicted? As a side character? As an influence? How many people really know all that he accomplished? Why is his name not as well known as Darwin's? This author brought von Humboldt out of the shadows to place him front and center, demonstrating he was as an important scientific figure as Darwin, if not more so. During his lifetime, von Humboldt set the stage for the theory of evolution, the theory of plate tectonics, the theory of the web of life and ecosystems (which also means he set the stage for the very new study of networks/systems science), and the study of human precipitated climate change. He did all of this hundreds of years before scientists came to understand the depth to which he was trying to describe the earth and larger universe, and how it is connected. Humboldt was extremely passionate about writing for the masses. He wanted to make science relatable to the nonscientist. He believed jargon should be kept in the margins and relatable text should fill every page of a science book, to help the reader connect to the true beauty of the natural world. For Humboldt, there was no need of a god. Understanding the facts of it all *was* religion; it *was* a spiritual experience. Despite his plain writing and ability to convey science on this level, his ideas were still not mainstream because he was on the cutting edge to an extreme degree. Plate tectonics, which he came to understand in the late 1700s- early 1800s would not be understood to any reasonable degree for another 100 years. Ecology would only be mildly understood until now! We are just beginning to understand ecosystems as networks, understanding how life itself emerges, how species emerge, how species are not only connected to smaller ecosystems but how each ecosystem is connected on a global level and ecosystems affect the climate of the earth itself. Two hundred years later, humans are still debating if human hastened climate change is real. With such a tiny amount of information available to him, Humboldt could already recognize the negative effects of human actions on the global health of the planet. Despite being right on the mark about so many phenomena, Humboldt's contributions are largely understated. I understand that this is more the case in America than in various other countries, but considering his significant contribution to almost every aspect of natural science, it should not be the case in any country. Being a German scientists, anti-German sentiments played a role in wiping his name from the many streets and other places that were named for him. Many prewar German scientist's books were burned. It's time to revisit his contribution and pay him the proper recognition. It is quite clear von Humboldt, who believed no race was superior to any other race, would not have agreed with the treatment of the Jewish people in his country and in neighboring countries. Humboldt's inner drive to understand and convey the dynamic nature of the world was unstoppable. As you will learn in this book, he was kept from exploring for much longer than he could bear. The moment he was allowed to go free into the wider world, he did. He spent every penny he had on that exploration as in the aid of others who were also exploring the natural world. He paid for his own printing, his supplies, his travel, etc. He ate almost nothing so that he could fund other scientists to carry out this important work. In this, he very much reminds me of the beautiful Michelangelo. And in a way, von Humboldt was the Michelangelo of the natural world. He studied its beauty in great detail, just as Michelangelo stole a corpse and studied its every muscle and organ. Von Humboldt sculpted that beauty for all to see, but instead of using Carrara marble, he used words in books to create a shape, a vision, that everyone could see. Like Darwin, von Humboldt, at least in his early years, cared more about the science than fame. After he earned his stripes, it appears he was fairly domineering in presence and conversation, sometimes obnoxiously so. However, it seems it might have been a product of aging? I am not sure what to make of that. What I do know is that his work in uncovering the natural laws was every bit as significant as Copernicus', Newton's, Darwin's, and Einsteins, and his name should always appear whenever these familiar examples are given. If you have not read a book focused entirely on von Humboldt, then you have not completed your education of the history of science. It's that cut and dry. And, if you are going to read a book about von Humboldt, make it this one. A+"
13,038535066X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1794273-jaylia3,5,"A scientific expedition had long been Alexander von Humboldt’s dream, so when he stepped onto the shores of Latin America in 1799 he was beyond excited, and soon began exploring, measuring, comparing, questioning, and chronicling everything: the distribution of indigenous plants, barometric pressure at different altitudes, the relative blueness of the sky, the cultures and customs of local people, rates of river evaporation, the environmental effects of farming, examples of native language, the charge in electric eels, and--maybe most significantly--his thoughts and feelings about it all, because Humboldt believed people learned by their connection to nature so he used comparison and poetic analogies to advance his discoveries and expand his understanding. Humboldt has to be one of the most interesting people I’d almost never heard of. (I checked the index of one of my all time favorite books about the era, Richard Holmes’s The Age of Wonder: How the Romantic Generation Discovered the Beauty and Terror of Science, and Humboldt does receive a few scant mentions there.)Humboldt’s many visionary achievements have had a lasting impact. He began talking about man-made climate change in 1800, he invented isotherms--lines of temperature and pressure--that we still see on today’s weather maps, he initiated the idea of vegetation and climate zones, he denounced slavery and colonialism when both still had a strong hold, he inspired many great thinkers and leaders of his day and beyond, and he revolutionized how we think about nature by describing it as an interconnected web in which what happens to one part affects everything else. Though colonial powers weren’t crazy about some of his revolutionary political ideas, Humboldt had an energetic charisma that drew people to him and he was widely celebrated in his life. His death was mourned around the globe, and huge world-wide celebrations were held on the hundredth anniversary of his birth. So why isn’t he better known today? One reason Wulf gives is that unlike Newton or Columbus, Humboldt isn’t recognized for a one great discovery--his methods were holistic, combining the hard data of science with art, poetry, history and politics, and his biggest successes involved making science both popular and accessible through his ingeniously imagined graphics and widely read books. The other reason Humboldt fell off radar in the English speaking world is the anti-German sentiment that developed during WWI. Andrea Wulf’s enthusiasm about her subject is contagious, so this book she’s written about Humboldt and his legacy is fascinating, even gripping, and highly readable. Beautiful illustrations from some of Humboldt’s own books are included. Because Humboldt spent time in many places and knew well or influenced a lot of notable people, Wulf has included in-depth, idea-rich portraits of a wide variety of people, including members of the Prussian royal family, Goethe, Kant, Thomas Jefferson, Simón Bolívar, William Wordsworth, Samuel Taylor Coleridge, Charles Darwin, John Muir, Ernst Haeckel, George Perkins Marsh, and Henry David Thoreau. I especially enjoyed reading about Humboldt’s enthusiastic explorations of the world around him, Napoleonic era Paris, the revolutionary history of South America, and Humboldt’s wild ride across Russia. Is Humboldt better remembered in non-English speaking parts of the world? I'd love to have a comment from anyone who knows.I read an advanced review copy of this book supplied by the publisher. If the finished version has color plates instead of black and white it will be even more spectacular. "
14,038535066X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/632247-chrissie,3,"Interesting and well written. Filled with pertinent information, yet a bit long-winded at times. The book is not merely a biography covering the life of one man, Alexander von Humboldt (1769-1859). It starts with a description of the world he was born into - Prussia, Pre-Romanticism and the eminent philosophers, poets and writers of the time, i.e. Johann Wolfgang von Goethe, Immanuel Kant and Friedrich von Schiller, to name but a few. Humboldt came to spend long hours with Goethe. These prominent thinkers influenced who he was to become. Their lives and the lives of others Humboldt associated with are discussed. Another two such men are Simón Bolívar and Thomas Jefferson. Humboldt’s theories, experiments, books, travels and companions are covered. The book does not conclude with his death. It continues, showing how he directly influenced others, in particular Charles Darwin, George Perkins Marsh, Ernst Haeckel and John Muir. It is through these men that ecology, conservation and preservation has become what it is today. Others are mentioned too. The book ends with the hope that we reclaim Humboldt as our hero or at least re-acknowledge the importance he has played in how we view nature. Humboldt's thoughts and writings lie at the beginning of a chain of men who have brought us to where we are today in the field of environmentalism. How much do we learn about Humboldt’s personality? Well he never kept his mouth shut, and he was indefatigable. In a conversation you couldn't get a word in edgewise. Being with him must have been quite a strain. Whether he was homosexual or not is unclear. How he could have possibly had time for anything other than his artistic, philosophical and scientific pursuits is the prime question. He seems to have had neither the time nor the interest for a lover. He was a fervent abolitionist.The audiobook narration is by David Drummond. I found it too fast, particularly in the beginning. There is just too much information to absorb. Later it gets easier. Some words are unclear. Narration does not influence my rating. Rivers, minerals, lakes, parks and many, many places are named after this Prussian. I didn't even know who he was! It is stated that more places have been named after this man than anyone else. His views have shaped our very concept of how we see nature. He realized back in 1800 the interrelationship between all aspects of nature. He understood that nature is one unified whole, and that an interdisciplinary approach is essential to solving problems, one such being climate control."
15,038535066X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/8079403-max,4,"We are indebted to Wulf for bringing this remarkable individual back to life for us in the 21st century. She is clearly enamored with her subject and not without reason. He was determined, adventurous, meticulous, methodical, original, influential, visionary and inspirational. With his presence, command of language and fact, new ideas and incredible explorations he was able to capture the imagination of those around him even though he could also be emotionally distant, tactless and self-centered. He eschewed interest in the opposite sex and always had close male companions. But his lifestyle and personality quirks did not impede his social acceptance and the far ranging impact of his ideas.Wulf credits Humboldt as being the first to see nature as a global connected whole. She details how he and his writings influenced many, including Goethe, Thomas Jefferson, Charles Lyell, Darwin, Emerson, Thoreau, John Muir and even the Romantic poets Wordsworth and Coleridge. His books were immensely popular and read by scientists, artists and poets. He used the flowery language of the period to express his feelings about nature, but he also was a biologist carefully collecting extensive collections of specimens from remote environments and a geographer measuring position, elevation, magnetism, temperature and pressure on his expeditions. A science generalist and poetic writer, his fame receded quickly as the nineteenth century wore on and scientific language became more disciplined and science itself more compartmentalized. Anti-German sentiment stemming from two world wars pushed him further into obscurity.Wulf begins with Humboldt’s childhood and young adulthood. We learn about the death of his father as a young boy and the distant mother that left him lonely. But his mother was well off and paid for the best tutors and education. As a young man his position and brilliance enabled him to hobnob with the likes of Goethe and Shiller, to explore science in his own hands in his own way. When his mother died he was free to pursue his dreams of adventure and nature. And despite many delays due to the tumultuous times in late 1790’s Europe, he found his passage through the King of Spain to the New World. In South America he immerses himself in every aspect of nature. He develops his awareness of the interconnectedness of all of nature. At Lake Valencia in Venezuela he realizes how agriculture has changed the ecosystem, lowering water levels, disrupting native flora and fauna. Already a naturalist, he becomes an early environmentalist. He even sees the impact on the area’s weather. He eschews danger, traveling in the untamed jungle and barren plains, and climbing to dizzying heights without modern equipment in the Andes. All the while collecting plant, animal and mineral specimens; meticulously recording temperature, humidity, air pressure, position and elevation.Humboldt visited what are present day Venezuela, Columbia, Ecuador, Peru, Mexico, Cuba and lastly the United States where he met Jefferson in Washington. He saw the ravages of cash crops on the environment and how they made profitable the servitude of Africans and indigenous peoples. Wulf says, Humboldt “was the first to relate colonialism to the devastation of the environment.” He had witnessed the destruction of forests for growing sugar, indigo and other crops grown for export. But perhaps his most profound insight was to link vegetation to climate showing similarities around the globe. He identified plants at high elevations near the equator that were very similar to those in northern latitudes. This idea that life around the world was related was new and begged the question of a shared lineage.Upon his return to Europe, he became a celebrity sought out by scientists, artists, and the social elite. He set about organizing his collections and notes and writing about his work and exploits. He was able to provide a wealth of new species and unique rock collections. His measurements provided the basis for new and refined maps and understanding of climate. His books were immensely popular as he mixed his science with adventure, artistic illustrations and poetic descriptions. Some of his books went beyond naturalism and included social and political commentary about the evils of colonialism and the subjugation of native peoples and slavery. His outlook and writings were an inspiration to his friend Simon Bolivar. Humboldt died in 1859 four months short of his 90th birthday and six months before Darwin published On the Origin of Species.Wulf devotes many chapters to people Humboldt inspired. Humboldt became friends with Simon Bolivar in Paris in 1804. Wulf details Bolivar’s revolution that freed large parts of South America from Spanish rule and encouraged others in South America to start their own revolts. She says the revolution “was also a fight that was invigorated by Humboldt’s writings.” Wulf gives us another chapter showing us how Darwin was inspired by Humboldt’s writing to take his voyage on the Beagle. Darwin had plenty of time to read and reread his copies of Humboldt’s books. The voyage lasted five years from 1831 to 1836. Wulf equates Humboldt’s idea of a web of life with Darwin’s notes, “that all plants and animals ‘are bound together by a web of complex relations.’” She concludes that, “Darwin was standing on Humboldt’s shoulders.” And she gives us a chapter on Thoreau, an avid Humboldt reader, claiming that when he wrote in Walden published in 1854 that he began, “to look at nature with new eyes” that they were in her words “eyes that Humboldt had given him”.Wulf highlights Humboldt’s continuing impact after his death with chapters on George Perkins Marsh, Ernst Haeckel, and John Muir. Marsh an American wrote Man and Nature published in 1864 which embodied and extended Humboldt’s ideas. Marsh described the adverse environmental impact of deforestation and agricultural practices that depleted the soil and spoiled lakes and rivers. His book was widely influential spurring on a budding conservation movement. Haeckel a German was a prominent biologist whose book General Morphology of Organisms published in 1866 was a widely read reinforcement of Darwin’s theory of evolution. Darwin called it the “most magnificent eulogium.” Haeckel coined many words we still use such as phylum, stem cell, Protista and encapsulated Humboldt’s vision creating the word ecology which he defined as the “science of the relationships of an organism with its environment.” John Muir was a Scottish born American who loved the forest spending years in the Sierra Nevada where he met many visiting scientists and naturalists including Ralph Waldo Emerson who offered him a position at Harvard. But Muir, another avid reader of Humboldt’s books, stayed in the forest. He used his increasing fame and influence to fight for Yosemite National Park which was created in 1890. In 1892 he helped form the Sierra Club becoming its first president, a position he held until his death 22 years later. He spent three days camping with President Theodore Roosevelt in the park in 1903 which led to the federal government taking over the more loosely managed state controlled sections in 1906. Muir picked up on Humboldt’s and Marsh’s ideas concerning deforestation. But where Marsh proposed conservation, Muir proposed preservation. Marsh wanted to safeguard natural resources, but Muir wanted to completely protect the forest from human development.More than anything else, standing out is Humboldt’s influence on these other great scientists and naturalists. Through them he gave impetus to the conservation and preservation movements and helped shape biological science from the study of evolution to ecology. Wulf shows us how one man’s love of nature expressed in heartfelt yet still scientifically accurate prose made a difference, a difference that is still felt today. Wulf takes her book from interesting to important by showing us what others did with Humboldt’s ideas. Their work makes Humboldt’s life so meaningful. A great read about a fascinating man whose legacy Wulf illuminates for the modern reader."
16,038535066X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1109068-susanna---censored-by-goodreads,5,"Not flawless (for me the weakest chapter was on Humboldt and Thoreau), but endlessly fascinating. Before there was Carl Sagan and his Cosmos, there was the great Prussian naturalist Alexander von Humboldt, and his Kosmos. Why have we forgotten him? Because he was German? (That would be depressing.) Because he did not invent one theory in a specific field, but a way of looking at the universe? (Possible, I think. The former is easier to teach in school than the latter.) I don't know. At any rate, it's a pity.Here's to the energizer bunny of naturalists!"
17,038535066X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/23100707-jean,5,"Wulf’s award winning book is a bit different from the average biography in that it is about a history of Alexander von Humboldt’s (1769-1859) ideas as much as it is about the man. Humboldt was a naturalist, geographer, polymath, explorer and the first environmentalist who at one time was the most famous man in Europe.Wulf reveals Humboldt’s discoveries of similarities between climate and vegetation zone on different continents (climate zones). The author discusses Humboldt’s prediction of human induced climate change. Humboldt wrote his scientific observations in the poetic narrative of the times as did Darwin. Wulf discusses Humboldt’s friendship with Thomas Jefferson, Simon Bolivar and Goethe. Wulf is a lucid and intellectual writer. The book is a work of scholarship. Wulf allows the complex personality of Humboldt and his wide scope of interests to come through in the writing. Wulf did meticulous research of Humboldt’s diaries, letters and writings. The author quoted from some of the letters which added to the work. Wulf was born in India, raised in German and now lives in London where she writes.I read this as an audiobook downloaded from Audible. David Drummond does an excellent job narrating the book. Drummond is an actor and winner of numerous Audiofile Earphone Awards for audiobook narration.I enjoyed reading this book and learned much about Alexander von Humboldt. Years ago when I was in school I was fascinated by Humboldt. I wish I had this book to read at that time with its wide range of knowledge of Humboldt. If you are interested in biographies, science or nature you will enjoy this book."
18,038535066X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2077536-navi,5,"I am really happy that I took the time to savour this book. Wulf does an incredible job painting a portrait of a relatively unknown figure, through her evocative and well-researched biography. Throughout this book, I could not believe that I had never heard of Alexander von Humboldt. He was a polymath, explorer, naturalist and writer who had a life full of adventure, discoveries and influence. Humboldt devoted his whole life to traveling and studying in attempts to understand the natural world as an interconnected web, everything from volcanoes, earthquakes, plants, species, and climate. He had a major influence on prominent figures of the day including Charles Darwin, Thomas Jefferson, Simón Bolívar, Henry David Thoreau and John Muir. My favourite part was following Humboldt’s travels into South America. The adventure and passion he brought to his extensive observations was endlessly enthralling! "
19,038535066X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/53179837-george,5,"This book follows the life of Alexander Von Humboldt and takes us on a rapturous journey with him through South America and Siberia, with detours with Darwin, Thoreau, Emerson and strangely enough with Bolivar during his own revolution. I have criticized other books for this same reason, but Andrea Wolf was both chronological with these detours and stuck with the theme of Humboldt and naturalism. And thus we learn about this great man and our current view of nature. Alexander Von Humboldt was the first ecologist, environmentalist, a great champion of science and nature popularization and a intellectual godfather to entire generations of scientists. So how in hell have I not heard of him until now? To me this was incredibly weird considering that Humboldt has also in his latter life written a book titled Cosmos that has thrived to show connections of all of sciences at the time and put on display the glory and beauty of our world and universe. Sound familiar, it should because Carl Sagan did the same in the 70s. Surely he had made some acknowledgements to Humboldt, so I pulled my copy of Cosmos off the shelf and reread the introduction. Nothing. Ok, Sagan started every chapter with a few quotes by notable people, maybe there is some mention there. Still nothing. Oh well ,lets look at the index. Page 89, in a footnote acknowledgement of Humboldts views on comets with the source listed as his book Cosmos volume 5... Oh the Irony! And I know that this was definitely added by one of many editors and research librarians, still something I guess...This book came at the right time, this mans legacy has to be resurrected and this time remembered for good."
20,038535066X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/11951948-paul,4,"When you think of scientists that have formed the way that we think about world around us, the names that tend to come to mind are Newton, Darwin, Wallace, Davy and Einstein. In the mid-19th Century though the most famous scientist in the world was a man called Alexander von Humboldt, a man very few people have ever heard of these days. von Humboldt had a fascination of everything around him; he studied plants, geology, volcanos, animal and the stars the weather and the movement of the planets. Everything fascinated him and he went on major expeditions to South America and across the Russian steppe to China, and bought back detailed notebooks and trunks stuffed full of specimens and samples. He was one of the first scientists to consider the interconnectedness of all natural things, noticing that climate zones were similar on completely different continents, something that didn’t really gain traction until Lovelock’s Gaia theory and his observations led him to predict our effects on the climate decades before anyone else.He was the author of around thirty volumes that became best sellers and were translated into multiple languages. His lyrical writing not only inspired countless other scientists to further their studies, but they stimulated artists and poets to explore their own natural world. He wrote and recived thousands of letters a year, corresponding with American presidents, like Thomas Jefferson and iconic figures Simón Bolívar. Even though he was from Prussia and was a member of King Frederick William III court, he felt his spiritual home was in the intellectual melting pot of Paris, even though he was sometimes considered an enemy by Napoleon. The King insisted he return home, much to his disappointment, but he still spent some of the year there, meeting and talking with fellow scientists. Wulf’s book is a captivating account of the life and achievements of von Humboldt. Just a glance at the comprehensive notes you can see it has taken an immense amount of research to write this book, but it is still very readable without being dry and academic. She has successfully managed to bring to life a scientist whose influence on our understanding of the natural world can still be seen today."
21,038535066X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3461034-trish,5,"Alexander von Humboldt was born in 1769 in Prussia as the younger son of an aristocratic and wealthy family (the father supplied the title, the mother the money). When he and his brother Wilhelm (later Minister of Education in Berlin and founder of the Humboldt University there) were little, their father died. Their relationship with their mother was … cool, to say the least.While his brother was bookish, Alexander was not only curious but also couldn't sit still. He didn't want to know the world through books but instead preferred to go outside and see it for himself. That never changed.When he was only 22 years old, he went on a voyage to South America that lasted for 5 years. On that voyage, he made astounding and world-changing observations regarding the fauna and flora as well as the people and the world in general. Because Humboldt believed in the interconnectedness - then a radical way of thinking.He was against slavery and indeed advocated that all human beings had the same roots and that therefore none was superior to the other. He had a current named after him but pointed out that local fishermen had known it way before he ""discovered"" it and put it on a map.Despite his ""unpatriotic"" behavior during the Napoleonic War (he stayed in Paris because of its science academy and botanical garden and published many of his books not only in French but in French first even), he was basically a rock star that everyone wanted at their dinner parties. And that was true in almost every country around the world.Humboldt was a personal friend of Thomas Jefferson (3rd President of the US with whom he discussed slavery since he abhorred it), was in correspondence with at least one of Jefferson’s successors, received special dispensation from the King of Spain and the Tsar of Russia to travel through their territories, became an involuntary advisor for the Prussian King (though basically only on paper), was the best friend of Johann Wolfgang von Goethe (with whom he even conducted experiments), was referenced by Mary Shelley, Coleridge, Wordsworth as well as Lord Byron in their respective works, Thoreau only wrote his magnum opus thanks to the inspiration for writing about nature in a romantic way (which he copied from Humboldt), and he even counted Bolivar (leader of the South American revolution) as one of his acquaintances/friends (Bolivar used Humboldt’s descriptions of South America to ignite pride in his people). Darwin decided to go on a voyage as a naturalist because he loved Humboldt’s writing and was inspired by some of his published theories. In fact, the wonderful writing style so many people love in Darwin's description of his voyage on the Beagle is directly taken from Humboldt (Darwin had no problem admitting that).According to scholars at L'Académie des Sciences (French Science Academy - then THE institution for sciences), Humboldt was a one-man-university, a modern Aristotle and the greatest scholar of the day, and they were shocked / intimidated by how much he knew in basically every field or subject.Oh, and remember the snaking lines on weather maps? They are called isotherms and are his invention as well. Just like he came up with the theory of subterraneous volcanic activity and how that would enable flat lands to rise up and become mountains. Moreover, he talked the heads of states around the globe into erecting stations in various places in their respective territories where measurements were taken - nowadays, these are weather stations measuring not only temperatures but also collecting data on global warming and such.He was also the first to ever warn that deforestation would have devastating effects on nature and thus humans - 150 years before anyone else did. In fact, modern environmentalism stands on the shoulders of what he wrote down.Oh, and one very endearing thing was that he had no problem spending a lot of money on special editions of books but had no interest in fashion or furniture and was always stingy when it came to buying those. *lol* In general, he didn't like society and its conventions and found the whole affair rather silly.Even in old age, he would like to discover for himself and write books, often doing an impossible number of things simultaneously (proving that men are capable of multitasking, too). He was fearless in his voyages as well, having planned on witnessing a volcanic eruption up close and personal. Sadly, that didn’t work out because his ship was leaving.He had seen so many revolutions during his lifetime that the one in Germany was hardly a surprise and he said so. What irked him most about them (at least when he was younger) was that his travel plans were often thwarted due to some battle or another. *lol* One could draw a comparison between the political revolutions around the world during Humboldt's time and the upheavals in the scientific communities back then (in fact, the word ""scientist"" was only used ever since the year Humboldt had started writing his Cosmos).On his centennial, people all around the globe took to the streets in celebration of this great man; streets and piazzas, rivers, a current, animals, minerals and plants bear his name. And yet … nowadays barely anyone outside academia knows who he is. It breaks my heart. In 2017, the Deutsche Bahn (train system in Germany) named its 4th and newest generation of express trains after him, but considering that it's not really connected to the preservation of nature, I somehow doubt he would have been thrilled.Some of the things recounted here were feats I already knew about but even I, interested as I am in science/nature/history and despite being a German myself, knew far too little about a man as prolific as he was. No matter which important person from around that time we look at, they were all more or less influenced by this one man or had personal interactions with him in some way. He lay the foundations for so many things we know about our planet nowadays.P.S.: Since this is a biography, I guess I should also mention that the author did a fantastic job not only of recounting Humboldt's life and feats, but also of showing his own personal interconnectedness with the world as much as his theory about the same. Seriously, this book was wonderfully written and meticulously researched, but the writing style (not just the subject) made it a delight to read."
22,038535066X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5476515-amanda,3,Alexander von Humboldt was a fascinating man. He has been largely forgotten in the English speaking world. This biography is a pretty comprehensive look at his discoveries. I really enjoy parts of it and found parts of it to be really tedious. He was a visionary and many of his ideas have shaped today's environmental issues. It's pretty amazing how spot on he was about issues we are facing today. If you are interested in the environment and nature I definitely recommend this. I listened to the audio narrated by David Drummond and he did a fine job.
23,038535066X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5979619-boudewijn,4,"Alexander von Humboldt is not widely known or recognized in the Western World. But it is he who lay the foundations for the human vision of nature as something understandable and part of a closely connected system, where the minute intervention of man can cause devastating results. In this book, Andrea Wulf succeeded in providing great insights into Alexander von Humboldt, ranging from his personal life to the detailed observations and descriptions that he made on his grand voyages, as well as his influence on other scientists, such as Charles Darwin and John Muir.Born to a respected and aristocratic Prussian family on 14 September 1769, from an early age Alexander developed a passion for science and nature. He dutifully continued his education that his parents had layed out for him in science, math and languages. When he was 22, he started working as a mining inspector, where he not only improved the conditions for the miners, but also published his first book on subterranean flora.Alexander's brother introduced him to Johann Wolfgang von Goethe, the great poet and they immediately developed a friendship for life. Goethe introduced Humboldt to the process of subjectivity: in order to truly understand nature, including geology and botany, one must experience and interact with it.This meant that Humboldt was ready to explore the world. After the death of his mother in 1796 and with his inheritance, Humboldt decided to venture out. In 1799 Spain agreed to provide Humboldt and his French friend and botanist Aimé Bonpland passage to South America.While travelling through Venezuela, as they passed Lake Valencia, its particular ecosystem offered Humboldt insight into the importance of trees and the dangers of deforestation. He also came to the realization on how human actions could cause chain reactions in nature and the negative impact this has on the precariously balanced system in nature. Everywhere he looked he could see that people had little understanding of how nature really worked.It was on mount Chimborazo, which he climbed in June 1802, that he got his revelation and all pieces came together: the threads of nature connected everything.When Humboldt returned to Europe, he received a hero’s welcome. His trip received a lot of international attention and his notes and specimens resulted in his first book “Essay on the Geography of Plants”, a revelation and instant success.The book was the first to show the direct relations between plants, climate and geography.The reputation for Humboldt was set and he enjoyed a great prestige in the academic world. He conducted a series of immensely popular lectures where he presented his vision of a deeply connected world to fascinated audiences. In 1828 this resulted in a groundbreaking scientific conference, that united 500 scientists from the world to exchange ideas and unite scientists from all over the world.Humboldt wanted to launch another expedition, but it wasn’t until 1829 when Humboldt was invited by Russia to check whether the Oeral Mountains could hold valuable mineral deposits.Once back in Europe, he created his best known masterpiece “Cosmos”, where the message was that all nature needed to be regarded as part of a unified whole. The book would in the end comprise of five volumes, his last volume published before his death in May 1895.Not only was Humboldt the first to create a new vision of nature, his works influenced other scientists such as Charles Darwin, who decided to embark on the HMS Beagle after reading Humboldt’s books. But also Henry David Thoreau was heavily influenced by Himboldt’s vision.Humboldt’s ideas and influences survive to this day. His new vision has influenced today’s ecological thinking and was of influence for one of the greatest scientists and authors. How we see the world today, is for a great deal thanks to Humboldt, who for the first time was able to realise the intricate structure of the nature around us the devastating impact the tiniest human interventions can have on nature.."
24,038535066X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1881113-andrea,4,"How is that I've never heard of such a distinguished scientist as Alexander von Humboldt? This is the man that influenced some of the greatest thinkers, was an avid supporter of human rights in the age of slavery, and a proponent of conservationism when humanity was considered the centre of the God-created universe. Humboldt was a visionary that we need in our tumultuous times. He was perhaps not the most easy person to have a conversation with, but the legacy that he left cannot be ignored.Andrea Wulf created a biography that is extremely readable and enlightening, but I thought it was overly padded in places by tangential discussions. This small fault is prominent in last few chapters that outlined entire careers of scientists inspired by Humboldt, and a piece on revolutionary movement in Latin America led by Bolivar. Not that I slogged through these parts, but I expected this to be purely a biography, when The Invention of Nature is more of natural history study from historical point of view. Totally not the author's fault, because this is definitely a worthy read."

Lots of Good Stuff, but, like many biographers, Wulf rather fell in love with her subject, and it shows. Not all in a bad way.....Here's the NYT review, which is likely the reason I read the book: https://www.nytimes.com/2015/09/27/bo...Excerpt:""Alexander von Humboldt was the pre-eminent scientist of his time. Contemporaries spoke of him as second in fame only to Napoleon. All over the Americas and the English-speaking world, towns and rivers are still named after him, along with mountain ranges, bays, waterfalls, 300 plants and more than 100 animals. There is a Humboldt glacier, a Humboldt asteroid, a Humboldt hog-nosed skunk. Off the coast of Peru and Chile, the giant Humboldt squid swims in the Humboldt Current, and even on the moon there is an area called Mare Humboldtianum. Darwin called him the “greatest scientific traveler who ever lived.”[Later] Well, my notes went astray. I did like the book. 3.5 stars, rounded up."
26,038535066X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4263900-joachim-stoop,5,"Von Humboldt was a hero in the old 'Homo Universalis Visionary The world is here and I've got no minute to lose, so let's read, write, travel, talk, explore' kind of way.Andrea Wulf is a heroine for gathering all the information about him that she could find and assembling it into a highly enjoyable and fascinating biography. What a triump!"
27,038535066X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/27250071-vimal-thiagarajan,5,"Introducing and factually exploring the life of someone who is almost completely forgotten in the modern world, yet was the most famous man in the world during his long and restless lifetime, someone who is totally missing from modern school and university textbooks, yet was a key inspiration and guiding beacon for many of the celebrated names we find in these same textbooks - biographies seldom get better.An intrepid explorer and the best mountaineer of his time, Alexander Von Humboldt left his home country of Prussia in 1799 and explored the length and breadth of South America on foot for a period of 6 years, an exploration that would not just make him the most famous man of his time, but would change the course of Science, Literature, and the way we think about nature. Through tireless hard work and an insatiable curiosity, and leveraging his prodigious memory and his legendary powers of observation and comparison, Humboldt discovered isotherms and vegetation zones, spoke about continental shift and tectonics centuries before they became accepted parlance, became the first person to discover and conclusively demonstrate human induced climate change, discovered so many things about forests and their complex ecosystems and their impact on climate - ideas which we take for granted these days and do not tend to think someone would have discovered them. Some of these principles have definitely been in vogue in most of the ancient nature-worshipping civilizations of the world, but in this modern age which derides unquestioning tradition with mostly misplaced, utilitarian and short-term reasoning, we would have either completely lost touch with these principles or would have theorized them rather too late without Humboldt.Humboldt also gathered evidence and spoke boldly and vehemently against the devastation of environment caused by the greed of colonial regimes(so much so that the British denied him permission to explore India in fear that he would open many a colonial can of worms and serve it globally), became one of the leading voices against slavery and a prolific writer who didn't just enjoy an immensely wide readership globally but whose towering charisma would rub on to Von Goethe, Wordsworth, Coleridge, Thoreau, Jules Verne, Edgar Allan Poe, Walt Whitman among several other writers and poets and would become a key influence on Charles Darwin, Charles Lyell, Simon Bolivar, George Perkins Marsh, Ernst Haeckel and John Muir among other famous and important historical figures. Thomas Jefferson considered Humboldt the most important scientist he had ever met and also solely relied on him to obtain key information about Geography, population and economy during the annexation of Texas.There wasn't a section in the book I didn't savour, though I particularly enjoyed those that dealt with his incredible and arduous Latin American exploration and his odyssey through Anthrax-ridden Russia and Siberia in his sixties. Aside from these, the sections dealing with his long and warm friendship with Von Goethe and the numerous ways in which his ideas led to Darwin's conceptualization of the Origin of species were some of the best sections of the book. The painstakingly well-researched Humboldt-centric mini biographies of Thomas Jefferson, Thoreau, Charles Lyell, Perkins Marsh, Ernst Haeckel and John Muir came as unexpected treats in an already formidable biography.The New York book review had stated that it is impossible to read The Invention of Nature without contracting Humboldt fever - Couldn't agree more. Its impossible not to come out of this book with genuine wonderment at Humboldt's towering and significant achievements and his legacy to the modern world, and a compelling sense of urgency to seek out newer and abler methods to bridge the ever widening gulf between the self and the natural world."

29,038535066X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4125660-liz,5,"Ana amazing book about the man who first realized the correlation between man's actions and their effects on the natural world. Theories we take for granted, like climate change, were first put forth by Humboldt. Also interesting to see how his theories inspired more well known names like Darwin, Thoreau and Muir."
30,038535066X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3409532-april-does-feral-sometimes,4,"The book 'The Invention of Nature' is fascinating. It is more than a biography of Alexander Von Humboldt (1769-1859), who can be described as a polymath genius whose enthusiasm for travel and nature was as momentous for the development of as many branches of science that Albert Einstein (1879-1955) was because of his interest in physics. Yet, I have never heard of him until I read this book.Some early Western 19th-century proto-scientists labored all of their life in bleak obscurity until only after their deaths being recognized as major scientific brains and discoverers; others announced their work to newly created scientific societies only to be met with withering scorn. Some inventors were clearly crackpots with one great idea while others were intelligent driven members of respectable aristocrat families and upper-class merchants. (Almost all of these Great Men of Science upset their parents by refusing to study law or medicine in university! Humboldt was one of these children of disappointed parents. I have read a few other science histories, and I have noticed that almost all of these early scientists had parents hoping for a son who would become a doctor or lawyer. Just saying.)However, Humboldt became famous early in his lifetime and all doors were open to him. He met already famous people eager to speak with him, such as President Thomas Jefferson. Others who desired to call him friend went on to illustrious (and nefarious) careers as famous scientists in their own right such as Charles Darwin, well-known writers such as Henry David Thoreau, and Kings, Emperors and Prime Ministers such as Friedrich Wilhelm IV and George Canning, as well as leaders of political revolutions overthrowing those before-mentioned Kings and Emperors such as Simón Bolívar. Humboldt himself was a liberal and he supported the overthrow of the aristocracy, but his income primarily was from a pension paid by two Prussian kings after he went through his own inheritance. He obviously was charismatic, moving easily between many different cultures and social classes, from South America to Europe to Russia.After returning from a five-year exploration of South America with tens of thousands of astronomical, geological and meteorological observations and specimens, he published his first book, 'Essay on the Geography of Plants' at age 32, dedicating it to Johann Wolfgang Goethe, his fellow polymath and best friend (after his brother Wilhelm von Humboldt, who founded the University of Berlin after a career as the Prussian ambassador to Vienna and Britain). The book combined with his achievements and personality made him a famous man, perhaps the most famous respected natural scientist in the world. However, full of energy, wanderlust and curiosity, Humboldt moved on to more explorations crossing over the frontlines of many European wars between France, Prussia, Britain, and Spain, and maneuvering through countries on three continents which were undergoing political revolutions, observing volcano eruptions while mountain climbing without oxygen tanks (yes, he and his companions fainted occasionally) enduring nasty mosquitos, while exposing and warning the public of the dreadful environmental destruction of earth wherever men used the land for agriculture, mining and lumber.Humboldt lived to the age of 89, still receiving famous visitors and writing thousands of letters a month up to his death. His books on the natural sciences, illustrated with his own and other explorers' beautiful art and drawings, inspired Darwin, Thoreau, Ernst Haeckel, John Muir, to name a few. Rivers, mountains, towns and other landmarks were named after him, and he is mentioned in thousands of famous novels. Yet most Americans today have never heard of him, probably because of World War I and WWII having been fought against Germany as an enemy of the United States. I think we should bring this man back into the spotlight and make him a famous hero scientist again. This book is an excellent start.Below I've included some Wikipedia links about the early naturalists, Humboldt, and many of the famous intellectuals, writers and scientists he inspired in later centuries, in hope that these thumbnail histories will convince you, gentle reader, to pick up this book:http://www.ranker.com/list/notable-na...https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alexa...https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kosmo...https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Georg...https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Man_a...https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ernst...https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kunst...https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_..."
31,038535066X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2527265-david,5,"It is a sad commentary on our age (or maybe me personally) that, when I am about to get really enthusiastic about something, as in this case, I feel the need to make clear that I am NOT being sarcastic. HOLY MOLY! WOW! What an awesome book! Just reading it made me happy to be alive! Really! It was a wonderful break from the dreary procession of bad news parading out of every media orifice! (Note to self: improve your imagery.) I neglected other self-improving projects to read this book, and then was sad when I finished it! Worthy of all awards and accolades! The world would be a better place if everyone was forced to read it, at gunpoint if necessary! Don't just stand (or sit) there, go out and get a copy right away!I love narratives about news events, scandals, and personalities that once famous, but now forgotten. This is one of them, of a man known by everyone when living, celebrated, called without irony the greatest man who had ever lived, sought out by tedious rich people and aristocrats, pestered for autographs, and recipient of mountains of admiring old-school paper letters. Intrepid and death-defying explorer, partisan of liberty, deplorer of slavery and cruelty, widely-admired prose stylist, polyglot, polymath. Honored by having towns, counties, and other jurisdictions named after him. Further honored by having a Pacific Ocean current named after him and, even cooler still, also a critter described by Wikipedia as a ""large predatory squid"". His books were anticipated with an enthusiasm which today, sadly, only occurs with certain entries in the ""Young Adult"" market. Pirated translations of his works were rushed to market to satisfy bottomless demand. He was even -- dare I say it? -- the Werner Herzog of his age (ok, yes, Humboldt was Prussian and Herzog Bavarian, but let's not nitpick). As young men, both were driven by some inner demon to seek out the most pestilential, soggy, disease-ridden, and predator-filled sections of inner South America, and came back to ""civilization"", such as it is, with precious insights and striking images, which changed the way people looked at the world. When older, both continued to push into far corners of the world (including, in both cases, Siberia) at a time of life when most of us find it increasingly difficult to get out of bed.Humboldt actually had a life that was both exciting and well-documented, so writing about him was a little like shooting fish in barrel. I don't wish to belittle the author's achievement: the narrative always moves along at an entertaining clip, even during those periods when Humboldt had to spend some time toadying up to various Kaisers in order to keep the old mazuma rolling in. I also enjoyed the last few chapters, which switched tone from standard biography of one man to mini chapter-long biographies of various men (including Simon Bolivar, Charles Darwin, Henry David Thoreau, and John Muir), with a concentration on how Humboldt changed the lives and directions of their thoughts. The point, I believe, was that, even though his name is no longer on everybody's lips, Humboldt is still very much with us.To repeat: delightful. Read it.The only thing that I didn't like about this book was the realization at the conclusion that, no matter what achievements I, uh, achieve with the balance of my life, I will never, ever, have a large predatory squid named after me. "
32,038535066X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6938150-marie-paule,5,"When in Berlin a few years ago, I came by the magnificent building of the Humboldt University. And I know that quite a few plants are named '... humboldtiensis'. Although I have a PhD in Science I knew nothing more about Alexander von Humboldt. What a shame. On Sep 14, 1869, the 100th birthday of this brilliant man, there were celebrations all over the world: Europe, Africa, Australia and the America's. More than 100 years later, he seems to be forgotten. What a life he has led. In his younger years, he became a lifetime friend of Goethe, who, besides being a poet, was very interested in botanics and geology. They were both interested in the dualism between the external and internal world (Kant and his 'Kritik der reinen Vernunft'). Is the tree in my garden a real tree, or my idea of a tree? Humboldt gradually shifted from pure empirical research towards his own interpretation of nature: he mixed detailed scientific facts with the emotional reactions they invoked. He thought a great deal about 'Life'. A machine can be taken apart and reassembled, but you can't do this with an animal. Why? Von Humboldt’s most important journey was a 5 year-trip through South America. There, he developed the first concept of 'ecosystems' (long before we knew this particular word), explaining that geology, climate, micro-organisms, plants and animals all influence each other. When he travelled through the plains of Los llanos in Venezuela in 1800 (!), he warned for the destructive effects of human activity (large scale agriculture of commercial crops, mining, ...) on the ecosystems. At the same time, he pointed out that the overexploitation of local ecosystems had disastrous effects on the human population as well: slavery, unhealthy working conditions, a shortage of local healthy foods, exploitation of large groups of have-nots by the happy few….. Sounds familiar, no?Does it surprise you that Alexander von Humboldt became one of the best liftetime friends of Simon Bolivar, who fought to liberate South America from its Spanish colonists? All through his live, von Humboldt fought against slavery. He so longed to visit India, but the British government denied him a passport, because they knew how he felt about slavery and he was not willing to compromise…. For the British, he remained a dangerous anti-colonialist actor. Later in life, he made a great journey through Russia, all the way to Mongolia. He held his 60th birthday party in … the pharmacy of Lenin’s grandfather. After his return from South America, von Humboldt lived in Paris and in London, where he met the famous scientists of his time. He inspired a lot of scientists and writers of his time, among others Charles Darwin, Henry David Thoreau, George Perkin Marsh, Ernst Haeckel and John Muir. Indeed, what a life and what a talent… At the end of his life, von Humboldt wrote his magnum opus ‘Kosmos’: an overview of his own and other scientific findings, but above all, his opinion about the correlations and relationships between different scientific theories, and the interrelation between science, art and sociology. For von Humboldt, there were no boundaries between scientific domains or between science and humanities. In short: von Humboldt was a scientist who was far ahead of his time and who remains a lighting example for us all."

And then to write a piece about a book I feel I’ve somehow grown and evolved from... ends up being an intensive labour of love that takes several days to complete and is never worth all that energy output, or maybe it does, depending where inmy mood cycle my bipolar brain happens to be at. It controls the inner weather regardless of whatever meds are in the picture. Reading is the perfect activity when living with an unpredictable bipolar inner weather system.

There is no limit to how many tags you can list, and they facilitate searching tremendously, so I’ve taken to tagging my books extensively to create indexes to help bring the book back to mind. I felt I was not up to the task of doing justice to Alexander von Humboldt with a humble review of my own. A man who was clearly a genius and well ahead of his time, and truly what we often refer to as a Renaissance Man.

34,038535066X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4070288-jo,4,The first 2/3 of this book are 5 star material. Wulf vividly depicts Humboldt's travels and his personality. He is a fascinating subject. The last sections really suffers in comparison. Her choice of figures to investigate his legacy through their biography is both too focused and too limited to be truly effective. While I understand her desire to dive deep into Humboldt's influence shoehorning in 5 mini bios of other figures into the end of the book moves the book away from its true center. Leaving Humboldt behind made me want to throw myself on the ground in the middle of the town square and yell about things breaking per my hero AvH.
35,038535066X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4739424-mal-warwick,5,"He was the most famous man in the world, and more places around the world are named after him than anyone else. To many of the giants of his time — Johann Wolfgang von Goethe, Thomas Jefferson, Simon Bolivar, Charles Darwin, Henry David Thoreau — he was a colossus whose genius overshadowed their own. He was the first to describe the web of life on Earth, foreshadowing James Lovelock’s Gaia hypothesis, and the first to describe the impact of human activity on the world’s climate. His books, which read like poetry, “were so popular that people bribed booksellers to be the first to receive copies.” Eleven years after his death at age 89, the centennial of his birth was observed by hundreds of thousands of people in huge celebrations around the world.Chances are, you’ve never heard of him.His name was Alexander von Humboldt, and he died in 1859. He had first described climate change in 1800. He “gave us his concept of nature itself.”Andrea Wulf’s engrossing new biography, The Invention of Nature, brings this extraordinary man into the spotlight again after a century and a half. It’s about time. His may well have been one of the finest minds in human history.Humboldt, born into a prosperous family of Prussian aristocrats shortly after the American Civil War, rebelled against the constraints on his life and set out on his own unique path. Though he became best known as a naturalist, world traveler, and author, his interests reached into a far wider range of human endeavor, and Cosmos, the multi-volume book he began to write at the age of sixty-five, encompassed virtually the whole of human knowledge, from botany, geology, and zoology to astronomy, philosophy, and, in effect, the new science he invented: ecology. (Though he didn’t invent that term, his work was the inspiration for the man who did later in the nineteenth century.)As Wulf notes, “Humboldt took his readers from outer space to earth, and then from the surface of the planet into its inner core. He discussed comets, the Milky Way and the solar system as well as terrestrial magnetism, volcanoes and the snow line of mountains. He wrote about the migration of the human species, about plants and animals and the microscopic organisms that live in stagnant water or on the weathered surface of rocks.” Never before, and never since (to the best of my knowledge), has a single individual mastered so many fields of inquiry so successfully that his contemporaries regarded him as a force of nature. And, in an age when most of humanity lived in thrall to organized religion, Humboldt didn’t once mention God in all the many thousands of pages of his books. Instead, he spoke of a “wonderful web of organic life.”Wulf’s biography of this astonishing man is by no means unreservedly positive. She describes the shortcomings of his personality in embarrassing detail: his tendency to talk nonstop at a rapid rate for hours without permitting interruptions of any kind, regardless of the stature of his listeners; his seeming inability to understand the feelings of others and to show empathy for their pain; his venomous gossiping; and his inability to accept criticism. Alexander von Humboldt was not a nice man.Andrea Wulf is an historian and writer who lives in Britain. The Invention of Nature is her fifth book."
36,038535066X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/93114967-barbara,4,"I had some familiarity with von Humboldt before reading Andrea Wulf's book - intrepid young explorer of South America, well known in his time, ocean currents and rivers named for him, information source for Thomas Jefferson about Spanish colonial America. Obviously, an interesting guy, so when I saw an audio copy of The Invention of Nature: Alexander von Humboldt's New World on sale, I grabbed it. Turned out to be a good decision on my part. Von Humboldt was so much more than just that adventurous young man I'd heard of, and Wulf does an excellent job of filling out the picture and his impact.During that extended exploration of South America 200 years ago, while ranging through much of modern day Venezuela, Columbia, Ecuador and Peru, von Humboldt developed concepts of nature, climate and ecology that we take as ""new"" in the late 20th/early 21st centuries. He determined, for instance, that the drop in the level of Lake Valencia was tied to the destruction of the surrounding forest to clear land for farming. He made the connection that the absence of the trees dramatically reduced the ability of the land to retain water. While climbing Mt. Chimborazo in the Andes he developed the concept of altitude-based climate zones that are consistent around the globe. Comparing plants he found on the South American Atlantic coast with those growing on the African Atlantic coast, he intuited that the two land masses must once have been one.These were not simply casual observations for von Humboldt; after returning to Europe he spent the rest of his life as a scientist and author, successfully seeking out the data to support his theories. It's impossible here to summarize his many brilliant insights, but as one example, his perceptions of the devastating outcomes of human's impact on the natural world were prescient of the reality we experience today. Through his writings he influenced many key thinkers of the 19th century, including Darwin, Thoreau and Muir.In truth, I found the biographical information about those scientists and naturalists who built their own theories on his foundations to be more lengthy than necessary, and the latter part of the book dragged a bit for that reason. But overall, reading the story of von Humboldt, a polymath with the ability to pull together what he observed in multiple scientific fields to develop comprehensive theories, was time well spent. He deserves more recognition today."
37,038535066X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/35482263-gumble-s-yard,4,"Alexander Von Humboldt ... was one of the last polymaths, and died at a time when scientific disciplines were hardening into tightly fenced and more specialised fields. Consequently his more holistic approach - a scientific method that included art, history, poetry and politics alongside hard data - has fallen out of favour ..... One of [his] greatest achievements had been to make science accessible and popular ......... in a world where we draw a sharp line between the sciences and the arts, between he subjective and the objective, Humboldt's insight that we can only truly understand nature by using our imaginations makes him a visionaryAward winning biography of Alexander Von Humboldt, of who I was previously familiar from the fictional biography Measuring the World. Wulf ksets out to show that: he was a true polymath, perhaps the last to really range across all scientific disciplines; that at a time when science was becoming increasingly focused on classifications he remained able to see the big picture both across as well as within scientific disciplines; that at a time when romantic poets and data driven scientists were starting to grow in mutual incomprehension, his method of observing and describing nature in person and in capturing what he observed both in rigorous data and evocative descriptions, enabled him to be lionised by individuals on both sides of that divide; that in his pioneering work on the inter-connectedness of natural ecosystems and on the impact of human actions on those systems, he should be regarded as the founder of the environmental movement. She also is keen to emphasise his influence on others - starting with his almost lifelong friendship with and influence on the work of Goethe. Wulf writes chapters on each of Simon Bolivar, Charles Darwin and Henry Thoreau, cantering on their achievements but at all times seeking for the considerable impact Von Humboldt had on them. In perhaps the only slightly false note in the book, it finishes with more than fifty pages on his seemingly more tangential influence on three lesser known figures whose main achievements were after his death. Overall though this is a fascinating and well written account."
38,038535066X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1241339-clif,5,"Chicago's public radio station, WBEZ, had a program on the statue of Alexander Humboldt in the park named after him, in a neighborhood named after him. The program speculated that not one in a thousand passersby would know who he was. I've no doubt that's true. My only association of the name was with the Humboldt Current that brings cold water up the west coast of South America from Antarctica. With that as background, this book floored me.Humboldt was to the 19th century as Einstein was to the 20th. It's fair to say that everyone knew his name even decades after his death in 1859. He was a powerful influence on Charles Darwin, John Muir and Henry David Thoreau. On the seminal voyage aboard the Beagle that took Darwin around the world, his notes are peppered with ""as Humboldt said..."" whenever something was found that confirmed Humboldt's previous discoveries. Thoreau was a Humboldt devotee.During his lifetime, and he loved life, lectures given by Humboldt were packed, whether in America or Europe. His books were best sellers and he was personally acquainted with everyone who was anyone, from Napoleon (one of the few that didn't like Humboldt) through the royalty of Europe to Simón Bolívar, the liberator of South America, and on down from there. He was a font of knowledge on the natural world, was driven by curiosity and would even at an advanced age rush to attend the lectures of someone who knew something he did not, sitting in an audience of college students furiously taking notes as he listened.He had only one foible - he could not stop talking. Only the most determined could get in a comment, but few wished to do so as it would, but only possibly, interrupt the flow of knowledge they wanted to hear. Single his entire life with never any indication of an attraction to women, he bonded easily with men, forming lifelong friendships and exploring for months on end with a partner.His physical endurance and health were phenomenal. He climbed snow covered mountains with none of the equipment we know today, even above levels where oxygen should be used. As others would fall victim to tropical diseases, Humboldt was up at dawn ready to go. Clouds of mosquitoes for days and nights on end were no deterrent if there was a new plant, animal or rock formation to be examined.Not only did he crave knowledge, he wanted everyone to share in it. His Personal Narrative of the Equinoctial Regions of the New Continent (South America) was devoured by a public as eager to find out what had been found as we today would read the account of a person visiting another solar system. And, speaking of outer space, he took that subject on as well in his quest to tie everything together, writing the multi-volume Cosmos as he neared the end of his life.As Andrea Wulf makes clear in her title, The Invention of Nature, Humboldt was one of the first to come up with the concept of ecosystems, the interconnection of the natural world that allow an environment to thrive if left alone, and change it even to the point of destruction when this or that part is altered. While few of us today know of Humboldt, we live in the conceptual world of nature he created.This book is a wonderful wide-ranging history that covers not only Humboldt's life, but contains brief overviews of the lives and work of Darwin, Thoreau, George Perkins Marsh, Ernst Haeckel and John Muir in relation to Humboldt. Filled with adventure and excitement, Wulf perfectly captures a man to which we are all indebted and one who would be delighted to meet any of us and relate his discoveries.Sad to say, none of his books are in the network of public libraries including the one in my own town."
39,038535066X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7175349-david,5,"Didn't finish before it was due back to the library, but I read enough to be dazzled by Humboldt. First, I must praise this author for writing this book, bringing this once famous and celebrated figure back to our attention. The title is apparently not as hyperbolic as it seems, as her subject really does seem to have given both the public and the scientific community the idea of nature as an interconnected whole. No summary I could offer will do justice to the book, so you will need to read it yourself. And if it is not the kind of book you would read, then at least go to a bookstore or the library and skim enough to get some idea of it, because it is worth knowing about. (Note: yes, this is who Humboldt county in California is named after, and the University in Berlin, and the current in the Pacific Ocean, and many other things besides.)Here's a guy who got Goethe all stirred up, who explored the Amazon and the Andes, loved to get close to an erupting volcano, inspired Simon Bolivar to rebel against Spain, admired the American Revolution but could not understand why his friend Thomas Jefferson did not free the slaves, got Thoreau interested in nature, etc., etc. Seems to have been gay (avant la lettre), as his attachments to other men seem to have been unusual enough to cause his family some concern. Certainly his companions stuck with him through thick and thin, at risk to their lives with some frequency. My favorite is the poor guy who survives fever in the Amazon, crawling along a precarious mountain trail in a howling snowstorm, a hurricane at sea, just for a few examples, only to be berated for not working hard enough to publish their discoveries when they finally get back to Paris. Our hero could wear you out, apparently, not that anyone seemed to mind. And he was enough of a superstar that the King of Prussia kept him at court later in life even though it was no secret that he didn't believe in Monarchy and would support any revolution that might overthrow his patron. Think about that: he didn't worry about pleasing the King, the King worried about keeping him around.The book may seem too thorough to some readers (e.g., me), but when you think about the many volumes written by Humboldt, it's easy to see that she must have felt like this was the short version of the story. So worth checking out! "
40,038535066X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/180643-jim-coughenour,3,"A fine (re)introduction to Humboldt and his prescient ecological view of nature: that everything is connected and that humanity is capable of destroying the world it's been given. Humboldt appears as a brilliant, even heroic, transitional figure between the Enlightenment and the Romantic movement, between the positivism of science and the inwardness of art, between Goethe and Darwin. Wulf is also good at demonstrating his influence on other naturalists, not only Darwin but Thoreau, George Perkins Marsh (new to me), Ernst Haeckel and John Muir.Because I'd just finished reading On the Move: A Life, I couldn't help being reminded of Oliver Sacks, who also stood outside his own profession of neurology to capture the human and artistic dimension of knowledge, creating a new kind of scientific literature in the process. I was also intrigued to find out that Humboldt never married. He claimed his passion was only for science, but he was rarely without the company of another charismatic young man. His equally famous brother, Willem, ""disliked his brother's intense friendships – probably a mixture of jealousy and a concern for what might have seemed the inappropriate nature of these connections."" And finally, to my private embarrassment, I realized I've confused Alexander and Willem my whole life. (Humboldt University in Berlin is named after both of them.)The dark irony is that, although Humboldt was revered his warnings about how humanity was destroying its own environment were largely ignored. What should be obvious to everyone is still the stuff of partisan politics, and the grim conviction deepens that nothing will be done until it is too late, that it is in fact too late already."
41,038535066X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5871422-elena,5,"Andrea Wulf paints an appealing picture of the brilliant Alexander von Humboldt, an Enlightenment titan who climbed the highest mountains he could find with heavy instruments to make precise measurements, not just air pressure, but he had some kind of cyanograph to measure just how blue the sky was at different altitudes. He discussed science with Thomas Jefferson, whom he admired on one level, but AvH was firmly opposed to any form of slavery. He admired the indigenous peoples he met while exploring South America, and reported on the magnificent ruins of ancient American civilizations and the complex languages of the peoples he encountered in the colorful jungles, which he much perfered to his native Berlin. He deplored the degradation of the New World ecology by the mining and cash crops of the Spanish. Wulf did extensive research on his influence on Darwin and the theory of evolution which he anticipated with studies of fossils, on Goethe who put a bit of him into Faust, on Simon Bolivar who discussed concepts of political freedom with him, on Henry David Thoreau who's love of nature was nurtured by reading AvH's books on the interconnected-ness of nature, and on John Muir who read and annotated his books. Wulf found direct connections to show how his love of nature even inspired the Art Deco movement. His fame was universal, his name attached to currents, mountains, counties, cities all across the US and Latin America. It was the anti-German sentiments of World War I, intensified in World War II that cause his fame to be mostly extinguished along with admiration for German science and culture in general. Time to appreciate the man who pushed through legislation in Prussia that any slave, including any American slave, who lands on Prussian soil becomes a free person. "
42,038535066X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6432978-bfisher,4,"Alexander von Humboldt was one of the most prominent scientists of the nineteenth century. When he died in 1859, tens of thousands of mourners marched in his funeral procession. A staggering number of geographical features were named after him in his lifetime. It seems appropriate that the namesake Humboldt River, one of the largest rivers in the Great Basin of North America, disappears from sight in the Humboldt Sinks, much as Humboldt’s reputation has disappeared from modern popular memory.Yet, it is not fitting that Humboldt should be forgotten to our age. Andrea Wulf describes his roles as a founder of biogeography, inventor of isotherms, developer of the concept of ecological systems and the interdependence of life, and as the first scientist to recognize the danger of anthropogenic climate change. He influenced Darwin, Thoreau and John Muir. We recognize and adopt his ideas but have forgotten the person. This book is a useful recovery of the core importance to science and society of Humboldt's work. Unfortunately, in its coverage of Humboldt the scientist, Humboldt the person gets short shrift, aside from a few brief hints. That is my one quibble with this book."
43,038535066X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7283807-ben,1,"Desperately in need of an editor. Perhaps the author could not find enough source material on Humboldt himself. The majority of the book consists of capsule biographies and Wikipedia-level explanations of other people, such as Darwin or Muir. The author bombastically credits everything good to Humboldt. A typical phrasing, repeated dozens if not hundreds of times, goes like, ""Humboldt generously shared his library with X, and despite his own debts supported X financially. X praised Humboldt as 'one of the greatest scientists of his generation.'"" There is very little insight added to the material. The author does not bring any skepticism to the table, and is entirely credulous when it comes to Humboldt. Unfortunately, this means that you can't trust what few conclusions are drawn. I only finished it because I had an audiobook. Not worth reading. "
44,038535066X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/18845147-gill,4,"This is a well written, comprehensive account of the life of Alexander von Humboldt, and his influences and influence. I found it an interesting read, and the specialist sections clearly explained. I found the section on his links with Simon Bolívar especially interesting. Well done to Andrea Wulf for introducing a man who was so important in his own time to a present day audience."
45,038535066X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2758455-katy,5,Excellent book! Alexander Von Humboldt is a hero for science & nature and was ahead of his time. We can all still learn from him and from those who were influenced by him.

Humboldt's legacy of scientific inquiry has style of writing has impacted generations of scientist, writers and readers all around the world. His numerous works and lectures are still revelant as the world faces a global environmental crossroads. I highly encourage readers to pick up this outstanding work."
47,038535066X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/96806543-the-colonial,3,"Alexander von Humboldt’s name can be seen throughout the world’s streets, trails, universities, and rivers, yet the man and his mystique are rarely brought to our actual attention. By the early-nineteenth century, Humboldt had become what today we would call both an Environmentalist and Renaissance Man—as he was a scientist, explorer, naturalist, botanist, and colleague of renowned and like-minded intellectuals of the age. Andrea Wulf weaves all of these traits together in order to discuss Humboldt’s life journey and the groundbreaking ideas that he introduced our world to—some far too ahead of the times for the likes of his contemporaries.The first half of the book appropriately covers Humboldt’s beginnings, from his boyhood and ancestry in Prussia, to his rise in education and esteem in the scientific world. Wulf devotes much attention to Humboldt’s standing in the political world as a whole, where the botanist is doted upon by courtly officials and diplomats from such prosperous world powers as Russia, Great Britain, Spain, and the United States. He is honored by the prestigious Royal Society of London as a foreign member, and throughout his remarkable life he meets the likes of such prominent figures as Joseph Banks, Benjamin Smith Barton, Thomas Jefferson, Benjamin Rush, and a young and upcoming Charles Darwin.Unfortunately, Wulf’s enthusiasm for her subject is too broad in its approach, as she pivots into the second half of the book by focusing on the great men that were influenced by Humboldt—all of which include famous scientists, authors, environmentalists, and inventors. This is collectively balanced out by her engaging and imaginative prose, where she fortunately excels at using her fascination with Humboldt as well as that of nature itself for her inspiration. Wulf majestically explains each and every tour and journey that Humboldt embarked upon, as well as the meetings he held with prominent men of his times:…Humboldt informed Jefferson, where he had collected plants, made astronomical observations, found hieroglyphs of ancient civilizations deep in the rainforest and had amassed important data from the colonial archives of Mexico City. Humboldt also wrote to James Madison, the Secretary of State and Jefferson’s closest political ally, declaring that ‘having witnessed the great spectacle of the majestic Andes and the grandeur of the physical world I intended to enjoy the spectacle of a free people.’ Politics and nature belonged together–an idea that Humboldt would be discussing with the Americans.With almost the final half of the book being dedicated to Thoreau, Darwin, George Perkins Marsh, John Muir, and Ernst Haeckel, the reader unfortunately loses interest on the main subject of Humboldt’s adventurous life—leaving a sense of unfulfillment. It’s apparent that Wulf has so much more to tell on Alexander von Humboldt’s life, which is almost frustrating since the reader is constantly engrossed and intrigued in his story, due to the benefit of her writing style and equal fascination. Apart from the unnecessary segue into like-minded men, there is still much to be gained by the modern reader from reading Wulf’s work on an environmental pioneer and enlightened man of many qualifications and achievements. Maps are provided, a useful “Note on Humboldt’s Publications”, as well as helpful illustrations found throughout the text.

48,038535066X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3007401-biblio-files-takingadayoff,5,"Apparently, in much of Europe, Alexander von Humboldt is as well known as Charles Darwin is to those of us in the United States and Britain. A naturalist and explorer, Humboldt took his upper class education in 18th century Prussia and applied it to becoming a Renaissance man in 19th century Europe and America. Humboldt was especially interested in plant life, but he was an extremely energetic and focused person who also enjoyed studying all forms of life on earth, as well as philosophy, literature and poetry, astronomy, and languages. He loved participating in the frequent salons of the time and became friends with Goethe, and later with Simon Bolivar in his pre-revolutionary days traveling in Europe. He reached out to Thomas Jefferson as a fellow scientist (Jefferson was not only a gentleman farmer, but a scientific farmer as well) and procured an invitation to stay at the President's mansion while he visited Washington, D.C. Later, in Paris, he tried to play diplomat with Napoleon, but was not successful. Still, Napoleon was said to be impressed with his scientific works and to have read Humboldt's books.Humboldt's claim to fame as a scientist is to have been one of the first to see plant life, animal life, the cosmos, geology, everything, as a part of a single ecosystem, rather than as individual and not necessarily connected pieces. This is so basic to our way of thinking today that it seems obvious and not particularly remarkable. But it is as fundamentally different a way of looking at the world as Darwin's idea of natural selection was. Andrea Wulf's biography describes Humboldt's studies, travels, accomplishments -- you feel as if Humboldt would be quite an engaging, if hard to keep up with, fellow. After reading The Invention of Nature, the question that still nagged at me was how I had never learned of this whirlwind before. "
49,038535066X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/241691-kay,4,"“Temperament is destiny,” or so the proverb says, though I have always been suspicious of such broad sweeps of rhetoric. Still, this saying kept echoing through my head as I read this book, for I could not help but wonder: “What makes such a man as Alexander von Humboldt? What motivates him, drives him forward, helps him overcome obstacles, or, perhaps even ultimately, is his very undoing?” It seemed as I read of Humboldt’s life, passions, and seemingly boundless energy, that he must have sprung, almost Athena-like, from his mother’s womb, set from the get-go on a trajectory that would send him around the world in an unceasing round of exploration, research, and writing. Certainly, the advantages of his upbringing and background helped: a stable home, wealth, attentive (if distant) parents, exacting tutors, a library at his disposal. Yet there are other men and women that I can think of, such as the naturalist Alfred Russel Wallace or the explorer Mary Kingsley who had few such advantages, but, like Humboldt, possessed an urge for going, a forward momentum, an insatiable curiosity, and above all, seemingly boundless resources of optimism, courage, and self-reliance. They were, I can’t help but feel, the chosen few, blessed with a rare combination of temperament, intelligence, and energy. It is a magic formula – and, oh, if only I possessed it! The title of this book could well have been “Why Humboldt Matters,” and it’s scarcely a spoiler to reveal that he matters very much, and indeed is perhaps more relevant than ever. Although Humboldt is little thought about or even known about today, in his time he was the most famous scientist in the world - and that was before the term ""scientist"" even existed. It was Humboldt's accounts of his travels in South America and Russia that most captured the public's attention, but among Enlightenment-era and 19th century intellectual circles, his reputation as the authority on a wide range of scientific matters was unquestioned. His vision of nature as an integrated, interconnected and interdependent force, one, furthermore, indifferent to and even damaged by man is what most influenced thinkers of his time, and it is this complex and far-sighted vision which resonates today, perhaps now more than ever in the face of impending environmental threats.Wulf's explanation of why Humboldt fell into relative obscurity during the 20th century, particularly in the U.S.A., wasn't entirely convincing. She cites anti-German sentiment in the wake of the First World War, the fragmentation of science into specialized fields, and the fact that ""Humboldt is not known for a single fact or a discovery but for his worldview. His vision of nature has passed into our consciousness as if by osmosis."" But I think another reason lies within the pages of Wulf's book: Humboldt was the original ""torch bearer,"" but that torch has been taken up by many, some of whom Wulf devotes chapters to, such as Charles Darwin and John Muir. These figures, rather than Humboldt, occupy a larger place in the current public imagination. However, in contemplating Humboldt's scientific eclipse, once again I fell to musing about our fickleness in choosing heroes. Charles Darwin, hero (or blasphemer, depending on your perspective) is universally known if perhaps less than universally understood. (Hence the “blasphemer” part, one could argue.) His less-well-heeled contemporary, Alfred Russel Wallace, simultaneous and independent formulator of the theory of natural selection, while more recently enjoying a bit of an upswing, is still a relative unknown. (And can you guess which of the two is a personal hero? Corr-rect! Wallace it is!) Alfred Einstein, virtually a pop star in the scientific firmament, is but one very bright star in a constellation of equally impressive luminaries – Niels Bohr, Max Planck, Ernest Rutherford, Paul Dirac, James Clerk Maxwell – but it is Einstein who inhabits the popular imagination as the preeminent scientist of all time. (Though many will, of course, at least have a hazy idea, as I do, that Schrödinger and a cat also come into play somewhere.) Yet, after living for years with a physicist, I can confidently state that this much is true: No genius exists in splendid isolation. Each is perched on the shoulders of genii who preceded him. Or her. And so it unquestionably was with Humboldt, whose influences included Johann Wolfgang von Goethe, Captain Cook, Joseph Banks, Immanuel Kant, and indeed the very temper of the Age of Enlightenment. Yet Wulf’s biography focuses primarily on how Humboldt influenced his contemporaries and subsequent generations.  The most prominent of Humboldt’s followers (and that’s not too strong a term, really), was Darwin, who arguably would never have made that voyage on  The Beagle had he not been inspired by Humboldt’s account of his South American travels. Wulf devotes a chapter each to Darwin and four others who fell under Humboldt’s spell: Henry David Thoreau, George Perkins Marsh, Ernst Haeckel, and John Muir. Some of these Humboldtiphiles (Darwin, Thoreau, Muir), I knew something about, though admittedly it seems I knew less about Thoreau than I had thought, while of the remaining two, Marsh and Haeckel, I knew nothing. The chapter on Haeckel I particularly enjoyed, for I have a longstanding interest in Art Nouveau and its various architectural offshoots, and I immediately perceived how Haeckel’s wonderful fusion of art and science became the wellspring for many artists in the new (20th) century. Look at Gaudi’s Casa Batlló and then look at Haeckel’s illustrations of radiolarians (microscopic sea creatures) and the similarities are almost breathtaking. Why, that famous unfinished cathedral in Barcelona is but a radiolarian writ large!In short, I came away not just with a very good idea of Humboldt’s life after reading The Invention of Nature, but also was treated to five succinct mini-biographies of his most influential acolytes. Looking over that group provides a good sense of how all-encompassing Humboldt’s polymath grasp was: he influenced natural scientists, philosopher poets, conservationists, preservationists, earth scientists, artists, and even politicians and kings. Oh, and to add a bit more to this grandiose mix, Humboldt’s friends and contemporaries included the likes of Thomas Jefferson, Simon Bolivar, Joseph Hooker, and practically the entire scientific and intellectual elite of his age, with whom he maintained a voluminous correspondence.But again….that energy! Reading of Humboldt’s travels, experiments, indefatigable correspondence, and the breadth of his expertise practically made my head spin. Wulf makes the point – repeatedly – that perhaps Humboldt’s most singular legacy was his ability to synthesize information from areas which, today, are broken into discrete fields, such as climatology, volcanology, botany, biology, geology, meteorology, seismology, and paleontology, just to name a few. Those fields were all given a hearty kick-start by Humboldt’s grand synthesis, his Cosmos. It is this great overarching view of nature that inspired those that followed. Reading (but, admittedly, not entirely comprehending) how Humboldt achieved this was inspirational. A couple of final notes: firstly, the illustrations in the book were a delight. May I confess how much I enjoy well-selected (and nicely rendered) illustrations? I sometimes feel a little jolt of pleasure whenever I turn the page to find one. The chapter on Haeckel, for example, cried out for some of his radiolarian drawings. And there they were! Along with some equally fetching Medusae. Another not entirely unexpected joy was Wulf’s style. She has one! That is to say, I got a sense of 
her
 from reading this book, but she never intruded upon the subject, which always remained in focus. While it’s clear that Wulf must have loved researching and writing about Humboldt, she judiciously organized the material and trimmed her narrative, then wrote it in a lively yet elegant style that made me think, on the whole, that I would rather enjoy meeting this author. At any rate, I certainly want to read more of her work. "

51,038535066X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/18695911-daniel-chaikin,4,"It was interesting this evening, as I was driving home and listening to Michael Pollan read his latest book, to hear him refer to this book as if it were a major inspiration for him. Humboldt's view of nature as one entire interconnected thing. It is a beautiful concept, one he made at length and, as Wulf shows, elegantly and poetically. Darwin, who eventually met Humboldt, found Humboldt's writing inspirational for his scientific view of nature. Henry Thoreau devoured his writing, and found inspiration of his poetic view of the nature around his small pond. And John Muir, so enraptured he set off for Cuba and South America until he learned the tropical climates made him ill, found in Humboldt an inspiration for the environmental movement. And, I should mention, Simon Bolivar not only found in Humboldt a South American natural identity he raved about, but also used Humboldt's maps in his military campaigns. Wulf follows all these threads and more, in great detail. She rushes headlong through narratives, making them something of a roller coaster ride, and she spends time at the end wondering why the contemporary English speaking world has practically forgotten who Humboldt was or why anyone cares. What did he accomplish anyway, other than create some of the first detailed maps in a few hard to reach parts of South America? He was, it seems, primarily and powerfully, an inspiration. OK, he also invented the idea of nature. Well, maybe. I mean, Wulf makes the claim, over and over again, but it's a claim that reveals a major weakness in the book that bothered me a lot. She presents, ultimately, a very narrow in focus. So, yes, no question, Humboldt has a thought-provoking unified view on nature. But, was he the first? What was the intellectual world around him thinking, and what were the foundations? Is it possible nature as a unified thing was brought up before? Ever? by anyone? Wulf doesn't do context well, or didn't here. Really, mainly what she does is report stories in lengthy but also abbreviated forms. I liked her book and I really liked learning about Humbolt. It's not a perfect work, but it's not like the early 19th century intellectual world is an easy one to capture. So, flawed but still recommended, and who knows, you might be blown away like Michael Pollan.-----------------------------------------------60.

52,038535066X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/67736000-elizabeth-a-g,5,"Andrea Wulf's The Invention of Nature: Alexander von Humboldt's New World is an enjoyable, well-written and researched exploration of one man's vision of the world around him and how his restless spirit and determination gave us a deep appreciation of nature and presented the idea connectedness of all things organic and inorganic. Alexander von Humboldt is little remembered today and this book sheds a light on the scientist, ecologist. educator, and humanist who influenced later, better known naturalists like Darwin, Thoreau, George Perkins Marsh, Ernst Haeckel, and John Muir. Humboldt believed in the power of education and his writings and books were aimed toward a general audience rather than to specifically the scientific community. In fact he sought to show how nature is a living organism and that there is unity in scientific thought and the emotional response to nature that is expressed in poetry, art and music. He is also one of the first to warn that the activities of man in his commercial pursuits are bringing about the destruction of forests and creating climate change. In this book Wulf describes Humboldt's influence on future environmentalists and goes into some detail on these others...my only issue that perhaps the author could have shortened this section of the book by more of a summarization rather such detail (the subjects for a future book, perhaps). The epilogue of the book is excellent."

About half the book is padded with simplistic one chapter biopics of people purported to have been strongly influenced by Humboldt, often to an extent that is hard to credit. So according to Wulf: Goethe modelled Faust on Humboldt; Darwin would not have travelled on the Beagle and eventually developed evolutionary theory; John Muir wouldn't have become a environmentalist and saved the redwoods; Heckel wouldn't have created art that directly lead to Art Nouveau; and Bolívar wouldn't have become a revolutionary leading to the decolonization of Spain in Latin America. Wulf also repeatedly credits him with discovering climate change, centuries before it came to conscious awareness here, despite no evidence that this is true. Near the end of the book, she credits his current day obscurity (which is not really true) from a reaction against all things German after the 2nd World War, but if this was really correct, why are so many other German scientists and writers remembered and him not? Perhaps it is more to do with him never creating a lasting advance in knowledge via synthesis (a la Darwin).A great opportunity that is wasted by lack of in depth research and a critical appraisal of Humboldt's life.2-stars."

He inspired Charles Darwin and Henry David Thoreau. He was friends with Simon Bolivar. He invented the thermal lines on maps and came up with the idea of ecosystems and climate zones. He was a scientist before that was a word, and a naturalist before all the different disciplines of nature split into their factions. He believed nature needed to be understood with facts and poetry, felt as well as experienced. And he predicted climate change and deforestation... in the 1790s. I don’t usually enjoy biographies but I loved this book. It’s well-researched and well written. It’s a fascinating look at the adventures and contributions of a truly great man, and the grandfather of the environmental movement. He was the most famous man in the world at one point, and he’s been lost to history only because of 20th Century anti-German sentiment. Glad I read this and learnt about Humboldt. We owe him so much. "
55,038535066X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/155776-katharine,5,"Do you like science? Literature? History? Do you have strong emotional reactions to being in nature? Then you should read this book! I will boldly say this book is my favorite book of 2015 and I plan on recommending it to everyone I know. Part of the delight is that I had no knowledge of Humboldt before reading this book and I was amazed to learn how influential and inspiring he was to people in the 18th and 19th centuries. With direct links to American founding fathers, the Romantic Literature movement, and Simon Bolivar's fight for independence in South America, and Charles Darwin Humboldt is seed that many modern ideas are sprung from. Although I read a library copy of this book I promptly went out and bought my own personal copy because it's a book I will treasure for years to come."
56,038535066X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/8942931-steph-post,5,"A gorgeous book for science, art and literature fans alike. This is more than a biography of Humboldt (one of the most interesting scientists and explorers of all time)- it's a dedication to his legacy and an exploration of how his findings and philosophies eventually influenced everything from Art Nouveau to Walden to John Muir. Wide and diverse in breadth and scope, this reminds me of one of my favorite books- The Age of Wonder. "
57,038535066X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/637858-mike,4,"I never knew much about Humboldt, yet I found this book breathtaking. A man of natural science of the 19th century, multitalented, and as smart and as dedicated as they come. Substantial impact on Latin American knowledge, and shared experiences.Well written, insightful, an easy and smooth learning experience."

59,038535066X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5930747-hermien,5,That a man of such great vision can be almost forgotten now is amazing. I had no idea that the survival of the planet had preoccupied people that long ago - unfortunately to not enough effect. 
60,038535066X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3409532-april-does-feral-sometimes,4,"The book 'The Invention of Nature' is fascinating. It is more than a biography of Alexander Von Humboldt (1769-1859), who can be described as a polymath genius whose enthusiasm for travel and nature was as momentous for the development of as many branches of science that Albert Einstein (1879-1955) was because of his interest in physics. Yet, I have never heard of him until I read this book.Some early Western 19th-century proto-scientists labored all of their life in bleak obscurity until only after their deaths being recognized as major scientific brains and discoverers; others announced their work to newly created scientific societies only to be met with withering scorn. Some inventors were clearly crackpots with one great idea while others were intelligent driven members of respectable aristocrat families and upper-class merchants. (Almost all of these Great Men of Science upset their parents by refusing to study law or medicine in university! Humboldt was one of these children of disappointed parents. I have read a few other science histories, and I have noticed that almost all of these early scientists had parents hoping for a son who would become a doctor or lawyer. Just saying.)However, Humboldt became famous early in his lifetime and all doors were open to him. He met already famous people eager to speak with him, such as President Thomas Jefferson. Others who desired to call him friend went on to illustrious (and nefarious) careers as famous scientists in their own right such as Charles Darwin, well-known writers such as Henry David Thoreau, and Kings, Emperors and Prime Ministers such as Friedrich Wilhelm IV and George Canning, as well as leaders of political revolutions overthrowing those before-mentioned Kings and Emperors such as Simón Bolívar. Humboldt himself was a liberal and he supported the overthrow of the aristocracy, but his income primarily was from a pension paid by two Prussian kings after he went through his own inheritance. He obviously was charismatic, moving easily between many different cultures and social classes, from South America to Europe to Russia.After returning from a five-year exploration of South America with tens of thousands of astronomical, geological and meteorological observations and specimens, he published his first book, 'Essay on the Geography of Plants' at age 32, dedicating it to Johann Wolfgang Goethe, his fellow polymath and best friend (after his brother Wilhelm von Humboldt, who founded the University of Berlin after a career as the Prussian ambassador to Vienna and Britain). The book combined with his achievements and personality made him a famous man, perhaps the most famous respected natural scientist in the world. However, full of energy, wanderlust and curiosity, Humboldt moved on to more explorations crossing over the frontlines of many European wars between France, Prussia, Britain, and Spain, and maneuvering through countries on three continents which were undergoing political revolutions, observing volcano eruptions while mountain climbing without oxygen tanks (yes, he and his companions fainted occasionally) enduring nasty mosquitos, while exposing and warning the public of the dreadful environmental destruction of earth wherever men used the land for agriculture, mining and lumber.Humboldt lived to the age of 89, still receiving famous visitors and writing thousands of letters a month up to his death. His books on the natural sciences, illustrated with his own and other explorers' beautiful art and drawings, inspired Darwin, Thoreau, Ernst Haeckel, John Muir, to name a few. Rivers, mountains, towns and other landmarks were named after him, and he is mentioned in thousands of famous novels. Yet most Americans today have never heard of him, probably because of World War I and WWII having been fought against Germany as an enemy of the United States. I think we should bring this man back into the spotlight and make him a famous hero scientist again. This book is an excellent start.Below I've included some Wikipedia links about the early naturalists, Humboldt, and many of the famous intellectuals, writers and scientists he inspired in later centuries, in hope that these thumbnail histories will convince you, gentle reader, to pick up this book:http://www.ranker.com/list/notable-na...https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alexa...https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kosmo...https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Georg...https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Man_a...https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ernst...https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kunst...https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_..."
61,038535066X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2527265-david,5,"It is a sad commentary on our age (or maybe me personally) that, when I am about to get really enthusiastic about something, as in this case, I feel the need to make clear that I am NOT being sarcastic. HOLY MOLY! WOW! What an awesome book! Just reading it made me happy to be alive! Really! It was a wonderful break from the dreary procession of bad news parading out of every media orifice! (Note to self: improve your imagery.) I neglected other self-improving projects to read this book, and then was sad when I finished it! Worthy of all awards and accolades! The world would be a better place if everyone was forced to read it, at gunpoint if necessary! Don't just stand (or sit) there, go out and get a copy right away!I love narratives about news events, scandals, and personalities that once famous, but now forgotten. This is one of them, of a man known by everyone when living, celebrated, called without irony the greatest man who had ever lived, sought out by tedious rich people and aristocrats, pestered for autographs, and recipient of mountains of admiring old-school paper letters. Intrepid and death-defying explorer, partisan of liberty, deplorer of slavery and cruelty, widely-admired prose stylist, polyglot, polymath. Honored by having towns, counties, and other jurisdictions named after him. Further honored by having a Pacific Ocean current named after him and, even cooler still, also a critter described by Wikipedia as a ""large predatory squid"". His books were anticipated with an enthusiasm which today, sadly, only occurs with certain entries in the ""Young Adult"" market. Pirated translations of his works were rushed to market to satisfy bottomless demand. He was even -- dare I say it? -- the Werner Herzog of his age (ok, yes, Humboldt was Prussian and Herzog Bavarian, but let's not nitpick). As young men, both were driven by some inner demon to seek out the most pestilential, soggy, disease-ridden, and predator-filled sections of inner South America, and came back to ""civilization"", such as it is, with precious insights and striking images, which changed the way people looked at the world. When older, both continued to push into far corners of the world (including, in both cases, Siberia) at a time of life when most of us find it increasingly difficult to get out of bed.Humboldt actually had a life that was both exciting and well-documented, so writing about him was a little like shooting fish in barrel. I don't wish to belittle the author's achievement: the narrative always moves along at an entertaining clip, even during those periods when Humboldt had to spend some time toadying up to various Kaisers in order to keep the old mazuma rolling in. I also enjoyed the last few chapters, which switched tone from standard biography of one man to mini chapter-long biographies of various men (including Simon Bolivar, Charles Darwin, Henry David Thoreau, and John Muir), with a concentration on how Humboldt changed the lives and directions of their thoughts. The point, I believe, was that, even though his name is no longer on everybody's lips, Humboldt is still very much with us.To repeat: delightful. Read it.The only thing that I didn't like about this book was the realization at the conclusion that, no matter what achievements I, uh, achieve with the balance of my life, I will never, ever, have a large predatory squid named after me. "
62,038535066X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6938150-marie-paule,5,"When in Berlin a few years ago, I came by the magnificent building of the Humboldt University. And I know that quite a few plants are named '... humboldtiensis'. Although I have a PhD in Science I knew nothing more about Alexander von Humboldt. What a shame. On Sep 14, 1869, the 100th birthday of this brilliant man, there were celebrations all over the world: Europe, Africa, Australia and the America's. More than 100 years later, he seems to be forgotten. What a life he has led. In his younger years, he became a lifetime friend of Goethe, who, besides being a poet, was very interested in botanics and geology. They were both interested in the dualism between the external and internal world (Kant and his 'Kritik der reinen Vernunft'). Is the tree in my garden a real tree, or my idea of a tree? Humboldt gradually shifted from pure empirical research towards his own interpretation of nature: he mixed detailed scientific facts with the emotional reactions they invoked. He thought a great deal about 'Life'. A machine can be taken apart and reassembled, but you can't do this with an animal. Why? Von Humboldt’s most important journey was a 5 year-trip through South America. There, he developed the first concept of 'ecosystems' (long before we knew this particular word), explaining that geology, climate, micro-organisms, plants and animals all influence each other. When he travelled through the plains of Los llanos in Venezuela in 1800 (!), he warned for the destructive effects of human activity (large scale agriculture of commercial crops, mining, ...) on the ecosystems. At the same time, he pointed out that the overexploitation of local ecosystems had disastrous effects on the human population as well: slavery, unhealthy working conditions, a shortage of local healthy foods, exploitation of large groups of have-nots by the happy few….. Sounds familiar, no?Does it surprise you that Alexander von Humboldt became one of the best liftetime friends of Simon Bolivar, who fought to liberate South America from its Spanish colonists? All through his live, von Humboldt fought against slavery. He so longed to visit India, but the British government denied him a passport, because they knew how he felt about slavery and he was not willing to compromise…. For the British, he remained a dangerous anti-colonialist actor. Later in life, he made a great journey through Russia, all the way to Mongolia. He held his 60th birthday party in … the pharmacy of Lenin’s grandfather. After his return from South America, von Humboldt lived in Paris and in London, where he met the famous scientists of his time. He inspired a lot of scientists and writers of his time, among others Charles Darwin, Henry David Thoreau, George Perkin Marsh, Ernst Haeckel and John Muir. Indeed, what a life and what a talent… At the end of his life, von Humboldt wrote his magnum opus ‘Kosmos’: an overview of his own and other scientific findings, but above all, his opinion about the correlations and relationships between different scientific theories, and the interrelation between science, art and sociology. For von Humboldt, there were no boundaries between scientific domains or between science and humanities. In short: von Humboldt was a scientist who was far ahead of his time and who remains a lighting example for us all."

There is no limit to how many tags you can list, and they facilitate searching tremendously, so I’ve taken to tagging my books extensively to create indexes to help bring the book back to mind. I felt I was not up to the task of doing justice to Alexander von Humboldt with a humble review of my own. A man who was clearly a genius and well ahead of his time, and truly what we often refer to as a Renaissance Man. So this is what I have in lieu of a review, presenting my list of aide mémoire tags...

64,038535066X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4070288-jo,4,The first 2/3 of this book are 5 star material. Wulf vividly depicts Humboldt's travels and his personality. He is a fascinating subject. The last sections really suffers in comparison. Her choice of figures to investigate his legacy through their biography is both too focused and too limited to be truly effective. While I understand her desire to dive deep into Humboldt's influence shoehorning in 5 mini bios of other figures into the end of the book moves the book away from its true center. Leaving Humboldt behind made me want to throw myself on the ground in the middle of the town square and yell about things breaking per my hero AvH.
65,038535066X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4739424-mal-warwick,5,"He was the most famous man in the world, and more places around the world are named after him than anyone else. To many of the giants of his time — Johann Wolfgang von Goethe, Thomas Jefferson, Simon Bolivar, Charles Darwin, Henry David Thoreau — he was a colossus whose genius overshadowed their own. He was the first to describe the web of life on Earth, foreshadowing James Lovelock’s Gaia hypothesis, and the first to describe the impact of human activity on the world’s climate. His books, which read like poetry, “were so popular that people bribed booksellers to be the first to receive copies.” Eleven years after his death at age 89, the centennial of his birth was observed by hundreds of thousands of people in huge celebrations around the world.Chances are, you’ve never heard of him.His name was Alexander von Humboldt, and he died in 1859. He had first described climate change in 1800. He “gave us his concept of nature itself.”Andrea Wulf’s engrossing new biography, The Invention of Nature, brings this extraordinary man into the spotlight again after a century and a half. It’s about time. His may well have been one of the finest minds in human history.Humboldt, born into a prosperous family of Prussian aristocrats shortly after the American Civil War, rebelled against the constraints on his life and set out on his own unique path. Though he became best known as a naturalist, world traveler, and author, his interests reached into a far wider range of human endeavor, and Cosmos, the multi-volume book he began to write at the age of sixty-five, encompassed virtually the whole of human knowledge, from botany, geology, and zoology to astronomy, philosophy, and, in effect, the new science he invented: ecology. (Though he didn’t invent that term, his work was the inspiration for the man who did later in the nineteenth century.)As Wulf notes, “Humboldt took his readers from outer space to earth, and then from the surface of the planet into its inner core. He discussed comets, the Milky Way and the solar system as well as terrestrial magnetism, volcanoes and the snow line of mountains. He wrote about the migration of the human species, about plants and animals and the microscopic organisms that live in stagnant water or on the weathered surface of rocks.” Never before, and never since (to the best of my knowledge), has a single individual mastered so many fields of inquiry so successfully that his contemporaries regarded him as a force of nature. And, in an age when most of humanity lived in thrall to organized religion, Humboldt didn’t once mention God in all the many thousands of pages of his books. Instead, he spoke of a “wonderful web of organic life.”Wulf’s biography of this astonishing man is by no means unreservedly positive. She describes the shortcomings of his personality in embarrassing detail: his tendency to talk nonstop at a rapid rate for hours without permitting interruptions of any kind, regardless of the stature of his listeners; his seeming inability to understand the feelings of others and to show empathy for their pain; his venomous gossiping; and his inability to accept criticism. Alexander von Humboldt was not a nice man.Andrea Wulf is an historian and writer who lives in Britain. The Invention of Nature is her fifth book."
66,038535066X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/93114967-barbara,4,"I had some familiarity with von Humboldt before reading Andrea Wulf's book - intrepid young explorer of South America, well known in his time, ocean currents and rivers named for him, information source for Thomas Jefferson about Spanish colonial America. Obviously, an interesting guy, so when I saw an audio copy of The Invention of Nature: Alexander von Humboldt's New World on sale, I grabbed it. Turned out to be a good decision on my part. Von Humboldt was so much more than just that adventurous young man I'd heard of, and Wulf does an excellent job of filling out the picture and his impact.During that extended exploration of South America 200 years ago, while ranging through much of modern day Venezuela, Columbia, Ecuador and Peru, von Humboldt developed concepts of nature, climate and ecology that we take as ""new"" in the late 20th/early 21st centuries. He determined, for instance, that the drop in the level of Lake Valencia was tied to the destruction of the surrounding forest to clear land for farming. He made the connection that the absence of the trees dramatically reduced the ability of the land to retain water. While climbing Mt. Chimborazo in the Andes he developed the concept of altitude-based climate zones that are consistent around the globe. Comparing plants he found on the South American Atlantic coast with those growing on the African Atlantic coast, he intuited that the two land masses must once have been one.These were not simply casual observations for von Humboldt; after returning to Europe he spent the rest of his life as a scientist and author, successfully seeking out the data to support his theories. It's impossible here to summarize his many brilliant insights, but as one example, his perceptions of the devastating outcomes of human's impact on the natural world were prescient of the reality we experience today. Through his writings he influenced many key thinkers of the 19th century, including Darwin, Thoreau and Muir.In truth, I found the biographical information about those scientists and naturalists who built their own theories on his foundations to be more lengthy than necessary, and the latter part of the book dragged a bit for that reason. But overall, reading the story of von Humboldt, a polymath with the ability to pull together what he observed in multiple scientific fields to develop comprehensive theories, was time well spent. He deserves more recognition today."
67,038535066X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/35482263-gumble-s-yard,4,"Alexander Von Humboldt ... was one of the last polymaths, and died at a time when scientific disciplines were hardening into tightly fenced and more specialised fields. Consequently his more holistic approach - a scientific method that included art, history, poetry and politics alongside hard data - has fallen out of favour ..... One of [his] greatest achievements had been to make science accessible and popular ......... in a world where we draw a sharp line between the sciences and the arts, between he subjective and the objective, Humboldt's insight that we can only truly understand nature by using our imaginations makes him a visionaryAward winning biography of Alexander Von Humboldt, of who I was previously familiar from the fictional biography Measuring the World. Wulf ksets out to show that: he was a true polymath, perhaps the last to really range across all scientific disciplines; that at a time when science was becoming increasingly focused on classifications he remained able to see the big picture both across as well as within scientific disciplines; that at a time when romantic poets and data driven scientists were starting to grow in mutual incomprehension, his method of observing and describing nature in person and in capturing what he observed both in rigorous data and evocative descriptions, enabled him to be lionised by individuals on both sides of that divide; that in his pioneering work on the inter-connectedness of natural ecosystems and on the impact of human actions on those systems, he should be regarded as the founder of the environmental movement. She also is keen to emphasise his influence on others - starting with his almost lifelong friendship with and influence on the work of Goethe. Wulf writes chapters on each of Simon Bolivar, Charles Darwin and Henry Thoreau, cantering on their achievements but at all times seeking for the considerable impact Von Humboldt had on them. In perhaps the only slightly false note in the book, it finishes with more than fifty pages on his seemingly more tangential influence on three lesser known figures whose main achievements were after his death. Overall though this is a fascinating and well written account."
68,038535066X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1241339-clif,5,"Chicago's public radio station, WBEZ, had a program on the statue of Alexander Humboldt in the park named after him, in a neighborhood named after him. The program speculated that not one in a thousand passersby would know who he was. I've no doubt that's true. My only association of the name was with the Humboldt Current that brings cold water up the west coast of South America from Antarctica. With that as background, this book floored me.Humboldt was to the 19th century as Einstein was to the 20th. It's fair to say that everyone knew his name even decades after his death in 1859. He was a powerful influence on Charles Darwin, John Muir and Henry David Thoreau. On the seminal voyage aboard the Beagle that took Darwin around the world, his notes are peppered with ""as Humboldt said..."" whenever something was found that confirmed Humboldt's previous discoveries. Thoreau was a Humboldt devotee.During his lifetime, and he loved life, lectures given by Humboldt were packed, whether in America or Europe. His books were best sellers and he was personally acquainted with everyone who was anyone, from Napoleon (one of the few that didn't like Humboldt) through the royalty of Europe to Simón Bolívar, the liberator of South America, and on down from there. He was a font of knowledge on the natural world, was driven by curiosity and would even at an advanced age rush to attend the lectures of someone who knew something he did not, sitting in an audience of college students furiously taking notes as he listened.He had only one foible - he could not stop talking. Only the most determined could get in a comment, but few wished to do so as it would, but only possibly, interrupt the flow of knowledge they wanted to hear. Single his entire life with never any indication of an attraction to women, he bonded easily with men, forming lifelong friendships and exploring for months on end with a partner.His physical endurance and health were phenomenal. He climbed snow covered mountains with none of the equipment we know today, even above levels where oxygen should be used. As others would fall victim to tropical diseases, Humboldt was up at dawn ready to go. Clouds of mosquitoes for days and nights on end were no deterrent if there was a new plant, animal or rock formation to be examined.Not only did he crave knowledge, he wanted everyone to share in it. His Personal Narrative of the Equinoctial Regions of the New Continent (South America) was devoured by a public as eager to find out what had been found as we today would read the account of a person visiting another solar system. And, speaking of outer space, he took that subject on as well in his quest to tie everything together, writing the multi-volume Cosmos as he neared the end of his life.As Andrea Wulf makes clear in her title, The Invention of Nature, Humboldt was one of the first to come up with the concept of ecosystems, the interconnection of the natural world that allow an environment to thrive if left alone, and change it even to the point of destruction when this or that part is altered. While few of us today know of Humboldt, we live in the conceptual world of nature he created.This book is a wonderful wide-ranging history that covers not only Humboldt's life, but contains brief overviews of the lives and work of Darwin, Thoreau, George Perkins Marsh, Ernst Haeckel and John Muir in relation to Humboldt. Filled with adventure and excitement, Wulf perfectly captures a man to which we are all indebted and one who would be delighted to meet any of us and relate his discoveries.Sad to say, none of his books are in the network of public libraries including the one in my own town."
69,038535066X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7175349-david,5,"Didn't finish before it was due back to the library, but I read enough to be dazzled by Humboldt. First, I must praise this author for writing this book, bringing this once famous and celebrated figure back to our attention. The title is apparently not as hyperbolic as it seems, as her subject really does seem to have given both the public and the scientific community the idea of nature as an interconnected whole. No summary I could offer will do justice to the book, so you will need to read it yourself. And if it is not the kind of book you would read, then at least go to a bookstore or the library and skim enough to get some idea of it, because it is worth knowing about. (Note: yes, this is who Humboldt county in California is named after, and the University in Berlin, and the current in the Pacific Ocean, and many other things besides.)Here's a guy who got Goethe all stirred up, who explored the Amazon and the Andes, loved to get close to an erupting volcano, inspired Simon Bolivar to rebel against Spain, admired the American Revolution but could not understand why his friend Thomas Jefferson did not free the slaves, got Thoreau interested in nature, etc., etc. Seems to have been gay (avant la lettre), as his attachments to other men seem to have been unusual enough to cause his family some concern. Certainly his companions stuck with him through thick and thin, at risk to their lives with some frequency. My favorite is the poor guy who survives fever in the Amazon, crawling along a precarious mountain trail in a howling snowstorm, a hurricane at sea, just for a few examples, only to be berated for not working hard enough to publish their discoveries when they finally get back to Paris. Our hero could wear you out, apparently, not that anyone seemed to mind. And he was enough of a superstar that the King of Prussia kept him at court later in life even though it was no secret that he didn't believe in Monarchy and would support any revolution that might overthrow his patron. Think about that: he didn't worry about pleasing the King, the King worried about keeping him around.The book may seem too thorough to some readers (e.g., me), but when you think about the many volumes written by Humboldt, it's easy to see that she must have felt like this was the short version of the story. So worth checking out! "
70,038535066X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/180643-jim-coughenour,3,"A fine (re)introduction to Humboldt and his prescient ecological view of nature: that everything is connected and that humanity is capable of destroying the world it's been given. Humboldt appears as a brilliant, even heroic, transitional figure between the Enlightenment and the Romantic movement, between the positivism of science and the inwardness of art, between Goethe and Darwin. Wulf is also good at demonstrating his influence on other naturalists, not only Darwin but Thoreau, George Perkins Marsh (new to me), Ernst Haeckel and John Muir.Because I'd just finished reading On the Move: A Life, I couldn't help being reminded of Oliver Sacks, who also stood outside his own profession of neurology to capture the human and artistic dimension of knowledge, creating a new kind of scientific literature in the process. I was also intrigued to find out that Humboldt never married. He claimed his passion was only for science, but he was rarely without the company of another charismatic young man. His equally famous brother, Willem, ""disliked his brother's intense friendships – probably a mixture of jealousy and a concern for what might have seemed the inappropriate nature of these connections."" And finally, to my private embarrassment, I realized I've confused Alexander and Willem my whole life. (Humboldt University in Berlin is named after both of them.)The dark irony is that, although Humboldt was revered his warnings about how humanity was destroying its own environment were largely ignored. What should be obvious to everyone is still the stuff of partisan politics, and the grim conviction deepens that nothing will be done until it is too late, that it is in fact too late already."
71,038535066X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5871422-elena,5,"Andrea Wulf paints an appealing picture of the brilliant Alexander von Humboldt, an Enlightenment titan who climbed the highest mountains he could find with heavy instruments to make precise measurements, not just air pressure, but he had some kind of cyanograph to measure just how blue the sky was at different altitudes. He discussed science with Thomas Jefferson, whom he admired on one level, but AvH was firmly opposed to any form of slavery. He admired the indigenous peoples he met while exploring South America, and reported on the magnificent ruins of ancient American civilizations and the complex languages of the peoples he encountered in the colorful jungles, which he much perfered to his native Berlin. He deplored the degradation of the New World ecology by the mining and cash crops of the Spanish. Wulf did extensive research on his influence on Darwin and the theory of evolution which he anticipated with studies of fossils, on Goethe who put a bit of him into Faust, on Simon Bolivar who discussed concepts of political freedom with him, on Henry David Thoreau who's love of nature was nurtured by reading AvH's books on the interconnected-ness of nature, and on John Muir who read and annotated his books. Wulf found direct connections to show how his love of nature even inspired the Art Deco movement. His fame was universal, his name attached to currents, mountains, counties, cities all across the US and Latin America. It was the anti-German sentiments of World War I, intensified in World War II that cause his fame to be mostly extinguished along with admiration for German science and culture in general. Time to appreciate the man who pushed through legislation in Prussia that any slave, including any American slave, who lands on Prussian soil becomes a free person. "
72,038535066X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6432978-bfisher,4,"Alexander von Humboldt was one of the most prominent scientists of the nineteenth century. When he died in 1859, tens of thousands of mourners marched in his funeral procession. A staggering number of geographical features were named after him in his lifetime. It seems appropriate that the namesake Humboldt River, one of the largest rivers in the Great Basin of North America, disappears from sight in the Humboldt Sinks, much as Humboldt’s reputation has disappeared from modern popular memory.Yet, it is not fitting that Humboldt should be forgotten to our age. Andrea Wulf describes his roles as a founder of biogeography, inventor of isotherms, developer of the concept of ecological systems and the interdependence of life, and as the first scientist to recognize the danger of anthropogenic climate change. He influenced Darwin, Thoreau and John Muir. We recognize and adopt his ideas but have forgotten the person. This book is a useful recovery of the core importance to science and society of Humboldt's work. Unfortunately, in its coverage of Humboldt the scientist, Humboldt the person gets short shrift, aside from a few brief hints. That is my one quibble with this book."
73,038535066X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7283807-ben,1,"Desperately in need of an editor. Perhaps the author could not find enough source material on Humboldt himself. The majority of the book consists of capsule biographies and Wikipedia-level explanations of other people, such as Darwin or Muir. The author bombastically credits everything good to Humboldt. A typical phrasing, repeated dozens if not hundreds of times, goes like, ""Humboldt generously shared his library with X, and despite his own debts supported X financially. X praised Humboldt as 'one of the greatest scientists of his generation.'"" There is very little insight added to the material. The author does not bring any skepticism to the table, and is entirely credulous when it comes to Humboldt. Unfortunately, this means that you can't trust what few conclusions are drawn. I only finished it because I had an audiobook. Not worth reading. "

77,038535066X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/96806543-the-colonial,3,"Alexander von Humboldt’s name can be seen throughout the world’s streets, trails, universities, and rivers, yet the man and his mystique are rarely brought to our actual attention. By the early-nineteenth century, Humboldt had become what today we would call both an Environmentalist and Renaissance Man—as he was a scientist, explorer, naturalist, botanist, and colleague of renowned and like-minded intellectuals of the age. Andrea Wulf weaves all of these traits together in order to discuss Humboldt’s life journey and the groundbreaking ideas that he introduced our world to—some far too ahead of the times for the likes of his contemporaries.The first half of the book appropriately covers Humboldt’s beginnings, from his boyhood and ancestry in Prussia, to his rise in education and esteem in the scientific world. Wulf devotes much attention to Humboldt’s standing in the political world as a whole, where the botanist is doted upon by courtly officials and diplomats from such prosperous world powers as Russia, Great Britain, Spain, and the United States. He is honored by the prestigious Royal Society of London as a foreign member, and throughout his remarkable life he meets the likes of such prominent figures as Joseph Banks, Benjamin Smith Barton, Thomas Jefferson, Benjamin Rush, and a young and upcoming Charles Darwin.Unfortunately, Wulf’s enthusiasm for her subject is too broad in its approach, as she pivots into the second half of the book by focusing on the great men that were influenced by Humboldt—all of which include famous scientists, authors, environmentalists, and inventors. This is collectively balanced out by her engaging and imaginative prose, where she fortunately excels at using her fascination with Humboldt as well as that of nature itself for her inspiration. Wulf majestically explains each and every tour and journey that Humboldt embarked upon, as well as the meetings he held with prominent men of his times:…Humboldt informed Jefferson, where he had collected plants, made astronomical observations, found hieroglyphs of ancient civilizations deep in the rainforest and had amassed important data from the colonial archives of Mexico City. Humboldt also wrote to James Madison, the Secretary of State and Jefferson’s closest political ally, declaring that ‘having witnessed the great spectacle of the majestic Andes and the grandeur of the physical world I intended to enjoy the spectacle of a free people.’ Politics and nature belonged together–an idea that Humboldt would be discussing with the Americans.With almost the final half of the book being dedicated to Thoreau, Darwin, George Perkins Marsh, John Muir, and Ernst Haeckel, the reader unfortunately loses interest on the main subject of Humboldt’s adventurous life—leaving a sense of unfulfillment. It’s apparent that Wulf has so much more to tell on Alexander von Humboldt’s life, which is almost frustrating since the reader is constantly engrossed and intrigued in his story, due to the benefit of her writing style and equal fascination. Apart from the unnecessary segue into like-minded men, there is still much to be gained by the modern reader from reading Wulf’s work on an environmental pioneer and enlightened man of many qualifications and achievements. Maps are provided, a useful “Note on Humboldt’s Publications”, as well as helpful illustrations found throughout the text.

78,038535066X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3007401-biblio-files-takingadayoff,5,"Apparently, in much of Europe, Alexander von Humboldt is as well known as Charles Darwin is to those of us in the United States and Britain. A naturalist and explorer, Humboldt took his upper class education in 18th century Prussia and applied it to becoming a Renaissance man in 19th century Europe and America. Humboldt was especially interested in plant life, but he was an extremely energetic and focused person who also enjoyed studying all forms of life on earth, as well as philosophy, literature and poetry, astronomy, and languages. He loved participating in the frequent salons of the time and became friends with Goethe, and later with Simon Bolivar in his pre-revolutionary days traveling in Europe. He reached out to Thomas Jefferson as a fellow scientist (Jefferson was not only a gentleman farmer, but a scientific farmer as well) and procured an invitation to stay at the President's mansion while he visited Washington, D.C. Later, in Paris, he tried to play diplomat with Napoleon, but was not successful. Still, Napoleon was said to be impressed with his scientific works and to have read Humboldt's books.Humboldt's claim to fame as a scientist is to have been one of the first to see plant life, animal life, the cosmos, geology, everything, as a part of a single ecosystem, rather than as individual and not necessarily connected pieces. This is so basic to our way of thinking today that it seems obvious and not particularly remarkable. But it is as fundamentally different a way of looking at the world as Darwin's idea of natural selection was. Andrea Wulf's biography describes Humboldt's studies, travels, accomplishments -- you feel as if Humboldt would be quite an engaging, if hard to keep up with, fellow. After reading The Invention of Nature, the question that still nagged at me was how I had never learned of this whirlwind before. "
79,038535066X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/241691-kay,4,"“Temperament is destiny,” or so the proverb says, though I have always been suspicious of such broad sweeps of rhetoric. Still, this saying kept echoing through my head as I read this book, for I could not help but wonder: “What makes such a man as Alexander von Humboldt? What motivates him, drives him forward, helps him overcome obstacles, or, perhaps even ultimately, is his very undoing?” It seemed as I read of Humboldt’s life, passions, and seemingly boundless energy, that he must have sprung, almost Athena-like, from his mother’s womb, set from the get-go on a trajectory that would send him around the world in an unceasing round of exploration, research, and writing. Certainly, the advantages of his upbringing and background helped: a stable home, wealth, attentive (if distant) parents, exacting tutors, a library at his disposal. Yet there are other men and women that I can think of, such as the naturalist Alfred Russel Wallace or the explorer Mary Kingsley who had few such advantages, but, like Humboldt, possessed an urge for going, a forward momentum, an insatiable curiosity, and above all, seemingly boundless resources of optimism, courage, and self-reliance. They were, I can’t help but feel, the chosen few, blessed with a rare combination of temperament, intelligence, and energy. It is a magic formula – and, oh, if only I possessed it! The title of this book could well have been “Why Humboldt Matters,” and it’s scarcely a spoiler to reveal that he matters very much, and indeed is perhaps more relevant than ever. Although Humboldt is little thought about or even known about today, in his time he was the most famous scientist in the world - and that was before the term ""scientist"" even existed. It was Humboldt's accounts of his travels in South America and Russia that most captured the public's attention, but among Enlightenment-era and 19th century intellectual circles, his reputation as the authority on a wide range of scientific matters was unquestioned. His vision of nature as an integrated, interconnected and interdependent force, one, furthermore, indifferent to and even damaged by man is what most influenced thinkers of his time, and it is this complex and far-sighted vision which resonates today, perhaps now more than ever in the face of impending environmental threats.Wulf's explanation of why Humboldt fell into relative obscurity during the 20th century, particularly in the U.S.A., wasn't entirely convincing. She cites anti-German sentiment in the wake of the First World War, the fragmentation of science into specialized fields, and the fact that ""Humboldt is not known for a single fact or a discovery but for his worldview. His vision of nature has passed into our consciousness as if by osmosis."" But I think another reason lies within the pages of Wulf's book: Humboldt was the original ""torch bearer,"" but that torch has been taken up by many, some of whom Wulf devotes chapters to, such as Charles Darwin and John Muir. These figures, rather than Humboldt, occupy a larger place in the current public imagination. However, in contemplating Humboldt's scientific eclipse, once again I fell to musing about our fickleness in choosing heroes. Charles Darwin, hero (or blasphemer, depending on your perspective) is universally known if perhaps less than universally understood. (Hence the “blasphemer” part, one could argue.) His less-well-heeled contemporary, Alfred Russel Wallace, simultaneous and independent formulator of the theory of natural selection, while more recently enjoying a bit of an upswing, is still a relative unknown. (And can you guess which of the two is a personal hero? Corr-rect! Wallace it is!) Alfred Einstein, virtually a pop star in the scientific firmament, is but one very bright star in a constellation of equally impressive luminaries – Niels Bohr, Max Planck, Ernest Rutherford, Paul Dirac, James Clerk Maxwell – but it is Einstein who inhabits the popular imagination as the preeminent scientist of all time. (Though many will, of course, at least have a hazy idea, as I do, that Schrödinger and a cat also come into play somewhere.) Yet, after living for years with a physicist, I can confidently state that this much is true: No genius exists in splendid isolation. Each is perched on the shoulders of genii who preceded him. Or her. And so it unquestionably was with Humboldt, whose influences included Johann Wolfgang von Goethe, Captain Cook, Joseph Banks, Immanuel Kant, and indeed the very temper of the Age of Enlightenment. Yet Wulf’s biography focuses primarily on how Humboldt influenced his contemporaries and subsequent generations.  The most prominent of Humboldt’s followers (and that’s not too strong a term, really), was Darwin, who arguably would never have made that voyage on  The Beagle had he not been inspired by Humboldt’s account of his South American travels. Wulf devotes a chapter each to Darwin and four others who fell under Humboldt’s spell: Henry David Thoreau, George Perkins Marsh, Ernst Haeckel, and John Muir. Some of these Humboldtiphiles (Darwin, Thoreau, Muir), I knew something about, though admittedly it seems I knew less about Thoreau than I had thought, while of the remaining two, Marsh and Haeckel, I knew nothing. The chapter on Haeckel I particularly enjoyed, for I have a longstanding interest in Art Nouveau and its various architectural offshoots, and I immediately perceived how Haeckel’s wonderful fusion of art and science became the wellspring for many artists in the new (20th) century. Look at Gaudi’s Casa Batlló and then look at Haeckel’s illustrations of radiolarians (microscopic sea creatures) and the similarities are almost breathtaking. Why, that famous unfinished cathedral in Barcelona is but a radiolarian writ large!In short, I came away not just with a very good idea of Humboldt’s life after reading The Invention of Nature, but also was treated to five succinct mini-biographies of his most influential acolytes. Looking over that group provides a good sense of how all-encompassing Humboldt’s polymath grasp was: he influenced natural scientists, philosopher poets, conservationists, preservationists, earth scientists, artists, and even politicians and kings. Oh, and to add a bit more to this grandiose mix, Humboldt’s friends and contemporaries included the likes of Thomas Jefferson, Simon Bolivar, Joseph Hooker, and practically the entire scientific and intellectual elite of his age, with whom he maintained a voluminous correspondence.But again….that energy! Reading of Humboldt’s travels, experiments, indefatigable correspondence, and the breadth of his expertise practically made my head spin. Wulf makes the point – repeatedly – that perhaps Humboldt’s most singular legacy was his ability to synthesize information from areas which, today, are broken into discrete fields, such as climatology, volcanology, botany, biology, geology, meteorology, seismology, and paleontology, just to name a few. Those fields were all given a hearty kick-start by Humboldt’s grand synthesis, his Cosmos. It is this great overarching view of nature that inspired those that followed. Reading (but, admittedly, not entirely comprehending) how Humboldt achieved this was inspirational. A couple of final notes: firstly, the illustrations in the book were a delight. May I confess how much I enjoy well-selected (and nicely rendered) illustrations? I sometimes feel a little jolt of pleasure whenever I turn the page to find one. The chapter on Haeckel, for example, cried out for some of his radiolarian drawings. And there they were! Along with some equally fetching Medusae. Another not entirely unexpected joy was Wulf’s style. She has one! That is to say, I got a sense of 
her
 from reading this book, but she never intruded upon the subject, which always remained in focus. While it’s clear that Wulf must have loved researching and writing about Humboldt, she judiciously organized the material and trimmed her narrative, then wrote it in a lively yet elegant style that made me think, on the whole, that I would rather enjoy meeting this author. At any rate, I certainly want to read more of her work. "

81,038535066X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/18695911-daniel-chaikin,4,"It was interesting this evening, as I was driving home and listening to Michael Pollan read his latest book, to hear him refer to this book as if it were a major inspiration for him. Humboldt's view of nature as one entire interconnected thing. It is a beautiful concept, one he made at length and, as Wulf shows, elegantly and poetically. Darwin, who eventually met Humboldt, found Humboldt's writing inspirational for his scientific view of nature. Henry Thoreau devoured his writing, and found inspiration of his poetic view of the nature around his small pond. And John Muir, so enraptured he set off for Cuba and South America until he learned the tropical climates made him ill, found in Humboldt an inspiration for the environmental movement. And, I should mention, Simon Bolivar not only found in Humboldt a South American natural identity he raved about, but also used Humboldt's maps in his military campaigns. Wulf follows all these threads and more, in great detail. She rushes headlong through narratives, making them something of a roller coaster ride, and she spends time at the end wondering why the contemporary English speaking world has practically forgotten who Humboldt was or why anyone cares. What did he accomplish anyway, other than create some of the first detailed maps in a few hard to reach parts of South America? He was, it seems, primarily and powerfully, an inspiration. OK, he also invented the idea of nature. Well, maybe. I mean, Wulf makes the claim, over and over again, but it's a claim that reveals a major weakness in the book that bothered me a lot. She presents, ultimately, a very narrow in focus. So, yes, no question, Humboldt has a thought-provoking unified view on nature. But, was he the first? What was the intellectual world around him thinking, and what were the foundations? Is it possible nature as a unified thing was brought up before? Ever? by anyone? Wulf doesn't do context well, or didn't here. Really, mainly what she does is report stories in lengthy but also abbreviated forms. I liked her book and I really liked learning about Humbolt. It's not a perfect work, but it's not like the early 19th century intellectual world is an easy one to capture. So, flawed but still recommended, and who knows, you might be blown away like Michael Pollan.-----------------------------------------------60.

82,038535066X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/67736000-elizabeth-a-g,5,"Andrea Wulf's The Invention of Nature: Alexander von Humboldt's New World is an enjoyable, well-written and researched exploration of one man's vision of the world around him and how his restless spirit and determination gave us a deep appreciation of nature and presented the idea connectedness of all things organic and inorganic. Alexander von Humboldt is little remembered today and this book sheds a light on the scientist, ecologist. educator, and humanist who influenced later, better known naturalists like Darwin, Thoreau, George Perkins Marsh, Ernst Haeckel, and John Muir. Humboldt believed in the power of education and his writings and books were aimed toward a general audience rather than to specifically the scientific community. In fact he sought to show how nature is a living organism and that there is unity in scientific thought and the emotional response to nature that is expressed in poetry, art and music. He is also one of the first to warn that the activities of man in his commercial pursuits are bringing about the destruction of forests and creating climate change. In this book Wulf describes Humboldt's influence on future environmentalists and goes into some detail on these others...my only issue that perhaps the author could have shortened this section of the book by more of a summarization rather such detail (the subjects for a future book, perhaps). The epilogue of the book is excellent."

About half the book is padded with simplistic one chapter biopics of people purported to have been strongly influenced by Humboldt, often to an extent that is hard to credit. So according to Wulf: Goethe modelled Faust on Humboldt; Darwin would not have travelled on the Beagle and eventually developed evolutionary theory; John Muir wouldn't have become a environmentalist and saved the redwoods; Heckel wouldn't have created art that directly lead to Art Nouveau; and Bolívar wouldn't have become a revolutionary leading to the decolonization of Spain in Latin America. Wulf also repeatedly credits him with discovering climate change, centuries before it came to conscious awareness here, despite no evidence that this is true. Near the end of the book, she credits his current day obscurity (which is not really true) from a reaction against all things German after the 2nd World War, but if this was really correct, why are so many other German scientists and writers remembered and him not? Perhaps it is more to do with him never creating a lasting advance in knowledge via synthesis (a la Darwin).A great opportunity that is wasted by lack of in depth research and a critical appraisal of Humboldt's life.2-stars."
84,038535066X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/76176316-alistair-mackay,4,"The most famous man you’ve never heard of. Alexander Von Humboldt was a superstar explorer, botanist, geologist, naturalist. He inspired Charles Darwin and Henry David Thoreau. He was friends with Simon Bolivar. He invented the thermal lines on maps and came up with the idea of ecosystems and climate zones. He was a scientist before that was a word, and a naturalist before all the different disciplines of nature split into their factions. He believed nature needed to be understood with facts and poetry, felt as well as experienced. And he predicted climate change and deforestation... in the 1790s. I don’t usually enjoy biographies but I loved this book. It’s well-researched and well written. It’s a fascinating look at the adventures and contributions of a truly great man, and the grandfather of the environmental movement. He was the most famous man in the world at one point, and he’s been lost to history only because of 20th Century anti-German sentiment. Glad I read this and learnt about Humboldt. We owe him so much.

I will boldly say this book is my favorite book of 2015 and I plan on recommending it to everyone I know. Part of the delight is that I had no knowledge of Humboldt before reading this book and I was amazed to learn how influential and inspiring he was to people in the 18th and 19th centuries. With direct links to American founding fathers, the Romantic Literature movement, and Simon Bolivar's fight for independence in South America, and Charles Darwin Humboldt is seed that many modern ideas are sprung from. Although I read a library copy of this book I promptly went out and bought my own personal copy because it's a book I will treasure for years to come."

90,038535066X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3409532-april-does-feral-sometimes,4,"The book 'The Invention of Nature' is fascinating. It is more than a biography of Alexander Von Humboldt (1769-1859), who can be described as a polymath genius whose enthusiasm for travel and nature was as momentous for the development of as many branches of science that Albert Einstein (1879-1955) was because of his interest in physics. Yet, I have never heard of him until I read this book.Some early Western 19th-century proto-scientists labored all of their life in bleak obscurity until only after their deaths being recognized as major scientific brains and discoverers; others announced their work to newly created scientific societies only to be met with withering scorn. Some inventors were clearly crackpots with one great idea while others were intelligent driven members of respectable aristocrat families and upper-class merchants. (Almost all of these Great Men of Science upset their parents by refusing to study law or medicine in university! Humboldt was one of these children of disappointed parents. I have read a few other science histories, and I have noticed that almost all of these early scientists had parents hoping for a son who would become a doctor or lawyer. Just saying.)However, Humboldt became famous early in his lifetime and all doors were open to him. He met already famous people eager to speak with him, such as President Thomas Jefferson. Others who desired to call him friend went on to illustrious (and nefarious) careers as famous scientists in their own right such as Charles Darwin, well-known writers such as Henry David Thoreau, and Kings, Emperors and Prime Ministers such as Friedrich Wilhelm IV and George Canning, as well as leaders of political revolutions overthrowing those before-mentioned Kings and Emperors such as Simón Bolívar. Humboldt himself was a liberal and he supported the overthrow of the aristocracy, but his income primarily was from a pension paid by two Prussian kings after he went through his own inheritance. He obviously was charismatic, moving easily between many different cultures and social classes, from South America to Europe to Russia.After returning from a five-year exploration of South America with tens of thousands of astronomical, geological and meteorological observations and specimens, he published his first book, 'Essay on the Geography of Plants' at age 32, dedicating it to Johann Wolfgang Goethe, his fellow polymath and best friend (after his brother Wilhelm von Humboldt, who founded the University of Berlin after a career as the Prussian ambassador to Vienna and Britain). The book combined with his achievements and personality made him a famous man, perhaps the most famous respected natural scientist in the world. However, full of energy, wanderlust and curiosity, Humboldt moved on to more explorations crossing over the frontlines of many European wars between France, Prussia, Britain, and Spain, and maneuvering through countries on three continents which were undergoing political revolutions, observing volcano eruptions while mountain climbing without oxygen tanks (yes, he and his companions fainted occasionally) enduring nasty mosquitos, while exposing and warning the public of the dreadful environmental destruction of earth wherever men used the land for agriculture, mining and lumber.Humboldt lived to the age of 89, still receiving famous visitors and writing thousands of letters a month up to his death. His books on the natural sciences, illustrated with his own and other explorers' beautiful art and drawings, inspired Darwin, Thoreau, Ernst Haeckel, John Muir, to name a few. Rivers, mountains, towns and other landmarks were named after him, and he is mentioned in thousands of famous novels. Yet most Americans today have never heard of him, probably because of World War I and WWII having been fought against Germany as an enemy of the United States. I think we should bring this man back into the spotlight and make him a famous hero scientist again. This book is an excellent start.Below I've included some Wikipedia links about the early naturalists, Humboldt, and many of the famous intellectuals, writers and scientists he inspired in later centuries, in hope that these thumbnail histories will convince you, gentle reader, to pick up this book:http://www.ranker.com/list/notable-na...https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alexa...https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kosmo...https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Georg...https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Man_a...https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ernst...https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kunst...https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_..."

HOLY MOLY! WOW! What an awesome book! Just reading it made me happy to be alive! Really! It was a wonderful break from the dreary procession of bad news parading out of every media orifice! (Note to self: improve your imagery.) I neglected other self-improving projects to read this book, and then was sad when I finished it! Worthy of all awards and accolades! The world would be a better place if everyone was forced to read it, at gunpoint if necessary! Don't just stand (or sit) there, go out and get a copy right away!I love narratives about news events, scandals, and personalities that once famous, but now forgotten. This is one of them, of a man known by everyone when living, celebrated, called without irony the greatest man who had ever lived, sought out by tedious rich people and aristocrats, pestered for autographs, and recipient of mountains of admiring old-school paper letters. Intrepid and death-defying explorer, partisan of liberty, deplorer of slavery and cruelty, widely-admired prose stylist, polyglot, polymath. Honored by having towns, counties, and other jurisdictions named after him. Further honored by having a Pacific Ocean current named after him and, even cooler still, also a critter described by Wikipedia as a ""large predatory squid"". His books were anticipated with an enthusiasm which today, sadly, only occurs with certain entries in the ""Young Adult"" market. Pirated translations of his works were rushed to market to satisfy bottomless demand. He was even -- dare I say it? -- the Werner Herzog of his age (ok, yes, Humboldt was Prussian and Herzog Bavarian, but let's not nitpick). As young men, both were driven by some inner demon to seek out the most pestilential, soggy, disease-ridden, and predator-filled sections of inner South America, and came back to ""civilization"", such as it is, with precious insights and striking images, which changed the way people looked at the world. When older, both continued to push into far corners of the world (including, in both cases, Siberia) at a time of life when most of us find it increasingly difficult to get out of bed.Humboldt actually had a life that was both exciting and well-documented, so writing about him was a little like shooting fish in barrel. I don't wish to belittle the author's achievement: the narrative always moves along at an entertaining clip, even during those periods when Humboldt had to spend some time toadying up to various Kaisers in order to keep the old mazuma rolling in. I also enjoyed the last few chapters, which switched tone from standard biography of one man to mini chapter-long biographies of various men (including Simon Bolivar, Charles Darwin, Henry David Thoreau, and John Muir), with a concentration on how Humboldt changed the lives and directions of their thoughts. The point, I believe, was that, even though his name is no longer on everybody's lips, Humboldt is still very much with us.To repeat: delightful. Read it.The only thing that I didn't like about this book was the realization at the conclusion that, no matter what achievements I, uh, achieve with the balance of my life, I will never, ever, have a large predatory squid named after me.

92,038535066X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6938150-marie-paule,5,"When in Berlin a few years ago, I came by the magnificent building of the Humboldt University. And I know that quite a few plants are named '... humboldtiensis'. Although I have a PhD in Science I knew nothing more about Alexander von Humboldt. What a shame. On Sep 14, 1869, the 100th birthday of this brilliant man, there were celebrations all over the world: Europe, Africa, Australia and the America's. More than 100 years later, he seems to be forgotten. What a life he has led. In his younger years, he became a lifetime friend of Goethe, who, besides being a poet, was very interested in botanics and geology. They were both interested in the dualism between the external and internal world (Kant and his 'Kritik der reinen Vernunft'). Is the tree in my garden a real tree, or my idea of a tree? Humboldt gradually shifted from pure empirical research towards his own interpretation of nature: he mixed detailed scientific facts with the emotional reactions they invoked. He thought a great deal about 'Life'. A machine can be taken apart and reassembled, but you can't do this with an animal. Why? Von Humboldt’s most important journey was a 5 year-trip through South America. There, he developed the first concept of 'ecosystems' (long before we knew this particular word), explaining that geology, climate, micro-organisms, plants and animals all influence each other. When he travelled through the plains of Los llanos in Venezuela in 1800 (!), he warned for the destructive effects of human activity (large scale agriculture of commercial crops, mining, ...) on the ecosystems. At the same time, he pointed out that the overexploitation of local ecosystems had disastrous effects on the human population as well: slavery, unhealthy working conditions, a shortage of local healthy foods, exploitation of large groups of have-nots by the happy few….. Sounds familiar, no?Does it surprise you that Alexander von Humboldt became one of the best liftetime friends of Simon Bolivar, who fought to liberate South America from its Spanish colonists? All through his live, von Humboldt fought against slavery. He so longed to visit India, but the British government denied him a passport, because they knew how he felt about slavery and he was not willing to compromise…. For the British, he remained a dangerous anti-colonialist actor. Later in life, he made a great journey through Russia, all the way to Mongolia. He held his 60th birthday party in … the pharmacy of Lenin’s grandfather. After his return from South America, von Humboldt lived in Paris and in London, where he met the famous scientists of his time. He inspired a lot of scientists and writers of his time, among others Charles Darwin, Henry David Thoreau, George Perkin Marsh, Ernst Haeckel and John Muir. Indeed, what a life and what a talent… At the end of his life, von Humboldt wrote his magnum opus ‘Kosmos’: an overview of his own and other scientific findings, but above all, his opinion about the correlations and relationships between different scientific theories, and the interrelation between science, art and sociology. For von Humboldt, there were no boundaries between scientific domains or between science and humanities. In short: von Humboldt was a scientist who was far ahead of his time and who remains a lighting example for us all."

94,038535066X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4070288-jo,4,The first 2/3 of this book are 5 star material. Wulf vividly depicts Humboldt's travels and his personality. He is a fascinating subject. The last sections really suffers in comparison. Her choice of figures to investigate his legacy through their biography is both too focused and too limited to be truly effective. While I understand her desire to dive deep into Humboldt's influence shoehorning in 5 mini bios of other figures into the end of the book moves the book away from its true center. Leaving Humboldt behind made me want to throw myself on the ground in the middle of the town square and yell about things breaking per my hero AvH.
95,038535066X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4739424-mal-warwick,5,"He was the most famous man in the world, and more places around the world are named after him than anyone else. To many of the giants of his time — Johann Wolfgang von Goethe, Thomas Jefferson, Simon Bolivar, Charles Darwin, Henry David Thoreau — he was a colossus whose genius overshadowed their own. He was the first to describe the web of life on Earth, foreshadowing James Lovelock’s Gaia hypothesis, and the first to describe the impact of human activity on the world’s climate. His books, which read like poetry, “were so popular that people bribed booksellers to be the first to receive copies.” Eleven years after his death at age 89, the centennial of his birth was observed by hundreds of thousands of people in huge celebrations around the world.Chances are, you’ve never heard of him.His name was Alexander von Humboldt, and he died in 1859. He had first described climate change in 1800. He “gave us his concept of nature itself.”Andrea Wulf’s engrossing new biography, The Invention of Nature, brings this extraordinary man into the spotlight again after a century and a half. It’s about time. His may well have been one of the finest minds in human history.Humboldt, born into a prosperous family of Prussian aristocrats shortly after the American Civil War, rebelled against the constraints on his life and set out on his own unique path. Though he became best known as a naturalist, world traveler, and author, his interests reached into a far wider range of human endeavor, and Cosmos, the multi-volume book he began to write at the age of sixty-five, encompassed virtually the whole of human knowledge, from botany, geology, and zoology to astronomy, philosophy, and, in effect, the new science he invented: ecology. (Though he didn’t invent that term, his work was the inspiration for the man who did later in the nineteenth century.)As Wulf notes, “Humboldt took his readers from outer space to earth, and then from the surface of the planet into its inner core. He discussed comets, the Milky Way and the solar system as well as terrestrial magnetism, volcanoes and the snow line of mountains. He wrote about the migration of the human species, about plants and animals and the microscopic organisms that live in stagnant water or on the weathered surface of rocks.” Never before, and never since (to the best of my knowledge), has a single individual mastered so many fields of inquiry so successfully that his contemporaries regarded him as a force of nature. And, in an age when most of humanity lived in thrall to organized religion, Humboldt didn’t once mention God in all the many thousands of pages of his books. Instead, he spoke of a “wonderful web of organic life.”Wulf’s biography of this astonishing man is by no means unreservedly positive. She describes the shortcomings of his personality in embarrassing detail: his tendency to talk nonstop at a rapid rate for hours without permitting interruptions of any kind, regardless of the stature of his listeners; his seeming inability to understand the feelings of others and to show empathy for their pain; his venomous gossiping; and his inability to accept criticism. Alexander von Humboldt was not a nice man.Andrea Wulf is an historian and writer who lives in Britain. The Invention of Nature is her fifth book."
96,038535066X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/93114967-barbara,4,"I had some familiarity with von Humboldt before reading Andrea Wulf's book - intrepid young explorer of South America, well known in his time, ocean currents and rivers named for him, information source for Thomas Jefferson about Spanish colonial America. Obviously, an interesting guy, so when I saw an audio copy of The Invention of Nature: Alexander von Humboldt's New World on sale, I grabbed it. Turned out to be a good decision on my part. Von Humboldt was so much more than just that adventurous young man I'd heard of, and Wulf does an excellent job of filling out the picture and his impact.During that extended exploration of South America 200 years ago, while ranging through much of modern day Venezuela, Columbia, Ecuador and Peru, von Humboldt developed concepts of nature, climate and ecology that we take as ""new"" in the late 20th/early 21st centuries. He determined, for instance, that the drop in the level of Lake Valencia was tied to the destruction of the surrounding forest to clear land for farming. He made the connection that the absence of the trees dramatically reduced the ability of the land to retain water. While climbing Mt. Chimborazo in the Andes he developed the concept of altitude-based climate zones that are consistent around the globe. Comparing plants he found on the South American Atlantic coast with those growing on the African Atlantic coast, he intuited that the two land masses must once have been one.These were not simply casual observations for von Humboldt; after returning to Europe he spent the rest of his life as a scientist and author, successfully seeking out the data to support his theories. It's impossible here to summarize his many brilliant insights, but as one example, his perceptions of the devastating outcomes of human's impact on the natural world were prescient of the reality we experience today. Through his writings he influenced many key thinkers of the 19th century, including Darwin, Thoreau and Muir.In truth, I found the biographical information about those scientists and naturalists who built their own theories on his foundations to be more lengthy than necessary, and the latter part of the book dragged a bit for that reason. But overall, reading the story of von Humboldt, a polymath with the ability to pull together what he observed in multiple scientific fields to develop comprehensive theories, was time well spent. He deserves more recognition today."
97,038535066X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/35482263-gumble-s-yard,4,"Alexander Von Humboldt ... was one of the last polymaths, and died at a time when scientific disciplines were hardening into tightly fenced and more specialised fields. Consequently his more holistic approach - a scientific method that included art, history, poetry and politics alongside hard data - has fallen out of favour ..... One of [his] greatest achievements had been to make science accessible and popular ......... in a world where we draw a sharp line between the sciences and the arts, between he subjective and the objective, Humboldt's insight that we can only truly understand nature by using our imaginations makes him a visionaryAward winning biography of Alexander Von Humboldt, of who I was previously familiar from the fictional biography Measuring the World. Wulf ksets out to show that: he was a true polymath, perhaps the last to really range across all scientific disciplines; that at a time when science was becoming increasingly focused on classifications he remained able to see the big picture both across as well as within scientific disciplines; that at a time when romantic poets and data driven scientists were starting to grow in mutual incomprehension, his method of observing and describing nature in person and in capturing what he observed both in rigorous data and evocative descriptions, enabled him to be lionised by individuals on both sides of that divide; that in his pioneering work on the inter-connectedness of natural ecosystems and on the impact of human actions on those systems, he should be regarded as the founder of the environmental movement. She also is keen to emphasise his influence on others - starting with his almost lifelong friendship with and influence on the work of Goethe. Wulf writes chapters on each of Simon Bolivar, Charles Darwin and Henry Thoreau, cantering on their achievements but at all times seeking for the considerable impact Von Humboldt had on them. In perhaps the only slightly false note in the book, it finishes with more than fifty pages on his seemingly more tangential influence on three lesser known figures whose main achievements were after his death. Overall though this is a fascinating and well written account."
98,038535066X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1241339-clif,5,"Chicago's public radio station, WBEZ, had a program on the statue of Alexander Humboldt in the park named after him, in a neighborhood named after him. The program speculated that not one in a thousand passersby would know who he was. I've no doubt that's true. My only association of the name was with the Humboldt Current that brings cold water up the west coast of South America from Antarctica. With that as background, this book floored me.Humboldt was to the 19th century as Einstein was to the 20th. It's fair to say that everyone knew his name even decades after his death in 1859. He was a powerful influence on Charles Darwin, John Muir and Henry David Thoreau. On the seminal voyage aboard the Beagle that took Darwin around the world, his notes are peppered with ""as Humboldt said..."" whenever something was found that confirmed Humboldt's previous discoveries. Thoreau was a Humboldt devotee.During his lifetime, and he loved life, lectures given by Humboldt were packed, whether in America or Europe. His books were best sellers and he was personally acquainted with everyone who was anyone, from Napoleon (one of the few that didn't like Humboldt) through the royalty of Europe to Simón Bolívar, the liberator of South America, and on down from there. He was a font of knowledge on the natural world, was driven by curiosity and would even at an advanced age rush to attend the lectures of someone who knew something he did not, sitting in an audience of college students furiously taking notes as he listened.He had only one foible - he could not stop talking. Only the most determined could get in a comment, but few wished to do so as it would, but only possibly, interrupt the flow of knowledge they wanted to hear. Single his entire life with never any indication of an attraction to women, he bonded easily with men, forming lifelong friendships and exploring for months on end with a partner.His physical endurance and health were phenomenal. He climbed snow covered mountains with none of the equipment we know today, even above levels where oxygen should be used. As others would fall victim to tropical diseases, Humboldt was up at dawn ready to go. Clouds of mosquitoes for days and nights on end were no deterrent if there was a new plant, animal or rock formation to be examined.Not only did he crave knowledge, he wanted everyone to share in it. His Personal Narrative of the Equinoctial Regions of the New Continent (South America) was devoured by a public as eager to find out what had been found as we today would read the account of a person visiting another solar system. And, speaking of outer space, he took that subject on as well in his quest to tie everything together, writing the multi-volume Cosmos as he neared the end of his life.As Andrea Wulf makes clear in her title, The Invention of Nature, Humboldt was one of the first to come up with the concept of ecosystems, the interconnection of the natural world that allow an environment to thrive if left alone, and change it even to the point of destruction when this or that part is altered. While few of us today know of Humboldt, we live in the conceptual world of nature he created.This book is a wonderful wide-ranging history that covers not only Humboldt's life, but contains brief overviews of the lives and work of Darwin, Thoreau, George Perkins Marsh, Ernst Haeckel and John Muir in relation to Humboldt. Filled with adventure and excitement, Wulf perfectly captures a man to which we are all indebted and one who would be delighted to meet any of us and relate his discoveries.Sad to say, none of his books are in the network of public libraries including the one in my own town."
99,038535066X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7175349-david,5,"Didn't finish before it was due back to the library, but I read enough to be dazzled by Humboldt. First, I must praise this author for writing this book, bringing this once famous and celebrated figure back to our attention. The title is apparently not as hyperbolic as it seems, as her subject really does seem to have given both the public and the scientific community the idea of nature as an interconnected whole. No summary I could offer will do justice to the book, so you will need to read it yourself. And if it is not the kind of book you would read, then at least go to a bookstore or the library and skim enough to get some idea of it, because it is worth knowing about. (Note: yes, this is who Humboldt county in California is named after, and the University in Berlin, and the current in the Pacific Ocean, and many other things besides.)Here's a guy who got Goethe all stirred up, who explored the Amazon and the Andes, loved to get close to an erupting volcano, inspired Simon Bolivar to rebel against Spain, admired the American Revolution but could not understand why his friend Thomas Jefferson did not free the slaves, got Thoreau interested in nature, etc., etc. Seems to have been gay (avant la lettre), as his attachments to other men seem to have been unusual enough to cause his family some concern. Certainly his companions stuck with him through thick and thin, at risk to their lives with some frequency. My favorite is the poor guy who survives fever in the Amazon, crawling along a precarious mountain trail in a howling snowstorm, a hurricane at sea, just for a few examples, only to be berated for not working hard enough to publish their discoveries when they finally get back to Paris. Our hero could wear you out, apparently, not that anyone seemed to mind. And he was enough of a superstar that the King of Prussia kept him at court later in life even though it was no secret that he didn't believe in Monarchy and would support any revolution that might overthrow his patron. Think about that: he didn't worry about pleasing the King, the King worried about keeping him around.The book may seem too thorough to some readers (e.g., me), but when you think about the many volumes written by Humboldt, it's easy to see that she must have felt like this was the short version of the story. So worth checking out! "
100,038535066X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/180643-jim-coughenour,3,"A fine (re)introduction to Humboldt and his prescient ecological view of nature: that everything is connected and that humanity is capable of destroying the world it's been given. Humboldt appears as a brilliant, even heroic, transitional figure between the Enlightenment and the Romantic movement, between the positivism of science and the inwardness of art, between Goethe and Darwin. Wulf is also good at demonstrating his influence on other naturalists, not only Darwin but Thoreau, George Perkins Marsh (new to me), Ernst Haeckel and John Muir.Because I'd just finished reading On the Move: A Life, I couldn't help being reminded of Oliver Sacks, who also stood outside his own profession of neurology to capture the human and artistic dimension of knowledge, creating a new kind of scientific literature in the process. I was also intrigued to find out that Humboldt never married. He claimed his passion was only for science, but he was rarely without the company of another charismatic young man. His equally famous brother, Willem, ""disliked his brother's intense friendships – probably a mixture of jealousy and a concern for what might have seemed the inappropriate nature of these connections."" And finally, to my private embarrassment, I realized I've confused Alexander and Willem my whole life. (Humboldt University in Berlin is named after both of them.)The dark irony is that, although Humboldt was revered his warnings about how humanity was destroying its own environment were largely ignored. What should be obvious to everyone is still the stuff of partisan politics, and the grim conviction deepens that nothing will be done until it is too late, that it is in fact too late already."
101,038535066X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5871422-elena,5,"Andrea Wulf paints an appealing picture of the brilliant Alexander von Humboldt, an Enlightenment titan who climbed the highest mountains he could find with heavy instruments to make precise measurements, not just air pressure, but he had some kind of cyanograph to measure just how blue the sky was at different altitudes. He discussed science with Thomas Jefferson, whom he admired on one level, but AvH was firmly opposed to any form of slavery. He admired the indigenous peoples he met while exploring South America, and reported on the magnificent ruins of ancient American civilizations and the complex languages of the peoples he encountered in the colorful jungles, which he much perfered to his native Berlin. He deplored the degradation of the New World ecology by the mining and cash crops of the Spanish. Wulf did extensive research on his influence on Darwin and the theory of evolution which he anticipated with studies of fossils, on Goethe who put a bit of him into Faust, on Simon Bolivar who discussed concepts of political freedom with him, on Henry David Thoreau who's love of nature was nurtured by reading AvH's books on the interconnected-ness of nature, and on John Muir who read and annotated his books. Wulf found direct connections to show how his love of nature even inspired the Art Deco movement. His fame was universal, his name attached to currents, mountains, counties, cities all across the US and Latin America. It was the anti-German sentiments of World War I, intensified in World War II that cause his fame to be mostly extinguished along with admiration for German science and culture in general. Time to appreciate the man who pushed through legislation in Prussia that any slave, including any American slave, who lands on Prussian soil becomes a free person. "
102,038535066X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6432978-bfisher,4,"Alexander von Humboldt was one of the most prominent scientists of the nineteenth century. When he died in 1859, tens of thousands of mourners marched in his funeral procession. A staggering number of geographical features were named after him in his lifetime. It seems appropriate that the namesake Humboldt River, one of the largest rivers in the Great Basin of North America, disappears from sight in the Humboldt Sinks, much as Humboldt’s reputation has disappeared from modern popular memory.Yet, it is not fitting that Humboldt should be forgotten to our age. Andrea Wulf describes his roles as a founder of biogeography, inventor of isotherms, developer of the concept of ecological systems and the interdependence of life, and as the first scientist to recognize the danger of anthropogenic climate change. He influenced Darwin, Thoreau and John Muir. We recognize and adopt his ideas but have forgotten the person. This book is a useful recovery of the core importance to science and society of Humboldt's work. Unfortunately, in its coverage of Humboldt the scientist, Humboldt the person gets short shrift, aside from a few brief hints. That is my one quibble with this book."
103,038535066X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7283807-ben,1,"Desperately in need of an editor. Perhaps the author could not find enough source material on Humboldt himself. The majority of the book consists of capsule biographies and Wikipedia-level explanations of other people, such as Darwin or Muir. The author bombastically credits everything good to Humboldt. A typical phrasing, repeated dozens if not hundreds of times, goes like, ""Humboldt generously shared his library with X, and despite his own debts supported X financially. X praised Humboldt as 'one of the greatest scientists of his generation.'"" There is very little insight added to the material. The author does not bring any skepticism to the table, and is entirely credulous when it comes to Humboldt. Unfortunately, this means that you can't trust what few conclusions are drawn. I only finished it because I had an audiobook. Not worth reading. "
104,038535066X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/18845147-gill,4,"This is a well written, comprehensive account of the life of Alexander von Humboldt, and his influences and influence. I found it an interesting read, and the specialist sections clearly explained. I found the section on his links with Simon Bolívar especially interesting. Well done to Andrea Wulf for introducing a man who was so important in his own time to a present day audience."

Humboldt's legacy of scientific inquiry has style of writing has impacted generations of scientist, writers and readers all around the world. His numerous works and lectures are still revelant as the world faces a global environmental crossroads. I highly encourage readers to pick up this outstanding work."
107,038535066X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/96806543-the-colonial,3,"Alexander von Humboldt’s name can be seen throughout the world’s streets, trails, universities, and rivers, yet the man and his mystique are rarely brought to our actual attention. By the early-nineteenth century, Humboldt had become what today we would call both an Environmentalist and Renaissance Man—as he was a scientist, explorer, naturalist, botanist, and colleague of renowned and like-minded intellectuals of the age. Andrea Wulf weaves all of these traits together in order to discuss Humboldt’s life journey and the groundbreaking ideas that he introduced our world to—some far too ahead of the times for the likes of his contemporaries.The first half of the book appropriately covers Humboldt’s beginnings, from his boyhood and ancestry in Prussia, to his rise in education and esteem in the scientific world. Wulf devotes much attention to Humboldt’s standing in the political world as a whole, where the botanist is doted upon by courtly officials and diplomats from such prosperous world powers as Russia, Great Britain, Spain, and the United States. He is honored by the prestigious Royal Society of London as a foreign member, and throughout his remarkable life he meets the likes of such prominent figures as Joseph Banks, Benjamin Smith Barton, Thomas Jefferson, Benjamin Rush, and a young and upcoming Charles Darwin.Unfortunately, Wulf’s enthusiasm for her subject is too broad in its approach, as she pivots into the second half of the book by focusing on the great men that were influenced by Humboldt—all of which include famous scientists, authors, environmentalists, and inventors. This is collectively balanced out by her engaging and imaginative prose, where she fortunately excels at using her fascination with Humboldt as well as that of nature itself for her inspiration. Wulf majestically explains each and every tour and journey that Humboldt embarked upon, as well as the meetings he held with prominent men of his times:…Humboldt informed Jefferson, where he had collected plants, made astronomical observations, found hieroglyphs of ancient civilizations deep in the rainforest and had amassed important data from the colonial archives of Mexico City. Humboldt also wrote to James Madison, the Secretary of State and Jefferson’s closest political ally, declaring that ‘having witnessed the great spectacle of the majestic Andes and the grandeur of the physical world I intended to enjoy the spectacle of a free people.’ Politics and nature belonged together–an idea that Humboldt would be discussing with the Americans.With almost the final half of the book being dedicated to Thoreau, Darwin, George Perkins Marsh, John Muir, and Ernst Haeckel, the reader unfortunately loses interest on the main subject of Humboldt’s adventurous life—leaving a sense of unfulfillment. It’s apparent that Wulf has so much more to tell on Alexander von Humboldt’s life, which is almost frustrating since the reader is constantly engrossed and intrigued in his story, due to the benefit of her writing style and equal fascination. Apart from the unnecessary segue into like-minded men, there is still much to be gained by the modern reader from reading Wulf’s work on an environmental pioneer and enlightened man of many qualifications and achievements. Maps are provided, a useful “Note on Humboldt’s Publications”, as well as helpful illustrations found throughout the text.

108,038535066X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3007401-biblio-files-takingadayoff,5,"Apparently, in much of Europe, Alexander von Humboldt is as well known as Charles Darwin is to those of us in the United States and Britain. A naturalist and explorer, Humboldt took his upper class education in 18th century Prussia and applied it to becoming a Renaissance man in 19th century Europe and America. Humboldt was especially interested in plant life, but he was an extremely energetic and focused person who also enjoyed studying all forms of life on earth, as well as philosophy, literature and poetry, astronomy, and languages. He loved participating in the frequent salons of the time and became friends with Goethe, and later with Simon Bolivar in his pre-revolutionary days traveling in Europe. He reached out to Thomas Jefferson as a fellow scientist (Jefferson was not only a gentleman farmer, but a scientific farmer as well) and procured an invitation to stay at the President's mansion while he visited Washington, D.C. Later, in Paris, he tried to play diplomat with Napoleon, but was not successful. Still, Napoleon was said to be impressed with his scientific works and to have read Humboldt's books.Humboldt's claim to fame as a scientist is to have been one of the first to see plant life, animal life, the cosmos, geology, everything, as a part of a single ecosystem, rather than as individual and not necessarily connected pieces. This is so basic to our way of thinking today that it seems obvious and not particularly remarkable. But it is as fundamentally different a way of looking at the world as Darwin's idea of natural selection was. Andrea Wulf's biography describes Humboldt's studies, travels, accomplishments -- you feel as if Humboldt would be quite an engaging, if hard to keep up with, fellow. After reading The Invention of Nature, the question that still nagged at me was how I had never learned of this whirlwind before. "
109,038535066X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/241691-kay,4,"“Temperament is destiny,” or so the proverb says, though I have always been suspicious of such broad sweeps of rhetoric. Still, this saying kept echoing through my head as I read this book, for I could not help but wonder: “What makes such a man as Alexander von Humboldt? What motivates him, drives him forward, helps him overcome obstacles, or, perhaps even ultimately, is his very undoing?” It seemed as I read of Humboldt’s life, passions, and seemingly boundless energy, that he must have sprung, almost Athena-like, from his mother’s womb, set from the get-go on a trajectory that would send him around the world in an unceasing round of exploration, research, and writing. Certainly, the advantages of his upbringing and background helped: a stable home, wealth, attentive (if distant) parents, exacting tutors, a library at his disposal. Yet there are other men and women that I can think of, such as the naturalist Alfred Russel Wallace or the explorer Mary Kingsley who had few such advantages, but, like Humboldt, possessed an urge for going, a forward momentum, an insatiable curiosity, and above all, seemingly boundless resources of optimism, courage, and self-reliance. They were, I can’t help but feel, the chosen few, blessed with a rare combination of temperament, intelligence, and energy. It is a magic formula – and, oh, if only I possessed it! The title of this book could well have been “Why Humboldt Matters,” and it’s scarcely a spoiler to reveal that he matters very much, and indeed is perhaps more relevant than ever. Although Humboldt is little thought about or even known about today, in his time he was the most famous scientist in the world - and that was before the term ""scientist"" even existed. It was Humboldt's accounts of his travels in South America and Russia that most captured the public's attention, but among Enlightenment-era and 19th century intellectual circles, his reputation as the authority on a wide range of scientific matters was unquestioned. His vision of nature as an integrated, interconnected and interdependent force, one, furthermore, indifferent to and even damaged by man is what most influenced thinkers of his time, and it is this complex and far-sighted vision which resonates today, perhaps now more than ever in the face of impending environmental threats.Wulf's explanation of why Humboldt fell into relative obscurity during the 20th century, particularly in the U.S.A., wasn't entirely convincing. She cites anti-German sentiment in the wake of the First World War, the fragmentation of science into specialized fields, and the fact that ""Humboldt is not known for a single fact or a discovery but for his worldview. His vision of nature has passed into our consciousness as if by osmosis."" But I think another reason lies within the pages of Wulf's book: Humboldt was the original ""torch bearer,"" but that torch has been taken up by many, some of whom Wulf devotes chapters to, such as Charles Darwin and John Muir. These figures, rather than Humboldt, occupy a larger place in the current public imagination. However, in contemplating Humboldt's scientific eclipse, once again I fell to musing about our fickleness in choosing heroes. Charles Darwin, hero (or blasphemer, depending on your perspective) is universally known if perhaps less than universally understood. (Hence the “blasphemer” part, one could argue.) His less-well-heeled contemporary, Alfred Russel Wallace, simultaneous and independent formulator of the theory of natural selection, while more recently enjoying a bit of an upswing, is still a relative unknown. (And can you guess which of the two is a personal hero? Corr-rect! Wallace it is!) Alfred Einstein, virtually a pop star in the scientific firmament, is but one very bright star in a constellation of equally impressive luminaries – Niels Bohr, Max Planck, Ernest Rutherford, Paul Dirac, James Clerk Maxwell – but it is Einstein who inhabits the popular imagination as the preeminent scientist of all time. (Though many will, of course, at least have a hazy idea, as I do, that Schrödinger and a cat also come into play somewhere.) Yet, after living for years with a physicist, I can confidently state that this much is true: No genius exists in splendid isolation. Each is perched on the shoulders of genii who preceded him. Or her. And so it unquestionably was with Humboldt, whose influences included Johann Wolfgang von Goethe, Captain Cook, Joseph Banks, Immanuel Kant, and indeed the very temper of the Age of Enlightenment. Yet Wulf’s biography focuses primarily on how Humboldt influenced his contemporaries and subsequent generations.  The most prominent of Humboldt’s followers (and that’s not too strong a term, really), was Darwin, who arguably would never have made that voyage on  The Beagle had he not been inspired by Humboldt’s account of his South American travels. Wulf devotes a chapter each to Darwin and four others who fell under Humboldt’s spell: Henry David Thoreau, George Perkins Marsh, Ernst Haeckel, and John Muir. Some of these Humboldtiphiles (Darwin, Thoreau, Muir), I knew something about, though admittedly it seems I knew less about Thoreau than I had thought, while of the remaining two, Marsh and Haeckel, I knew nothing. The chapter on Haeckel I particularly enjoyed, for I have a longstanding interest in Art Nouveau and its various architectural offshoots, and I immediately perceived how Haeckel’s wonderful fusion of art and science became the wellspring for many artists in the new (20th) century. Look at Gaudi’s Casa Batlló and then look at Haeckel’s illustrations of radiolarians (microscopic sea creatures) and the similarities are almost breathtaking. Why, that famous unfinished cathedral in Barcelona is but a radiolarian writ large!In short, I came away not just with a very good idea of Humboldt’s life after reading The Invention of Nature, but also was treated to five succinct mini-biographies of his most influential acolytes. Looking over that group provides a good sense of how all-encompassing Humboldt’s polymath grasp was: he influenced natural scientists, philosopher poets, conservationists, preservationists, earth scientists, artists, and even politicians and kings. Oh, and to add a bit more to this grandiose mix, Humboldt’s friends and contemporaries included the likes of Thomas Jefferson, Simon Bolivar, Joseph Hooker, and practically the entire scientific and intellectual elite of his age, with whom he maintained a voluminous correspondence.But again….that energy! Reading of Humboldt’s travels, experiments, indefatigable correspondence, and the breadth of his expertise practically made my head spin. Wulf makes the point – repeatedly – that perhaps Humboldt’s most singular legacy was his ability to synthesize information from areas which, today, are broken into discrete fields, such as climatology, volcanology, botany, biology, geology, meteorology, seismology, and paleontology, just to name a few. Those fields were all given a hearty kick-start by Humboldt’s grand synthesis, his Cosmos. It is this great overarching view of nature that inspired those that followed. Reading (but, admittedly, not entirely comprehending) how Humboldt achieved this was inspirational. A couple of final notes: firstly, the illustrations in the book were a delight. May I confess how much I enjoy well-selected (and nicely rendered) illustrations? I sometimes feel a little jolt of pleasure whenever I turn the page to find one. The chapter on Haeckel, for example, cried out for some of his radiolarian drawings. And there they were! Along with some equally fetching Medusae. Another not entirely unexpected joy was Wulf’s style. She has one! That is to say, I got a sense of 
her
 from reading this book, but she never intruded upon the subject, which always remained in focus. While it’s clear that Wulf must have loved researching and writing about Humboldt, she judiciously organized the material and trimmed her narrative, then wrote it in a lively yet elegant style that made me think, on the whole, that I would rather enjoy meeting this author. At any rate, I certainly want to read more of her work. "

111,038535066X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/18695911-daniel-chaikin,4,"It was interesting this evening, as I was driving home and listening to Michael Pollan read his latest book, to hear him refer to this book as if it were a major inspiration for him. Humboldt's view of nature as one entire interconnected thing. It is a beautiful concept, one he made at length and, as Wulf shows, elegantly and poetically. Darwin, who eventually met Humboldt, found Humboldt's writing inspirational for his scientific view of nature. Henry Thoreau devoured his writing, and found inspiration of his poetic view of the nature around his small pond. And John Muir, so enraptured he set off for Cuba and South America until he learned the tropical climates made him ill, found in Humboldt an inspiration for the environmental movement. And, I should mention, Simon Bolivar not only found in Humboldt a South American natural identity he raved about, but also used Humboldt's maps in his military campaigns. Wulf follows all these threads and more, in great detail. She rushes headlong through narratives, making them something of a roller coaster ride, and she spends time at the end wondering why the contemporary English speaking world has practically forgotten who Humboldt was or why anyone cares. What did he accomplish anyway, other than create some of the first detailed maps in a few hard to reach parts of South America? He was, it seems, primarily and powerfully, an inspiration. OK, he also invented the idea of nature. Well, maybe. I mean, Wulf makes the claim, over and over again, but it's a claim that reveals a major weakness in the book that bothered me a lot. She presents, ultimately, a very narrow in focus. So, yes, no question, Humboldt has a thought-provoking unified view on nature. But, was he the first? What was the intellectual world around him thinking, and what were the foundations? Is it possible nature as a unified thing was brought up before? Ever? by anyone? Wulf doesn't do context well, or didn't here. Really, mainly what she does is report stories in lengthy but also abbreviated forms. I liked her book and I really liked learning about Humbolt. It's not a perfect work, but it's not like the early 19th century intellectual world is an easy one to capture. So, flawed but still recommended, and who knows, you might be blown away like Michael Pollan.-----------------------------------------------60.

112,038535066X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/67736000-elizabeth-a-g,5,"Andrea Wulf's The Invention of Nature: Alexander von Humboldt's New World is an enjoyable, well-written and researched exploration of one man's vision of the world around him and how his restless spirit and determination gave us a deep appreciation of nature and presented the idea connectedness of all things organic and inorganic. Alexander von Humboldt is little remembered today and this book sheds a light on the scientist, ecologist. educator, and humanist who influenced later, better known naturalists like Darwin, Thoreau, George Perkins Marsh, Ernst Haeckel, and John Muir. Humboldt believed in the power of education and his writings and books were aimed toward a general audience rather than to specifically the scientific community. In fact he sought to show how nature is a living organism and that there is unity in scientific thought and the emotional response to nature that is expressed in poetry, art and music. He is also one of the first to warn that the activities of man in his commercial pursuits are bringing about the destruction of forests and creating climate change. In this book Wulf describes Humboldt's influence on future environmentalists and goes into some detail on these others...my only issue that perhaps the author could have shortened this section of the book by more of a summarization rather such detail (the subjects for a future book, perhaps). The epilogue of the book is excellent."

About half the book is padded with simplistic one chapter biopics of people purported to have been strongly influenced by Humboldt, often to an extent that is hard to credit. So according to Wulf: Goethe modelled Faust on Humboldt; Darwin would not have travelled on the Beagle and eventually developed evolutionary theory; John Muir wouldn't have become a environmentalist and saved the redwoods; Heckel wouldn't have created art that directly lead to Art Nouveau; and Bolívar wouldn't have become a revolutionary leading to the decolonization of Spain in Latin America. Wulf also repeatedly credits him with discovering climate change, centuries before it came to conscious awareness here, despite no evidence that this is true. Near the end of the book, she credits his current day obscurity (which is not really true) from a reaction against all things German after the 2nd World War, but if this was really correct, why are so many other German scientists and writers remembered and him not? Perhaps it is more to do with him never creating a lasting advance in knowledge via synthesis (a la Darwin).A great opportunity that is wasted by lack of in depth research and a critical appraisal of Humboldt's life.2-stars."
114,038535066X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/76176316-alistair-mackay,4,"The most famous man you’ve never heard of. Alexander Von Humboldt was a superstar explorer, botanist, geologist, naturalist. He inspired Charles Darwin and Henry David Thoreau. He was friends with Simon Bolivar. He invented the thermal lines on maps and came up with the idea of ecosystems and climate zones. He was a scientist before that was a word, and a naturalist before all the different disciplines of nature split into their factions. He believed nature needed to be understood with facts and poetry, felt as well as experienced. And he predicted climate change and deforestation... in the 1790s. I don’t usually enjoy biographies but I loved this book. It’s well-researched and well written. It’s a fascinating look at the adventures and contributions of a truly great man, and the grandfather of the environmental movement. He was the most famous man in the world at one point, and he’s been lost to history only because of 20th Century anti-German sentiment. Glad I read this and learnt about Humboldt. We owe him so much.

I will boldly say this book is my favorite book of 2015 and I plan on recommending it to everyone I know. Part of the delight is that I had no knowledge of Humboldt before reading this book and I was amazed to learn how influential and inspiring he was to people in the 18th and 19th centuries. With direct links to American founding fathers, the Romantic Literature movement, and Simon Bolivar's fight for independence in South America, and Charles Darwin Humboldt is seed that many modern ideas are sprung from. Although I read a library copy of this book I promptly went out and bought my own personal copy because it's a book I will treasure for years to come."

This is more than a biography of Humboldt (one of the most interesting scientists and explorers of all time)- it's a dedication to his legacy and an exploration of how his findings and philosophies eventually influenced everything from Art Nouveau to Walden to John Muir. Wide and diverse in breadth and scope, this reminds me of one of my favorite books- The Age of Wonder. "

120,038535066X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3409532-april-does-feral-sometimes,4,"The book 'The Invention of Nature' is fascinating. It is more than a biography of Alexander Von Humboldt (1769-1859), who can be described as a polymath genius whose enthusiasm for travel and nature was as momentous for the development of as many branches of science that Albert Einstein (1879-1955) was because of his interest in physics. Yet, I have never heard of him until I read this book.Some early Western 19th-century proto-scientists labored all of their life in bleak obscurity until only after their deaths being recognized as major scientific brains and discoverers; others announced their work to newly created scientific societies only to be met with withering scorn. Some inventors were clearly crackpots with one great idea while others were intelligent driven members of respectable aristocrat families and upper-class merchants. (Almost all of these Great Men of Science upset their parents by refusing to study law or medicine in university! Humboldt was one of these children of disappointed parents. I have read a few other science histories, and I have noticed that almost all of these early scientists had parents hoping for a son who would become a doctor or lawyer. Just saying.)However, Humboldt became famous early in his lifetime and all doors were open to him. He met already famous people eager to speak with him, such as President Thomas Jefferson. Others who desired to call him friend went on to illustrious (and nefarious) careers as famous scientists in their own right such as Charles Darwin, well-known writers such as Henry David Thoreau, and Kings, Emperors and Prime Ministers such as Friedrich Wilhelm IV and George Canning, as well as leaders of political revolutions overthrowing those before-mentioned Kings and Emperors such as Simón Bolívar. Humboldt himself was a liberal and he supported the overthrow of the aristocracy, but his income primarily was from a pension paid by two Prussian kings after he went through his own inheritance. He obviously was charismatic, moving easily between many different cultures and social classes, from South America to Europe to Russia.After returning from a five-year exploration of South America with tens of thousands of astronomical, geological and meteorological observations and specimens, he published his first book, 'Essay on the Geography of Plants' at age 32, dedicating it to Johann Wolfgang Goethe, his fellow polymath and best friend (after his brother Wilhelm von Humboldt, who founded the University of Berlin after a career as the Prussian ambassador to Vienna and Britain). The book combined with his achievements and personality made him a famous man, perhaps the most famous respected natural scientist in the world. However, full of energy, wanderlust and curiosity, Humboldt moved on to more explorations crossing over the frontlines of many European wars between France, Prussia, Britain, and Spain, and maneuvering through countries on three continents which were undergoing political revolutions, observing volcano eruptions while mountain climbing without oxygen tanks (yes, he and his companions fainted occasionally) enduring nasty mosquitos, while exposing and warning the public of the dreadful environmental destruction of earth wherever men used the land for agriculture, mining and lumber.Humboldt lived to the age of 89, still receiving famous visitors and writing thousands of letters a month up to his death. His books on the natural sciences, illustrated with his own and other explorers' beautiful art and drawings, inspired Darwin, Thoreau, Ernst Haeckel, John Muir, to name a few. Rivers, mountains, towns and other landmarks were named after him, and he is mentioned in thousands of famous novels. Yet most Americans today have never heard of him, probably because of World War I and WWII having been fought against Germany as an enemy of the United States. I think we should bring this man back into the spotlight and make him a famous hero scientist again. This book is an excellent start.Below I've included some Wikipedia links about the early naturalists, Humboldt, and many of the famous intellectuals, writers and scientists he inspired in later centuries, in hope that these thumbnail histories will convince you, gentle reader, to pick up this book:http://www.ranker.com/list/notable-na...https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alexa...https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kosmo...https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Georg...https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Man_a...https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ernst...https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kunst...https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_..."

HOLY MOLY! WOW! What an awesome book! Just reading it made me happy to be alive! Really! It was a wonderful break from the dreary procession of bad news parading out of every media orifice! (Note to self: improve your imagery.) I neglected other self-improving projects to read this book, and then was sad when I finished it! Worthy of all awards and accolades! The world would be a better place if everyone was forced to read it, at gunpoint if necessary! Don't just stand (or sit) there, go out and get a copy right away!I love narratives about news events, scandals, and personalities that once famous, but now forgotten. This is one of them, of a man known by everyone when living, celebrated, called without irony the greatest man who had ever lived, sought out by tedious rich people and aristocrats, pestered for autographs, and recipient of mountains of admiring old-school paper letters. Intrepid and death-defying explorer, partisan of liberty, deplorer of slavery and cruelty, widely-admired prose stylist, polyglot, polymath. Honored by having towns, counties, and other jurisdictions named after him. Further honored by having a Pacific Ocean current named after him and, even cooler still, also a critter described by Wikipedia as a ""large predatory squid"". His books were anticipated with an enthusiasm which today, sadly, only occurs with certain entries in the ""Young Adult"" market. Pirated translations of his works were rushed to market to satisfy bottomless demand. He was even -- dare I say it? -- the Werner Herzog of his age (ok, yes, Humboldt was Prussian and Herzog Bavarian, but let's not nitpick). As young men, both were driven by some inner demon to seek out the most pestilential, soggy, disease-ridden, and predator-filled sections of inner South America, and came back to ""civilization"", such as it is, with precious insights and striking images, which changed the way people looked at the world. When older, both continued to push into far corners of the world (including, in both cases, Siberia) at a time of life when most of us find it increasingly difficult to get out of bed.Humboldt actually had a life that was both exciting and well-documented, so writing about him was a little like shooting fish in barrel. I don't wish to belittle the author's achievement: the narrative always moves along at an entertaining clip, even during those periods when Humboldt had to spend some time toadying up to various Kaisers in order to keep the old mazuma rolling in. I also enjoyed the last few chapters, which switched tone from standard biography of one man to mini chapter-long biographies of various men (including Simon Bolivar, Charles Darwin, Henry David Thoreau, and John Muir), with a concentration on how Humboldt changed the lives and directions of their thoughts. The point, I believe, was that, even though his name is no longer on everybody's lips, Humboldt is still very much with us.To repeat: delightful. Read it.The only thing that I didn't like about this book was the realization at the conclusion that, no matter what achievements I, uh, achieve with the balance of my life, I will never, ever, have a large predatory squid named after me.

122,038535066X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6938150-marie-paule,5,"When in Berlin a few years ago, I came by the magnificent building of the Humboldt University. And I know that quite a few plants are named '... humboldtiensis'. Although I have a PhD in Science I knew nothing more about Alexander von Humboldt. What a shame. On Sep 14, 1869, the 100th birthday of this brilliant man, there were celebrations all over the world: Europe, Africa, Australia and the America's. More than 100 years later, he seems to be forgotten. What a life he has led. In his younger years, he became a lifetime friend of Goethe, who, besides being a poet, was very interested in botanics and geology. They were both interested in the dualism between the external and internal world (Kant and his 'Kritik der reinen Vernunft'). Is the tree in my garden a real tree, or my idea of a tree? Humboldt gradually shifted from pure empirical research towards his own interpretation of nature: he mixed detailed scientific facts with the emotional reactions they invoked. He thought a great deal about 'Life'. A machine can be taken apart and reassembled, but you can't do this with an animal. Why? Von Humboldt’s most important journey was a 5 year-trip through South America. There, he developed the first concept of 'ecosystems' (long before we knew this particular word), explaining that geology, climate, micro-organisms, plants and animals all influence each other. When he travelled through the plains of Los llanos in Venezuela in 1800 (!), he warned for the destructive effects of human activity (large scale agriculture of commercial crops, mining, ...) on the ecosystems. At the same time, he pointed out that the overexploitation of local ecosystems had disastrous effects on the human population as well: slavery, unhealthy working conditions, a shortage of local healthy foods, exploitation of large groups of have-nots by the happy few….. Sounds familiar, no?Does it surprise you that Alexander von Humboldt became one of the best liftetime friends of Simon Bolivar, who fought to liberate South America from its Spanish colonists? All through his live, von Humboldt fought against slavery. He so longed to visit India, but the British government denied him a passport, because they knew how he felt about slavery and he was not willing to compromise…. For the British, he remained a dangerous anti-colonialist actor. Later in life, he made a great journey through Russia, all the way to Mongolia. He held his 60th birthday party in … the pharmacy of Lenin’s grandfather. After his return from South America, von Humboldt lived in Paris and in London, where he met the famous scientists of his time. He inspired a lot of scientists and writers of his time, among others Charles Darwin, Henry David Thoreau, George Perkin Marsh, Ernst Haeckel and John Muir. Indeed, what a life and what a talent… At the end of his life, von Humboldt wrote his magnum opus ‘Kosmos’: an overview of his own and other scientific findings, but above all, his opinion about the correlations and relationships between different scientific theories, and the interrelation between science, art and sociology. For von Humboldt, there were no boundaries between scientific domains or between science and humanities. In short: von Humboldt was a scientist who was far ahead of his time and who remains a lighting example for us all."

The last sections really suffers in comparison. Her choice of figures to investigate his legacy through their biography is both too focused and too limited to be truly effective. While I understand her desire to dive deep into Humboldt's influence shoehorning in 5 mini bios of other figures into the end of the book moves the book away from its true center.

125,038535066X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4739424-mal-warwick,5,"He was the most famous man in the world, and more places around the world are named after him than anyone else. To many of the giants of his time — Johann Wolfgang von Goethe, Thomas Jefferson, Simon Bolivar, Charles Darwin, Henry David Thoreau — he was a colossus whose genius overshadowed their own. He was the first to describe the web of life on Earth, foreshadowing James Lovelock’s Gaia hypothesis, and the first to describe the impact of human activity on the world’s climate. His books, which read like poetry, “were so popular that people bribed booksellers to be the first to receive copies.” Eleven years after his death at age 89, the centennial of his birth was observed by hundreds of thousands of people in huge celebrations around the world.Chances are, you’ve never heard of him.His name was Alexander von Humboldt, and he died in 1859. He had first described climate change in 1800. He “gave us his concept of nature itself.”Andrea Wulf’s engrossing new biography, The Invention of Nature, brings this extraordinary man into the spotlight again after a century and a half. It’s about time. His may well have been one of the finest minds in human history.Humboldt, born into a prosperous family of Prussian aristocrats shortly after the American Civil War, rebelled against the constraints on his life and set out on his own unique path. Though he became best known as a naturalist, world traveler, and author, his interests reached into a far wider range of human endeavor, and Cosmos, the multi-volume book he began to write at the age of sixty-five, encompassed virtually the whole of human knowledge, from botany, geology, and zoology to astronomy, philosophy, and, in effect, the new science he invented: ecology. (Though he didn’t invent that term, his work was the inspiration for the man who did later in the nineteenth century.)As Wulf notes, “Humboldt took his readers from outer space to earth, and then from the surface of the planet into its inner core. He discussed comets, the Milky Way and the solar system as well as terrestrial magnetism, volcanoes and the snow line of mountains. He wrote about the migration of the human species, about plants and animals and the microscopic organisms that live in stagnant water or on the weathered surface of rocks.” Never before, and never since (to the best of my knowledge), has a single individual mastered so many fields of inquiry so successfully that his contemporaries regarded him as a force of nature. And, in an age when most of humanity lived in thrall to organized religion, Humboldt didn’t once mention God in all the many thousands of pages of his books. Instead, he spoke of a “wonderful web of organic life.”Wulf’s biography of this astonishing man is by no means unreservedly positive. She describes the shortcomings of his personality in embarrassing detail: his tendency to talk nonstop at a rapid rate for hours without permitting interruptions of any kind, regardless of the stature of his listeners; his seeming inability to understand the feelings of others and to show empathy for their pain; his venomous gossiping; and his inability to accept criticism. Alexander von Humboldt was not a nice man.Andrea Wulf is an historian and writer who lives in Britain. The Invention of Nature is her fifth book."

Von Humboldt was so much more than just that adventurous young man I'd heard of, and Wulf does an excellent job of filling out the picture and his impact.During that extended exploration of South America 200 years ago, while ranging through much of modern day Venezuela, Columbia, Ecuador and Peru, von Humboldt developed concepts of nature, climate and ecology that we take as ""new"" in the late 20th/early 21st centuries. He determined, for instance, that the drop in the level of Lake Valencia was tied to the destruction of the surrounding forest to clear land for farming. He made the connection that the absence of the trees dramatically reduced the ability of the land to retain water. While climbing Mt. Chimborazo in the Andes he developed the concept of altitude-based climate zones that are consistent around the globe. Comparing plants he found on the South American Atlantic coast with those growing on the African Atlantic coast, he intuited that the two land masses must once have been one.These were not simply casual observations for von Humboldt; after returning to Europe he spent the rest of his life as a scientist and author, successfully seeking out the data to support his theories. It's impossible here to summarize his many brilliant insights, but as one example, his perceptions of the devastating outcomes of human's impact on the natural world were prescient of the reality we experience today. Through his writings he influenced many key thinkers of the 19th century, including Darwin, Thoreau and Muir.In truth, I found the biographical information about those scientists and naturalists who built their own theories on his foundations to be more lengthy than necessary, and the latter part of the book dragged a bit for that reason. But overall, reading the story of von Humboldt, a polymath with the ability to pull together what he observed in multiple scientific fields to develop comprehensive theories, was time well spent. He deserves more recognition today."
127,038535066X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/35482263-gumble-s-yard,4,"Alexander Von Humboldt ... was one of the last polymaths, and died at a time when scientific disciplines were hardening into tightly fenced and more specialised fields. Consequently his more holistic approach - a scientific method that included art, history, poetry and politics alongside hard data - has fallen out of favour ..... One of [his] greatest achievements had been to make science accessible and popular ......... in a world where we draw a sharp line between the sciences and the arts, between he subjective and the objective, Humboldt's insight that we can only truly understand nature by using our imaginations makes him a visionaryAward winning biography of Alexander Von Humboldt, of who I was previously familiar from the fictional biography Measuring the World. Wulf ksets out to show that: he was a true polymath, perhaps the last to really range across all scientific disciplines; that at a time when science was becoming increasingly focused on classifications he remained able to see the big picture both across as well as within scientific disciplines; that at a time when romantic poets and data driven scientists were starting to grow in mutual incomprehension, his method of observing and describing nature in person and in capturing what he observed both in rigorous data and evocative descriptions, enabled him to be lionised by individuals on both sides of that divide; that in his pioneering work on the inter-connectedness of natural ecosystems and on the impact of human actions on those systems, he should be regarded as the founder of the environmental movement. She also is keen to emphasise his influence on others - starting with his almost lifelong friendship with and influence on the work of Goethe. Wulf writes chapters on each of Simon Bolivar, Charles Darwin and Henry Thoreau, cantering on their achievements but at all times seeking for the considerable impact Von Humboldt had on them. In perhaps the only slightly false note in the book, it finishes with more than fifty pages on his seemingly more tangential influence on three lesser known figures whose main achievements were after his death. Overall though this is a fascinating and well written account."
128,038535066X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1241339-clif,5,"Chicago's public radio station, WBEZ, had a program on the statue of Alexander Humboldt in the park named after him, in a neighborhood named after him. The program speculated that not one in a thousand passersby would know who he was. I've no doubt that's true. My only association of the name was with the Humboldt Current that brings cold water up the west coast of South America from Antarctica. With that as background, this book floored me.Humboldt was to the 19th century as Einstein was to the 20th. It's fair to say that everyone knew his name even decades after his death in 1859. He was a powerful influence on Charles Darwin, John Muir and Henry David Thoreau. On the seminal voyage aboard the Beagle that took Darwin around the world, his notes are peppered with ""as Humboldt said..."" whenever something was found that confirmed Humboldt's previous discoveries. Thoreau was a Humboldt devotee.During his lifetime, and he loved life, lectures given by Humboldt were packed, whether in America or Europe. His books were best sellers and he was personally acquainted with everyone who was anyone, from Napoleon (one of the few that didn't like Humboldt) through the royalty of Europe to Simón Bolívar, the liberator of South America, and on down from there. He was a font of knowledge on the natural world, was driven by curiosity and would even at an advanced age rush to attend the lectures of someone who knew something he did not, sitting in an audience of college students furiously taking notes as he listened.He had only one foible - he could not stop talking. Only the most determined could get in a comment, but few wished to do so as it would, but only possibly, interrupt the flow of knowledge they wanted to hear. Single his entire life with never any indication of an attraction to women, he bonded easily with men, forming lifelong friendships and exploring for months on end with a partner.His physical endurance and health were phenomenal. He climbed snow covered mountains with none of the equipment we know today, even above levels where oxygen should be used. As others would fall victim to tropical diseases, Humboldt was up at dawn ready to go. Clouds of mosquitoes for days and nights on end were no deterrent if there was a new plant, animal or rock formation to be examined.Not only did he crave knowledge, he wanted everyone to share in it. His Personal Narrative of the Equinoctial Regions of the New Continent (South America) was devoured by a public as eager to find out what had been found as we today would read the account of a person visiting another solar system. And, speaking of outer space, he took that subject on as well in his quest to tie everything together, writing the multi-volume Cosmos as he neared the end of his life.As Andrea Wulf makes clear in her title, The Invention of Nature, Humboldt was one of the first to come up with the concept of ecosystems, the interconnection of the natural world that allow an environment to thrive if left alone, and change it even to the point of destruction when this or that part is altered. While few of us today know of Humboldt, we live in the conceptual world of nature he created.This book is a wonderful wide-ranging history that covers not only Humboldt's life, but contains brief overviews of the lives and work of Darwin, Thoreau, George Perkins Marsh, Ernst Haeckel and John Muir in relation to Humboldt. Filled with adventure and excitement, Wulf perfectly captures a man to which we are all indebted and one who would be delighted to meet any of us and relate his discoveries.Sad to say, none of his books are in the network of public libraries including the one in my own town."
129,038535066X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7175349-david,5,"Didn't finish before it was due back to the library, but I read enough to be dazzled by Humboldt. First, I must praise this author for writing this book, bringing this once famous and celebrated figure back to our attention. The title is apparently not as hyperbolic as it seems, as her subject really does seem to have given both the public and the scientific community the idea of nature as an interconnected whole. No summary I could offer will do justice to the book, so you will need to read it yourself. And if it is not the kind of book you would read, then at least go to a bookstore or the library and skim enough to get some idea of it, because it is worth knowing about. (Note: yes, this is who Humboldt county in California is named after, and the University in Berlin, and the current in the Pacific Ocean, and many other things besides.)Here's a guy who got Goethe all stirred up, who explored the Amazon and the Andes, loved to get close to an erupting volcano, inspired Simon Bolivar to rebel against Spain, admired the American Revolution but could not understand why his friend Thomas Jefferson did not free the slaves, got Thoreau interested in nature, etc., etc. Seems to have been gay (avant la lettre), as his attachments to other men seem to have been unusual enough to cause his family some concern. Certainly his companions stuck with him through thick and thin, at risk to their lives with some frequency. My favorite is the poor guy who survives fever in the Amazon, crawling along a precarious mountain trail in a howling snowstorm, a hurricane at sea, just for a few examples, only to be berated for not working hard enough to publish their discoveries when they finally get back to Paris. Our hero could wear you out, apparently, not that anyone seemed to mind. And he was enough of a superstar that the King of Prussia kept him at court later in life even though it was no secret that he didn't believe in Monarchy and would support any revolution that might overthrow his patron. Think about that: he didn't worry about pleasing the King, the King worried about keeping him around.The book may seem too thorough to some readers (e.g., me), but when you think about the many volumes written by Humboldt, it's easy to see that she must have felt like this was the short version of the story. So worth checking out! "
130,038535066X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/180643-jim-coughenour,3,"A fine (re)introduction to Humboldt and his prescient ecological view of nature: that everything is connected and that humanity is capable of destroying the world it's been given. Humboldt appears as a brilliant, even heroic, transitional figure between the Enlightenment and the Romantic movement, between the positivism of science and the inwardness of art, between Goethe and Darwin. Wulf is also good at demonstrating his influence on other naturalists, not only Darwin but Thoreau, George Perkins Marsh (new to me), Ernst Haeckel and John Muir.Because I'd just finished reading On the Move: A Life, I couldn't help being reminded of Oliver Sacks, who also stood outside his own profession of neurology to capture the human and artistic dimension of knowledge, creating a new kind of scientific literature in the process. I was also intrigued to find out that Humboldt never married. He claimed his passion was only for science, but he was rarely without the company of another charismatic young man. His equally famous brother, Willem, ""disliked his brother's intense friendships – probably a mixture of jealousy and a concern for what might have seemed the inappropriate nature of these connections."" And finally, to my private embarrassment, I realized I've confused Alexander and Willem my whole life. (Humboldt University in Berlin is named after both of them.)The dark irony is that, although Humboldt was revered his warnings about how humanity was destroying its own environment were largely ignored. What should be obvious to everyone is still the stuff of partisan politics, and the grim conviction deepens that nothing will be done until it is too late, that it is in fact too late already."
131,038535066X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5871422-elena,5,"Andrea Wulf paints an appealing picture of the brilliant Alexander von Humboldt, an Enlightenment titan who climbed the highest mountains he could find with heavy instruments to make precise measurements, not just air pressure, but he had some kind of cyanograph to measure just how blue the sky was at different altitudes. He discussed science with Thomas Jefferson, whom he admired on one level, but AvH was firmly opposed to any form of slavery. He admired the indigenous peoples he met while exploring South America, and reported on the magnificent ruins of ancient American civilizations and the complex languages of the peoples he encountered in the colorful jungles, which he much perfered to his native Berlin. He deplored the degradation of the New World ecology by the mining and cash crops of the Spanish. Wulf did extensive research on his influence on Darwin and the theory of evolution which he anticipated with studies of fossils, on Goethe who put a bit of him into Faust, on Simon Bolivar who discussed concepts of political freedom with him, on Henry David Thoreau who's love of nature was nurtured by reading AvH's books on the interconnected-ness of nature, and on John Muir who read and annotated his books. Wulf found direct connections to show how his love of nature even inspired the Art Deco movement. His fame was universal, his name attached to currents, mountains, counties, cities all across the US and Latin America. It was the anti-German sentiments of World War I, intensified in World War II that cause his fame to be mostly extinguished along with admiration for German science and culture in general. Time to appreciate the man who pushed through legislation in Prussia that any slave, including any American slave, who lands on Prussian soil becomes a free person. "
132,038535066X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6432978-bfisher,4,"Alexander von Humboldt was one of the most prominent scientists of the nineteenth century. When he died in 1859, tens of thousands of mourners marched in his funeral procession. A staggering number of geographical features were named after him in his lifetime. It seems appropriate that the namesake Humboldt River, one of the largest rivers in the Great Basin of North America, disappears from sight in the Humboldt Sinks, much as Humboldt’s reputation has disappeared from modern popular memory.Yet, it is not fitting that Humboldt should be forgotten to our age. Andrea Wulf describes his roles as a founder of biogeography, inventor of isotherms, developer of the concept of ecological systems and the interdependence of life, and as the first scientist to recognize the danger of anthropogenic climate change. He influenced Darwin, Thoreau and John Muir. We recognize and adopt his ideas but have forgotten the person. This book is a useful recovery of the core importance to science and society of Humboldt's work. Unfortunately, in its coverage of Humboldt the scientist, Humboldt the person gets short shrift, aside from a few brief hints. That is my one quibble with this book."
133,038535066X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7283807-ben,1,"Desperately in need of an editor. Perhaps the author could not find enough source material on Humboldt himself. The majority of the book consists of capsule biographies and Wikipedia-level explanations of other people, such as Darwin or Muir. The author bombastically credits everything good to Humboldt. A typical phrasing, repeated dozens if not hundreds of times, goes like, ""Humboldt generously shared his library with X, and despite his own debts supported X financially. X praised Humboldt as 'one of the greatest scientists of his generation.'"" There is very little insight added to the material. The author does not bring any skepticism to the table, and is entirely credulous when it comes to Humboldt. Unfortunately, this means that you can't trust what few conclusions are drawn. I only finished it because I had an audiobook. Not worth reading. "
134,038535066X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/18845147-gill,4,"This is a well written, comprehensive account of the life of Alexander von Humboldt, and his influences and influence. I found it an interesting read, and the specialist sections clearly explained. I found the section on his links with Simon Bolívar especially interesting. Well done to Andrea Wulf for introducing a man who was so important in his own time to a present day audience."
135,038535066X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2758455-katy,5,Excellent book! Alexander Von Humboldt is a hero for science & nature and was ahead of his time. We can all still learn from him and from those who were influenced by him.

Humboldt's legacy of scientific inquiry has style of writing has impacted generations of scientist, writers and readers all around the world. His numerous works and lectures are still revelant as the world faces a global environmental crossroads. I highly encourage readers to pick up this outstanding work."
137,038535066X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/96806543-the-colonial,3,"Alexander von Humboldt’s name can be seen throughout the world’s streets, trails, universities, and rivers, yet the man and his mystique are rarely brought to our actual attention. By the early-nineteenth century, Humboldt had become what today we would call both an Environmentalist and Renaissance Man—as he was a scientist, explorer, naturalist, botanist, and colleague of renowned and like-minded intellectuals of the age. Andrea Wulf weaves all of these traits together in order to discuss Humboldt’s life journey and the groundbreaking ideas that he introduced our world to—some far too ahead of the times for the likes of his contemporaries.The first half of the book appropriately covers Humboldt’s beginnings, from his boyhood and ancestry in Prussia, to his rise in education and esteem in the scientific world. Wulf devotes much attention to Humboldt’s standing in the political world as a whole, where the botanist is doted upon by courtly officials and diplomats from such prosperous world powers as Russia, Great Britain, Spain, and the United States. He is honored by the prestigious Royal Society of London as a foreign member, and throughout his remarkable life he meets the likes of such prominent figures as Joseph Banks, Benjamin Smith Barton, Thomas Jefferson, Benjamin Rush, and a young and upcoming Charles Darwin.Unfortunately, Wulf’s enthusiasm for her subject is too broad in its approach, as she pivots into the second half of the book by focusing on the great men that were influenced by Humboldt—all of which include famous scientists, authors, environmentalists, and inventors. This is collectively balanced out by her engaging and imaginative prose, where she fortunately excels at using her fascination with Humboldt as well as that of nature itself for her inspiration. Wulf majestically explains each and every tour and journey that Humboldt embarked upon, as well as the meetings he held with prominent men of his times:…Humboldt informed Jefferson, where he had collected plants, made astronomical observations, found hieroglyphs of ancient civilizations deep in the rainforest and had amassed important data from the colonial archives of Mexico City. Humboldt also wrote to James Madison, the Secretary of State and Jefferson’s closest political ally, declaring that ‘having witnessed the great spectacle of the majestic Andes and the grandeur of the physical world I intended to enjoy the spectacle of a free people.’ Politics and nature belonged together–an idea that Humboldt would be discussing with the Americans.With almost the final half of the book being dedicated to Thoreau, Darwin, George Perkins Marsh, John Muir, and Ernst Haeckel, the reader unfortunately loses interest on the main subject of Humboldt’s adventurous life—leaving a sense of unfulfillment. It’s apparent that Wulf has so much more to tell on Alexander von Humboldt’s life, which is almost frustrating since the reader is constantly engrossed and intrigued in his story, due to the benefit of her writing style and equal fascination. Apart from the unnecessary segue into like-minded men, there is still much to be gained by the modern reader from reading Wulf’s work on an environmental pioneer and enlightened man of many qualifications and achievements. Maps are provided, a useful “Note on Humboldt’s Publications”, as well as helpful illustrations found throughout the text.

138,038535066X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3007401-biblio-files-takingadayoff,5,"Apparently, in much of Europe, Alexander von Humboldt is as well known as Charles Darwin is to those of us in the United States and Britain. A naturalist and explorer, Humboldt took his upper class education in 18th century Prussia and applied it to becoming a Renaissance man in 19th century Europe and America. Humboldt was especially interested in plant life, but he was an extremely energetic and focused person who also enjoyed studying all forms of life on earth, as well as philosophy, literature and poetry, astronomy, and languages. He loved participating in the frequent salons of the time and became friends with Goethe, and later with Simon Bolivar in his pre-revolutionary days traveling in Europe. He reached out to Thomas Jefferson as a fellow scientist (Jefferson was not only a gentleman farmer, but a scientific farmer as well) and procured an invitation to stay at the President's mansion while he visited Washington, D.C. Later, in Paris, he tried to play diplomat with Napoleon, but was not successful. Still, Napoleon was said to be impressed with his scientific works and to have read Humboldt's books.Humboldt's claim to fame as a scientist is to have been one of the first to see plant life, animal life, the cosmos, geology, everything, as a part of a single ecosystem, rather than as individual and not necessarily connected pieces. This is so basic to our way of thinking today that it seems obvious and not particularly remarkable. But it is as fundamentally different a way of looking at the world as Darwin's idea of natural selection was. Andrea Wulf's biography describes Humboldt's studies, travels, accomplishments -- you feel as if Humboldt would be quite an engaging, if hard to keep up with, fellow. After reading The Invention of Nature, the question that still nagged at me was how I had never learned of this whirlwind before. "
139,038535066X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/241691-kay,4,"“Temperament is destiny,” or so the proverb says, though I have always been suspicious of such broad sweeps of rhetoric. Still, this saying kept echoing through my head as I read this book, for I could not help but wonder: “What makes such a man as Alexander von Humboldt? What motivates him, drives him forward, helps him overcome obstacles, or, perhaps even ultimately, is his very undoing?” It seemed as I read of Humboldt’s life, passions, and seemingly boundless energy, that he must have sprung, almost Athena-like, from his mother’s womb, set from the get-go on a trajectory that would send him around the world in an unceasing round of exploration, research, and writing. Certainly, the advantages of his upbringing and background helped: a stable home, wealth, attentive (if distant) parents, exacting tutors, a library at his disposal. Yet there are other men and women that I can think of, such as the naturalist Alfred Russel Wallace or the explorer Mary Kingsley who had few such advantages, but, like Humboldt, possessed an urge for going, a forward momentum, an insatiable curiosity, and above all, seemingly boundless resources of optimism, courage, and self-reliance. They were, I can’t help but feel, the chosen few, blessed with a rare combination of temperament, intelligence, and energy. It is a magic formula – and, oh, if only I possessed it! The title of this book could well have been “Why Humboldt Matters,” and it’s scarcely a spoiler to reveal that he matters very much, and indeed is perhaps more relevant than ever. Although Humboldt is little thought about or even known about today, in his time he was the most famous scientist in the world - and that was before the term ""scientist"" even existed. It was Humboldt's accounts of his travels in South America and Russia that most captured the public's attention, but among Enlightenment-era and 19th century intellectual circles, his reputation as the authority on a wide range of scientific matters was unquestioned. His vision of nature as an integrated, interconnected and interdependent force, one, furthermore, indifferent to and even damaged by man is what most influenced thinkers of his time, and it is this complex and far-sighted vision which resonates today, perhaps now more than ever in the face of impending environmental threats.Wulf's explanation of why Humboldt fell into relative obscurity during the 20th century, particularly in the U.S.A., wasn't entirely convincing. She cites anti-German sentiment in the wake of the First World War, the fragmentation of science into specialized fields, and the fact that ""Humboldt is not known for a single fact or a discovery but for his worldview. His vision of nature has passed into our consciousness as if by osmosis."" But I think another reason lies within the pages of Wulf's book: Humboldt was the original ""torch bearer,"" but that torch has been taken up by many, some of whom Wulf devotes chapters to, such as Charles Darwin and John Muir. These figures, rather than Humboldt, occupy a larger place in the current public imagination. However, in contemplating Humboldt's scientific eclipse, once again I fell to musing about our fickleness in choosing heroes. Charles Darwin, hero (or blasphemer, depending on your perspective) is universally known if perhaps less than universally understood. (Hence the “blasphemer” part, one could argue.) His less-well-heeled contemporary, Alfred Russel Wallace, simultaneous and independent formulator of the theory of natural selection, while more recently enjoying a bit of an upswing, is still a relative unknown. (And can you guess which of the two is a personal hero? Corr-rect! Wallace it is!) Alfred Einstein, virtually a pop star in the scientific firmament, is but one very bright star in a constellation of equally impressive luminaries – Niels Bohr, Max Planck, Ernest Rutherford, Paul Dirac, James Clerk Maxwell – but it is Einstein who inhabits the popular imagination as the preeminent scientist of all time. (Though many will, of course, at least have a hazy idea, as I do, that Schrödinger and a cat also come into play somewhere.) Yet, after living for years with a physicist, I can confidently state that this much is true: No genius exists in splendid isolation. Each is perched on the shoulders of genii who preceded him. Or her. And so it unquestionably was with Humboldt, whose influences included Johann Wolfgang von Goethe, Captain Cook, Joseph Banks, Immanuel Kant, and indeed the very temper of the Age of Enlightenment. Yet Wulf’s biography focuses primarily on how Humboldt influenced his contemporaries and subsequent generations.  The most prominent of Humboldt’s followers (and that’s not too strong a term, really), was Darwin, who arguably would never have made that voyage on  The Beagle had he not been inspired by Humboldt’s account of his South American travels. Wulf devotes a chapter each to Darwin and four others who fell under Humboldt’s spell: Henry David Thoreau, George Perkins Marsh, Ernst Haeckel, and John Muir. Some of these Humboldtiphiles (Darwin, Thoreau, Muir), I knew something about, though admittedly it seems I knew less about Thoreau than I had thought, while of the remaining two, Marsh and Haeckel, I knew nothing. The chapter on Haeckel I particularly enjoyed, for I have a longstanding interest in Art Nouveau and its various architectural offshoots, and I immediately perceived how Haeckel’s wonderful fusion of art and science became the wellspring for many artists in the new (20th) century. Look at Gaudi’s Casa Batlló and then look at Haeckel’s illustrations of radiolarians (microscopic sea creatures) and the similarities are almost breathtaking. Why, that famous unfinished cathedral in Barcelona is but a radiolarian writ large!In short, I came away not just with a very good idea of Humboldt’s life after reading The Invention of Nature, but also was treated to five succinct mini-biographies of his most influential acolytes. Looking over that group provides a good sense of how all-encompassing Humboldt’s polymath grasp was: he influenced natural scientists, philosopher poets, conservationists, preservationists, earth scientists, artists, and even politicians and kings. Oh, and to add a bit more to this grandiose mix, Humboldt’s friends and contemporaries included the likes of Thomas Jefferson, Simon Bolivar, Joseph Hooker, and practically the entire scientific and intellectual elite of his age, with whom he maintained a voluminous correspondence.But again….that energy! Reading of Humboldt’s travels, experiments, indefatigable correspondence, and the breadth of his expertise practically made my head spin. Wulf makes the point – repeatedly – that perhaps Humboldt’s most singular legacy was his ability to synthesize information from areas which, today, are broken into discrete fields, such as climatology, volcanology, botany, biology, geology, meteorology, seismology, and paleontology, just to name a few. Those fields were all given a hearty kick-start by Humboldt’s grand synthesis, his Cosmos. It is this great overarching view of nature that inspired those that followed. Reading (but, admittedly, not entirely comprehending) how Humboldt achieved this was inspirational. A couple of final notes: firstly, the illustrations in the book were a delight. May I confess how much I enjoy well-selected (and nicely rendered) illustrations? I sometimes feel a little jolt of pleasure whenever I turn the page to find one. The chapter on Haeckel, for example, cried out for some of his radiolarian drawings. And there they were! Along with some equally fetching Medusae. Another not entirely unexpected joy was Wulf’s style. She has one! That is to say, I got a sense of 
her
 from reading this book, but she never intruded upon the subject, which always remained in focus. While it’s clear that Wulf must have loved researching and writing about Humboldt, she judiciously organized the material and trimmed her narrative, then wrote it in a lively yet elegant style that made me think, on the whole, that I would rather enjoy meeting this author. At any rate, I certainly want to read more of her work. "

141,038535066X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/18695911-daniel-chaikin,4,"It was interesting this evening, as I was driving home and listening to Michael Pollan read his latest book, to hear him refer to this book as if it were a major inspiration for him. Humboldt's view of nature as one entire interconnected thing. It is a beautiful concept, one he made at length and, as Wulf shows, elegantly and poetically. Darwin, who eventually met Humboldt, found Humboldt's writing inspirational for his scientific view of nature. Henry Thoreau devoured his writing, and found inspiration of his poetic view of the nature around his small pond. And John Muir, so enraptured he set off for Cuba and South America until he learned the tropical climates made him ill, found in Humboldt an inspiration for the environmental movement. And, I should mention, Simon Bolivar not only found in Humboldt a South American natural identity he raved about, but also used Humboldt's maps in his military campaigns. Wulf follows all these threads and more, in great detail. She rushes headlong through narratives, making them something of a roller coaster ride, and she spends time at the end wondering why the contemporary English speaking world has practically forgotten who Humboldt was or why anyone cares. What did he accomplish anyway, other than create some of the first detailed maps in a few hard to reach parts of South America? He was, it seems, primarily and powerfully, an inspiration. OK, he also invented the idea of nature. Well, maybe. I mean, Wulf makes the claim, over and over again, but it's a claim that reveals a major weakness in the book that bothered me a lot. She presents, ultimately, a very narrow in focus. So, yes, no question, Humboldt has a thought-provoking unified view on nature. But, was he the first? What was the intellectual world around him thinking, and what were the foundations? Is it possible nature as a unified thing was brought up before? Ever? by anyone? Wulf doesn't do context well, or didn't here. Really, mainly what she does is report stories in lengthy but also abbreviated forms. I liked her book and I really liked learning about Humbolt. It's not a perfect work, but it's not like the early 19th century intellectual world is an easy one to capture. So, flawed but still recommended, and who knows, you might be blown away like Michael Pollan.-----------------------------------------------60.

142,038535066X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/67736000-elizabeth-a-g,5,"Andrea Wulf's The Invention of Nature: Alexander von Humboldt's New World is an enjoyable, well-written and researched exploration of one man's vision of the world around him and how his restless spirit and determination gave us a deep appreciation of nature and presented the idea connectedness of all things organic and inorganic. Alexander von Humboldt is little remembered today and this book sheds a light on the scientist, ecologist. educator, and humanist who influenced later, better known naturalists like Darwin, Thoreau, George Perkins Marsh, Ernst Haeckel, and John Muir. Humboldt believed in the power of education and his writings and books were aimed toward a general audience rather than to specifically the scientific community. In fact he sought to show how nature is a living organism and that there is unity in scientific thought and the emotional response to nature that is expressed in poetry, art and music. He is also one of the first to warn that the activities of man in his commercial pursuits are bringing about the destruction of forests and creating climate change. In this book Wulf describes Humboldt's influence on future environmentalists and goes into some detail on these others...my only issue that perhaps the author could have shortened this section of the book by more of a summarization rather such detail (the subjects for a future book, perhaps). The epilogue of the book is excellent."

About half the book is padded with simplistic one chapter biopics of people purported to have been strongly influenced by Humboldt, often to an extent that is hard to credit. So according to Wulf: Goethe modelled Faust on Humboldt; Darwin would not have travelled on the Beagle and eventually developed evolutionary theory; John Muir wouldn't have become a environmentalist and saved the redwoods; Heckel wouldn't have created art that directly lead to Art Nouveau; and Bolívar wouldn't have become a revolutionary leading to the decolonization of Spain in Latin America. Wulf also repeatedly credits him with discovering climate change, centuries before it came to conscious awareness here, despite no evidence that this is true. Near the end of the book, she credits his current day obscurity (which is not really true) from a reaction against all things German after the 2nd World War, but if this was really correct, why are so many other German scientists and writers remembered and him not? Perhaps it is more to do with him never creating a lasting advance in knowledge via synthesis (a la Darwin).A great opportunity that is wasted by lack of in depth research and a critical appraisal of Humboldt's life.2-stars."

He inspired Charles Darwin and Henry David Thoreau. He was friends with Simon Bolivar. He invented the thermal lines on maps and came up with the idea of ecosystems and climate zones. He was a scientist before that was a word, and a naturalist before all the different disciplines of nature split into their factions. He believed nature needed to be understood with facts and poetry, felt as well as experienced. And he predicted climate change and deforestation... in the 1790s. I don’t usually enjoy biographies but I loved this book. It’s well-researched and well written. It’s a fascinating look at the adventures and contributions of a truly great man, and the grandfather of the environmental movement. He was the most famous man in the world at one point, and he’s been lost to history only because of 20th Century anti-German sentiment. Glad I read this and learnt about Humboldt. We owe him so much. "
145,038535066X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/155776-katharine,5,"Do you like science? Literature? History? Do you have strong emotional reactions to being in nature? Then you should read this book! I will boldly say this book is my favorite book of 2015 and I plan on recommending it to everyone I know. Part of the delight is that I had no knowledge of Humboldt before reading this book and I was amazed to learn how influential and inspiring he was to people in the 18th and 19th centuries. With direct links to American founding fathers, the Romantic Literature movement, and Simon Bolivar's fight for independence in South America, and Charles Darwin Humboldt is seed that many modern ideas are sprung from. Although I read a library copy of this book I promptly went out and bought my own personal copy because it's a book I will treasure for years to come."
146,038535066X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/8942931-steph-post,5,"A gorgeous book for science, art and literature fans alike. This is more than a biography of Humboldt (one of the most interesting scientists and explorers of all time)- it's a dedication to his legacy and an exploration of how his findings and philosophies eventually influenced everything from Art Nouveau to Walden to John Muir. Wide and diverse in breadth and scope, this reminds me of one of my favorite books- The Age of Wonder. "
147,038535066X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/637858-mike,4,"I never knew much about Humboldt, yet I found this book breathtaking. A man of natural science of the 19th century, multitalented, and as smart and as dedicated as they come. Substantial impact on Latin American knowledge, and shared experiences.Well written, insightful, an easy and smooth learning experience."

149,038535066X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5930747-hermien,5,That a man of such great vision can be almost forgotten now is amazing. I had no idea that the survival of the planet had preoccupied people that long ago - unfortunately to not enough effect. 
150,038535066X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3409532-april-does-feral-sometimes,4,"The book 'The Invention of Nature' is fascinating. It is more than a biography of Alexander Von Humboldt (1769-1859), who can be described as a polymath genius whose enthusiasm for travel and nature was as momentous for the development of as many branches of science that Albert Einstein (1879-1955) was because of his interest in physics. Yet, I have never heard of him until I read this book.Some early Western 19th-century proto-scientists labored all of their life in bleak obscurity until only after their deaths being recognized as major scientific brains and discoverers; others announced their work to newly created scientific societies only to be met with withering scorn. Some inventors were clearly crackpots with one great idea while others were intelligent driven members of respectable aristocrat families and upper-class merchants. (Almost all of these Great Men of Science upset their parents by refusing to study law or medicine in university! Humboldt was one of these children of disappointed parents. I have read a few other science histories, and I have noticed that almost all of these early scientists had parents hoping for a son who would become a doctor or lawyer. Just saying.)However, Humboldt became famous early in his lifetime and all doors were open to him. He met already famous people eager to speak with him, such as President Thomas Jefferson. Others who desired to call him friend went on to illustrious (and nefarious) careers as famous scientists in their own right such as Charles Darwin, well-known writers such as Henry David Thoreau, and Kings, Emperors and Prime Ministers such as Friedrich Wilhelm IV and George Canning, as well as leaders of political revolutions overthrowing those before-mentioned Kings and Emperors such as Simón Bolívar. Humboldt himself was a liberal and he supported the overthrow of the aristocracy, but his income primarily was from a pension paid by two Prussian kings after he went through his own inheritance. He obviously was charismatic, moving easily between many different cultures and social classes, from South America to Europe to Russia.After returning from a five-year exploration of South America with tens of thousands of astronomical, geological and meteorological observations and specimens, he published his first book, 'Essay on the Geography of Plants' at age 32, dedicating it to Johann Wolfgang Goethe, his fellow polymath and best friend (after his brother Wilhelm von Humboldt, who founded the University of Berlin after a career as the Prussian ambassador to Vienna and Britain). The book combined with his achievements and personality made him a famous man, perhaps the most famous respected natural scientist in the world. However, full of energy, wanderlust and curiosity, Humboldt moved on to more explorations crossing over the frontlines of many European wars between France, Prussia, Britain, and Spain, and maneuvering through countries on three continents which were undergoing political revolutions, observing volcano eruptions while mountain climbing without oxygen tanks (yes, he and his companions fainted occasionally) enduring nasty mosquitos, while exposing and warning the public of the dreadful environmental destruction of earth wherever men used the land for agriculture, mining and lumber.Humboldt lived to the age of 89, still receiving famous visitors and writing thousands of letters a month up to his death. His books on the natural sciences, illustrated with his own and other explorers' beautiful art and drawings, inspired Darwin, Thoreau, Ernst Haeckel, John Muir, to name a few. Rivers, mountains, towns and other landmarks were named after him, and he is mentioned in thousands of famous novels. Yet most Americans today have never heard of him, probably because of World War I and WWII having been fought against Germany as an enemy of the United States. I think we should bring this man back into the spotlight and make him a famous hero scientist again. This book is an excellent start.Below I've included some Wikipedia links about the early naturalists, Humboldt, and many of the famous intellectuals, writers and scientists he inspired in later centuries, in hope that these thumbnail histories will convince you, gentle reader, to pick up this book:http://www.ranker.com/list/notable-na...https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alexa...https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kosmo...https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Georg...https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Man_a...https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ernst...https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kunst...https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_..."
151,038535066X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2527265-david,5,"It is a sad commentary on our age (or maybe me personally) that, when I am about to get really enthusiastic about something, as in this case, I feel the need to make clear that I am NOT being sarcastic. HOLY MOLY! WOW! What an awesome book! Just reading it made me happy to be alive! Really! It was a wonderful break from the dreary procession of bad news parading out of every media orifice! (Note to self: improve your imagery.) I neglected other self-improving projects to read this book, and then was sad when I finished it! Worthy of all awards and accolades! The world would be a better place if everyone was forced to read it, at gunpoint if necessary! Don't just stand (or sit) there, go out and get a copy right away!I love narratives about news events, scandals, and personalities that once famous, but now forgotten. This is one of them, of a man known by everyone when living, celebrated, called without irony the greatest man who had ever lived, sought out by tedious rich people and aristocrats, pestered for autographs, and recipient of mountains of admiring old-school paper letters. Intrepid and death-defying explorer, partisan of liberty, deplorer of slavery and cruelty, widely-admired prose stylist, polyglot, polymath. Honored by having towns, counties, and other jurisdictions named after him. Further honored by having a Pacific Ocean current named after him and, even cooler still, also a critter described by Wikipedia as a ""large predatory squid"". His books were anticipated with an enthusiasm which today, sadly, only occurs with certain entries in the ""Young Adult"" market. Pirated translations of his works were rushed to market to satisfy bottomless demand. He was even -- dare I say it? -- the Werner Herzog of his age (ok, yes, Humboldt was Prussian and Herzog Bavarian, but let's not nitpick). As young men, both were driven by some inner demon to seek out the most pestilential, soggy, disease-ridden, and predator-filled sections of inner South America, and came back to ""civilization"", such as it is, with precious insights and striking images, which changed the way people looked at the world. When older, both continued to push into far corners of the world (including, in both cases, Siberia) at a time of life when most of us find it increasingly difficult to get out of bed.Humboldt actually had a life that was both exciting and well-documented, so writing about him was a little like shooting fish in barrel. I don't wish to belittle the author's achievement: the narrative always moves along at an entertaining clip, even during those periods when Humboldt had to spend some time toadying up to various Kaisers in order to keep the old mazuma rolling in. I also enjoyed the last few chapters, which switched tone from standard biography of one man to mini chapter-long biographies of various men (including Simon Bolivar, Charles Darwin, Henry David Thoreau, and John Muir), with a concentration on how Humboldt changed the lives and directions of their thoughts. The point, I believe, was that, even though his name is no longer on everybody's lips, Humboldt is still very much with us.To repeat: delightful. Read it.The only thing that I didn't like about this book was the realization at the conclusion that, no matter what achievements I, uh, achieve with the balance of my life, I will never, ever, have a large predatory squid named after me. "
152,038535066X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6938150-marie-paule,5,"When in Berlin a few years ago, I came by the magnificent building of the Humboldt University. And I know that quite a few plants are named '... humboldtiensis'. Although I have a PhD in Science I knew nothing more about Alexander von Humboldt. What a shame. On Sep 14, 1869, the 100th birthday of this brilliant man, there were celebrations all over the world: Europe, Africa, Australia and the America's. More than 100 years later, he seems to be forgotten. What a life he has led. In his younger years, he became a lifetime friend of Goethe, who, besides being a poet, was very interested in botanics and geology. They were both interested in the dualism between the external and internal world (Kant and his 'Kritik der reinen Vernunft'). Is the tree in my garden a real tree, or my idea of a tree? Humboldt gradually shifted from pure empirical research towards his own interpretation of nature: he mixed detailed scientific facts with the emotional reactions they invoked. He thought a great deal about 'Life'. A machine can be taken apart and reassembled, but you can't do this with an animal. Why? Von Humboldt’s most important journey was a 5 year-trip through South America. There, he developed the first concept of 'ecosystems' (long before we knew this particular word), explaining that geology, climate, micro-organisms, plants and animals all influence each other. When he travelled through the plains of Los llanos in Venezuela in 1800 (!), he warned for the destructive effects of human activity (large scale agriculture of commercial crops, mining, ...) on the ecosystems. At the same time, he pointed out that the overexploitation of local ecosystems had disastrous effects on the human population as well: slavery, unhealthy working conditions, a shortage of local healthy foods, exploitation of large groups of have-nots by the happy few….. Sounds familiar, no?Does it surprise you that Alexander von Humboldt became one of the best liftetime friends of Simon Bolivar, who fought to liberate South America from its Spanish colonists? All through his live, von Humboldt fought against slavery. He so longed to visit India, but the British government denied him a passport, because they knew how he felt about slavery and he was not willing to compromise…. For the British, he remained a dangerous anti-colonialist actor. Later in life, he made a great journey through Russia, all the way to Mongolia. He held his 60th birthday party in … the pharmacy of Lenin’s grandfather. After his return from South America, von Humboldt lived in Paris and in London, where he met the famous scientists of his time. He inspired a lot of scientists and writers of his time, among others Charles Darwin, Henry David Thoreau, George Perkin Marsh, Ernst Haeckel and John Muir. Indeed, what a life and what a talent… At the end of his life, von Humboldt wrote his magnum opus ‘Kosmos’: an overview of his own and other scientific findings, but above all, his opinion about the correlations and relationships between different scientific theories, and the interrelation between science, art and sociology. For von Humboldt, there were no boundaries between scientific domains or between science and humanities. In short: von Humboldt was a scientist who was far ahead of his time and who remains a lighting example for us all."

There is no limit to how many tags you can list, and they facilitate searching tremendously, so I’ve taken to tagging my books extensively to create indexes to help bring the book back to mind. I felt I was not up to the task of doing justice to Alexander von Humboldt with a humble review of my own. A man who was clearly a genius and well ahead of his time, and truly what we often refer to as a Renaissance Man. So this is what I have in lieu of a review, presenting my list of aide mémoire tags...

154,038535066X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4070288-jo,4,The first 2/3 of this book are 5 star material. Wulf vividly depicts Humboldt's travels and his personality. He is a fascinating subject. The last sections really suffers in comparison. Her choice of figures to investigate his legacy through their biography is both too focused and too limited to be truly effective. While I understand her desire to dive deep into Humboldt's influence shoehorning in 5 mini bios of other figures into the end of the book moves the book away from its true center. Leaving Humboldt behind made me want to throw myself on the ground in the middle of the town square and yell about things breaking per my hero AvH.
155,038535066X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4739424-mal-warwick,5,"He was the most famous man in the world, and more places around the world are named after him than anyone else. To many of the giants of his time — Johann Wolfgang von Goethe, Thomas Jefferson, Simon Bolivar, Charles Darwin, Henry David Thoreau — he was a colossus whose genius overshadowed their own. He was the first to describe the web of life on Earth, foreshadowing James Lovelock’s Gaia hypothesis, and the first to describe the impact of human activity on the world’s climate. His books, which read like poetry, “were so popular that people bribed booksellers to be the first to receive copies.” Eleven years after his death at age 89, the centennial of his birth was observed by hundreds of thousands of people in huge celebrations around the world.Chances are, you’ve never heard of him.His name was Alexander von Humboldt, and he died in 1859. He had first described climate change in 1800. He “gave us his concept of nature itself.”Andrea Wulf’s engrossing new biography, The Invention of Nature, brings this extraordinary man into the spotlight again after a century and a half. It’s about time. His may well have been one of the finest minds in human history.Humboldt, born into a prosperous family of Prussian aristocrats shortly after the American Civil War, rebelled against the constraints on his life and set out on his own unique path. Though he became best known as a naturalist, world traveler, and author, his interests reached into a far wider range of human endeavor, and Cosmos, the multi-volume book he began to write at the age of sixty-five, encompassed virtually the whole of human knowledge, from botany, geology, and zoology to astronomy, philosophy, and, in effect, the new science he invented: ecology. (Though he didn’t invent that term, his work was the inspiration for the man who did later in the nineteenth century.)As Wulf notes, “Humboldt took his readers from outer space to earth, and then from the surface of the planet into its inner core. He discussed comets, the Milky Way and the solar system as well as terrestrial magnetism, volcanoes and the snow line of mountains. He wrote about the migration of the human species, about plants and animals and the microscopic organisms that live in stagnant water or on the weathered surface of rocks.” Never before, and never since (to the best of my knowledge), has a single individual mastered so many fields of inquiry so successfully that his contemporaries regarded him as a force of nature. And, in an age when most of humanity lived in thrall to organized religion, Humboldt didn’t once mention God in all the many thousands of pages of his books. Instead, he spoke of a “wonderful web of organic life.”Wulf’s biography of this astonishing man is by no means unreservedly positive. She describes the shortcomings of his personality in embarrassing detail: his tendency to talk nonstop at a rapid rate for hours without permitting interruptions of any kind, regardless of the stature of his listeners; his seeming inability to understand the feelings of others and to show empathy for their pain; his venomous gossiping; and his inability to accept criticism. Alexander von Humboldt was not a nice man.Andrea Wulf is an historian and writer who lives in Britain. The Invention of Nature is her fifth book."
156,038535066X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/93114967-barbara,4,"I had some familiarity with von Humboldt before reading Andrea Wulf's book - intrepid young explorer of South America, well known in his time, ocean currents and rivers named for him, information source for Thomas Jefferson about Spanish colonial America. Obviously, an interesting guy, so when I saw an audio copy of The Invention of Nature: Alexander von Humboldt's New World on sale, I grabbed it. Turned out to be a good decision on my part. Von Humboldt was so much more than just that adventurous young man I'd heard of, and Wulf does an excellent job of filling out the picture and his impact.During that extended exploration of South America 200 years ago, while ranging through much of modern day Venezuela, Columbia, Ecuador and Peru, von Humboldt developed concepts of nature, climate and ecology that we take as ""new"" in the late 20th/early 21st centuries. He determined, for instance, that the drop in the level of Lake Valencia was tied to the destruction of the surrounding forest to clear land for farming. He made the connection that the absence of the trees dramatically reduced the ability of the land to retain water. While climbing Mt. Chimborazo in the Andes he developed the concept of altitude-based climate zones that are consistent around the globe. Comparing plants he found on the South American Atlantic coast with those growing on the African Atlantic coast, he intuited that the two land masses must once have been one.These were not simply casual observations for von Humboldt; after returning to Europe he spent the rest of his life as a scientist and author, successfully seeking out the data to support his theories. It's impossible here to summarize his many brilliant insights, but as one example, his perceptions of the devastating outcomes of human's impact on the natural world were prescient of the reality we experience today. Through his writings he influenced many key thinkers of the 19th century, including Darwin, Thoreau and Muir.In truth, I found the biographical information about those scientists and naturalists who built their own theories on his foundations to be more lengthy than necessary, and the latter part of the book dragged a bit for that reason. But overall, reading the story of von Humboldt, a polymath with the ability to pull together what he observed in multiple scientific fields to develop comprehensive theories, was time well spent. He deserves more recognition today."
157,038535066X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/35482263-gumble-s-yard,4,"Alexander Von Humboldt ... was one of the last polymaths, and died at a time when scientific disciplines were hardening into tightly fenced and more specialised fields. Consequently his more holistic approach - a scientific method that included art, history, poetry and politics alongside hard data - has fallen out of favour ..... One of [his] greatest achievements had been to make science accessible and popular ......... in a world where we draw a sharp line between the sciences and the arts, between he subjective and the objective, Humboldt's insight that we can only truly understand nature by using our imaginations makes him a visionaryAward winning biography of Alexander Von Humboldt, of who I was previously familiar from the fictional biography Measuring the World. Wulf ksets out to show that: he was a true polymath, perhaps the last to really range across all scientific disciplines; that at a time when science was becoming increasingly focused on classifications he remained able to see the big picture both across as well as within scientific disciplines; that at a time when romantic poets and data driven scientists were starting to grow in mutual incomprehension, his method of observing and describing nature in person and in capturing what he observed both in rigorous data and evocative descriptions, enabled him to be lionised by individuals on both sides of that divide; that in his pioneering work on the inter-connectedness of natural ecosystems and on the impact of human actions on those systems, he should be regarded as the founder of the environmental movement. She also is keen to emphasise his influence on others - starting with his almost lifelong friendship with and influence on the work of Goethe. Wulf writes chapters on each of Simon Bolivar, Charles Darwin and Henry Thoreau, cantering on their achievements but at all times seeking for the considerable impact Von Humboldt had on them. In perhaps the only slightly false note in the book, it finishes with more than fifty pages on his seemingly more tangential influence on three lesser known figures whose main achievements were after his death. Overall though this is a fascinating and well written account."
158,038535066X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1241339-clif,5,"Chicago's public radio station, WBEZ, had a program on the statue of Alexander Humboldt in the park named after him, in a neighborhood named after him. The program speculated that not one in a thousand passersby would know who he was. I've no doubt that's true. My only association of the name was with the Humboldt Current that brings cold water up the west coast of South America from Antarctica. With that as background, this book floored me.Humboldt was to the 19th century as Einstein was to the 20th. It's fair to say that everyone knew his name even decades after his death in 1859. He was a powerful influence on Charles Darwin, John Muir and Henry David Thoreau. On the seminal voyage aboard the Beagle that took Darwin around the world, his notes are peppered with ""as Humboldt said..."" whenever something was found that confirmed Humboldt's previous discoveries. Thoreau was a Humboldt devotee.During his lifetime, and he loved life, lectures given by Humboldt were packed, whether in America or Europe. His books were best sellers and he was personally acquainted with everyone who was anyone, from Napoleon (one of the few that didn't like Humboldt) through the royalty of Europe to Simón Bolívar, the liberator of South America, and on down from there. He was a font of knowledge on the natural world, was driven by curiosity and would even at an advanced age rush to attend the lectures of someone who knew something he did not, sitting in an audience of college students furiously taking notes as he listened.He had only one foible - he could not stop talking. Only the most determined could get in a comment, but few wished to do so as it would, but only possibly, interrupt the flow of knowledge they wanted to hear. Single his entire life with never any indication of an attraction to women, he bonded easily with men, forming lifelong friendships and exploring for months on end with a partner.His physical endurance and health were phenomenal. He climbed snow covered mountains with none of the equipment we know today, even above levels where oxygen should be used. As others would fall victim to tropical diseases, Humboldt was up at dawn ready to go. Clouds of mosquitoes for days and nights on end were no deterrent if there was a new plant, animal or rock formation to be examined.Not only did he crave knowledge, he wanted everyone to share in it. His Personal Narrative of the Equinoctial Regions of the New Continent (South America) was devoured by a public as eager to find out what had been found as we today would read the account of a person visiting another solar system. And, speaking of outer space, he took that subject on as well in his quest to tie everything together, writing the multi-volume Cosmos as he neared the end of his life.As Andrea Wulf makes clear in her title, The Invention of Nature, Humboldt was one of the first to come up with the concept of ecosystems, the interconnection of the natural world that allow an environment to thrive if left alone, and change it even to the point of destruction when this or that part is altered. While few of us today know of Humboldt, we live in the conceptual world of nature he created.This book is a wonderful wide-ranging history that covers not only Humboldt's life, but contains brief overviews of the lives and work of Darwin, Thoreau, George Perkins Marsh, Ernst Haeckel and John Muir in relation to Humboldt. Filled with adventure and excitement, Wulf perfectly captures a man to which we are all indebted and one who would be delighted to meet any of us and relate his discoveries.Sad to say, none of his books are in the network of public libraries including the one in my own town."
159,038535066X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7175349-david,5,"Didn't finish before it was due back to the library, but I read enough to be dazzled by Humboldt. First, I must praise this author for writing this book, bringing this once famous and celebrated figure back to our attention. The title is apparently not as hyperbolic as it seems, as her subject really does seem to have given both the public and the scientific community the idea of nature as an interconnected whole. No summary I could offer will do justice to the book, so you will need to read it yourself. And if it is not the kind of book you would read, then at least go to a bookstore or the library and skim enough to get some idea of it, because it is worth knowing about. (Note: yes, this is who Humboldt county in California is named after, and the University in Berlin, and the current in the Pacific Ocean, and many other things besides.)Here's a guy who got Goethe all stirred up, who explored the Amazon and the Andes, loved to get close to an erupting volcano, inspired Simon Bolivar to rebel against Spain, admired the American Revolution but could not understand why his friend Thomas Jefferson did not free the slaves, got Thoreau interested in nature, etc., etc. Seems to have been gay (avant la lettre), as his attachments to other men seem to have been unusual enough to cause his family some concern. Certainly his companions stuck with him through thick and thin, at risk to their lives with some frequency. My favorite is the poor guy who survives fever in the Amazon, crawling along a precarious mountain trail in a howling snowstorm, a hurricane at sea, just for a few examples, only to be berated for not working hard enough to publish their discoveries when they finally get back to Paris. Our hero could wear you out, apparently, not that anyone seemed to mind. And he was enough of a superstar that the King of Prussia kept him at court later in life even though it was no secret that he didn't believe in Monarchy and would support any revolution that might overthrow his patron. Think about that: he didn't worry about pleasing the King, the King worried about keeping him around.The book may seem too thorough to some readers (e.g., me), but when you think about the many volumes written by Humboldt, it's easy to see that she must have felt like this was the short version of the story. So worth checking out! "
160,038535066X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/180643-jim-coughenour,3,"A fine (re)introduction to Humboldt and his prescient ecological view of nature: that everything is connected and that humanity is capable of destroying the world it's been given. Humboldt appears as a brilliant, even heroic, transitional figure between the Enlightenment and the Romantic movement, between the positivism of science and the inwardness of art, between Goethe and Darwin. Wulf is also good at demonstrating his influence on other naturalists, not only Darwin but Thoreau, George Perkins Marsh (new to me), Ernst Haeckel and John Muir.Because I'd just finished reading On the Move: A Life, I couldn't help being reminded of Oliver Sacks, who also stood outside his own profession of neurology to capture the human and artistic dimension of knowledge, creating a new kind of scientific literature in the process. I was also intrigued to find out that Humboldt never married. He claimed his passion was only for science, but he was rarely without the company of another charismatic young man. His equally famous brother, Willem, ""disliked his brother's intense friendships – probably a mixture of jealousy and a concern for what might have seemed the inappropriate nature of these connections."" And finally, to my private embarrassment, I realized I've confused Alexander and Willem my whole life. (Humboldt University in Berlin is named after both of them.)The dark irony is that, although Humboldt was revered his warnings about how humanity was destroying its own environment were largely ignored. What should be obvious to everyone is still the stuff of partisan politics, and the grim conviction deepens that nothing will be done until it is too late, that it is in fact too late already."
161,038535066X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5871422-elena,5,"Andrea Wulf paints an appealing picture of the brilliant Alexander von Humboldt, an Enlightenment titan who climbed the highest mountains he could find with heavy instruments to make precise measurements, not just air pressure, but he had some kind of cyanograph to measure just how blue the sky was at different altitudes. He discussed science with Thomas Jefferson, whom he admired on one level, but AvH was firmly opposed to any form of slavery. He admired the indigenous peoples he met while exploring South America, and reported on the magnificent ruins of ancient American civilizations and the complex languages of the peoples he encountered in the colorful jungles, which he much perfered to his native Berlin. He deplored the degradation of the New World ecology by the mining and cash crops of the Spanish. Wulf did extensive research on his influence on Darwin and the theory of evolution which he anticipated with studies of fossils, on Goethe who put a bit of him into Faust, on Simon Bolivar who discussed concepts of political freedom with him, on Henry David Thoreau who's love of nature was nurtured by reading AvH's books on the interconnected-ness of nature, and on John Muir who read and annotated his books. Wulf found direct connections to show how his love of nature even inspired the Art Deco movement. His fame was universal, his name attached to currents, mountains, counties, cities all across the US and Latin America. It was the anti-German sentiments of World War I, intensified in World War II that cause his fame to be mostly extinguished along with admiration for German science and culture in general. Time to appreciate the man who pushed through legislation in Prussia that any slave, including any American slave, who lands on Prussian soil becomes a free person. "
162,038535066X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6432978-bfisher,4,"Alexander von Humboldt was one of the most prominent scientists of the nineteenth century. When he died in 1859, tens of thousands of mourners marched in his funeral procession. A staggering number of geographical features were named after him in his lifetime. It seems appropriate that the namesake Humboldt River, one of the largest rivers in the Great Basin of North America, disappears from sight in the Humboldt Sinks, much as Humboldt’s reputation has disappeared from modern popular memory.Yet, it is not fitting that Humboldt should be forgotten to our age. Andrea Wulf describes his roles as a founder of biogeography, inventor of isotherms, developer of the concept of ecological systems and the interdependence of life, and as the first scientist to recognize the danger of anthropogenic climate change. He influenced Darwin, Thoreau and John Muir. We recognize and adopt his ideas but have forgotten the person. This book is a useful recovery of the core importance to science and society of Humboldt's work. Unfortunately, in its coverage of Humboldt the scientist, Humboldt the person gets short shrift, aside from a few brief hints. That is my one quibble with this book."
163,038535066X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7283807-ben,1,"Desperately in need of an editor. Perhaps the author could not find enough source material on Humboldt himself. The majority of the book consists of capsule biographies and Wikipedia-level explanations of other people, such as Darwin or Muir. The author bombastically credits everything good to Humboldt. A typical phrasing, repeated dozens if not hundreds of times, goes like, ""Humboldt generously shared his library with X, and despite his own debts supported X financially. X praised Humboldt as 'one of the greatest scientists of his generation.'"" There is very little insight added to the material. The author does not bring any skepticism to the table, and is entirely credulous when it comes to Humboldt. Unfortunately, this means that you can't trust what few conclusions are drawn. I only finished it because I had an audiobook. Not worth reading. "

167,038535066X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/96806543-the-colonial,3,"Alexander von Humboldt’s name can be seen throughout the world’s streets, trails, universities, and rivers, yet the man and his mystique are rarely brought to our actual attention. By the early-nineteenth century, Humboldt had become what today we would call both an Environmentalist and Renaissance Man—as he was a scientist, explorer, naturalist, botanist, and colleague of renowned and like-minded intellectuals of the age. Andrea Wulf weaves all of these traits together in order to discuss Humboldt’s life journey and the groundbreaking ideas that he introduced our world to—some far too ahead of the times for the likes of his contemporaries.The first half of the book appropriately covers Humboldt’s beginnings, from his boyhood and ancestry in Prussia, to his rise in education and esteem in the scientific world. Wulf devotes much attention to Humboldt’s standing in the political world as a whole, where the botanist is doted upon by courtly officials and diplomats from such prosperous world powers as Russia, Great Britain, Spain, and the United States. He is honored by the prestigious Royal Society of London as a foreign member, and throughout his remarkable life he meets the likes of such prominent figures as Joseph Banks, Benjamin Smith Barton, Thomas Jefferson, Benjamin Rush, and a young and upcoming Charles Darwin.Unfortunately, Wulf’s enthusiasm for her subject is too broad in its approach, as she pivots into the second half of the book by focusing on the great men that were influenced by Humboldt—all of which include famous scientists, authors, environmentalists, and inventors. This is collectively balanced out by her engaging and imaginative prose, where she fortunately excels at using her fascination with Humboldt as well as that of nature itself for her inspiration. Wulf majestically explains each and every tour and journey that Humboldt embarked upon, as well as the meetings he held with prominent men of his times:…Humboldt informed Jefferson, where he had collected plants, made astronomical observations, found hieroglyphs of ancient civilizations deep in the rainforest and had amassed important data from the colonial archives of Mexico City. Humboldt also wrote to James Madison, the Secretary of State and Jefferson’s closest political ally, declaring that ‘having witnessed the great spectacle of the majestic Andes and the grandeur of the physical world I intended to enjoy the spectacle of a free people.’ Politics and nature belonged together–an idea that Humboldt would be discussing with the Americans.With almost the final half of the book being dedicated to Thoreau, Darwin, George Perkins Marsh, John Muir, and Ernst Haeckel, the reader unfortunately loses interest on the main subject of Humboldt’s adventurous life—leaving a sense of unfulfillment. It’s apparent that Wulf has so much more to tell on Alexander von Humboldt’s life, which is almost frustrating since the reader is constantly engrossed and intrigued in his story, due to the benefit of her writing style and equal fascination. Apart from the unnecessary segue into like-minded men, there is still much to be gained by the modern reader from reading Wulf’s work on an environmental pioneer and enlightened man of many qualifications and achievements. Maps are provided, a useful “Note on Humboldt’s Publications”, as well as helpful illustrations found throughout the text.

168,038535066X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3007401-biblio-files-takingadayoff,5,"Apparently, in much of Europe, Alexander von Humboldt is as well known as Charles Darwin is to those of us in the United States and Britain. A naturalist and explorer, Humboldt took his upper class education in 18th century Prussia and applied it to becoming a Renaissance man in 19th century Europe and America. Humboldt was especially interested in plant life, but he was an extremely energetic and focused person who also enjoyed studying all forms of life on earth, as well as philosophy, literature and poetry, astronomy, and languages. He loved participating in the frequent salons of the time and became friends with Goethe, and later with Simon Bolivar in his pre-revolutionary days traveling in Europe. He reached out to Thomas Jefferson as a fellow scientist (Jefferson was not only a gentleman farmer, but a scientific farmer as well) and procured an invitation to stay at the President's mansion while he visited Washington, D.C. Later, in Paris, he tried to play diplomat with Napoleon, but was not successful. Still, Napoleon was said to be impressed with his scientific works and to have read Humboldt's books.Humboldt's claim to fame as a scientist is to have been one of the first to see plant life, animal life, the cosmos, geology, everything, as a part of a single ecosystem, rather than as individual and not necessarily connected pieces. This is so basic to our way of thinking today that it seems obvious and not particularly remarkable. But it is as fundamentally different a way of looking at the world as Darwin's idea of natural selection was. Andrea Wulf's biography describes Humboldt's studies, travels, accomplishments -- you feel as if Humboldt would be quite an engaging, if hard to keep up with, fellow. After reading The Invention of Nature, the question that still nagged at me was how I had never learned of this whirlwind before. "
169,038535066X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/241691-kay,4,"“Temperament is destiny,” or so the proverb says, though I have always been suspicious of such broad sweeps of rhetoric. Still, this saying kept echoing through my head as I read this book, for I could not help but wonder: “What makes such a man as Alexander von Humboldt? What motivates him, drives him forward, helps him overcome obstacles, or, perhaps even ultimately, is his very undoing?” It seemed as I read of Humboldt’s life, passions, and seemingly boundless energy, that he must have sprung, almost Athena-like, from his mother’s womb, set from the get-go on a trajectory that would send him around the world in an unceasing round of exploration, research, and writing. Certainly, the advantages of his upbringing and background helped: a stable home, wealth, attentive (if distant) parents, exacting tutors, a library at his disposal. Yet there are other men and women that I can think of, such as the naturalist Alfred Russel Wallace or the explorer Mary Kingsley who had few such advantages, but, like Humboldt, possessed an urge for going, a forward momentum, an insatiable curiosity, and above all, seemingly boundless resources of optimism, courage, and self-reliance. They were, I can’t help but feel, the chosen few, blessed with a rare combination of temperament, intelligence, and energy. It is a magic formula – and, oh, if only I possessed it! The title of this book could well have been “Why Humboldt Matters,” and it’s scarcely a spoiler to reveal that he matters very much, and indeed is perhaps more relevant than ever. Although Humboldt is little thought about or even known about today, in his time he was the most famous scientist in the world - and that was before the term ""scientist"" even existed. It was Humboldt's accounts of his travels in South America and Russia that most captured the public's attention, but among Enlightenment-era and 19th century intellectual circles, his reputation as the authority on a wide range of scientific matters was unquestioned. His vision of nature as an integrated, interconnected and interdependent force, one, furthermore, indifferent to and even damaged by man is what most influenced thinkers of his time, and it is this complex and far-sighted vision which resonates today, perhaps now more than ever in the face of impending environmental threats.Wulf's explanation of why Humboldt fell into relative obscurity during the 20th century, particularly in the U.S.A., wasn't entirely convincing. She cites anti-German sentiment in the wake of the First World War, the fragmentation of science into specialized fields, and the fact that ""Humboldt is not known for a single fact or a discovery but for his worldview. His vision of nature has passed into our consciousness as if by osmosis."" But I think another reason lies within the pages of Wulf's book: Humboldt was the original ""torch bearer,"" but that torch has been taken up by many, some of whom Wulf devotes chapters to, such as Charles Darwin and John Muir. These figures, rather than Humboldt, occupy a larger place in the current public imagination. However, in contemplating Humboldt's scientific eclipse, once again I fell to musing about our fickleness in choosing heroes. Charles Darwin, hero (or blasphemer, depending on your perspective) is universally known if perhaps less than universally understood. (Hence the “blasphemer” part, one could argue.) His less-well-heeled contemporary, Alfred Russel Wallace, simultaneous and independent formulator of the theory of natural selection, while more recently enjoying a bit of an upswing, is still a relative unknown. (And can you guess which of the two is a personal hero? Corr-rect! Wallace it is!) Alfred Einstein, virtually a pop star in the scientific firmament, is but one very bright star in a constellation of equally impressive luminaries – Niels Bohr, Max Planck, Ernest Rutherford, Paul Dirac, James Clerk Maxwell – but it is Einstein who inhabits the popular imagination as the preeminent scientist of all time. (Though many will, of course, at least have a hazy idea, as I do, that Schrödinger and a cat also come into play somewhere.) Yet, after living for years with a physicist, I can confidently state that this much is true: No genius exists in splendid isolation. Each is perched on the shoulders of genii who preceded him. Or her. And so it unquestionably was with Humboldt, whose influences included Johann Wolfgang von Goethe, Captain Cook, Joseph Banks, Immanuel Kant, and indeed the very temper of the Age of Enlightenment. Yet Wulf’s biography focuses primarily on how Humboldt influenced his contemporaries and subsequent generations.  The most prominent of Humboldt’s followers (and that’s not too strong a term, really), was Darwin, who arguably would never have made that voyage on  The Beagle had he not been inspired by Humboldt’s account of his South American travels. Wulf devotes a chapter each to Darwin and four others who fell under Humboldt’s spell: Henry David Thoreau, George Perkins Marsh, Ernst Haeckel, and John Muir. Some of these Humboldtiphiles (Darwin, Thoreau, Muir), I knew something about, though admittedly it seems I knew less about Thoreau than I had thought, while of the remaining two, Marsh and Haeckel, I knew nothing. The chapter on Haeckel I particularly enjoyed, for I have a longstanding interest in Art Nouveau and its various architectural offshoots, and I immediately perceived how Haeckel’s wonderful fusion of art and science became the wellspring for many artists in the new (20th) century. Look at Gaudi’s Casa Batlló and then look at Haeckel’s illustrations of radiolarians (microscopic sea creatures) and the similarities are almost breathtaking. Why, that famous unfinished cathedral in Barcelona is but a radiolarian writ large!In short, I came away not just with a very good idea of Humboldt’s life after reading The Invention of Nature, but also was treated to five succinct mini-biographies of his most influential acolytes. Looking over that group provides a good sense of how all-encompassing Humboldt’s polymath grasp was: he influenced natural scientists, philosopher poets, conservationists, preservationists, earth scientists, artists, and even politicians and kings. Oh, and to add a bit more to this grandiose mix, Humboldt’s friends and contemporaries included the likes of Thomas Jefferson, Simon Bolivar, Joseph Hooker, and practically the entire scientific and intellectual elite of his age, with whom he maintained a voluminous correspondence.But again….that energy! Reading of Humboldt’s travels, experiments, indefatigable correspondence, and the breadth of his expertise practically made my head spin. Wulf makes the point – repeatedly – that perhaps Humboldt’s most singular legacy was his ability to synthesize information from areas which, today, are broken into discrete fields, such as climatology, volcanology, botany, biology, geology, meteorology, seismology, and paleontology, just to name a few. Those fields were all given a hearty kick-start by Humboldt’s grand synthesis, his Cosmos. It is this great overarching view of nature that inspired those that followed. Reading (but, admittedly, not entirely comprehending) how Humboldt achieved this was inspirational. A couple of final notes: firstly, the illustrations in the book were a delight. May I confess how much I enjoy well-selected (and nicely rendered) illustrations? I sometimes feel a little jolt of pleasure whenever I turn the page to find one. The chapter on Haeckel, for example, cried out for some of his radiolarian drawings. And there they were! Along with some equally fetching Medusae. Another not entirely unexpected joy was Wulf’s style. She has one! That is to say, I got a sense of 
her
 from reading this book, but she never intruded upon the subject, which always remained in focus. While it’s clear that Wulf must have loved researching and writing about Humboldt, she judiciously organized the material and trimmed her narrative, then wrote it in a lively yet elegant style that made me think, on the whole, that I would rather enjoy meeting this author. At any rate, I certainly want to read more of her work. "

171,038535066X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/18695911-daniel-chaikin,4,"It was interesting this evening, as I was driving home and listening to Michael Pollan read his latest book, to hear him refer to this book as if it were a major inspiration for him. Humboldt's view of nature as one entire interconnected thing. It is a beautiful concept, one he made at length and, as Wulf shows, elegantly and poetically. Darwin, who eventually met Humboldt, found Humboldt's writing inspirational for his scientific view of nature. Henry Thoreau devoured his writing, and found inspiration of his poetic view of the nature around his small pond. And John Muir, so enraptured he set off for Cuba and South America until he learned the tropical climates made him ill, found in Humboldt an inspiration for the environmental movement. And, I should mention, Simon Bolivar not only found in Humboldt a South American natural identity he raved about, but also used Humboldt's maps in his military campaigns. Wulf follows all these threads and more, in great detail. She rushes headlong through narratives, making them something of a roller coaster ride, and she spends time at the end wondering why the contemporary English speaking world has practically forgotten who Humboldt was or why anyone cares. What did he accomplish anyway, other than create some of the first detailed maps in a few hard to reach parts of South America? He was, it seems, primarily and powerfully, an inspiration. OK, he also invented the idea of nature. Well, maybe. I mean, Wulf makes the claim, over and over again, but it's a claim that reveals a major weakness in the book that bothered me a lot. She presents, ultimately, a very narrow in focus. So, yes, no question, Humboldt has a thought-provoking unified view on nature. But, was he the first? What was the intellectual world around him thinking, and what were the foundations? Is it possible nature as a unified thing was brought up before? Ever? by anyone? Wulf doesn't do context well, or didn't here. Really, mainly what she does is report stories in lengthy but also abbreviated forms. I liked her book and I really liked learning about Humbolt. It's not a perfect work, but it's not like the early 19th century intellectual world is an easy one to capture. So, flawed but still recommended, and who knows, you might be blown away like Michael Pollan.-----------------------------------------------60.

172,038535066X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/67736000-elizabeth-a-g,5,"Andrea Wulf's The Invention of Nature: Alexander von Humboldt's New World is an enjoyable, well-written and researched exploration of one man's vision of the world around him and how his restless spirit and determination gave us a deep appreciation of nature and presented the idea connectedness of all things organic and inorganic. Alexander von Humboldt is little remembered today and this book sheds a light on the scientist, ecologist. educator, and humanist who influenced later, better known naturalists like Darwin, Thoreau, George Perkins Marsh, Ernst Haeckel, and John Muir. Humboldt believed in the power of education and his writings and books were aimed toward a general audience rather than to specifically the scientific community. In fact he sought to show how nature is a living organism and that there is unity in scientific thought and the emotional response to nature that is expressed in poetry, art and music. He is also one of the first to warn that the activities of man in his commercial pursuits are bringing about the destruction of forests and creating climate change. In this book Wulf describes Humboldt's influence on future environmentalists and goes into some detail on these others...my only issue that perhaps the author could have shortened this section of the book by more of a summarization rather such detail (the subjects for a future book, perhaps). The epilogue of the book is excellent."

About half the book is padded with simplistic one chapter biopics of people purported to have been strongly influenced by Humboldt, often to an extent that is hard to credit. So according to Wulf: Goethe modelled Faust on Humboldt; Darwin would not have travelled on the Beagle and eventually developed evolutionary theory; John Muir wouldn't have become a environmentalist and saved the redwoods; Heckel wouldn't have created art that directly lead to Art Nouveau; and Bolívar wouldn't have become a revolutionary leading to the decolonization of Spain in Latin America. Wulf also repeatedly credits him with discovering climate change, centuries before it came to conscious awareness here, despite no evidence that this is true. Near the end of the book, she credits his current day obscurity (which is not really true) from a reaction against all things German after the 2nd World War, but if this was really correct, why are so many other German scientists and writers remembered and him not? Perhaps it is more to do with him never creating a lasting advance in knowledge via synthesis (a la Darwin).A great opportunity that is wasted by lack of in depth research and a critical appraisal of Humboldt's life.2-stars."
174,038535066X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/76176316-alistair-mackay,4,"The most famous man you’ve never heard of. Alexander Von Humboldt was a superstar explorer, botanist, geologist, naturalist. He inspired Charles Darwin and Henry David Thoreau. He was friends with Simon Bolivar. He invented the thermal lines on maps and came up with the idea of ecosystems and climate zones. He was a scientist before that was a word, and a naturalist before all the different disciplines of nature split into their factions. He believed nature needed to be understood with facts and poetry, felt as well as experienced. And he predicted climate change and deforestation... in the 1790s. I don’t usually enjoy biographies but I loved this book. It’s well-researched and well written. It’s a fascinating look at the adventures and contributions of a truly great man, and the grandfather of the environmental movement. He was the most famous man in the world at one point, and he’s been lost to history only because of 20th Century anti-German sentiment. Glad I read this and learnt about Humboldt. We owe him so much.

I will boldly say this book is my favorite book of 2015 and I plan on recommending it to everyone I know. Part of the delight is that I had no knowledge of Humboldt before reading this book and I was amazed to learn how influential and inspiring he was to people in the 18th and 19th centuries. With direct links to American founding fathers, the Romantic Literature movement, and Simon Bolivar's fight for independence in South America, and Charles Darwin Humboldt is seed that many modern ideas are sprung from. Although I read a library copy of this book I promptly went out and bought my own personal copy because it's a book I will treasure for years to come."

This is more than a biography of Humboldt (one of the most interesting scientists and explorers of all time)- it's a dedication to his legacy and an exploration of how his findings and philosophies eventually influenced everything from Art Nouveau to Walden to John Muir.

180,038535066X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3409532-april-does-feral-sometimes,4,"The book 'The Invention of Nature' is fascinating. It is more than a biography of Alexander Von Humboldt (1769-1859), who can be described as a polymath genius whose enthusiasm for travel and nature was as momentous for the development of as many branches of science that Albert Einstein (1879-1955) was because of his interest in physics. Yet, I have never heard of him until I read this book.Some early Western 19th-century proto-scientists labored all of their life in bleak obscurity until only after their deaths being recognized as major scientific brains and discoverers; others announced their work to newly created scientific societies only to be met with withering scorn. Some inventors were clearly crackpots with one great idea while others were intelligent driven members of respectable aristocrat families and upper-class merchants. (Almost all of these Great Men of Science upset their parents by refusing to study law or medicine in university! Humboldt was one of these children of disappointed parents. I have read a few other science histories, and I have noticed that almost all of these early scientists had parents hoping for a son who would become a doctor or lawyer. Just saying.)However, Humboldt became famous early in his lifetime and all doors were open to him. He met already famous people eager to speak with him, such as President Thomas Jefferson. Others who desired to call him friend went on to illustrious (and nefarious) careers as famous scientists in their own right such as Charles Darwin, well-known writers such as Henry David Thoreau, and Kings, Emperors and Prime Ministers such as Friedrich Wilhelm IV and George Canning, as well as leaders of political revolutions overthrowing those before-mentioned Kings and Emperors such as Simón Bolívar. Humboldt himself was a liberal and he supported the overthrow of the aristocracy, but his income primarily was from a pension paid by two Prussian kings after he went through his own inheritance. He obviously was charismatic, moving easily between many different cultures and social classes, from South America to Europe to Russia.After returning from a five-year exploration of South America with tens of thousands of astronomical, geological and meteorological observations and specimens, he published his first book, 'Essay on the Geography of Plants' at age 32, dedicating it to Johann Wolfgang Goethe, his fellow polymath and best friend (after his brother Wilhelm von Humboldt, who founded the University of Berlin after a career as the Prussian ambassador to Vienna and Britain). The book combined with his achievements and personality made him a famous man, perhaps the most famous respected natural scientist in the world. However, full of energy, wanderlust and curiosity, Humboldt moved on to more explorations crossing over the frontlines of many European wars between France, Prussia, Britain, and Spain, and maneuvering through countries on three continents which were undergoing political revolutions, observing volcano eruptions while mountain climbing without oxygen tanks (yes, he and his companions fainted occasionally) enduring nasty mosquitos, while exposing and warning the public of the dreadful environmental destruction of earth wherever men used the land for agriculture, mining and lumber.Humboldt lived to the age of 89, still receiving famous visitors and writing thousands of letters a month up to his death. His books on the natural sciences, illustrated with his own and other explorers' beautiful art and drawings, inspired Darwin, Thoreau, Ernst Haeckel, John Muir, to name a few. Rivers, mountains, towns and other landmarks were named after him, and he is mentioned in thousands of famous novels. Yet most Americans today have never heard of him, probably because of World War I and WWII having been fought against Germany as an enemy of the United States. I think we should bring this man back into the spotlight and make him a famous hero scientist again. This book is an excellent start.Below I've included some Wikipedia links about the early naturalists, Humboldt, and many of the famous intellectuals, writers and scientists he inspired in later centuries, in hope that these thumbnail histories will convince you, gentle reader, to pick up this book:http://www.ranker.com/list/notable-na...https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alexa...https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kosmo...https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Georg...https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Man_a...https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ernst...https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kunst...https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_..."

HOLY MOLY! WOW! What an awesome book! Just reading it made me happy to be alive! Really! It was a wonderful break from the dreary procession of bad news parading out of every media orifice! (Note to self: improve your imagery.) I neglected other self-improving projects to read this book, and then was sad when I finished it! Worthy of all awards and accolades! The world would be a better place if everyone was forced to read it, at gunpoint if necessary! Don't just stand (or sit) there, go out and get a copy right away!I love narratives about news events, scandals, and personalities that once famous, but now forgotten. This is one of them, of a man known by everyone when living, celebrated, called without irony the greatest man who had ever lived, sought out by tedious rich people and aristocrats, pestered for autographs, and recipient of mountains of admiring old-school paper letters. Intrepid and death-defying explorer, partisan of liberty, deplorer of slavery and cruelty, widely-admired prose stylist, polyglot, polymath. Honored by having towns, counties, and other jurisdictions named after him. Further honored by having a Pacific Ocean current named after him and, even cooler still, also a critter described by Wikipedia as a ""large predatory squid"". His books were anticipated with an enthusiasm which today, sadly, only occurs with certain entries in the ""Young Adult"" market. Pirated translations of his works were rushed to market to satisfy bottomless demand. He was even -- dare I say it? -- the Werner Herzog of his age (ok, yes, Humboldt was Prussian and Herzog Bavarian, but let's not nitpick). As young men, both were driven by some inner demon to seek out the most pestilential, soggy, disease-ridden, and predator-filled sections of inner South America, and came back to ""civilization"", such as it is, with precious insights and striking images, which changed the way people looked at the world. When older, both continued to push into far corners of the world (including, in both cases, Siberia) at a time of life when most of us find it increasingly difficult to get out of bed.Humboldt actually had a life that was both exciting and well-documented, so writing about him was a little like shooting fish in barrel. I don't wish to belittle the author's achievement: the narrative always moves along at an entertaining clip, even during those periods when Humboldt had to spend some time toadying up to various Kaisers in order to keep the old mazuma rolling in. I also enjoyed the last few chapters, which switched tone from standard biography of one man to mini chapter-long biographies of various men (including Simon Bolivar, Charles Darwin, Henry David Thoreau, and John Muir), with a concentration on how Humboldt changed the lives and directions of their thoughts. The point, I believe, was that, even though his name is no longer on everybody's lips, Humboldt is still very much with us.To repeat: delightful. Read it.The only thing that I didn't like about this book was the realization at the conclusion that, no matter what achievements I, uh, achieve with the balance of my life, I will never, ever, have a large predatory squid named after me.

182,038535066X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6938150-marie-paule,5,"When in Berlin a few years ago, I came by the magnificent building of the Humboldt University. And I know that quite a few plants are named '... humboldtiensis'. Although I have a PhD in Science I knew nothing more about Alexander von Humboldt. What a shame. On Sep 14, 1869, the 100th birthday of this brilliant man, there were celebrations all over the world: Europe, Africa, Australia and the America's. More than 100 years later, he seems to be forgotten. What a life he has led. In his younger years, he became a lifetime friend of Goethe, who, besides being a poet, was very interested in botanics and geology. They were both interested in the dualism between the external and internal world (Kant and his 'Kritik der reinen Vernunft'). Is the tree in my garden a real tree, or my idea of a tree? Humboldt gradually shifted from pure empirical research towards his own interpretation of nature: he mixed detailed scientific facts with the emotional reactions they invoked. He thought a great deal about 'Life'. A machine can be taken apart and reassembled, but you can't do this with an animal. Why? Von Humboldt’s most important journey was a 5 year-trip through South America. There, he developed the first concept of 'ecosystems' (long before we knew this particular word), explaining that geology, climate, micro-organisms, plants and animals all influence each other. When he travelled through the plains of Los llanos in Venezuela in 1800 (!), he warned for the destructive effects of human activity (large scale agriculture of commercial crops, mining, ...) on the ecosystems. At the same time, he pointed out that the overexploitation of local ecosystems had disastrous effects on the human population as well: slavery, unhealthy working conditions, a shortage of local healthy foods, exploitation of large groups of have-nots by the happy few….. Sounds familiar, no?Does it surprise you that Alexander von Humboldt became one of the best liftetime friends of Simon Bolivar, who fought to liberate South America from its Spanish colonists? All through his live, von Humboldt fought against slavery. He so longed to visit India, but the British government denied him a passport, because they knew how he felt about slavery and he was not willing to compromise…. For the British, he remained a dangerous anti-colonialist actor. Later in life, he made a great journey through Russia, all the way to Mongolia. He held his 60th birthday party in … the pharmacy of Lenin’s grandfather. After his return from South America, von Humboldt lived in Paris and in London, where he met the famous scientists of his time. He inspired a lot of scientists and writers of his time, among others Charles Darwin, Henry David Thoreau, George Perkin Marsh, Ernst Haeckel and John Muir. Indeed, what a life and what a talent… At the end of his life, von Humboldt wrote his magnum opus ‘Kosmos’: an overview of his own and other scientific findings, but above all, his opinion about the correlations and relationships between different scientific theories, and the interrelation between science, art and sociology. For von Humboldt, there were no boundaries between scientific domains or between science and humanities. In short: von Humboldt was a scientist who was far ahead of his time and who remains a lighting example for us all."

184,038535066X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4070288-jo,4,The first 2/3 of this book are 5 star material. Wulf vividly depicts Humboldt's travels and his personality. He is a fascinating subject. The last sections really suffers in comparison. Her choice of figures to investigate his legacy through their biography is both too focused and too limited to be truly effective. While I understand her desire to dive deep into Humboldt's influence shoehorning in 5 mini bios of other figures into the end of the book moves the book away from its true center. Leaving Humboldt behind made me want to throw myself on the ground in the middle of the town square and yell about things breaking per my hero AvH.
185,038535066X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4739424-mal-warwick,5,"He was the most famous man in the world, and more places around the world are named after him than anyone else. To many of the giants of his time — Johann Wolfgang von Goethe, Thomas Jefferson, Simon Bolivar, Charles Darwin, Henry David Thoreau — he was a colossus whose genius overshadowed their own. He was the first to describe the web of life on Earth, foreshadowing James Lovelock’s Gaia hypothesis, and the first to describe the impact of human activity on the world’s climate. His books, which read like poetry, “were so popular that people bribed booksellers to be the first to receive copies.” Eleven years after his death at age 89, the centennial of his birth was observed by hundreds of thousands of people in huge celebrations around the world.Chances are, you’ve never heard of him.His name was Alexander von Humboldt, and he died in 1859. He had first described climate change in 1800. He “gave us his concept of nature itself.”Andrea Wulf’s engrossing new biography, The Invention of Nature, brings this extraordinary man into the spotlight again after a century and a half. It’s about time. His may well have been one of the finest minds in human history.Humboldt, born into a prosperous family of Prussian aristocrats shortly after the American Civil War, rebelled against the constraints on his life and set out on his own unique path. Though he became best known as a naturalist, world traveler, and author, his interests reached into a far wider range of human endeavor, and Cosmos, the multi-volume book he began to write at the age of sixty-five, encompassed virtually the whole of human knowledge, from botany, geology, and zoology to astronomy, philosophy, and, in effect, the new science he invented: ecology. (Though he didn’t invent that term, his work was the inspiration for the man who did later in the nineteenth century.)As Wulf notes, “Humboldt took his readers from outer space to earth, and then from the surface of the planet into its inner core. He discussed comets, the Milky Way and the solar system as well as terrestrial magnetism, volcanoes and the snow line of mountains. He wrote about the migration of the human species, about plants and animals and the microscopic organisms that live in stagnant water or on the weathered surface of rocks.” Never before, and never since (to the best of my knowledge), has a single individual mastered so many fields of inquiry so successfully that his contemporaries regarded him as a force of nature. And, in an age when most of humanity lived in thrall to organized religion, Humboldt didn’t once mention God in all the many thousands of pages of his books. Instead, he spoke of a “wonderful web of organic life.”Wulf’s biography of this astonishing man is by no means unreservedly positive. She describes the shortcomings of his personality in embarrassing detail: his tendency to talk nonstop at a rapid rate for hours without permitting interruptions of any kind, regardless of the stature of his listeners; his seeming inability to understand the feelings of others and to show empathy for their pain; his venomous gossiping; and his inability to accept criticism. Alexander von Humboldt was not a nice man.Andrea Wulf is an historian and writer who lives in Britain. The Invention of Nature is her fifth book."
186,038535066X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/93114967-barbara,4,"I had some familiarity with von Humboldt before reading Andrea Wulf's book - intrepid young explorer of South America, well known in his time, ocean currents and rivers named for him, information source for Thomas Jefferson about Spanish colonial America. Obviously, an interesting guy, so when I saw an audio copy of The Invention of Nature: Alexander von Humboldt's New World on sale, I grabbed it. Turned out to be a good decision on my part. Von Humboldt was so much more than just that adventurous young man I'd heard of, and Wulf does an excellent job of filling out the picture and his impact.During that extended exploration of South America 200 years ago, while ranging through much of modern day Venezuela, Columbia, Ecuador and Peru, von Humboldt developed concepts of nature, climate and ecology that we take as ""new"" in the late 20th/early 21st centuries. He determined, for instance, that the drop in the level of Lake Valencia was tied to the destruction of the surrounding forest to clear land for farming. He made the connection that the absence of the trees dramatically reduced the ability of the land to retain water. While climbing Mt. Chimborazo in the Andes he developed the concept of altitude-based climate zones that are consistent around the globe. Comparing plants he found on the South American Atlantic coast with those growing on the African Atlantic coast, he intuited that the two land masses must once have been one.These were not simply casual observations for von Humboldt; after returning to Europe he spent the rest of his life as a scientist and author, successfully seeking out the data to support his theories. It's impossible here to summarize his many brilliant insights, but as one example, his perceptions of the devastating outcomes of human's impact on the natural world were prescient of the reality we experience today. Through his writings he influenced many key thinkers of the 19th century, including Darwin, Thoreau and Muir.In truth, I found the biographical information about those scientists and naturalists who built their own theories on his foundations to be more lengthy than necessary, and the latter part of the book dragged a bit for that reason. But overall, reading the story of von Humboldt, a polymath with the ability to pull together what he observed in multiple scientific fields to develop comprehensive theories, was time well spent. He deserves more recognition today."
187,038535066X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/35482263-gumble-s-yard,4,"Alexander Von Humboldt ... was one of the last polymaths, and died at a time when scientific disciplines were hardening into tightly fenced and more specialised fields. Consequently his more holistic approach - a scientific method that included art, history, poetry and politics alongside hard data - has fallen out of favour ..... One of [his] greatest achievements had been to make science accessible and popular ......... in a world where we draw a sharp line between the sciences and the arts, between he subjective and the objective, Humboldt's insight that we can only truly understand nature by using our imaginations makes him a visionaryAward winning biography of Alexander Von Humboldt, of who I was previously familiar from the fictional biography Measuring the World. Wulf ksets out to show that: he was a true polymath, perhaps the last to really range across all scientific disciplines; that at a time when science was becoming increasingly focused on classifications he remained able to see the big picture both across as well as within scientific disciplines; that at a time when romantic poets and data driven scientists were starting to grow in mutual incomprehension, his method of observing and describing nature in person and in capturing what he observed both in rigorous data and evocative descriptions, enabled him to be lionised by individuals on both sides of that divide; that in his pioneering work on the inter-connectedness of natural ecosystems and on the impact of human actions on those systems, he should be regarded as the founder of the environmental movement. She also is keen to emphasise his influence on others - starting with his almost lifelong friendship with and influence on the work of Goethe. Wulf writes chapters on each of Simon Bolivar, Charles Darwin and Henry Thoreau, cantering on their achievements but at all times seeking for the considerable impact Von Humboldt had on them. In perhaps the only slightly false note in the book, it finishes with more than fifty pages on his seemingly more tangential influence on three lesser known figures whose main achievements were after his death. Overall though this is a fascinating and well written account."
188,038535066X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1241339-clif,5,"Chicago's public radio station, WBEZ, had a program on the statue of Alexander Humboldt in the park named after him, in a neighborhood named after him. The program speculated that not one in a thousand passersby would know who he was. I've no doubt that's true. My only association of the name was with the Humboldt Current that brings cold water up the west coast of South America from Antarctica. With that as background, this book floored me.Humboldt was to the 19th century as Einstein was to the 20th. It's fair to say that everyone knew his name even decades after his death in 1859. He was a powerful influence on Charles Darwin, John Muir and Henry David Thoreau. On the seminal voyage aboard the Beagle that took Darwin around the world, his notes are peppered with ""as Humboldt said..."" whenever something was found that confirmed Humboldt's previous discoveries. Thoreau was a Humboldt devotee.During his lifetime, and he loved life, lectures given by Humboldt were packed, whether in America or Europe. His books were best sellers and he was personally acquainted with everyone who was anyone, from Napoleon (one of the few that didn't like Humboldt) through the royalty of Europe to Simón Bolívar, the liberator of South America, and on down from there. He was a font of knowledge on the natural world, was driven by curiosity and would even at an advanced age rush to attend the lectures of someone who knew something he did not, sitting in an audience of college students furiously taking notes as he listened.He had only one foible - he could not stop talking. Only the most determined could get in a comment, but few wished to do so as it would, but only possibly, interrupt the flow of knowledge they wanted to hear. Single his entire life with never any indication of an attraction to women, he bonded easily with men, forming lifelong friendships and exploring for months on end with a partner.His physical endurance and health were phenomenal. He climbed snow covered mountains with none of the equipment we know today, even above levels where oxygen should be used. As others would fall victim to tropical diseases, Humboldt was up at dawn ready to go. Clouds of mosquitoes for days and nights on end were no deterrent if there was a new plant, animal or rock formation to be examined.Not only did he crave knowledge, he wanted everyone to share in it. His Personal Narrative of the Equinoctial Regions of the New Continent (South America) was devoured by a public as eager to find out what had been found as we today would read the account of a person visiting another solar system. And, speaking of outer space, he took that subject on as well in his quest to tie everything together, writing the multi-volume Cosmos as he neared the end of his life.As Andrea Wulf makes clear in her title, The Invention of Nature, Humboldt was one of the first to come up with the concept of ecosystems, the interconnection of the natural world that allow an environment to thrive if left alone, and change it even to the point of destruction when this or that part is altered. While few of us today know of Humboldt, we live in the conceptual world of nature he created.This book is a wonderful wide-ranging history that covers not only Humboldt's life, but contains brief overviews of the lives and work of Darwin, Thoreau, George Perkins Marsh, Ernst Haeckel and John Muir in relation to Humboldt. Filled with adventure and excitement, Wulf perfectly captures a man to which we are all indebted and one who would be delighted to meet any of us and relate his discoveries.Sad to say, none of his books are in the network of public libraries including the one in my own town."
189,038535066X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7175349-david,5,"Didn't finish before it was due back to the library, but I read enough to be dazzled by Humboldt. First, I must praise this author for writing this book, bringing this once famous and celebrated figure back to our attention. The title is apparently not as hyperbolic as it seems, as her subject really does seem to have given both the public and the scientific community the idea of nature as an interconnected whole. No summary I could offer will do justice to the book, so you will need to read it yourself. And if it is not the kind of book you would read, then at least go to a bookstore or the library and skim enough to get some idea of it, because it is worth knowing about. (Note: yes, this is who Humboldt county in California is named after, and the University in Berlin, and the current in the Pacific Ocean, and many other things besides.)Here's a guy who got Goethe all stirred up, who explored the Amazon and the Andes, loved to get close to an erupting volcano, inspired Simon Bolivar to rebel against Spain, admired the American Revolution but could not understand why his friend Thomas Jefferson did not free the slaves, got Thoreau interested in nature, etc., etc. Seems to have been gay (avant la lettre), as his attachments to other men seem to have been unusual enough to cause his family some concern. Certainly his companions stuck with him through thick and thin, at risk to their lives with some frequency. My favorite is the poor guy who survives fever in the Amazon, crawling along a precarious mountain trail in a howling snowstorm, a hurricane at sea, just for a few examples, only to be berated for not working hard enough to publish their discoveries when they finally get back to Paris. Our hero could wear you out, apparently, not that anyone seemed to mind. And he was enough of a superstar that the King of Prussia kept him at court later in life even though it was no secret that he didn't believe in Monarchy and would support any revolution that might overthrow his patron. Think about that: he didn't worry about pleasing the King, the King worried about keeping him around.The book may seem too thorough to some readers (e.g., me), but when you think about the many volumes written by Humboldt, it's easy to see that she must have felt like this was the short version of the story. So worth checking out! "
190,038535066X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/180643-jim-coughenour,3,"A fine (re)introduction to Humboldt and his prescient ecological view of nature: that everything is connected and that humanity is capable of destroying the world it's been given. Humboldt appears as a brilliant, even heroic, transitional figure between the Enlightenment and the Romantic movement, between the positivism of science and the inwardness of art, between Goethe and Darwin. Wulf is also good at demonstrating his influence on other naturalists, not only Darwin but Thoreau, George Perkins Marsh (new to me), Ernst Haeckel and John Muir.Because I'd just finished reading On the Move: A Life, I couldn't help being reminded of Oliver Sacks, who also stood outside his own profession of neurology to capture the human and artistic dimension of knowledge, creating a new kind of scientific literature in the process. I was also intrigued to find out that Humboldt never married. He claimed his passion was only for science, but he was rarely without the company of another charismatic young man. His equally famous brother, Willem, ""disliked his brother's intense friendships – probably a mixture of jealousy and a concern for what might have seemed the inappropriate nature of these connections."" And finally, to my private embarrassment, I realized I've confused Alexander and Willem my whole life. (Humboldt University in Berlin is named after both of them.)The dark irony is that, although Humboldt was revered his warnings about how humanity was destroying its own environment were largely ignored. What should be obvious to everyone is still the stuff of partisan politics, and the grim conviction deepens that nothing will be done until it is too late, that it is in fact too late already."
191,038535066X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5871422-elena,5,"Andrea Wulf paints an appealing picture of the brilliant Alexander von Humboldt, an Enlightenment titan who climbed the highest mountains he could find with heavy instruments to make precise measurements, not just air pressure, but he had some kind of cyanograph to measure just how blue the sky was at different altitudes. He discussed science with Thomas Jefferson, whom he admired on one level, but AvH was firmly opposed to any form of slavery. He admired the indigenous peoples he met while exploring South America, and reported on the magnificent ruins of ancient American civilizations and the complex languages of the peoples he encountered in the colorful jungles, which he much perfered to his native Berlin. He deplored the degradation of the New World ecology by the mining and cash crops of the Spanish. Wulf did extensive research on his influence on Darwin and the theory of evolution which he anticipated with studies of fossils, on Goethe who put a bit of him into Faust, on Simon Bolivar who discussed concepts of political freedom with him, on Henry David Thoreau who's love of nature was nurtured by reading AvH's books on the interconnected-ness of nature, and on John Muir who read and annotated his books. Wulf found direct connections to show how his love of nature even inspired the Art Deco movement. His fame was universal, his name attached to currents, mountains, counties, cities all across the US and Latin America. It was the anti-German sentiments of World War I, intensified in World War II that cause his fame to be mostly extinguished along with admiration for German science and culture in general. Time to appreciate the man who pushed through legislation in Prussia that any slave, including any American slave, who lands on Prussian soil becomes a free person. "
192,038535066X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6432978-bfisher,4,"Alexander von Humboldt was one of the most prominent scientists of the nineteenth century. When he died in 1859, tens of thousands of mourners marched in his funeral procession. A staggering number of geographical features were named after him in his lifetime. It seems appropriate that the namesake Humboldt River, one of the largest rivers in the Great Basin of North America, disappears from sight in the Humboldt Sinks, much as Humboldt’s reputation has disappeared from modern popular memory.Yet, it is not fitting that Humboldt should be forgotten to our age. Andrea Wulf describes his roles as a founder of biogeography, inventor of isotherms, developer of the concept of ecological systems and the interdependence of life, and as the first scientist to recognize the danger of anthropogenic climate change. He influenced Darwin, Thoreau and John Muir. We recognize and adopt his ideas but have forgotten the person. This book is a useful recovery of the core importance to science and society of Humboldt's work. Unfortunately, in its coverage of Humboldt the scientist, Humboldt the person gets short shrift, aside from a few brief hints. That is my one quibble with this book."
193,038535066X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7283807-ben,1,"Desperately in need of an editor. Perhaps the author could not find enough source material on Humboldt himself. The majority of the book consists of capsule biographies and Wikipedia-level explanations of other people, such as Darwin or Muir. The author bombastically credits everything good to Humboldt. A typical phrasing, repeated dozens if not hundreds of times, goes like, ""Humboldt generously shared his library with X, and despite his own debts supported X financially. X praised Humboldt as 'one of the greatest scientists of his generation.'"" There is very little insight added to the material. The author does not bring any skepticism to the table, and is entirely credulous when it comes to Humboldt. Unfortunately, this means that you can't trust what few conclusions are drawn. I only finished it because I had an audiobook. Not worth reading. "
194,038535066X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/18845147-gill,4,"This is a well written, comprehensive account of the life of Alexander von Humboldt, and his influences and influence. I found it an interesting read, and the specialist sections clearly explained. I found the section on his links with Simon Bolívar especially interesting. Well done to Andrea Wulf for introducing a man who was so important in his own time to a present day audience."

Humboldt's legacy of scientific inquiry has style of writing has impacted generations of scientist, writers and readers all around the world. His numerous works and lectures are still revelant as the world faces a global environmental crossroads. I highly encourage readers to pick up this outstanding work."
197,038535066X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/96806543-the-colonial,3,"Alexander von Humboldt’s name can be seen throughout the world’s streets, trails, universities, and rivers, yet the man and his mystique are rarely brought to our actual attention. By the early-nineteenth century, Humboldt had become what today we would call both an Environmentalist and Renaissance Man—as he was a scientist, explorer, naturalist, botanist, and colleague of renowned and like-minded intellectuals of the age. Andrea Wulf weaves all of these traits together in order to discuss Humboldt’s life journey and the groundbreaking ideas that he introduced our world to—some far too ahead of the times for the likes of his contemporaries.The first half of the book appropriately covers Humboldt’s beginnings, from his boyhood and ancestry in Prussia, to his rise in education and esteem in the scientific world. Wulf devotes much attention to Humboldt’s standing in the political world as a whole, where the botanist is doted upon by courtly officials and diplomats from such prosperous world powers as Russia, Great Britain, Spain, and the United States. He is honored by the prestigious Royal Society of London as a foreign member, and throughout his remarkable life he meets the likes of such prominent figures as Joseph Banks, Benjamin Smith Barton, Thomas Jefferson, Benjamin Rush, and a young and upcoming Charles Darwin.Unfortunately, Wulf’s enthusiasm for her subject is too broad in its approach, as she pivots into the second half of the book by focusing on the great men that were influenced by Humboldt—all of which include famous scientists, authors, environmentalists, and inventors. This is collectively balanced out by her engaging and imaginative prose, where she fortunately excels at using her fascination with Humboldt as well as that of nature itself for her inspiration. Wulf majestically explains each and every tour and journey that Humboldt embarked upon, as well as the meetings he held with prominent men of his times:…Humboldt informed Jefferson, where he had collected plants, made astronomical observations, found hieroglyphs of ancient civilizations deep in the rainforest and had amassed important data from the colonial archives of Mexico City. Humboldt also wrote to James Madison, the Secretary of State and Jefferson’s closest political ally, declaring that ‘having witnessed the great spectacle of the majestic Andes and the grandeur of the physical world I intended to enjoy the spectacle of a free people.’ Politics and nature belonged together–an idea that Humboldt would be discussing with the Americans.With almost the final half of the book being dedicated to Thoreau, Darwin, George Perkins Marsh, John Muir, and Ernst Haeckel, the reader unfortunately loses interest on the main subject of Humboldt’s adventurous life—leaving a sense of unfulfillment. It’s apparent that Wulf has so much more to tell on Alexander von Humboldt’s life, which is almost frustrating since the reader is constantly engrossed and intrigued in his story, due to the benefit of her writing style and equal fascination. Apart from the unnecessary segue into like-minded men, there is still much to be gained by the modern reader from reading Wulf’s work on an environmental pioneer and enlightened man of many qualifications and achievements. Maps are provided, a useful “Note on Humboldt’s Publications”, as well as helpful illustrations found throughout the text.

198,038535066X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3007401-biblio-files-takingadayoff,5,"Apparently, in much of Europe, Alexander von Humboldt is as well known as Charles Darwin is to those of us in the United States and Britain. A naturalist and explorer, Humboldt took his upper class education in 18th century Prussia and applied it to becoming a Renaissance man in 19th century Europe and America. Humboldt was especially interested in plant life, but he was an extremely energetic and focused person who also enjoyed studying all forms of life on earth, as well as philosophy, literature and poetry, astronomy, and languages. He loved participating in the frequent salons of the time and became friends with Goethe, and later with Simon Bolivar in his pre-revolutionary days traveling in Europe. He reached out to Thomas Jefferson as a fellow scientist (Jefferson was not only a gentleman farmer, but a scientific farmer as well) and procured an invitation to stay at the President's mansion while he visited Washington, D.C. Later, in Paris, he tried to play diplomat with Napoleon, but was not successful. Still, Napoleon was said to be impressed with his scientific works and to have read Humboldt's books.Humboldt's claim to fame as a scientist is to have been one of the first to see plant life, animal life, the cosmos, geology, everything, as a part of a single ecosystem, rather than as individual and not necessarily connected pieces. This is so basic to our way of thinking today that it seems obvious and not particularly remarkable. But it is as fundamentally different a way of looking at the world as Darwin's idea of natural selection was. Andrea Wulf's biography describes Humboldt's studies, travels, accomplishments -- you feel as if Humboldt would be quite an engaging, if hard to keep up with, fellow. After reading The Invention of Nature, the question that still nagged at me was how I had never learned of this whirlwind before. "
199,038535066X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/241691-kay,4,"“Temperament is destiny,” or so the proverb says, though I have always been suspicious of such broad sweeps of rhetoric. Still, this saying kept echoing through my head as I read this book, for I could not help but wonder: “What makes such a man as Alexander von Humboldt? What motivates him, drives him forward, helps him overcome obstacles, or, perhaps even ultimately, is his very undoing?” It seemed as I read of Humboldt’s life, passions, and seemingly boundless energy, that he must have sprung, almost Athena-like, from his mother’s womb, set from the get-go on a trajectory that would send him around the world in an unceasing round of exploration, research, and writing. Certainly, the advantages of his upbringing and background helped: a stable home, wealth, attentive (if distant) parents, exacting tutors, a library at his disposal. Yet there are other men and women that I can think of, such as the naturalist Alfred Russel Wallace or the explorer Mary Kingsley who had few such advantages, but, like Humboldt, possessed an urge for going, a forward momentum, an insatiable curiosity, and above all, seemingly boundless resources of optimism, courage, and self-reliance. They were, I can’t help but feel, the chosen few, blessed with a rare combination of temperament, intelligence, and energy. It is a magic formula – and, oh, if only I possessed it! The title of this book could well have been “Why Humboldt Matters,” and it’s scarcely a spoiler to reveal that he matters very much, and indeed is perhaps more relevant than ever. Although Humboldt is little thought about or even known about today, in his time he was the most famous scientist in the world - and that was before the term ""scientist"" even existed. It was Humboldt's accounts of his travels in South America and Russia that most captured the public's attention, but among Enlightenment-era and 19th century intellectual circles, his reputation as the authority on a wide range of scientific matters was unquestioned. His vision of nature as an integrated, interconnected and interdependent force, one, furthermore, indifferent to and even damaged by man is what most influenced thinkers of his time, and it is this complex and far-sighted vision which resonates today, perhaps now more than ever in the face of impending environmental threats.Wulf's explanation of why Humboldt fell into relative obscurity during the 20th century, particularly in the U.S.A., wasn't entirely convincing. She cites anti-German sentiment in the wake of the First World War, the fragmentation of science into specialized fields, and the fact that ""Humboldt is not known for a single fact or a discovery but for his worldview. His vision of nature has passed into our consciousness as if by osmosis."" But I think another reason lies within the pages of Wulf's book: Humboldt was the original ""torch bearer,"" but that torch has been taken up by many, some of whom Wulf devotes chapters to, such as Charles Darwin and John Muir. These figures, rather than Humboldt, occupy a larger place in the current public imagination. However, in contemplating Humboldt's scientific eclipse, once again I fell to musing about our fickleness in choosing heroes. Charles Darwin, hero (or blasphemer, depending on your perspective) is universally known if perhaps less than universally understood. (Hence the “blasphemer” part, one could argue.) His less-well-heeled contemporary, Alfred Russel Wallace, simultaneous and independent formulator of the theory of natural selection, while more recently enjoying a bit of an upswing, is still a relative unknown. (And can you guess which of the two is a personal hero? Corr-rect! Wallace it is!) Alfred Einstein, virtually a pop star in the scientific firmament, is but one very bright star in a constellation of equally impressive luminaries – Niels Bohr, Max Planck, Ernest Rutherford, Paul Dirac, James Clerk Maxwell – but it is Einstein who inhabits the popular imagination as the preeminent scientist of all time. (Though many will, of course, at least have a hazy idea, as I do, that Schrödinger and a cat also come into play somewhere.) Yet, after living for years with a physicist, I can confidently state that this much is true: No genius exists in splendid isolation. Each is perched on the shoulders of genii who preceded him. Or her. And so it unquestionably was with Humboldt, whose influences included Johann Wolfgang von Goethe, Captain Cook, Joseph Banks, Immanuel Kant, and indeed the very temper of the Age of Enlightenment. Yet Wulf’s biography focuses primarily on how Humboldt influenced his contemporaries and subsequent generations.  The most prominent of Humboldt’s followers (and that’s not too strong a term, really), was Darwin, who arguably would never have made that voyage on  The Beagle had he not been inspired by Humboldt’s account of his South American travels. Wulf devotes a chapter each to Darwin and four others who fell under Humboldt’s spell: Henry David Thoreau, George Perkins Marsh, Ernst Haeckel, and John Muir. Some of these Humboldtiphiles (Darwin, Thoreau, Muir), I knew something about, though admittedly it seems I knew less about Thoreau than I had thought, while of the remaining two, Marsh and Haeckel, I knew nothing. The chapter on Haeckel I particularly enjoyed, for I have a longstanding interest in Art Nouveau and its various architectural offshoots, and I immediately perceived how Haeckel’s wonderful fusion of art and science became the wellspring for many artists in the new (20th) century. Look at Gaudi’s Casa Batlló and then look at Haeckel’s illustrations of radiolarians (microscopic sea creatures) and the similarities are almost breathtaking. Why, that famous unfinished cathedral in Barcelona is but a radiolarian writ large!In short, I came away not just with a very good idea of Humboldt’s life after reading The Invention of Nature, but also was treated to five succinct mini-biographies of his most influential acolytes. Looking over that group provides a good sense of how all-encompassing Humboldt’s polymath grasp was: he influenced natural scientists, philosopher poets, conservationists, preservationists, earth scientists, artists, and even politicians and kings. Oh, and to add a bit more to this grandiose mix, Humboldt’s friends and contemporaries included the likes of Thomas Jefferson, Simon Bolivar, Joseph Hooker, and practically the entire scientific and intellectual elite of his age, with whom he maintained a voluminous correspondence.But again….that energy! Reading of Humboldt’s travels, experiments, indefatigable correspondence, and the breadth of his expertise practically made my head spin. Wulf makes the point – repeatedly – that perhaps Humboldt’s most singular legacy was his ability to synthesize information from areas which, today, are broken into discrete fields, such as climatology, volcanology, botany, biology, geology, meteorology, seismology, and paleontology, just to name a few. Those fields were all given a hearty kick-start by Humboldt’s grand synthesis, his Cosmos. It is this great overarching view of nature that inspired those that followed. Reading (but, admittedly, not entirely comprehending) how Humboldt achieved this was inspirational. A couple of final notes: firstly, the illustrations in the book were a delight. May I confess how much I enjoy well-selected (and nicely rendered) illustrations? I sometimes feel a little jolt of pleasure whenever I turn the page to find one. The chapter on Haeckel, for example, cried out for some of his radiolarian drawings. And there they were! Along with some equally fetching Medusae. Another not entirely unexpected joy was Wulf’s style. She has one! That is to say, I got a sense of 
her
 from reading this book, but she never intruded upon the subject, which always remained in focus. While it’s clear that Wulf must have loved researching and writing about Humboldt, she judiciously organized the material and trimmed her narrative, then wrote it in a lively yet elegant style that made me think, on the whole, that I would rather enjoy meeting this author. At any rate, I certainly want to read more of her work. "

201,038535066X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/18695911-daniel-chaikin,4,"It was interesting this evening, as I was driving home and listening to Michael Pollan read his latest book, to hear him refer to this book as if it were a major inspiration for him. Humboldt's view of nature as one entire interconnected thing. It is a beautiful concept, one he made at length and, as Wulf shows, elegantly and poetically. Darwin, who eventually met Humboldt, found Humboldt's writing inspirational for his scientific view of nature. Henry Thoreau devoured his writing, and found inspiration of his poetic view of the nature around his small pond. And John Muir, so enraptured he set off for Cuba and South America until he learned the tropical climates made him ill, found in Humboldt an inspiration for the environmental movement. And, I should mention, Simon Bolivar not only found in Humboldt a South American natural identity he raved about, but also used Humboldt's maps in his military campaigns. Wulf follows all these threads and more, in great detail. She rushes headlong through narratives, making them something of a roller coaster ride, and she spends time at the end wondering why the contemporary English speaking world has practically forgotten who Humboldt was or why anyone cares. What did he accomplish anyway, other than create some of the first detailed maps in a few hard to reach parts of South America? He was, it seems, primarily and powerfully, an inspiration. OK, he also invented the idea of nature. Well, maybe. I mean, Wulf makes the claim, over and over again, but it's a claim that reveals a major weakness in the book that bothered me a lot. She presents, ultimately, a very narrow in focus. So, yes, no question, Humboldt has a thought-provoking unified view on nature. But, was he the first? What was the intellectual world around him thinking, and what were the foundations? Is it possible nature as a unified thing was brought up before? Ever? by anyone? Wulf doesn't do context well, or didn't here. Really, mainly what she does is report stories in lengthy but also abbreviated forms. I liked her book and I really liked learning about Humbolt. It's not a perfect work, but it's not like the early 19th century intellectual world is an easy one to capture. So, flawed but still recommended, and who knows, you might be blown away like Michael Pollan.-----------------------------------------------60.

202,038535066X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/67736000-elizabeth-a-g,5,"Andrea Wulf's The Invention of Nature: Alexander von Humboldt's New World is an enjoyable, well-written and researched exploration of one man's vision of the world around him and how his restless spirit and determination gave us a deep appreciation of nature and presented the idea connectedness of all things organic and inorganic. Alexander von Humboldt is little remembered today and this book sheds a light on the scientist, ecologist. educator, and humanist who influenced later, better known naturalists like Darwin, Thoreau, George Perkins Marsh, Ernst Haeckel, and John Muir. Humboldt believed in the power of education and his writings and books were aimed toward a general audience rather than to specifically the scientific community. In fact he sought to show how nature is a living organism and that there is unity in scientific thought and the emotional response to nature that is expressed in poetry, art and music. He is also one of the first to warn that the activities of man in his commercial pursuits are bringing about the destruction of forests and creating climate change. In this book Wulf describes Humboldt's influence on future environmentalists and goes into some detail on these others...my only issue that perhaps the author could have shortened this section of the book by more of a summarization rather such detail (the subjects for a future book, perhaps). The epilogue of the book is excellent."
203,038535066X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/23195904-radiantflux,2,"43rd book for 2018.A hagiography of 19th C polymath/naturalist Alexander von Humboldt that never gets beyond the surface of his eventful life. About half the book is padded with simplistic one chapter biopics of people purported to have been strongly influenced by Humboldt, often to an extent that is hard to credit. So according to Wulf: Goethe modelled Faust on Humboldt; Darwin would not have travelled on the Beagle and eventually developed evolutionary theory; John Muir wouldn't have become a environmentalist and saved the redwoods; Heckel wouldn't have created art that directly lead to Art Nouveau; and Bolívar wouldn't have become a revolutionary leading to the decolonization of Spain in Latin America. Wulf also repeatedly credits him with discovering climate change, centuries before it came to conscious awareness here, despite no evidence that this is true. Near the end of the book, she credits his current day obscurity (which is not really true) from a reaction against all things German after the 2nd World War, but if this was really correct, why are so many other German scientists and writers remembered and him not? Perhaps it is more to do with him never creating a lasting advance in knowledge via synthesis (a la Darwin).A great opportunity that is wasted by lack of in depth research and a critical appraisal of Humboldt's life.2-stars."
204,038535066X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/76176316-alistair-mackay,4,"The most famous man you’ve never heard of. Alexander Von Humboldt was a superstar explorer, botanist, geologist, naturalist. He inspired Charles Darwin and Henry David Thoreau. He was friends with Simon Bolivar. He invented the thermal lines on maps and came up with the idea of ecosystems and climate zones. He was a scientist before that was a word, and a naturalist before all the different disciplines of nature split into their factions. He believed nature needed to be understood with facts and poetry, felt as well as experienced. And he predicted climate change and deforestation... in the 1790s. I don’t usually enjoy biographies but I loved this book. It’s well-researched and well written. It’s a fascinating look at the adventures and contributions of a truly great man, and the grandfather of the environmental movement. He was the most famous man in the world at one point, and he’s been lost to history only because of 20th Century anti-German sentiment. Glad I read this and learnt about Humboldt. We owe him so much.

I will boldly say this book is my favorite book of 2015 and I plan on recommending it to everyone I know. Part of the delight is that I had no knowledge of Humboldt before reading this book and I was amazed to learn how influential and inspiring he was to people in the 18th and 19th centuries. With direct links to American founding fathers, the Romantic Literature movement, and Simon Bolivar's fight for independence in South America, and Charles Darwin Humboldt is seed that many modern ideas are sprung from. Although I read a library copy of this book I promptly went out and bought my own personal copy because it's a book I will treasure for years to come."

This is more than a biography of Humboldt (one of the most interesting scientists and explorers of all time)- it's a dedication to his legacy and an exploration of how his findings and philosophies eventually influenced everything from Art Nouveau to Walden to John Muir. Wide and diverse in breadth and scope, this reminds me of one of my favorite books- The Age of Wonder. "

210,038535066X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3409532-april-does-feral-sometimes,4,"The book 'The Invention of Nature' is fascinating. It is more than a biography of Alexander Von Humboldt (1769-1859), who can be described as a polymath genius whose enthusiasm for travel and nature was as momentous for the development of as many branches of science that Albert Einstein (1879-1955) was because of his interest in physics. Yet, I have never heard of him until I read this book.Some early Western 19th-century proto-scientists labored all of their life in bleak obscurity until only after their deaths being recognized as major scientific brains and discoverers; others announced their work to newly created scientific societies only to be met with withering scorn. Some inventors were clearly crackpots with one great idea while others were intelligent driven members of respectable aristocrat families and upper-class merchants. (Almost all of these Great Men of Science upset their parents by refusing to study law or medicine in university! Humboldt was one of these children of disappointed parents. I have read a few other science histories, and I have noticed that almost all of these early scientists had parents hoping for a son who would become a doctor or lawyer. Just saying.)However, Humboldt became famous early in his lifetime and all doors were open to him. He met already famous people eager to speak with him, such as President Thomas Jefferson. Others who desired to call him friend went on to illustrious (and nefarious) careers as famous scientists in their own right such as Charles Darwin, well-known writers such as Henry David Thoreau, and Kings, Emperors and Prime Ministers such as Friedrich Wilhelm IV and George Canning, as well as leaders of political revolutions overthrowing those before-mentioned Kings and Emperors such as Simón Bolívar. Humboldt himself was a liberal and he supported the overthrow of the aristocracy, but his income primarily was from a pension paid by two Prussian kings after he went through his own inheritance. He obviously was charismatic, moving easily between many different cultures and social classes, from South America to Europe to Russia.After returning from a five-year exploration of South America with tens of thousands of astronomical, geological and meteorological observations and specimens, he published his first book, 'Essay on the Geography of Plants' at age 32, dedicating it to Johann Wolfgang Goethe, his fellow polymath and best friend (after his brother Wilhelm von Humboldt, who founded the University of Berlin after a career as the Prussian ambassador to Vienna and Britain). The book combined with his achievements and personality made him a famous man, perhaps the most famous respected natural scientist in the world. However, full of energy, wanderlust and curiosity, Humboldt moved on to more explorations crossing over the frontlines of many European wars between France, Prussia, Britain, and Spain, and maneuvering through countries on three continents which were undergoing political revolutions, observing volcano eruptions while mountain climbing without oxygen tanks (yes, he and his companions fainted occasionally) enduring nasty mosquitos, while exposing and warning the public of the dreadful environmental destruction of earth wherever men used the land for agriculture, mining and lumber.Humboldt lived to the age of 89, still receiving famous visitors and writing thousands of letters a month up to his death. His books on the natural sciences, illustrated with his own and other explorers' beautiful art and drawings, inspired Darwin, Thoreau, Ernst Haeckel, John Muir, to name a few. Rivers, mountains, towns and other landmarks were named after him, and he is mentioned in thousands of famous novels. Yet most Americans today have never heard of him, probably because of World War I and WWII having been fought against Germany as an enemy of the United States. I think we should bring this man back into the spotlight and make him a famous hero scientist again. This book is an excellent start.Below I've included some Wikipedia links about the early naturalists, Humboldt, and many of the famous intellectuals, writers and scientists he inspired in later centuries, in hope that these thumbnail histories will convince you, gentle reader, to pick up this book:http://www.ranker.com/list/notable-na...https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alexa...https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kosmo...https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Georg...https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Man_a...https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ernst...https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kunst...https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_..."

HOLY MOLY! WOW! What an awesome book! Just reading it made me happy to be alive! Really! It was a wonderful break from the dreary procession of bad news parading out of every media orifice! (Note to self: improve your imagery.) I neglected other self-improving projects to read this book, and then was sad when I finished it! Worthy of all awards and accolades! The world would be a better place if everyone was forced to read it, at gunpoint if necessary! Don't just stand (or sit) there, go out and get a copy right away!I love narratives about news events, scandals, and personalities that once famous, but now forgotten. This is one of them, of a man known by everyone when living, celebrated, called without irony the greatest man who had ever lived, sought out by tedious rich people and aristocrats, pestered for autographs, and recipient of mountains of admiring old-school paper letters. Intrepid and death-defying explorer, partisan of liberty, deplorer of slavery and cruelty, widely-admired prose stylist, polyglot, polymath. Honored by having towns, counties, and other jurisdictions named after him. Further honored by having a Pacific Ocean current named after him and, even cooler still, also a critter described by Wikipedia as a ""large predatory squid"". His books were anticipated with an enthusiasm which today, sadly, only occurs with certain entries in the ""Young Adult"" market. Pirated translations of his works were rushed to market to satisfy bottomless demand. He was even -- dare I say it? -- the Werner Herzog of his age (ok, yes, Humboldt was Prussian and Herzog Bavarian, but let's not nitpick). As young men, both were driven by some inner demon to seek out the most pestilential, soggy, disease-ridden, and predator-filled sections of inner South America, and came back to ""civilization"", such as it is, with precious insights and striking images, which changed the way people looked at the world. When older, both continued to push into far corners of the world (including, in both cases, Siberia) at a time of life when most of us find it increasingly difficult to get out of bed.Humboldt actually had a life that was both exciting and well-documented, so writing about him was a little like shooting fish in barrel. I don't wish to belittle the author's achievement: the narrative always moves along at an entertaining clip, even during those periods when Humboldt had to spend some time toadying up to various Kaisers in order to keep the old mazuma rolling in. I also enjoyed the last few chapters, which switched tone from standard biography of one man to mini chapter-long biographies of various men (including Simon Bolivar, Charles Darwin, Henry David Thoreau, and John Muir), with a concentration on how Humboldt changed the lives and directions of their thoughts. The point, I believe, was that, even though his name is no longer on everybody's lips, Humboldt is still very much with us.To repeat: delightful. Read it.The only thing that I didn't like about this book was the realization at the conclusion that, no matter what achievements I, uh, achieve with the balance of my life, I will never, ever, have a large predatory squid named after me. "
212,038535066X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6938150-marie-paule,5,"When in Berlin a few years ago, I came by the magnificent building of the Humboldt University. And I know that quite a few plants are named '... humboldtiensis'. Although I have a PhD in Science I knew nothing more about Alexander von Humboldt. What a shame. On Sep 14, 1869, the 100th birthday of this brilliant man, there were celebrations all over the world: Europe, Africa, Australia and the America's. More than 100 years later, he seems to be forgotten. What a life he has led. In his younger years, he became a lifetime friend of Goethe, who, besides being a poet, was very interested in botanics and geology. They were both interested in the dualism between the external and internal world (Kant and his 'Kritik der reinen Vernunft'). Is the tree in my garden a real tree, or my idea of a tree? Humboldt gradually shifted from pure empirical research towards his own interpretation of nature: he mixed detailed scientific facts with the emotional reactions they invoked. He thought a great deal about 'Life'. A machine can be taken apart and reassembled, but you can't do this with an animal. Why? Von Humboldt’s most important journey was a 5 year-trip through South America. There, he developed the first concept of 'ecosystems' (long before we knew this particular word), explaining that geology, climate, micro-organisms, plants and animals all influence each other. When he travelled through the plains of Los llanos in Venezuela in 1800 (!), he warned for the destructive effects of human activity (large scale agriculture of commercial crops, mining, ...) on the ecosystems. At the same time, he pointed out that the overexploitation of local ecosystems had disastrous effects on the human population as well: slavery, unhealthy working conditions, a shortage of local healthy foods, exploitation of large groups of have-nots by the happy few….. Sounds familiar, no?Does it surprise you that Alexander von Humboldt became one of the best liftetime friends of Simon Bolivar, who fought to liberate South America from its Spanish colonists? All through his live, von Humboldt fought against slavery. He so longed to visit India, but the British government denied him a passport, because they knew how he felt about slavery and he was not willing to compromise…. For the British, he remained a dangerous anti-colonialist actor. Later in life, he made a great journey through Russia, all the way to Mongolia. He held his 60th birthday party in … the pharmacy of Lenin’s grandfather. After his return from South America, von Humboldt lived in Paris and in London, where he met the famous scientists of his time. He inspired a lot of scientists and writers of his time, among others Charles Darwin, Henry David Thoreau, George Perkin Marsh, Ernst Haeckel and John Muir. Indeed, what a life and what a talent… At the end of his life, von Humboldt wrote his magnum opus ‘Kosmos’: an overview of his own and other scientific findings, but above all, his opinion about the correlations and relationships between different scientific theories, and the interrelation between science, art and sociology. For von Humboldt, there were no boundaries between scientific domains or between science and humanities. In short: von Humboldt was a scientist who was far ahead of his time and who remains a lighting example for us all."

The last sections really suffers in comparison. Her choice of figures to investigate his legacy through their biography is both too focused and too limited to be truly effective. While I understand her desire to dive deep into Humboldt's influence shoehorning in 5 mini bios of other figures into the end of the book moves the book away from its true center.

215,038535066X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4739424-mal-warwick,5,"He was the most famous man in the world, and more places around the world are named after him than anyone else. To many of the giants of his time — Johann Wolfgang von Goethe, Thomas Jefferson, Simon Bolivar, Charles Darwin, Henry David Thoreau — he was a colossus whose genius overshadowed their own. He was the first to describe the web of life on Earth, foreshadowing James Lovelock’s Gaia hypothesis, and the first to describe the impact of human activity on the world’s climate. His books, which read like poetry, “were so popular that people bribed booksellers to be the first to receive copies.” Eleven years after his death at age 89, the centennial of his birth was observed by hundreds of thousands of people in huge celebrations around the world.Chances are, you’ve never heard of him.His name was Alexander von Humboldt, and he died in 1859. He had first described climate change in 1800. He “gave us his concept of nature itself.”Andrea Wulf’s engrossing new biography, The Invention of Nature, brings this extraordinary man into the spotlight again after a century and a half. It’s about time. His may well have been one of the finest minds in human history.Humboldt, born into a prosperous family of Prussian aristocrats shortly after the American Civil War, rebelled against the constraints on his life and set out on his own unique path. Though he became best known as a naturalist, world traveler, and author, his interests reached into a far wider range of human endeavor, and Cosmos, the multi-volume book he began to write at the age of sixty-five, encompassed virtually the whole of human knowledge, from botany, geology, and zoology to astronomy, philosophy, and, in effect, the new science he invented: ecology. (Though he didn’t invent that term, his work was the inspiration for the man who did later in the nineteenth century.)As Wulf notes, “Humboldt took his readers from outer space to earth, and then from the surface of the planet into its inner core. He discussed comets, the Milky Way and the solar system as well as terrestrial magnetism, volcanoes and the snow line of mountains. He wrote about the migration of the human species, about plants and animals and the microscopic organisms that live in stagnant water or on the weathered surface of rocks.” Never before, and never since (to the best of my knowledge), has a single individual mastered so many fields of inquiry so successfully that his contemporaries regarded him as a force of nature. And, in an age when most of humanity lived in thrall to organized religion, Humboldt didn’t once mention God in all the many thousands of pages of his books. Instead, he spoke of a “wonderful web of organic life.”Wulf’s biography of this astonishing man is by no means unreservedly positive. She describes the shortcomings of his personality in embarrassing detail: his tendency to talk nonstop at a rapid rate for hours without permitting interruptions of any kind, regardless of the stature of his listeners; his seeming inability to understand the feelings of others and to show empathy for their pain; his venomous gossiping; and his inability to accept criticism. Alexander von Humboldt was not a nice man.Andrea Wulf is an historian and writer who lives in Britain. The Invention of Nature is her fifth book."
216,038535066X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/93114967-barbara,4,"I had some familiarity with von Humboldt before reading Andrea Wulf's book - intrepid young explorer of South America, well known in his time, ocean currents and rivers named for him, information source for Thomas Jefferson about Spanish colonial America. Obviously, an interesting guy, so when I saw an audio copy of The Invention of Nature: Alexander von Humboldt's New World on sale, I grabbed it. Turned out to be a good decision on my part. Von Humboldt was so much more than just that adventurous young man I'd heard of, and Wulf does an excellent job of filling out the picture and his impact.During that extended exploration of South America 200 years ago, while ranging through much of modern day Venezuela, Columbia, Ecuador and Peru, von Humboldt developed concepts of nature, climate and ecology that we take as ""new"" in the late 20th/early 21st centuries. He determined, for instance, that the drop in the level of Lake Valencia was tied to the destruction of the surrounding forest to clear land for farming. He made the connection that the absence of the trees dramatically reduced the ability of the land to retain water. While climbing Mt. Chimborazo in the Andes he developed the concept of altitude-based climate zones that are consistent around the globe. Comparing plants he found on the South American Atlantic coast with those growing on the African Atlantic coast, he intuited that the two land masses must once have been one.These were not simply casual observations for von Humboldt; after returning to Europe he spent the rest of his life as a scientist and author, successfully seeking out the data to support his theories. It's impossible here to summarize his many brilliant insights, but as one example, his perceptions of the devastating outcomes of human's impact on the natural world were prescient of the reality we experience today. Through his writings he influenced many key thinkers of the 19th century, including Darwin, Thoreau and Muir.In truth, I found the biographical information about those scientists and naturalists who built their own theories on his foundations to be more lengthy than necessary, and the latter part of the book dragged a bit for that reason. But overall, reading the story of von Humboldt, a polymath with the ability to pull together what he observed in multiple scientific fields to develop comprehensive theories, was time well spent. He deserves more recognition today."
217,038535066X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/35482263-gumble-s-yard,4,"Alexander Von Humboldt ... was one of the last polymaths, and died at a time when scientific disciplines were hardening into tightly fenced and more specialised fields. Consequently his more holistic approach - a scientific method that included art, history, poetry and politics alongside hard data - has fallen out of favour ..... One of [his] greatest achievements had been to make science accessible and popular ......... in a world where we draw a sharp line between the sciences and the arts, between he subjective and the objective, Humboldt's insight that we can only truly understand nature by using our imaginations makes him a visionaryAward winning biography of Alexander Von Humboldt, of who I was previously familiar from the fictional biography Measuring the World. Wulf ksets out to show that: he was a true polymath, perhaps the last to really range across all scientific disciplines; that at a time when science was becoming increasingly focused on classifications he remained able to see the big picture both across as well as within scientific disciplines; that at a time when romantic poets and data driven scientists were starting to grow in mutual incomprehension, his method of observing and describing nature in person and in capturing what he observed both in rigorous data and evocative descriptions, enabled him to be lionised by individuals on both sides of that divide; that in his pioneering work on the inter-connectedness of natural ecosystems and on the impact of human actions on those systems, he should be regarded as the founder of the environmental movement. She also is keen to emphasise his influence on others - starting with his almost lifelong friendship with and influence on the work of Goethe. Wulf writes chapters on each of Simon Bolivar, Charles Darwin and Henry Thoreau, cantering on their achievements but at all times seeking for the considerable impact Von Humboldt had on them. In perhaps the only slightly false note in the book, it finishes with more than fifty pages on his seemingly more tangential influence on three lesser known figures whose main achievements were after his death. Overall though this is a fascinating and well written account."
218,038535066X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1241339-clif,5,"Chicago's public radio station, WBEZ, had a program on the statue of Alexander Humboldt in the park named after him, in a neighborhood named after him. The program speculated that not one in a thousand passersby would know who he was. I've no doubt that's true. My only association of the name was with the Humboldt Current that brings cold water up the west coast of South America from Antarctica. With that as background, this book floored me.Humboldt was to the 19th century as Einstein was to the 20th. It's fair to say that everyone knew his name even decades after his death in 1859. He was a powerful influence on Charles Darwin, John Muir and Henry David Thoreau. On the seminal voyage aboard the Beagle that took Darwin around the world, his notes are peppered with ""as Humboldt said..."" whenever something was found that confirmed Humboldt's previous discoveries. Thoreau was a Humboldt devotee.During his lifetime, and he loved life, lectures given by Humboldt were packed, whether in America or Europe. His books were best sellers and he was personally acquainted with everyone who was anyone, from Napoleon (one of the few that didn't like Humboldt) through the royalty of Europe to Simón Bolívar, the liberator of South America, and on down from there. He was a font of knowledge on the natural world, was driven by curiosity and would even at an advanced age rush to attend the lectures of someone who knew something he did not, sitting in an audience of college students furiously taking notes as he listened.He had only one foible - he could not stop talking. Only the most determined could get in a comment, but few wished to do so as it would, but only possibly, interrupt the flow of knowledge they wanted to hear. Single his entire life with never any indication of an attraction to women, he bonded easily with men, forming lifelong friendships and exploring for months on end with a partner.His physical endurance and health were phenomenal. He climbed snow covered mountains with none of the equipment we know today, even above levels where oxygen should be used. As others would fall victim to tropical diseases, Humboldt was up at dawn ready to go. Clouds of mosquitoes for days and nights on end were no deterrent if there was a new plant, animal or rock formation to be examined.Not only did he crave knowledge, he wanted everyone to share in it. His Personal Narrative of the Equinoctial Regions of the New Continent (South America) was devoured by a public as eager to find out what had been found as we today would read the account of a person visiting another solar system. And, speaking of outer space, he took that subject on as well in his quest to tie everything together, writing the multi-volume Cosmos as he neared the end of his life.As Andrea Wulf makes clear in her title, The Invention of Nature, Humboldt was one of the first to come up with the concept of ecosystems, the interconnection of the natural world that allow an environment to thrive if left alone, and change it even to the point of destruction when this or that part is altered. While few of us today know of Humboldt, we live in the conceptual world of nature he created.This book is a wonderful wide-ranging history that covers not only Humboldt's life, but contains brief overviews of the lives and work of Darwin, Thoreau, George Perkins Marsh, Ernst Haeckel and John Muir in relation to Humboldt. Filled with adventure and excitement, Wulf perfectly captures a man to which we are all indebted and one who would be delighted to meet any of us and relate his discoveries.Sad to say, none of his books are in the network of public libraries including the one in my own town."
219,038535066X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7175349-david,5,"Didn't finish before it was due back to the library, but I read enough to be dazzled by Humboldt. First, I must praise this author for writing this book, bringing this once famous and celebrated figure back to our attention. The title is apparently not as hyperbolic as it seems, as her subject really does seem to have given both the public and the scientific community the idea of nature as an interconnected whole. No summary I could offer will do justice to the book, so you will need to read it yourself. And if it is not the kind of book you would read, then at least go to a bookstore or the library and skim enough to get some idea of it, because it is worth knowing about. (Note: yes, this is who Humboldt county in California is named after, and the University in Berlin, and the current in the Pacific Ocean, and many other things besides.)Here's a guy who got Goethe all stirred up, who explored the Amazon and the Andes, loved to get close to an erupting volcano, inspired Simon Bolivar to rebel against Spain, admired the American Revolution but could not understand why his friend Thomas Jefferson did not free the slaves, got Thoreau interested in nature, etc., etc. Seems to have been gay (avant la lettre), as his attachments to other men seem to have been unusual enough to cause his family some concern. Certainly his companions stuck with him through thick and thin, at risk to their lives with some frequency. My favorite is the poor guy who survives fever in the Amazon, crawling along a precarious mountain trail in a howling snowstorm, a hurricane at sea, just for a few examples, only to be berated for not working hard enough to publish their discoveries when they finally get back to Paris. Our hero could wear you out, apparently, not that anyone seemed to mind. And he was enough of a superstar that the King of Prussia kept him at court later in life even though it was no secret that he didn't believe in Monarchy and would support any revolution that might overthrow his patron. Think about that: he didn't worry about pleasing the King, the King worried about keeping him around.The book may seem too thorough to some readers (e.g., me), but when you think about the many volumes written by Humboldt, it's easy to see that she must have felt like this was the short version of the story. So worth checking out! "
220,038535066X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/180643-jim-coughenour,3,"A fine (re)introduction to Humboldt and his prescient ecological view of nature: that everything is connected and that humanity is capable of destroying the world it's been given. Humboldt appears as a brilliant, even heroic, transitional figure between the Enlightenment and the Romantic movement, between the positivism of science and the inwardness of art, between Goethe and Darwin. Wulf is also good at demonstrating his influence on other naturalists, not only Darwin but Thoreau, George Perkins Marsh (new to me), Ernst Haeckel and John Muir.Because I'd just finished reading On the Move: A Life, I couldn't help being reminded of Oliver Sacks, who also stood outside his own profession of neurology to capture the human and artistic dimension of knowledge, creating a new kind of scientific literature in the process. I was also intrigued to find out that Humboldt never married. He claimed his passion was only for science, but he was rarely without the company of another charismatic young man. His equally famous brother, Willem, ""disliked his brother's intense friendships – probably a mixture of jealousy and a concern for what might have seemed the inappropriate nature of these connections."" And finally, to my private embarrassment, I realized I've confused Alexander and Willem my whole life. (Humboldt University in Berlin is named after both of them.)The dark irony is that, although Humboldt was revered his warnings about how humanity was destroying its own environment were largely ignored. What should be obvious to everyone is still the stuff of partisan politics, and the grim conviction deepens that nothing will be done until it is too late, that it is in fact too late already."
221,038535066X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5871422-elena,5,"Andrea Wulf paints an appealing picture of the brilliant Alexander von Humboldt, an Enlightenment titan who climbed the highest mountains he could find with heavy instruments to make precise measurements, not just air pressure, but he had some kind of cyanograph to measure just how blue the sky was at different altitudes. He discussed science with Thomas Jefferson, whom he admired on one level, but AvH was firmly opposed to any form of slavery. He admired the indigenous peoples he met while exploring South America, and reported on the magnificent ruins of ancient American civilizations and the complex languages of the peoples he encountered in the colorful jungles, which he much perfered to his native Berlin. He deplored the degradation of the New World ecology by the mining and cash crops of the Spanish. Wulf did extensive research on his influence on Darwin and the theory of evolution which he anticipated with studies of fossils, on Goethe who put a bit of him into Faust, on Simon Bolivar who discussed concepts of political freedom with him, on Henry David Thoreau who's love of nature was nurtured by reading AvH's books on the interconnected-ness of nature, and on John Muir who read and annotated his books. Wulf found direct connections to show how his love of nature even inspired the Art Deco movement. His fame was universal, his name attached to currents, mountains, counties, cities all across the US and Latin America. It was the anti-German sentiments of World War I, intensified in World War II that cause his fame to be mostly extinguished along with admiration for German science and culture in general. Time to appreciate the man who pushed through legislation in Prussia that any slave, including any American slave, who lands on Prussian soil becomes a free person. "
222,038535066X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6432978-bfisher,4,"Alexander von Humboldt was one of the most prominent scientists of the nineteenth century. When he died in 1859, tens of thousands of mourners marched in his funeral procession. A staggering number of geographical features were named after him in his lifetime. It seems appropriate that the namesake Humboldt River, one of the largest rivers in the Great Basin of North America, disappears from sight in the Humboldt Sinks, much as Humboldt’s reputation has disappeared from modern popular memory.Yet, it is not fitting that Humboldt should be forgotten to our age. Andrea Wulf describes his roles as a founder of biogeography, inventor of isotherms, developer of the concept of ecological systems and the interdependence of life, and as the first scientist to recognize the danger of anthropogenic climate change. He influenced Darwin, Thoreau and John Muir. We recognize and adopt his ideas but have forgotten the person. This book is a useful recovery of the core importance to science and society of Humboldt's work. Unfortunately, in its coverage of Humboldt the scientist, Humboldt the person gets short shrift, aside from a few brief hints. That is my one quibble with this book."
223,038535066X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7283807-ben,1,"Desperately in need of an editor. Perhaps the author could not find enough source material on Humboldt himself. The majority of the book consists of capsule biographies and Wikipedia-level explanations of other people, such as Darwin or Muir. The author bombastically credits everything good to Humboldt. A typical phrasing, repeated dozens if not hundreds of times, goes like, ""Humboldt generously shared his library with X, and despite his own debts supported X financially. X praised Humboldt as 'one of the greatest scientists of his generation.'"" There is very little insight added to the material. The author does not bring any skepticism to the table, and is entirely credulous when it comes to Humboldt. Unfortunately, this means that you can't trust what few conclusions are drawn. I only finished it because I had an audiobook. Not worth reading. "
224,038535066X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/18845147-gill,4,"This is a well written, comprehensive account of the life of Alexander von Humboldt, and his influences and influence. I found it an interesting read, and the specialist sections clearly explained. I found the section on his links with Simon Bolívar especially interesting. Well done to Andrea Wulf for introducing a man who was so important in his own time to a present day audience."
225,038535066X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2758455-katy,5,Excellent book! Alexander Von Humboldt is a hero for science & nature and was ahead of his time. We can all still learn from him and from those who were influenced by him.

The author does a marvelous job of weaving the life and times of a transcendent individual who was the first to recognize the unity within nature. Humboldt's legacy of scientific inquiry has style of writing has impacted generations of scientist, writers and readers all around the world. His numerous works and lectures are still revelant as the world faces a global environmental crossroads. I highly encourage readers to pick up this outstanding work."
227,038535066X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/96806543-the-colonial,3,"Alexander von Humboldt’s name can be seen throughout the world’s streets, trails, universities, and rivers, yet the man and his mystique are rarely brought to our actual attention. By the early-nineteenth century, Humboldt had become what today we would call both an Environmentalist and Renaissance Man—as he was a scientist, explorer, naturalist, botanist, and colleague of renowned and like-minded intellectuals of the age. Andrea Wulf weaves all of these traits together in order to discuss Humboldt’s life journey and the groundbreaking ideas that he introduced our world to—some far too ahead of the times for the likes of his contemporaries.The first half of the book appropriately covers Humboldt’s beginnings, from his boyhood and ancestry in Prussia, to his rise in education and esteem in the scientific world. Wulf devotes much attention to Humboldt’s standing in the political world as a whole, where the botanist is doted upon by courtly officials and diplomats from such prosperous world powers as Russia, Great Britain, Spain, and the United States. He is honored by the prestigious Royal Society of London as a foreign member, and throughout his remarkable life he meets the likes of such prominent figures as Joseph Banks, Benjamin Smith Barton, Thomas Jefferson, Benjamin Rush, and a young and upcoming Charles Darwin.Unfortunately, Wulf’s enthusiasm for her subject is too broad in its approach, as she pivots into the second half of the book by focusing on the great men that were influenced by Humboldt—all of which include famous scientists, authors, environmentalists, and inventors. This is collectively balanced out by her engaging and imaginative prose, where she fortunately excels at using her fascination with Humboldt as well as that of nature itself for her inspiration. Wulf majestically explains each and every tour and journey that Humboldt embarked upon, as well as the meetings he held with prominent men of his times:…Humboldt informed Jefferson, where he had collected plants, made astronomical observations, found hieroglyphs of ancient civilizations deep in the rainforest and had amassed important data from the colonial archives of Mexico City. Humboldt also wrote to James Madison, the Secretary of State and Jefferson’s closest political ally, declaring that ‘having witnessed the great spectacle of the majestic Andes and the grandeur of the physical world I intended to enjoy the spectacle of a free people.’ Politics and nature belonged together–an idea that Humboldt would be discussing with the Americans.With almost the final half of the book being dedicated to Thoreau, Darwin, George Perkins Marsh, John Muir, and Ernst Haeckel, the reader unfortunately loses interest on the main subject of Humboldt’s adventurous life—leaving a sense of unfulfillment. It’s apparent that Wulf has so much more to tell on Alexander von Humboldt’s life, which is almost frustrating since the reader is constantly engrossed and intrigued in his story, due to the benefit of her writing style and equal fascination. Apart from the unnecessary segue into like-minded men, there is still much to be gained by the modern reader from reading Wulf’s work on an environmental pioneer and enlightened man of many qualifications and achievements. Maps are provided, a useful “Note on Humboldt’s Publications”, as well as helpful illustrations found throughout the text.

228,038535066X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3007401-biblio-files-takingadayoff,5,"Apparently, in much of Europe, Alexander von Humboldt is as well known as Charles Darwin is to those of us in the United States and Britain. A naturalist and explorer, Humboldt took his upper class education in 18th century Prussia and applied it to becoming a Renaissance man in 19th century Europe and America. Humboldt was especially interested in plant life, but he was an extremely energetic and focused person who also enjoyed studying all forms of life on earth, as well as philosophy, literature and poetry, astronomy, and languages. He loved participating in the frequent salons of the time and became friends with Goethe, and later with Simon Bolivar in his pre-revolutionary days traveling in Europe. He reached out to Thomas Jefferson as a fellow scientist (Jefferson was not only a gentleman farmer, but a scientific farmer as well) and procured an invitation to stay at the President's mansion while he visited Washington, D.C. Later, in Paris, he tried to play diplomat with Napoleon, but was not successful. Still, Napoleon was said to be impressed with his scientific works and to have read Humboldt's books.Humboldt's claim to fame as a scientist is to have been one of the first to see plant life, animal life, the cosmos, geology, everything, as a part of a single ecosystem, rather than as individual and not necessarily connected pieces. This is so basic to our way of thinking today that it seems obvious and not particularly remarkable. But it is as fundamentally different a way of looking at the world as Darwin's idea of natural selection was. Andrea Wulf's biography describes Humboldt's studies, travels, accomplishments -- you feel as if Humboldt would be quite an engaging, if hard to keep up with, fellow. After reading The Invention of Nature, the question that still nagged at me was how I had never learned of this whirlwind before. "
229,038535066X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/241691-kay,4,"“Temperament is destiny,” or so the proverb says, though I have always been suspicious of such broad sweeps of rhetoric. Still, this saying kept echoing through my head as I read this book, for I could not help but wonder: “What makes such a man as Alexander von Humboldt? What motivates him, drives him forward, helps him overcome obstacles, or, perhaps even ultimately, is his very undoing?” It seemed as I read of Humboldt’s life, passions, and seemingly boundless energy, that he must have sprung, almost Athena-like, from his mother’s womb, set from the get-go on a trajectory that would send him around the world in an unceasing round of exploration, research, and writing. Certainly, the advantages of his upbringing and background helped: a stable home, wealth, attentive (if distant) parents, exacting tutors, a library at his disposal. Yet there are other men and women that I can think of, such as the naturalist Alfred Russel Wallace or the explorer Mary Kingsley who had few such advantages, but, like Humboldt, possessed an urge for going, a forward momentum, an insatiable curiosity, and above all, seemingly boundless resources of optimism, courage, and self-reliance. They were, I can’t help but feel, the chosen few, blessed with a rare combination of temperament, intelligence, and energy. It is a magic formula – and, oh, if only I possessed it! The title of this book could well have been “Why Humboldt Matters,” and it’s scarcely a spoiler to reveal that he matters very much, and indeed is perhaps more relevant than ever. Although Humboldt is little thought about or even known about today, in his time he was the most famous scientist in the world - and that was before the term ""scientist"" even existed. It was Humboldt's accounts of his travels in South America and Russia that most captured the public's attention, but among Enlightenment-era and 19th century intellectual circles, his reputation as the authority on a wide range of scientific matters was unquestioned. His vision of nature as an integrated, interconnected and interdependent force, one, furthermore, indifferent to and even damaged by man is what most influenced thinkers of his time, and it is this complex and far-sighted vision which resonates today, perhaps now more than ever in the face of impending environmental threats.Wulf's explanation of why Humboldt fell into relative obscurity during the 20th century, particularly in the U.S.A., wasn't entirely convincing. She cites anti-German sentiment in the wake of the First World War, the fragmentation of science into specialized fields, and the fact that ""Humboldt is not known for a single fact or a discovery but for his worldview. His vision of nature has passed into our consciousness as if by osmosis."" But I think another reason lies within the pages of Wulf's book: Humboldt was the original ""torch bearer,"" but that torch has been taken up by many, some of whom Wulf devotes chapters to, such as Charles Darwin and John Muir. These figures, rather than Humboldt, occupy a larger place in the current public imagination. However, in contemplating Humboldt's scientific eclipse, once again I fell to musing about our fickleness in choosing heroes. Charles Darwin, hero (or blasphemer, depending on your perspective) is universally known if perhaps less than universally understood. (Hence the “blasphemer” part, one could argue.) His less-well-heeled contemporary, Alfred Russel Wallace, simultaneous and independent formulator of the theory of natural selection, while more recently enjoying a bit of an upswing, is still a relative unknown. (And can you guess which of the two is a personal hero? Corr-rect! Wallace it is!) Alfred Einstein, virtually a pop star in the scientific firmament, is but one very bright star in a constellation of equally impressive luminaries – Niels Bohr, Max Planck, Ernest Rutherford, Paul Dirac, James Clerk Maxwell – but it is Einstein who inhabits the popular imagination as the preeminent scientist of all time. (Though many will, of course, at least have a hazy idea, as I do, that Schrödinger and a cat also come into play somewhere.) Yet, after living for years with a physicist, I can confidently state that this much is true: No genius exists in splendid isolation. Each is perched on the shoulders of genii who preceded him. Or her. And so it unquestionably was with Humboldt, whose influences included Johann Wolfgang von Goethe, Captain Cook, Joseph Banks, Immanuel Kant, and indeed the very temper of the Age of Enlightenment. Yet Wulf’s biography focuses primarily on how Humboldt influenced his contemporaries and subsequent generations.  The most prominent of Humboldt’s followers (and that’s not too strong a term, really), was Darwin, who arguably would never have made that voyage on  The Beagle had he not been inspired by Humboldt’s account of his South American travels. Wulf devotes a chapter each to Darwin and four others who fell under Humboldt’s spell: Henry David Thoreau, George Perkins Marsh, Ernst Haeckel, and John Muir. Some of these Humboldtiphiles (Darwin, Thoreau, Muir), I knew something about, though admittedly it seems I knew less about Thoreau than I had thought, while of the remaining two, Marsh and Haeckel, I knew nothing. The chapter on Haeckel I particularly enjoyed, for I have a longstanding interest in Art Nouveau and its various architectural offshoots, and I immediately perceived how Haeckel’s wonderful fusion of art and science became the wellspring for many artists in the new (20th) century. Look at Gaudi’s Casa Batlló and then look at Haeckel’s illustrations of radiolarians (microscopic sea creatures) and the similarities are almost breathtaking. Why, that famous unfinished cathedral in Barcelona is but a radiolarian writ large!In short, I came away not just with a very good idea of Humboldt’s life after reading The Invention of Nature, but also was treated to five succinct mini-biographies of his most influential acolytes. Looking over that group provides a good sense of how all-encompassing Humboldt’s polymath grasp was: he influenced natural scientists, philosopher poets, conservationists, preservationists, earth scientists, artists, and even politicians and kings. Oh, and to add a bit more to this grandiose mix, Humboldt’s friends and contemporaries included the likes of Thomas Jefferson, Simon Bolivar, Joseph Hooker, and practically the entire scientific and intellectual elite of his age, with whom he maintained a voluminous correspondence.But again….that energy! Reading of Humboldt’s travels, experiments, indefatigable correspondence, and the breadth of his expertise practically made my head spin. Wulf makes the point – repeatedly – that perhaps Humboldt’s most singular legacy was his ability to synthesize information from areas which, today, are broken into discrete fields, such as climatology, volcanology, botany, biology, geology, meteorology, seismology, and paleontology, just to name a few. Those fields were all given a hearty kick-start by Humboldt’s grand synthesis, his Cosmos. It is this great overarching view of nature that inspired those that followed. Reading (but, admittedly, not entirely comprehending) how Humboldt achieved this was inspirational. A couple of final notes: firstly, the illustrations in the book were a delight. May I confess how much I enjoy well-selected (and nicely rendered) illustrations? I sometimes feel a little jolt of pleasure whenever I turn the page to find one. The chapter on Haeckel, for example, cried out for some of his radiolarian drawings. And there they were! Along with some equally fetching Medusae. Another not entirely unexpected joy was Wulf’s style. She has one! That is to say, I got a sense of 
her
 from reading this book, but she never intruded upon the subject, which always remained in focus. While it’s clear that Wulf must have loved researching and writing about Humboldt, she judiciously organized the material and trimmed her narrative, then wrote it in a lively yet elegant style that made me think, on the whole, that I would rather enjoy meeting this author. At any rate, I certainly want to read more of her work. "

231,038535066X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/18695911-daniel-chaikin,4,"It was interesting this evening, as I was driving home and listening to Michael Pollan read his latest book, to hear him refer to this book as if it were a major inspiration for him. Humboldt's view of nature as one entire interconnected thing. It is a beautiful concept, one he made at length and, as Wulf shows, elegantly and poetically. Darwin, who eventually met Humboldt, found Humboldt's writing inspirational for his scientific view of nature. Henry Thoreau devoured his writing, and found inspiration of his poetic view of the nature around his small pond. And John Muir, so enraptured he set off for Cuba and South America until he learned the tropical climates made him ill, found in Humboldt an inspiration for the environmental movement. And, I should mention, Simon Bolivar not only found in Humboldt a South American natural identity he raved about, but also used Humboldt's maps in his military campaigns. Wulf follows all these threads and more, in great detail. She rushes headlong through narratives, making them something of a roller coaster ride, and she spends time at the end wondering why the contemporary English speaking world has practically forgotten who Humboldt was or why anyone cares. What did he accomplish anyway, other than create some of the first detailed maps in a few hard to reach parts of South America? He was, it seems, primarily and powerfully, an inspiration. OK, he also invented the idea of nature. Well, maybe. I mean, Wulf makes the claim, over and over again, but it's a claim that reveals a major weakness in the book that bothered me a lot. She presents, ultimately, a very narrow in focus. So, yes, no question, Humboldt has a thought-provoking unified view on nature. But, was he the first? What was the intellectual world around him thinking, and what were the foundations? Is it possible nature as a unified thing was brought up before? Ever? by anyone? Wulf doesn't do context well, or didn't here. Really, mainly what she does is report stories in lengthy but also abbreviated forms. I liked her book and I really liked learning about Humbolt. It's not a perfect work, but it's not like the early 19th century intellectual world is an easy one to capture. So, flawed but still recommended, and who knows, you might be blown away like Michael Pollan.-----------------------------------------------60.

232,038535066X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/67736000-elizabeth-a-g,5,"Andrea Wulf's The Invention of Nature: Alexander von Humboldt's New World is an enjoyable, well-written and researched exploration of one man's vision of the world around him and how his restless spirit and determination gave us a deep appreciation of nature and presented the idea connectedness of all things organic and inorganic. Alexander von Humboldt is little remembered today and this book sheds a light on the scientist, ecologist. educator, and humanist who influenced later, better known naturalists like Darwin, Thoreau, George Perkins Marsh, Ernst Haeckel, and John Muir. Humboldt believed in the power of education and his writings and books were aimed toward a general audience rather than to specifically the scientific community. In fact he sought to show how nature is a living organism and that there is unity in scientific thought and the emotional response to nature that is expressed in poetry, art and music. He is also one of the first to warn that the activities of man in his commercial pursuits are bringing about the destruction of forests and creating climate change. In this book Wulf describes Humboldt's influence on future environmentalists and goes into some detail on these others...my only issue that perhaps the author could have shortened this section of the book by more of a summarization rather such detail (the subjects for a future book, perhaps). The epilogue of the book is excellent."
233,038535066X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/23195904-radiantflux,2,"43rd book for 2018.A hagiography of 19th C polymath/naturalist Alexander von Humboldt that never gets beyond the surface of his eventful life. About half the book is padded with simplistic one chapter biopics of people purported to have been strongly influenced by Humboldt, often to an extent that is hard to credit. So according to Wulf: Goethe modelled Faust on Humboldt; Darwin would not have travelled on the Beagle and eventually developed evolutionary theory; John Muir wouldn't have become a environmentalist and saved the redwoods; Heckel wouldn't have created art that directly lead to Art Nouveau; and Bolívar wouldn't have become a revolutionary leading to the decolonization of Spain in Latin America. Wulf also repeatedly credits him with discovering climate change, centuries before it came to conscious awareness here, despite no evidence that this is true. Near the end of the book, she credits his current day obscurity (which is not really true) from a reaction against all things German after the 2nd World War, but if this was really correct, why are so many other German scientists and writers remembered and him not? Perhaps it is more to do with him never creating a lasting advance in knowledge via synthesis (a la Darwin).A great opportunity that is wasted by lack of in depth research and a critical appraisal of Humboldt's life.2-stars."
234,038535066X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/76176316-alistair-mackay,4,"The most famous man you’ve never heard of. Alexander Von Humboldt was a superstar explorer, botanist, geologist, naturalist. He inspired Charles Darwin and Henry David Thoreau. He was friends with Simon Bolivar. He invented the thermal lines on maps and came up with the idea of ecosystems and climate zones. He was a scientist before that was a word, and a naturalist before all the different disciplines of nature split into their factions. He believed nature needed to be understood with facts and poetry, felt as well as experienced. And he predicted climate change and deforestation... in the 1790s. I don’t usually enjoy biographies but I loved this book. It’s well-researched and well written. It’s a fascinating look at the adventures and contributions of a truly great man, and the grandfather of the environmental movement. He was the most famous man in the world at one point, and he’s been lost to history only because of 20th Century anti-German sentiment. Glad I read this and learnt about Humboldt. We owe him so much. "
235,038535066X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/155776-katharine,5,"Do you like science? Literature? History? Do you have strong emotional reactions to being in nature? Then you should read this book! I will boldly say this book is my favorite book of 2015 and I plan on recommending it to everyone I know. Part of the delight is that I had no knowledge of Humboldt before reading this book and I was amazed to learn how influential and inspiring he was to people in the 18th and 19th centuries. With direct links to American founding fathers, the Romantic Literature movement, and Simon Bolivar's fight for independence in South America, and Charles Darwin Humboldt is seed that many modern ideas are sprung from. Although I read a library copy of this book I promptly went out and bought my own personal copy because it's a book I will treasure for years to come."
236,038535066X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/8942931-steph-post,5,"A gorgeous book for science, art and literature fans alike. This is more than a biography of Humboldt (one of the most interesting scientists and explorers of all time)- it's a dedication to his legacy and an exploration of how his findings and philosophies eventually influenced everything from Art Nouveau to Walden to John Muir. Wide and diverse in breadth and scope, this reminds me of one of my favorite books- The Age of Wonder. "
237,038535066X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/637858-mike,4,"I never knew much about Humboldt, yet I found this book breathtaking. A man of natural science of the 19th century, multitalented, and as smart and as dedicated as they come. Substantial impact on Latin American knowledge, and shared experiences.Well written, insightful, an easy and smooth learning experience."

240,038535066X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3409532-april-does-feral-sometimes,4,"The book 'The Invention of Nature' is fascinating. It is more than a biography of Alexander Von Humboldt (1769-1859), who can be described as a polymath genius whose enthusiasm for travel and nature was as momentous for the development of as many branches of science that Albert Einstein (1879-1955) was because of his interest in physics. Yet, I have never heard of him until I read this book.Some early Western 19th-century proto-scientists labored all of their life in bleak obscurity until only after their deaths being recognized as major scientific brains and discoverers; others announced their work to newly created scientific societies only to be met with withering scorn. Some inventors were clearly crackpots with one great idea while others were intelligent driven members of respectable aristocrat families and upper-class merchants. (Almost all of these Great Men of Science upset their parents by refusing to study law or medicine in university! Humboldt was one of these children of disappointed parents. I have read a few other science histories, and I have noticed that almost all of these early scientists had parents hoping for a son who would become a doctor or lawyer. Just saying.)However, Humboldt became famous early in his lifetime and all doors were open to him. He met already famous people eager to speak with him, such as President Thomas Jefferson. Others who desired to call him friend went on to illustrious (and nefarious) careers as famous scientists in their own right such as Charles Darwin, well-known writers such as Henry David Thoreau, and Kings, Emperors and Prime Ministers such as Friedrich Wilhelm IV and George Canning, as well as leaders of political revolutions overthrowing those before-mentioned Kings and Emperors such as Simón Bolívar. Humboldt himself was a liberal and he supported the overthrow of the aristocracy, but his income primarily was from a pension paid by two Prussian kings after he went through his own inheritance. He obviously was charismatic, moving easily between many different cultures and social classes, from South America to Europe to Russia.After returning from a five-year exploration of South America with tens of thousands of astronomical, geological and meteorological observations and specimens, he published his first book, 'Essay on the Geography of Plants' at age 32, dedicating it to Johann Wolfgang Goethe, his fellow polymath and best friend (after his brother Wilhelm von Humboldt, who founded the University of Berlin after a career as the Prussian ambassador to Vienna and Britain). The book combined with his achievements and personality made him a famous man, perhaps the most famous respected natural scientist in the world. However, full of energy, wanderlust and curiosity, Humboldt moved on to more explorations crossing over the frontlines of many European wars between France, Prussia, Britain, and Spain, and maneuvering through countries on three continents which were undergoing political revolutions, observing volcano eruptions while mountain climbing without oxygen tanks (yes, he and his companions fainted occasionally) enduring nasty mosquitos, while exposing and warning the public of the dreadful environmental destruction of earth wherever men used the land for agriculture, mining and lumber.Humboldt lived to the age of 89, still receiving famous visitors and writing thousands of letters a month up to his death. His books on the natural sciences, illustrated with his own and other explorers' beautiful art and drawings, inspired Darwin, Thoreau, Ernst Haeckel, John Muir, to name a few. Rivers, mountains, towns and other landmarks were named after him, and he is mentioned in thousands of famous novels. Yet most Americans today have never heard of him, probably because of World War I and WWII having been fought against Germany as an enemy of the United States. I think we should bring this man back into the spotlight and make him a famous hero scientist again. This book is an excellent start.Below I've included some Wikipedia links about the early naturalists, Humboldt, and many of the famous intellectuals, writers and scientists he inspired in later centuries, in hope that these thumbnail histories will convince you, gentle reader, to pick up this book:http://www.ranker.com/list/notable-na...https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alexa...https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kosmo...https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Georg...https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Man_a...https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ernst...https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kunst...https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_..."
241,038535066X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2527265-david,5,"It is a sad commentary on our age (or maybe me personally) that, when I am about to get really enthusiastic about something, as in this case, I feel the need to make clear that I am NOT being sarcastic. HOLY MOLY! WOW! What an awesome book! Just reading it made me happy to be alive! Really! It was a wonderful break from the dreary procession of bad news parading out of every media orifice! (Note to self: improve your imagery.) I neglected other self-improving projects to read this book, and then was sad when I finished it! Worthy of all awards and accolades! The world would be a better place if everyone was forced to read it, at gunpoint if necessary! Don't just stand (or sit) there, go out and get a copy right away!I love narratives about news events, scandals, and personalities that once famous, but now forgotten. This is one of them, of a man known by everyone when living, celebrated, called without irony the greatest man who had ever lived, sought out by tedious rich people and aristocrats, pestered for autographs, and recipient of mountains of admiring old-school paper letters. Intrepid and death-defying explorer, partisan of liberty, deplorer of slavery and cruelty, widely-admired prose stylist, polyglot, polymath. Honored by having towns, counties, and other jurisdictions named after him. Further honored by having a Pacific Ocean current named after him and, even cooler still, also a critter described by Wikipedia as a ""large predatory squid"". His books were anticipated with an enthusiasm which today, sadly, only occurs with certain entries in the ""Young Adult"" market. Pirated translations of his works were rushed to market to satisfy bottomless demand. He was even -- dare I say it? -- the Werner Herzog of his age (ok, yes, Humboldt was Prussian and Herzog Bavarian, but let's not nitpick). As young men, both were driven by some inner demon to seek out the most pestilential, soggy, disease-ridden, and predator-filled sections of inner South America, and came back to ""civilization"", such as it is, with precious insights and striking images, which changed the way people looked at the world. When older, both continued to push into far corners of the world (including, in both cases, Siberia) at a time of life when most of us find it increasingly difficult to get out of bed.Humboldt actually had a life that was both exciting and well-documented, so writing about him was a little like shooting fish in barrel. I don't wish to belittle the author's achievement: the narrative always moves along at an entertaining clip, even during those periods when Humboldt had to spend some time toadying up to various Kaisers in order to keep the old mazuma rolling in. I also enjoyed the last few chapters, which switched tone from standard biography of one man to mini chapter-long biographies of various men (including Simon Bolivar, Charles Darwin, Henry David Thoreau, and John Muir), with a concentration on how Humboldt changed the lives and directions of their thoughts. The point, I believe, was that, even though his name is no longer on everybody's lips, Humboldt is still very much with us.To repeat: delightful. Read it.The only thing that I didn't like about this book was the realization at the conclusion that, no matter what achievements I, uh, achieve with the balance of my life, I will never, ever, have a large predatory squid named after me. "
242,038535066X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6938150-marie-paule,5,"When in Berlin a few years ago, I came by the magnificent building of the Humboldt University. And I know that quite a few plants are named '... humboldtiensis'. Although I have a PhD in Science I knew nothing more about Alexander von Humboldt. What a shame. On Sep 14, 1869, the 100th birthday of this brilliant man, there were celebrations all over the world: Europe, Africa, Australia and the America's. More than 100 years later, he seems to be forgotten. What a life he has led. In his younger years, he became a lifetime friend of Goethe, who, besides being a poet, was very interested in botanics and geology. They were both interested in the dualism between the external and internal world (Kant and his 'Kritik der reinen Vernunft'). Is the tree in my garden a real tree, or my idea of a tree? Humboldt gradually shifted from pure empirical research towards his own interpretation of nature: he mixed detailed scientific facts with the emotional reactions they invoked. He thought a great deal about 'Life'. A machine can be taken apart and reassembled, but you can't do this with an animal. Why? Von Humboldt’s most important journey was a 5 year-trip through South America. There, he developed the first concept of 'ecosystems' (long before we knew this particular word), explaining that geology, climate, micro-organisms, plants and animals all influence each other. When he travelled through the plains of Los llanos in Venezuela in 1800 (!), he warned for the destructive effects of human activity (large scale agriculture of commercial crops, mining, ...) on the ecosystems. At the same time, he pointed out that the overexploitation of local ecosystems had disastrous effects on the human population as well: slavery, unhealthy working conditions, a shortage of local healthy foods, exploitation of large groups of have-nots by the happy few….. Sounds familiar, no?Does it surprise you that Alexander von Humboldt became one of the best liftetime friends of Simon Bolivar, who fought to liberate South America from its Spanish colonists? All through his live, von Humboldt fought against slavery. He so longed to visit India, but the British government denied him a passport, because they knew how he felt about slavery and he was not willing to compromise…. For the British, he remained a dangerous anti-colonialist actor. Later in life, he made a great journey through Russia, all the way to Mongolia. He held his 60th birthday party in … the pharmacy of Lenin’s grandfather. After his return from South America, von Humboldt lived in Paris and in London, where he met the famous scientists of his time. He inspired a lot of scientists and writers of his time, among others Charles Darwin, Henry David Thoreau, George Perkin Marsh, Ernst Haeckel and John Muir. Indeed, what a life and what a talent… At the end of his life, von Humboldt wrote his magnum opus ‘Kosmos’: an overview of his own and other scientific findings, but above all, his opinion about the correlations and relationships between different scientific theories, and the interrelation between science, art and sociology. For von Humboldt, there were no boundaries between scientific domains or between science and humanities. In short: von Humboldt was a scientist who was far ahead of his time and who remains a lighting example for us all."

There is no limit to how many tags you can list, and they facilitate searching tremendously, so I’ve taken to tagging my books extensively to create indexes to help bring the book back to mind. I felt I was not up to the task of doing justice to Alexander von Humboldt with a humble review of my own.

244,038535066X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4070288-jo,4,The first 2/3 of this book are 5 star material. Wulf vividly depicts Humboldt's travels and his personality. He is a fascinating subject. The last sections really suffers in comparison. Her choice of figures to investigate his legacy through their biography is both too focused and too limited to be truly effective. While I understand her desire to dive deep into Humboldt's influence shoehorning in 5 mini bios of other figures into the end of the book moves the book away from its true center. Leaving Humboldt behind made me want to throw myself on the ground in the middle of the town square and yell about things breaking per my hero AvH.
245,038535066X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4739424-mal-warwick,5,"He was the most famous man in the world, and more places around the world are named after him than anyone else. To many of the giants of his time — Johann Wolfgang von Goethe, Thomas Jefferson, Simon Bolivar, Charles Darwin, Henry David Thoreau — he was a colossus whose genius overshadowed their own. He was the first to describe the web of life on Earth, foreshadowing James Lovelock’s Gaia hypothesis, and the first to describe the impact of human activity on the world’s climate. His books, which read like poetry, “were so popular that people bribed booksellers to be the first to receive copies.” Eleven years after his death at age 89, the centennial of his birth was observed by hundreds of thousands of people in huge celebrations around the world.Chances are, you’ve never heard of him.His name was Alexander von Humboldt, and he died in 1859. He had first described climate change in 1800. He “gave us his concept of nature itself.”Andrea Wulf’s engrossing new biography, The Invention of Nature, brings this extraordinary man into the spotlight again after a century and a half. It’s about time. His may well have been one of the finest minds in human history.Humboldt, born into a prosperous family of Prussian aristocrats shortly after the American Civil War, rebelled against the constraints on his life and set out on his own unique path. Though he became best known as a naturalist, world traveler, and author, his interests reached into a far wider range of human endeavor, and Cosmos, the multi-volume book he began to write at the age of sixty-five, encompassed virtually the whole of human knowledge, from botany, geology, and zoology to astronomy, philosophy, and, in effect, the new science he invented: ecology. (Though he didn’t invent that term, his work was the inspiration for the man who did later in the nineteenth century.)As Wulf notes, “Humboldt took his readers from outer space to earth, and then from the surface of the planet into its inner core. He discussed comets, the Milky Way and the solar system as well as terrestrial magnetism, volcanoes and the snow line of mountains. He wrote about the migration of the human species, about plants and animals and the microscopic organisms that live in stagnant water or on the weathered surface of rocks.” Never before, and never since (to the best of my knowledge), has a single individual mastered so many fields of inquiry so successfully that his contemporaries regarded him as a force of nature. And, in an age when most of humanity lived in thrall to organized religion, Humboldt didn’t once mention God in all the many thousands of pages of his books. Instead, he spoke of a “wonderful web of organic life.”Wulf’s biography of this astonishing man is by no means unreservedly positive. She describes the shortcomings of his personality in embarrassing detail: his tendency to talk nonstop at a rapid rate for hours without permitting interruptions of any kind, regardless of the stature of his listeners; his seeming inability to understand the feelings of others and to show empathy for their pain; his venomous gossiping; and his inability to accept criticism. Alexander von Humboldt was not a nice man.Andrea Wulf is an historian and writer who lives in Britain. The Invention of Nature is her fifth book."
246,038535066X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/93114967-barbara,4,"I had some familiarity with von Humboldt before reading Andrea Wulf's book - intrepid young explorer of South America, well known in his time, ocean currents and rivers named for him, information source for Thomas Jefferson about Spanish colonial America. Obviously, an interesting guy, so when I saw an audio copy of The Invention of Nature: Alexander von Humboldt's New World on sale, I grabbed it. Turned out to be a good decision on my part. Von Humboldt was so much more than just that adventurous young man I'd heard of, and Wulf does an excellent job of filling out the picture and his impact.During that extended exploration of South America 200 years ago, while ranging through much of modern day Venezuela, Columbia, Ecuador and Peru, von Humboldt developed concepts of nature, climate and ecology that we take as ""new"" in the late 20th/early 21st centuries. He determined, for instance, that the drop in the level of Lake Valencia was tied to the destruction of the surrounding forest to clear land for farming. He made the connection that the absence of the trees dramatically reduced the ability of the land to retain water. While climbing Mt. Chimborazo in the Andes he developed the concept of altitude-based climate zones that are consistent around the globe. Comparing plants he found on the South American Atlantic coast with those growing on the African Atlantic coast, he intuited that the two land masses must once have been one.These were not simply casual observations for von Humboldt; after returning to Europe he spent the rest of his life as a scientist and author, successfully seeking out the data to support his theories. It's impossible here to summarize his many brilliant insights, but as one example, his perceptions of the devastating outcomes of human's impact on the natural world were prescient of the reality we experience today. Through his writings he influenced many key thinkers of the 19th century, including Darwin, Thoreau and Muir.In truth, I found the biographical information about those scientists and naturalists who built their own theories on his foundations to be more lengthy than necessary, and the latter part of the book dragged a bit for that reason. But overall, reading the story of von Humboldt, a polymath with the ability to pull together what he observed in multiple scientific fields to develop comprehensive theories, was time well spent. He deserves more recognition today."
247,038535066X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/35482263-gumble-s-yard,4,"Alexander Von Humboldt ... was one of the last polymaths, and died at a time when scientific disciplines were hardening into tightly fenced and more specialised fields. Consequently his more holistic approach - a scientific method that included art, history, poetry and politics alongside hard data - has fallen out of favour ..... One of [his] greatest achievements had been to make science accessible and popular ......... in a world where we draw a sharp line between the sciences and the arts, between he subjective and the objective, Humboldt's insight that we can only truly understand nature by using our imaginations makes him a visionaryAward winning biography of Alexander Von Humboldt, of who I was previously familiar from the fictional biography Measuring the World. Wulf ksets out to show that: he was a true polymath, perhaps the last to really range across all scientific disciplines; that at a time when science was becoming increasingly focused on classifications he remained able to see the big picture both across as well as within scientific disciplines; that at a time when romantic poets and data driven scientists were starting to grow in mutual incomprehension, his method of observing and describing nature in person and in capturing what he observed both in rigorous data and evocative descriptions, enabled him to be lionised by individuals on both sides of that divide; that in his pioneering work on the inter-connectedness of natural ecosystems and on the impact of human actions on those systems, he should be regarded as the founder of the environmental movement. She also is keen to emphasise his influence on others - starting with his almost lifelong friendship with and influence on the work of Goethe. Wulf writes chapters on each of Simon Bolivar, Charles Darwin and Henry Thoreau, cantering on their achievements but at all times seeking for the considerable impact Von Humboldt had on them. In perhaps the only slightly false note in the book, it finishes with more than fifty pages on his seemingly more tangential influence on three lesser known figures whose main achievements were after his death. Overall though this is a fascinating and well written account."
248,038535066X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1241339-clif,5,"Chicago's public radio station, WBEZ, had a program on the statue of Alexander Humboldt in the park named after him, in a neighborhood named after him. The program speculated that not one in a thousand passersby would know who he was. I've no doubt that's true. My only association of the name was with the Humboldt Current that brings cold water up the west coast of South America from Antarctica. With that as background, this book floored me.Humboldt was to the 19th century as Einstein was to the 20th. It's fair to say that everyone knew his name even decades after his death in 1859. He was a powerful influence on Charles Darwin, John Muir and Henry David Thoreau. On the seminal voyage aboard the Beagle that took Darwin around the world, his notes are peppered with ""as Humboldt said..."" whenever something was found that confirmed Humboldt's previous discoveries. Thoreau was a Humboldt devotee.During his lifetime, and he loved life, lectures given by Humboldt were packed, whether in America or Europe. His books were best sellers and he was personally acquainted with everyone who was anyone, from Napoleon (one of the few that didn't like Humboldt) through the royalty of Europe to Simón Bolívar, the liberator of South America, and on down from there. He was a font of knowledge on the natural world, was driven by curiosity and would even at an advanced age rush to attend the lectures of someone who knew something he did not, sitting in an audience of college students furiously taking notes as he listened.He had only one foible - he could not stop talking. Only the most determined could get in a comment, but few wished to do so as it would, but only possibly, interrupt the flow of knowledge they wanted to hear. Single his entire life with never any indication of an attraction to women, he bonded easily with men, forming lifelong friendships and exploring for months on end with a partner.His physical endurance and health were phenomenal. He climbed snow covered mountains with none of the equipment we know today, even above levels where oxygen should be used. As others would fall victim to tropical diseases, Humboldt was up at dawn ready to go. Clouds of mosquitoes for days and nights on end were no deterrent if there was a new plant, animal or rock formation to be examined.Not only did he crave knowledge, he wanted everyone to share in it. His Personal Narrative of the Equinoctial Regions of the New Continent (South America) was devoured by a public as eager to find out what had been found as we today would read the account of a person visiting another solar system. And, speaking of outer space, he took that subject on as well in his quest to tie everything together, writing the multi-volume Cosmos as he neared the end of his life.As Andrea Wulf makes clear in her title, The Invention of Nature, Humboldt was one of the first to come up with the concept of ecosystems, the interconnection of the natural world that allow an environment to thrive if left alone, and change it even to the point of destruction when this or that part is altered. While few of us today know of Humboldt, we live in the conceptual world of nature he created.This book is a wonderful wide-ranging history that covers not only Humboldt's life, but contains brief overviews of the lives and work of Darwin, Thoreau, George Perkins Marsh, Ernst Haeckel and John Muir in relation to Humboldt. Filled with adventure and excitement, Wulf perfectly captures a man to which we are all indebted and one who would be delighted to meet any of us and relate his discoveries.Sad to say, none of his books are in the network of public libraries including the one in my own town."
249,038535066X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7175349-david,5,"Didn't finish before it was due back to the library, but I read enough to be dazzled by Humboldt. First, I must praise this author for writing this book, bringing this once famous and celebrated figure back to our attention. The title is apparently not as hyperbolic as it seems, as her subject really does seem to have given both the public and the scientific community the idea of nature as an interconnected whole. No summary I could offer will do justice to the book, so you will need to read it yourself. And if it is not the kind of book you would read, then at least go to a bookstore or the library and skim enough to get some idea of it, because it is worth knowing about. (Note: yes, this is who Humboldt county in California is named after, and the University in Berlin, and the current in the Pacific Ocean, and many other things besides.)Here's a guy who got Goethe all stirred up, who explored the Amazon and the Andes, loved to get close to an erupting volcano, inspired Simon Bolivar to rebel against Spain, admired the American Revolution but could not understand why his friend Thomas Jefferson did not free the slaves, got Thoreau interested in nature, etc., etc. Seems to have been gay (avant la lettre), as his attachments to other men seem to have been unusual enough to cause his family some concern. Certainly his companions stuck with him through thick and thin, at risk to their lives with some frequency. My favorite is the poor guy who survives fever in the Amazon, crawling along a precarious mountain trail in a howling snowstorm, a hurricane at sea, just for a few examples, only to be berated for not working hard enough to publish their discoveries when they finally get back to Paris. Our hero could wear you out, apparently, not that anyone seemed to mind. And he was enough of a superstar that the King of Prussia kept him at court later in life even though it was no secret that he didn't believe in Monarchy and would support any revolution that might overthrow his patron. Think about that: he didn't worry about pleasing the King, the King worried about keeping him around.The book may seem too thorough to some readers (e.g., me), but when you think about the many volumes written by Humboldt, it's easy to see that she must have felt like this was the short version of the story. So worth checking out! "
250,038535066X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/180643-jim-coughenour,3,"A fine (re)introduction to Humboldt and his prescient ecological view of nature: that everything is connected and that humanity is capable of destroying the world it's been given. Humboldt appears as a brilliant, even heroic, transitional figure between the Enlightenment and the Romantic movement, between the positivism of science and the inwardness of art, between Goethe and Darwin. Wulf is also good at demonstrating his influence on other naturalists, not only Darwin but Thoreau, George Perkins Marsh (new to me), Ernst Haeckel and John Muir.Because I'd just finished reading On the Move: A Life, I couldn't help being reminded of Oliver Sacks, who also stood outside his own profession of neurology to capture the human and artistic dimension of knowledge, creating a new kind of scientific literature in the process. I was also intrigued to find out that Humboldt never married. He claimed his passion was only for science, but he was rarely without the company of another charismatic young man. His equally famous brother, Willem, ""disliked his brother's intense friendships – probably a mixture of jealousy and a concern for what might have seemed the inappropriate nature of these connections."" And finally, to my private embarrassment, I realized I've confused Alexander and Willem my whole life. (Humboldt University in Berlin is named after both of them.)The dark irony is that, although Humboldt was revered his warnings about how humanity was destroying its own environment were largely ignored. What should be obvious to everyone is still the stuff of partisan politics, and the grim conviction deepens that nothing will be done until it is too late, that it is in fact too late already."
251,038535066X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5871422-elena,5,"Andrea Wulf paints an appealing picture of the brilliant Alexander von Humboldt, an Enlightenment titan who climbed the highest mountains he could find with heavy instruments to make precise measurements, not just air pressure, but he had some kind of cyanograph to measure just how blue the sky was at different altitudes. He discussed science with Thomas Jefferson, whom he admired on one level, but AvH was firmly opposed to any form of slavery. He admired the indigenous peoples he met while exploring South America, and reported on the magnificent ruins of ancient American civilizations and the complex languages of the peoples he encountered in the colorful jungles, which he much perfered to his native Berlin. He deplored the degradation of the New World ecology by the mining and cash crops of the Spanish. Wulf did extensive research on his influence on Darwin and the theory of evolution which he anticipated with studies of fossils, on Goethe who put a bit of him into Faust, on Simon Bolivar who discussed concepts of political freedom with him, on Henry David Thoreau who's love of nature was nurtured by reading AvH's books on the interconnected-ness of nature, and on John Muir who read and annotated his books. Wulf found direct connections to show how his love of nature even inspired the Art Deco movement. His fame was universal, his name attached to currents, mountains, counties, cities all across the US and Latin America. It was the anti-German sentiments of World War I, intensified in World War II that cause his fame to be mostly extinguished along with admiration for German science and culture in general. Time to appreciate the man who pushed through legislation in Prussia that any slave, including any American slave, who lands on Prussian soil becomes a free person. "
252,038535066X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6432978-bfisher,4,"Alexander von Humboldt was one of the most prominent scientists of the nineteenth century. When he died in 1859, tens of thousands of mourners marched in his funeral procession. A staggering number of geographical features were named after him in his lifetime. It seems appropriate that the namesake Humboldt River, one of the largest rivers in the Great Basin of North America, disappears from sight in the Humboldt Sinks, much as Humboldt’s reputation has disappeared from modern popular memory.Yet, it is not fitting that Humboldt should be forgotten to our age. Andrea Wulf describes his roles as a founder of biogeography, inventor of isotherms, developer of the concept of ecological systems and the interdependence of life, and as the first scientist to recognize the danger of anthropogenic climate change. He influenced Darwin, Thoreau and John Muir. We recognize and adopt his ideas but have forgotten the person. This book is a useful recovery of the core importance to science and society of Humboldt's work. Unfortunately, in its coverage of Humboldt the scientist, Humboldt the person gets short shrift, aside from a few brief hints. That is my one quibble with this book."
253,038535066X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7283807-ben,1,"Desperately in need of an editor. Perhaps the author could not find enough source material on Humboldt himself. The majority of the book consists of capsule biographies and Wikipedia-level explanations of other people, such as Darwin or Muir. The author bombastically credits everything good to Humboldt. A typical phrasing, repeated dozens if not hundreds of times, goes like, ""Humboldt generously shared his library with X, and despite his own debts supported X financially. X praised Humboldt as 'one of the greatest scientists of his generation.'"" There is very little insight added to the material. The author does not bring any skepticism to the table, and is entirely credulous when it comes to Humboldt. Unfortunately, this means that you can't trust what few conclusions are drawn. I only finished it because I had an audiobook. Not worth reading. "

257,038535066X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/96806543-the-colonial,3,"Alexander von Humboldt’s name can be seen throughout the world’s streets, trails, universities, and rivers, yet the man and his mystique are rarely brought to our actual attention. By the early-nineteenth century, Humboldt had become what today we would call both an Environmentalist and Renaissance Man—as he was a scientist, explorer, naturalist, botanist, and colleague of renowned and like-minded intellectuals of the age. Andrea Wulf weaves all of these traits together in order to discuss Humboldt’s life journey and the groundbreaking ideas that he introduced our world to—some far too ahead of the times for the likes of his contemporaries.The first half of the book appropriately covers Humboldt’s beginnings, from his boyhood and ancestry in Prussia, to his rise in education and esteem in the scientific world. Wulf devotes much attention to Humboldt’s standing in the political world as a whole, where the botanist is doted upon by courtly officials and diplomats from such prosperous world powers as Russia, Great Britain, Spain, and the United States. He is honored by the prestigious Royal Society of London as a foreign member, and throughout his remarkable life he meets the likes of such prominent figures as Joseph Banks, Benjamin Smith Barton, Thomas Jefferson, Benjamin Rush, and a young and upcoming Charles Darwin.Unfortunately, Wulf’s enthusiasm for her subject is too broad in its approach, as she pivots into the second half of the book by focusing on the great men that were influenced by Humboldt—all of which include famous scientists, authors, environmentalists, and inventors. This is collectively balanced out by her engaging and imaginative prose, where she fortunately excels at using her fascination with Humboldt as well as that of nature itself for her inspiration. Wulf majestically explains each and every tour and journey that Humboldt embarked upon, as well as the meetings he held with prominent men of his times:…Humboldt informed Jefferson, where he had collected plants, made astronomical observations, found hieroglyphs of ancient civilizations deep in the rainforest and had amassed important data from the colonial archives of Mexico City. Humboldt also wrote to James Madison, the Secretary of State and Jefferson’s closest political ally, declaring that ‘having witnessed the great spectacle of the majestic Andes and the grandeur of the physical world I intended to enjoy the spectacle of a free people.’ Politics and nature belonged together–an idea that Humboldt would be discussing with the Americans.With almost the final half of the book being dedicated to Thoreau, Darwin, George Perkins Marsh, John Muir, and Ernst Haeckel, the reader unfortunately loses interest on the main subject of Humboldt’s adventurous life—leaving a sense of unfulfillment. It’s apparent that Wulf has so much more to tell on Alexander von Humboldt’s life, which is almost frustrating since the reader is constantly engrossed and intrigued in his story, due to the benefit of her writing style and equal fascination. Apart from the unnecessary segue into like-minded men, there is still much to be gained by the modern reader from reading Wulf’s work on an environmental pioneer and enlightened man of many qualifications and achievements. Maps are provided, a useful “Note on Humboldt’s Publications”, as well as helpful illustrations found throughout the text.

258,038535066X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3007401-biblio-files-takingadayoff,5,"Apparently, in much of Europe, Alexander von Humboldt is as well known as Charles Darwin is to those of us in the United States and Britain. A naturalist and explorer, Humboldt took his upper class education in 18th century Prussia and applied it to becoming a Renaissance man in 19th century Europe and America. Humboldt was especially interested in plant life, but he was an extremely energetic and focused person who also enjoyed studying all forms of life on earth, as well as philosophy, literature and poetry, astronomy, and languages. He loved participating in the frequent salons of the time and became friends with Goethe, and later with Simon Bolivar in his pre-revolutionary days traveling in Europe. He reached out to Thomas Jefferson as a fellow scientist (Jefferson was not only a gentleman farmer, but a scientific farmer as well) and procured an invitation to stay at the President's mansion while he visited Washington, D.C. Later, in Paris, he tried to play diplomat with Napoleon, but was not successful. Still, Napoleon was said to be impressed with his scientific works and to have read Humboldt's books.Humboldt's claim to fame as a scientist is to have been one of the first to see plant life, animal life, the cosmos, geology, everything, as a part of a single ecosystem, rather than as individual and not necessarily connected pieces. This is so basic to our way of thinking today that it seems obvious and not particularly remarkable. But it is as fundamentally different a way of looking at the world as Darwin's idea of natural selection was. Andrea Wulf's biography describes Humboldt's studies, travels, accomplishments -- you feel as if Humboldt would be quite an engaging, if hard to keep up with, fellow. After reading The Invention of Nature, the question that still nagged at me was how I had never learned of this whirlwind before. "
259,038535066X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/241691-kay,4,"“Temperament is destiny,” or so the proverb says, though I have always been suspicious of such broad sweeps of rhetoric. Still, this saying kept echoing through my head as I read this book, for I could not help but wonder: “What makes such a man as Alexander von Humboldt? What motivates him, drives him forward, helps him overcome obstacles, or, perhaps even ultimately, is his very undoing?” It seemed as I read of Humboldt’s life, passions, and seemingly boundless energy, that he must have sprung, almost Athena-like, from his mother’s womb, set from the get-go on a trajectory that would send him around the world in an unceasing round of exploration, research, and writing. Certainly, the advantages of his upbringing and background helped: a stable home, wealth, attentive (if distant) parents, exacting tutors, a library at his disposal. Yet there are other men and women that I can think of, such as the naturalist Alfred Russel Wallace or the explorer Mary Kingsley who had few such advantages, but, like Humboldt, possessed an urge for going, a forward momentum, an insatiable curiosity, and above all, seemingly boundless resources of optimism, courage, and self-reliance. They were, I can’t help but feel, the chosen few, blessed with a rare combination of temperament, intelligence, and energy. It is a magic formula – and, oh, if only I possessed it! The title of this book could well have been “Why Humboldt Matters,” and it’s scarcely a spoiler to reveal that he matters very much, and indeed is perhaps more relevant than ever. Although Humboldt is little thought about or even known about today, in his time he was the most famous scientist in the world - and that was before the term ""scientist"" even existed. It was Humboldt's accounts of his travels in South America and Russia that most captured the public's attention, but among Enlightenment-era and 19th century intellectual circles, his reputation as the authority on a wide range of scientific matters was unquestioned. His vision of nature as an integrated, interconnected and interdependent force, one, furthermore, indifferent to and even damaged by man is what most influenced thinkers of his time, and it is this complex and far-sighted vision which resonates today, perhaps now more than ever in the face of impending environmental threats.Wulf's explanation of why Humboldt fell into relative obscurity during the 20th century, particularly in the U.S.A., wasn't entirely convincing. She cites anti-German sentiment in the wake of the First World War, the fragmentation of science into specialized fields, and the fact that ""Humboldt is not known for a single fact or a discovery but for his worldview. His vision of nature has passed into our consciousness as if by osmosis."" But I think another reason lies within the pages of Wulf's book: Humboldt was the original ""torch bearer,"" but that torch has been taken up by many, some of whom Wulf devotes chapters to, such as Charles Darwin and John Muir. These figures, rather than Humboldt, occupy a larger place in the current public imagination. However, in contemplating Humboldt's scientific eclipse, once again I fell to musing about our fickleness in choosing heroes. Charles Darwin, hero (or blasphemer, depending on your perspective) is universally known if perhaps less than universally understood. (Hence the “blasphemer” part, one could argue.) His less-well-heeled contemporary, Alfred Russel Wallace, simultaneous and independent formulator of the theory of natural selection, while more recently enjoying a bit of an upswing, is still a relative unknown. (And can you guess which of the two is a personal hero? Corr-rect! Wallace it is!) Alfred Einstein, virtually a pop star in the scientific firmament, is but one very bright star in a constellation of equally impressive luminaries – Niels Bohr, Max Planck, Ernest Rutherford, Paul Dirac, James Clerk Maxwell – but it is Einstein who inhabits the popular imagination as the preeminent scientist of all time. (Though many will, of course, at least have a hazy idea, as I do, that Schrödinger and a cat also come into play somewhere.) Yet, after living for years with a physicist, I can confidently state that this much is true: No genius exists in splendid isolation. Each is perched on the shoulders of genii who preceded him. Or her. And so it unquestionably was with Humboldt, whose influences included Johann Wolfgang von Goethe, Captain Cook, Joseph Banks, Immanuel Kant, and indeed the very temper of the Age of Enlightenment. Yet Wulf’s biography focuses primarily on how Humboldt influenced his contemporaries and subsequent generations.  The most prominent of Humboldt’s followers (and that’s not too strong a term, really), was Darwin, who arguably would never have made that voyage on  The Beagle had he not been inspired by Humboldt’s account of his South American travels. Wulf devotes a chapter each to Darwin and four others who fell under Humboldt’s spell: Henry David Thoreau, George Perkins Marsh, Ernst Haeckel, and John Muir. Some of these Humboldtiphiles (Darwin, Thoreau, Muir), I knew something about, though admittedly it seems I knew less about Thoreau than I had thought, while of the remaining two, Marsh and Haeckel, I knew nothing. The chapter on Haeckel I particularly enjoyed, for I have a longstanding interest in Art Nouveau and its various architectural offshoots, and I immediately perceived how Haeckel’s wonderful fusion of art and science became the wellspring for many artists in the new (20th) century. Look at Gaudi’s Casa Batlló and then look at Haeckel’s illustrations of radiolarians (microscopic sea creatures) and the similarities are almost breathtaking. Why, that famous unfinished cathedral in Barcelona is but a radiolarian writ large!In short, I came away not just with a very good idea of Humboldt’s life after reading The Invention of Nature, but also was treated to five succinct mini-biographies of his most influential acolytes. Looking over that group provides a good sense of how all-encompassing Humboldt’s polymath grasp was: he influenced natural scientists, philosopher poets, conservationists, preservationists, earth scientists, artists, and even politicians and kings. Oh, and to add a bit more to this grandiose mix, Humboldt’s friends and contemporaries included the likes of Thomas Jefferson, Simon Bolivar, Joseph Hooker, and practically the entire scientific and intellectual elite of his age, with whom he maintained a voluminous correspondence.But again….that energy! Reading of Humboldt’s travels, experiments, indefatigable correspondence, and the breadth of his expertise practically made my head spin. Wulf makes the point – repeatedly – that perhaps Humboldt’s most singular legacy was his ability to synthesize information from areas which, today, are broken into discrete fields, such as climatology, volcanology, botany, biology, geology, meteorology, seismology, and paleontology, just to name a few. Those fields were all given a hearty kick-start by Humboldt’s grand synthesis, his Cosmos. It is this great overarching view of nature that inspired those that followed. Reading (but, admittedly, not entirely comprehending) how Humboldt achieved this was inspirational. A couple of final notes: firstly, the illustrations in the book were a delight. May I confess how much I enjoy well-selected (and nicely rendered) illustrations? I sometimes feel a little jolt of pleasure whenever I turn the page to find one. The chapter on Haeckel, for example, cried out for some of his radiolarian drawings. And there they were! Along with some equally fetching Medusae. Another not entirely unexpected joy was Wulf’s style. She has one! That is to say, I got a sense of 
her
 from reading this book, but she never intruded upon the subject, which always remained in focus. While it’s clear that Wulf must have loved researching and writing about Humboldt, she judiciously organized the material and trimmed her narrative, then wrote it in a lively yet elegant style that made me think, on the whole, that I would rather enjoy meeting this author. At any rate, I certainly want to read more of her work. "

261,038535066X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/18695911-daniel-chaikin,4,"It was interesting this evening, as I was driving home and listening to Michael Pollan read his latest book, to hear him refer to this book as if it were a major inspiration for him. Humboldt's view of nature as one entire interconnected thing. It is a beautiful concept, one he made at length and, as Wulf shows, elegantly and poetically. Darwin, who eventually met Humboldt, found Humboldt's writing inspirational for his scientific view of nature. Henry Thoreau devoured his writing, and found inspiration of his poetic view of the nature around his small pond. And John Muir, so enraptured he set off for Cuba and South America until he learned the tropical climates made him ill, found in Humboldt an inspiration for the environmental movement. And, I should mention, Simon Bolivar not only found in Humboldt a South American natural identity he raved about, but also used Humboldt's maps in his military campaigns. Wulf follows all these threads and more, in great detail. She rushes headlong through narratives, making them something of a roller coaster ride, and she spends time at the end wondering why the contemporary English speaking world has practically forgotten who Humboldt was or why anyone cares. What did he accomplish anyway, other than create some of the first detailed maps in a few hard to reach parts of South America? He was, it seems, primarily and powerfully, an inspiration. OK, he also invented the idea of nature. Well, maybe. I mean, Wulf makes the claim, over and over again, but it's a claim that reveals a major weakness in the book that bothered me a lot. She presents, ultimately, a very narrow in focus. So, yes, no question, Humboldt has a thought-provoking unified view on nature. But, was he the first? What was the intellectual world around him thinking, and what were the foundations? Is it possible nature as a unified thing was brought up before? Ever? by anyone? Wulf doesn't do context well, or didn't here. Really, mainly what she does is report stories in lengthy but also abbreviated forms. I liked her book and I really liked learning about Humbolt. It's not a perfect work, but it's not like the early 19th century intellectual world is an easy one to capture. So, flawed but still recommended, and who knows, you might be blown away like Michael Pollan.-----------------------------------------------60.

262,038535066X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/67736000-elizabeth-a-g,5,"Andrea Wulf's The Invention of Nature: Alexander von Humboldt's New World is an enjoyable, well-written and researched exploration of one man's vision of the world around him and how his restless spirit and determination gave us a deep appreciation of nature and presented the idea connectedness of all things organic and inorganic. Alexander von Humboldt is little remembered today and this book sheds a light on the scientist, ecologist. educator, and humanist who influenced later, better known naturalists like Darwin, Thoreau, George Perkins Marsh, Ernst Haeckel, and John Muir. Humboldt believed in the power of education and his writings and books were aimed toward a general audience rather than to specifically the scientific community. In fact he sought to show how nature is a living organism and that there is unity in scientific thought and the emotional response to nature that is expressed in poetry, art and music. He is also one of the first to warn that the activities of man in his commercial pursuits are bringing about the destruction of forests and creating climate change. In this book Wulf describes Humboldt's influence on future environmentalists and goes into some detail on these others...my only issue that perhaps the author could have shortened this section of the book by more of a summarization rather such detail (the subjects for a future book, perhaps). The epilogue of the book is excellent."

About half the book is padded with simplistic one chapter biopics of people purported to have been strongly influenced by Humboldt, often to an extent that is hard to credit. So according to Wulf: Goethe modelled Faust on Humboldt; Darwin would not have travelled on the Beagle and eventually developed evolutionary theory; John Muir wouldn't have become a environmentalist and saved the redwoods; Heckel wouldn't have created art that directly lead to Art Nouveau; and Bolívar wouldn't have become a revolutionary leading to the decolonization of Spain in Latin America. Wulf also repeatedly credits him with discovering climate change, centuries before it came to conscious awareness here, despite no evidence that this is true. Near the end of the book, she credits his current day obscurity (which is not really true) from a reaction against all things German after the 2nd World War, but if this was really correct, why are so many other German scientists and writers remembered and him not? Perhaps it is more to do with him never creating a lasting advance in knowledge via synthesis (a la Darwin).A great opportunity that is wasted by lack of in depth research and a critical appraisal of Humboldt's life.2-stars."
264,038535066X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/76176316-alistair-mackay,4,"The most famous man you’ve never heard of. Alexander Von Humboldt was a superstar explorer, botanist, geologist, naturalist. He inspired Charles Darwin and Henry David Thoreau. He was friends with Simon Bolivar. He invented the thermal lines on maps and came up with the idea of ecosystems and climate zones. He was a scientist before that was a word, and a naturalist before all the different disciplines of nature split into their factions. He believed nature needed to be understood with facts and poetry, felt as well as experienced. And he predicted climate change and deforestation... in the 1790s. I don’t usually enjoy biographies but I loved this book. It’s well-researched and well written. It’s a fascinating look at the adventures and contributions of a truly great man, and the grandfather of the environmental movement. He was the most famous man in the world at one point, and he’s been lost to history only because of 20th Century anti-German sentiment. Glad I read this and learnt about Humboldt. We owe him so much.

I will boldly say this book is my favorite book of 2015 and I plan on recommending it to everyone I know. Part of the delight is that I had no knowledge of Humboldt before reading this book and I was amazed to learn how influential and inspiring he was to people in the 18th and 19th centuries. With direct links to American founding fathers, the Romantic Literature movement, and Simon Bolivar's fight for independence in South America, and Charles Darwin Humboldt is seed that many modern ideas are sprung from. Although I read a library copy of this book I promptly went out and bought my own personal copy because it's a book I will treasure for years to come."

This is more than a biography of Humboldt (one of the most interesting scientists and explorers of all time)- it's a dedication to his legacy and an exploration of how his findings and philosophies eventually influenced everything from Art Nouveau to Walden to John Muir. Wide and diverse in breadth and scope, this reminds me of one of my favorite books- The Age of Wonder. "

270,038535066X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3409532-april-does-feral-sometimes,4,"The book 'The Invention of Nature' is fascinating. It is more than a biography of Alexander Von Humboldt (1769-1859), who can be described as a polymath genius whose enthusiasm for travel and nature was as momentous for the development of as many branches of science that Albert Einstein (1879-1955) was because of his interest in physics. Yet, I have never heard of him until I read this book.Some early Western 19th-century proto-scientists labored all of their life in bleak obscurity until only after their deaths being recognized as major scientific brains and discoverers; others announced their work to newly created scientific societies only to be met with withering scorn. Some inventors were clearly crackpots with one great idea while others were intelligent driven members of respectable aristocrat families and upper-class merchants. (Almost all of these Great Men of Science upset their parents by refusing to study law or medicine in university! Humboldt was one of these children of disappointed parents. I have read a few other science histories, and I have noticed that almost all of these early scientists had parents hoping for a son who would become a doctor or lawyer. Just saying.)However, Humboldt became famous early in his lifetime and all doors were open to him. He met already famous people eager to speak with him, such as President Thomas Jefferson. Others who desired to call him friend went on to illustrious (and nefarious) careers as famous scientists in their own right such as Charles Darwin, well-known writers such as Henry David Thoreau, and Kings, Emperors and Prime Ministers such as Friedrich Wilhelm IV and George Canning, as well as leaders of political revolutions overthrowing those before-mentioned Kings and Emperors such as Simón Bolívar. Humboldt himself was a liberal and he supported the overthrow of the aristocracy, but his income primarily was from a pension paid by two Prussian kings after he went through his own inheritance. He obviously was charismatic, moving easily between many different cultures and social classes, from South America to Europe to Russia.After returning from a five-year exploration of South America with tens of thousands of astronomical, geological and meteorological observations and specimens, he published his first book, 'Essay on the Geography of Plants' at age 32, dedicating it to Johann Wolfgang Goethe, his fellow polymath and best friend (after his brother Wilhelm von Humboldt, who founded the University of Berlin after a career as the Prussian ambassador to Vienna and Britain). The book combined with his achievements and personality made him a famous man, perhaps the most famous respected natural scientist in the world. However, full of energy, wanderlust and curiosity, Humboldt moved on to more explorations crossing over the frontlines of many European wars between France, Prussia, Britain, and Spain, and maneuvering through countries on three continents which were undergoing political revolutions, observing volcano eruptions while mountain climbing without oxygen tanks (yes, he and his companions fainted occasionally) enduring nasty mosquitos, while exposing and warning the public of the dreadful environmental destruction of earth wherever men used the land for agriculture, mining and lumber.Humboldt lived to the age of 89, still receiving famous visitors and writing thousands of letters a month up to his death. His books on the natural sciences, illustrated with his own and other explorers' beautiful art and drawings, inspired Darwin, Thoreau, Ernst Haeckel, John Muir, to name a few. Rivers, mountains, towns and other landmarks were named after him, and he is mentioned in thousands of famous novels. Yet most Americans today have never heard of him, probably because of World War I and WWII having been fought against Germany as an enemy of the United States. I think we should bring this man back into the spotlight and make him a famous hero scientist again. This book is an excellent start.Below I've included some Wikipedia links about the early naturalists, Humboldt, and many of the famous intellectuals, writers and scientists he inspired in later centuries, in hope that these thumbnail histories will convince you, gentle reader, to pick up this book:http://www.ranker.com/list/notable-na...https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alexa...https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kosmo...https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Georg...https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Man_a...https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ernst...https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kunst...https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_..."

HOLY MOLY! WOW! What an awesome book! Just reading it made me happy to be alive! Really! It was a wonderful break from the dreary procession of bad news parading out of every media orifice! (Note to self: improve your imagery.) I neglected other self-improving projects to read this book, and then was sad when I finished it! Worthy of all awards and accolades! The world would be a better place if everyone was forced to read it, at gunpoint if necessary! Don't just stand (or sit) there, go out and get a copy right away!I love narratives about news events, scandals, and personalities that once famous, but now forgotten. This is one of them, of a man known by everyone when living, celebrated, called without irony the greatest man who had ever lived, sought out by tedious rich people and aristocrats, pestered for autographs, and recipient of mountains of admiring old-school paper letters. Intrepid and death-defying explorer, partisan of liberty, deplorer of slavery and cruelty, widely-admired prose stylist, polyglot, polymath. Honored by having towns, counties, and other jurisdictions named after him. Further honored by having a Pacific Ocean current named after him and, even cooler still, also a critter described by Wikipedia as a ""large predatory squid"". His books were anticipated with an enthusiasm which today, sadly, only occurs with certain entries in the ""Young Adult"" market. Pirated translations of his works were rushed to market to satisfy bottomless demand. He was even -- dare I say it? -- the Werner Herzog of his age (ok, yes, Humboldt was Prussian and Herzog Bavarian, but let's not nitpick). As young men, both were driven by some inner demon to seek out the most pestilential, soggy, disease-ridden, and predator-filled sections of inner South America, and came back to ""civilization"", such as it is, with precious insights and striking images, which changed the way people looked at the world. When older, both continued to push into far corners of the world (including, in both cases, Siberia) at a time of life when most of us find it increasingly difficult to get out of bed.Humboldt actually had a life that was both exciting and well-documented, so writing about him was a little like shooting fish in barrel. I don't wish to belittle the author's achievement: the narrative always moves along at an entertaining clip, even during those periods when Humboldt had to spend some time toadying up to various Kaisers in order to keep the old mazuma rolling in. I also enjoyed the last few chapters, which switched tone from standard biography of one man to mini chapter-long biographies of various men (including Simon Bolivar, Charles Darwin, Henry David Thoreau, and John Muir), with a concentration on how Humboldt changed the lives and directions of their thoughts. The point, I believe, was that, even though his name is no longer on everybody's lips, Humboldt is still very much with us.To repeat: delightful. Read it.The only thing that I didn't like about this book was the realization at the conclusion that, no matter what achievements I, uh, achieve with the balance of my life, I will never, ever, have a large predatory squid named after me.

272,038535066X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6938150-marie-paule,5,"When in Berlin a few years ago, I came by the magnificent building of the Humboldt University. And I know that quite a few plants are named '... humboldtiensis'. Although I have a PhD in Science I knew nothing more about Alexander von Humboldt. What a shame. On Sep 14, 1869, the 100th birthday of this brilliant man, there were celebrations all over the world: Europe, Africa, Australia and the America's. More than 100 years later, he seems to be forgotten. What a life he has led. In his younger years, he became a lifetime friend of Goethe, who, besides being a poet, was very interested in botanics and geology. They were both interested in the dualism between the external and internal world (Kant and his 'Kritik der reinen Vernunft'). Is the tree in my garden a real tree, or my idea of a tree? Humboldt gradually shifted from pure empirical research towards his own interpretation of nature: he mixed detailed scientific facts with the emotional reactions they invoked. He thought a great deal about 'Life'. A machine can be taken apart and reassembled, but you can't do this with an animal. Why? Von Humboldt’s most important journey was a 5 year-trip through South America. There, he developed the first concept of 'ecosystems' (long before we knew this particular word), explaining that geology, climate, micro-organisms, plants and animals all influence each other. When he travelled through the plains of Los llanos in Venezuela in 1800 (!), he warned for the destructive effects of human activity (large scale agriculture of commercial crops, mining, ...) on the ecosystems. At the same time, he pointed out that the overexploitation of local ecosystems had disastrous effects on the human population as well: slavery, unhealthy working conditions, a shortage of local healthy foods, exploitation of large groups of have-nots by the happy few….. Sounds familiar, no?Does it surprise you that Alexander von Humboldt became one of the best liftetime friends of Simon Bolivar, who fought to liberate South America from its Spanish colonists? All through his live, von Humboldt fought against slavery. He so longed to visit India, but the British government denied him a passport, because they knew how he felt about slavery and he was not willing to compromise…. For the British, he remained a dangerous anti-colonialist actor. Later in life, he made a great journey through Russia, all the way to Mongolia. He held his 60th birthday party in … the pharmacy of Lenin’s grandfather. After his return from South America, von Humboldt lived in Paris and in London, where he met the famous scientists of his time. He inspired a lot of scientists and writers of his time, among others Charles Darwin, Henry David Thoreau, George Perkin Marsh, Ernst Haeckel and John Muir. Indeed, what a life and what a talent… At the end of his life, von Humboldt wrote his magnum opus ‘Kosmos’: an overview of his own and other scientific findings, but above all, his opinion about the correlations and relationships between different scientific theories, and the interrelation between science, art and sociology. For von Humboldt, there were no boundaries between scientific domains or between science and humanities. In short: von Humboldt was a scientist who was far ahead of his time and who remains a lighting example for us all."

274,038535066X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4070288-jo,4,The first 2/3 of this book are 5 star material. Wulf vividly depicts Humboldt's travels and his personality. He is a fascinating subject. The last sections really suffers in comparison. Her choice of figures to investigate his legacy through their biography is both too focused and too limited to be truly effective. While I understand her desire to dive deep into Humboldt's influence shoehorning in 5 mini bios of other figures into the end of the book moves the book away from its true center. Leaving Humboldt behind made me want to throw myself on the ground in the middle of the town square and yell about things breaking per my hero AvH.
275,038535066X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4739424-mal-warwick,5,"He was the most famous man in the world, and more places around the world are named after him than anyone else. To many of the giants of his time — Johann Wolfgang von Goethe, Thomas Jefferson, Simon Bolivar, Charles Darwin, Henry David Thoreau — he was a colossus whose genius overshadowed their own. He was the first to describe the web of life on Earth, foreshadowing James Lovelock’s Gaia hypothesis, and the first to describe the impact of human activity on the world’s climate. His books, which read like poetry, “were so popular that people bribed booksellers to be the first to receive copies.” Eleven years after his death at age 89, the centennial of his birth was observed by hundreds of thousands of people in huge celebrations around the world.Chances are, you’ve never heard of him.His name was Alexander von Humboldt, and he died in 1859. He had first described climate change in 1800. He “gave us his concept of nature itself.”Andrea Wulf’s engrossing new biography, The Invention of Nature, brings this extraordinary man into the spotlight again after a century and a half. It’s about time. His may well have been one of the finest minds in human history.Humboldt, born into a prosperous family of Prussian aristocrats shortly after the American Civil War, rebelled against the constraints on his life and set out on his own unique path. Though he became best known as a naturalist, world traveler, and author, his interests reached into a far wider range of human endeavor, and Cosmos, the multi-volume book he began to write at the age of sixty-five, encompassed virtually the whole of human knowledge, from botany, geology, and zoology to astronomy, philosophy, and, in effect, the new science he invented: ecology. (Though he didn’t invent that term, his work was the inspiration for the man who did later in the nineteenth century.)As Wulf notes, “Humboldt took his readers from outer space to earth, and then from the surface of the planet into its inner core. He discussed comets, the Milky Way and the solar system as well as terrestrial magnetism, volcanoes and the snow line of mountains. He wrote about the migration of the human species, about plants and animals and the microscopic organisms that live in stagnant water or on the weathered surface of rocks.” Never before, and never since (to the best of my knowledge), has a single individual mastered so many fields of inquiry so successfully that his contemporaries regarded him as a force of nature. And, in an age when most of humanity lived in thrall to organized religion, Humboldt didn’t once mention God in all the many thousands of pages of his books. Instead, he spoke of a “wonderful web of organic life.”Wulf’s biography of this astonishing man is by no means unreservedly positive. She describes the shortcomings of his personality in embarrassing detail: his tendency to talk nonstop at a rapid rate for hours without permitting interruptions of any kind, regardless of the stature of his listeners; his seeming inability to understand the feelings of others and to show empathy for their pain; his venomous gossiping; and his inability to accept criticism. Alexander von Humboldt was not a nice man.Andrea Wulf is an historian and writer who lives in Britain. The Invention of Nature is her fifth book."
276,038535066X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/93114967-barbara,4,"I had some familiarity with von Humboldt before reading Andrea Wulf's book - intrepid young explorer of South America, well known in his time, ocean currents and rivers named for him, information source for Thomas Jefferson about Spanish colonial America. Obviously, an interesting guy, so when I saw an audio copy of The Invention of Nature: Alexander von Humboldt's New World on sale, I grabbed it. Turned out to be a good decision on my part. Von Humboldt was so much more than just that adventurous young man I'd heard of, and Wulf does an excellent job of filling out the picture and his impact.During that extended exploration of South America 200 years ago, while ranging through much of modern day Venezuela, Columbia, Ecuador and Peru, von Humboldt developed concepts of nature, climate and ecology that we take as ""new"" in the late 20th/early 21st centuries. He determined, for instance, that the drop in the level of Lake Valencia was tied to the destruction of the surrounding forest to clear land for farming. He made the connection that the absence of the trees dramatically reduced the ability of the land to retain water. While climbing Mt. Chimborazo in the Andes he developed the concept of altitude-based climate zones that are consistent around the globe. Comparing plants he found on the South American Atlantic coast with those growing on the African Atlantic coast, he intuited that the two land masses must once have been one.These were not simply casual observations for von Humboldt; after returning to Europe he spent the rest of his life as a scientist and author, successfully seeking out the data to support his theories. It's impossible here to summarize his many brilliant insights, but as one example, his perceptions of the devastating outcomes of human's impact on the natural world were prescient of the reality we experience today. Through his writings he influenced many key thinkers of the 19th century, including Darwin, Thoreau and Muir.In truth, I found the biographical information about those scientists and naturalists who built their own theories on his foundations to be more lengthy than necessary, and the latter part of the book dragged a bit for that reason. But overall, reading the story of von Humboldt, a polymath with the ability to pull together what he observed in multiple scientific fields to develop comprehensive theories, was time well spent. He deserves more recognition today."
277,038535066X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/35482263-gumble-s-yard,4,"Alexander Von Humboldt ... was one of the last polymaths, and died at a time when scientific disciplines were hardening into tightly fenced and more specialised fields. Consequently his more holistic approach - a scientific method that included art, history, poetry and politics alongside hard data - has fallen out of favour ..... One of [his] greatest achievements had been to make science accessible and popular ......... in a world where we draw a sharp line between the sciences and the arts, between he subjective and the objective, Humboldt's insight that we can only truly understand nature by using our imaginations makes him a visionaryAward winning biography of Alexander Von Humboldt, of who I was previously familiar from the fictional biography Measuring the World. Wulf ksets out to show that: he was a true polymath, perhaps the last to really range across all scientific disciplines; that at a time when science was becoming increasingly focused on classifications he remained able to see the big picture both across as well as within scientific disciplines; that at a time when romantic poets and data driven scientists were starting to grow in mutual incomprehension, his method of observing and describing nature in person and in capturing what he observed both in rigorous data and evocative descriptions, enabled him to be lionised by individuals on both sides of that divide; that in his pioneering work on the inter-connectedness of natural ecosystems and on the impact of human actions on those systems, he should be regarded as the founder of the environmental movement. She also is keen to emphasise his influence on others - starting with his almost lifelong friendship with and influence on the work of Goethe. Wulf writes chapters on each of Simon Bolivar, Charles Darwin and Henry Thoreau, cantering on their achievements but at all times seeking for the considerable impact Von Humboldt had on them. In perhaps the only slightly false note in the book, it finishes with more than fifty pages on his seemingly more tangential influence on three lesser known figures whose main achievements were after his death. Overall though this is a fascinating and well written account."
278,038535066X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1241339-clif,5,"Chicago's public radio station, WBEZ, had a program on the statue of Alexander Humboldt in the park named after him, in a neighborhood named after him. The program speculated that not one in a thousand passersby would know who he was. I've no doubt that's true. My only association of the name was with the Humboldt Current that brings cold water up the west coast of South America from Antarctica. With that as background, this book floored me.Humboldt was to the 19th century as Einstein was to the 20th. It's fair to say that everyone knew his name even decades after his death in 1859. He was a powerful influence on Charles Darwin, John Muir and Henry David Thoreau. On the seminal voyage aboard the Beagle that took Darwin around the world, his notes are peppered with ""as Humboldt said..."" whenever something was found that confirmed Humboldt's previous discoveries. Thoreau was a Humboldt devotee.During his lifetime, and he loved life, lectures given by Humboldt were packed, whether in America or Europe. His books were best sellers and he was personally acquainted with everyone who was anyone, from Napoleon (one of the few that didn't like Humboldt) through the royalty of Europe to Simón Bolívar, the liberator of South America, and on down from there. He was a font of knowledge on the natural world, was driven by curiosity and would even at an advanced age rush to attend the lectures of someone who knew something he did not, sitting in an audience of college students furiously taking notes as he listened.He had only one foible - he could not stop talking. Only the most determined could get in a comment, but few wished to do so as it would, but only possibly, interrupt the flow of knowledge they wanted to hear. Single his entire life with never any indication of an attraction to women, he bonded easily with men, forming lifelong friendships and exploring for months on end with a partner.His physical endurance and health were phenomenal. He climbed snow covered mountains with none of the equipment we know today, even above levels where oxygen should be used. As others would fall victim to tropical diseases, Humboldt was up at dawn ready to go. Clouds of mosquitoes for days and nights on end were no deterrent if there was a new plant, animal or rock formation to be examined.Not only did he crave knowledge, he wanted everyone to share in it. His Personal Narrative of the Equinoctial Regions of the New Continent (South America) was devoured by a public as eager to find out what had been found as we today would read the account of a person visiting another solar system. And, speaking of outer space, he took that subject on as well in his quest to tie everything together, writing the multi-volume Cosmos as he neared the end of his life.As Andrea Wulf makes clear in her title, The Invention of Nature, Humboldt was one of the first to come up with the concept of ecosystems, the interconnection of the natural world that allow an environment to thrive if left alone, and change it even to the point of destruction when this or that part is altered. While few of us today know of Humboldt, we live in the conceptual world of nature he created.This book is a wonderful wide-ranging history that covers not only Humboldt's life, but contains brief overviews of the lives and work of Darwin, Thoreau, George Perkins Marsh, Ernst Haeckel and John Muir in relation to Humboldt. Filled with adventure and excitement, Wulf perfectly captures a man to which we are all indebted and one who would be delighted to meet any of us and relate his discoveries.Sad to say, none of his books are in the network of public libraries including the one in my own town."
279,038535066X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7175349-david,5,"Didn't finish before it was due back to the library, but I read enough to be dazzled by Humboldt. First, I must praise this author for writing this book, bringing this once famous and celebrated figure back to our attention. The title is apparently not as hyperbolic as it seems, as her subject really does seem to have given both the public and the scientific community the idea of nature as an interconnected whole. No summary I could offer will do justice to the book, so you will need to read it yourself. And if it is not the kind of book you would read, then at least go to a bookstore or the library and skim enough to get some idea of it, because it is worth knowing about. (Note: yes, this is who Humboldt county in California is named after, and the University in Berlin, and the current in the Pacific Ocean, and many other things besides.)Here's a guy who got Goethe all stirred up, who explored the Amazon and the Andes, loved to get close to an erupting volcano, inspired Simon Bolivar to rebel against Spain, admired the American Revolution but could not understand why his friend Thomas Jefferson did not free the slaves, got Thoreau interested in nature, etc., etc. Seems to have been gay (avant la lettre), as his attachments to other men seem to have been unusual enough to cause his family some concern. Certainly his companions stuck with him through thick and thin, at risk to their lives with some frequency. My favorite is the poor guy who survives fever in the Amazon, crawling along a precarious mountain trail in a howling snowstorm, a hurricane at sea, just for a few examples, only to be berated for not working hard enough to publish their discoveries when they finally get back to Paris. Our hero could wear you out, apparently, not that anyone seemed to mind. And he was enough of a superstar that the King of Prussia kept him at court later in life even though it was no secret that he didn't believe in Monarchy and would support any revolution that might overthrow his patron. Think about that: he didn't worry about pleasing the King, the King worried about keeping him around.The book may seem too thorough to some readers (e.g., me), but when you think about the many volumes written by Humboldt, it's easy to see that she must have felt like this was the short version of the story. So worth checking out! "
280,038535066X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/180643-jim-coughenour,3,"A fine (re)introduction to Humboldt and his prescient ecological view of nature: that everything is connected and that humanity is capable of destroying the world it's been given. Humboldt appears as a brilliant, even heroic, transitional figure between the Enlightenment and the Romantic movement, between the positivism of science and the inwardness of art, between Goethe and Darwin. Wulf is also good at demonstrating his influence on other naturalists, not only Darwin but Thoreau, George Perkins Marsh (new to me), Ernst Haeckel and John Muir.Because I'd just finished reading On the Move: A Life, I couldn't help being reminded of Oliver Sacks, who also stood outside his own profession of neurology to capture the human and artistic dimension of knowledge, creating a new kind of scientific literature in the process. I was also intrigued to find out that Humboldt never married. He claimed his passion was only for science, but he was rarely without the company of another charismatic young man. His equally famous brother, Willem, ""disliked his brother's intense friendships – probably a mixture of jealousy and a concern for what might have seemed the inappropriate nature of these connections."" And finally, to my private embarrassment, I realized I've confused Alexander and Willem my whole life. (Humboldt University in Berlin is named after both of them.)The dark irony is that, although Humboldt was revered his warnings about how humanity was destroying its own environment were largely ignored. What should be obvious to everyone is still the stuff of partisan politics, and the grim conviction deepens that nothing will be done until it is too late, that it is in fact too late already."
281,038535066X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5871422-elena,5,"Andrea Wulf paints an appealing picture of the brilliant Alexander von Humboldt, an Enlightenment titan who climbed the highest mountains he could find with heavy instruments to make precise measurements, not just air pressure, but he had some kind of cyanograph to measure just how blue the sky was at different altitudes. He discussed science with Thomas Jefferson, whom he admired on one level, but AvH was firmly opposed to any form of slavery. He admired the indigenous peoples he met while exploring South America, and reported on the magnificent ruins of ancient American civilizations and the complex languages of the peoples he encountered in the colorful jungles, which he much perfered to his native Berlin. He deplored the degradation of the New World ecology by the mining and cash crops of the Spanish. Wulf did extensive research on his influence on Darwin and the theory of evolution which he anticipated with studies of fossils, on Goethe who put a bit of him into Faust, on Simon Bolivar who discussed concepts of political freedom with him, on Henry David Thoreau who's love of nature was nurtured by reading AvH's books on the interconnected-ness of nature, and on John Muir who read and annotated his books. Wulf found direct connections to show how his love of nature even inspired the Art Deco movement. His fame was universal, his name attached to currents, mountains, counties, cities all across the US and Latin America. It was the anti-German sentiments of World War I, intensified in World War II that cause his fame to be mostly extinguished along with admiration for German science and culture in general. Time to appreciate the man who pushed through legislation in Prussia that any slave, including any American slave, who lands on Prussian soil becomes a free person. "
282,038535066X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6432978-bfisher,4,"Alexander von Humboldt was one of the most prominent scientists of the nineteenth century. When he died in 1859, tens of thousands of mourners marched in his funeral procession. A staggering number of geographical features were named after him in his lifetime. It seems appropriate that the namesake Humboldt River, one of the largest rivers in the Great Basin of North America, disappears from sight in the Humboldt Sinks, much as Humboldt’s reputation has disappeared from modern popular memory.Yet, it is not fitting that Humboldt should be forgotten to our age. Andrea Wulf describes his roles as a founder of biogeography, inventor of isotherms, developer of the concept of ecological systems and the interdependence of life, and as the first scientist to recognize the danger of anthropogenic climate change. He influenced Darwin, Thoreau and John Muir. We recognize and adopt his ideas but have forgotten the person. This book is a useful recovery of the core importance to science and society of Humboldt's work. Unfortunately, in its coverage of Humboldt the scientist, Humboldt the person gets short shrift, aside from a few brief hints. That is my one quibble with this book."
283,038535066X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7283807-ben,1,"Desperately in need of an editor. Perhaps the author could not find enough source material on Humboldt himself. The majority of the book consists of capsule biographies and Wikipedia-level explanations of other people, such as Darwin or Muir. The author bombastically credits everything good to Humboldt. A typical phrasing, repeated dozens if not hundreds of times, goes like, ""Humboldt generously shared his library with X, and despite his own debts supported X financially. X praised Humboldt as 'one of the greatest scientists of his generation.'"" There is very little insight added to the material. The author does not bring any skepticism to the table, and is entirely credulous when it comes to Humboldt. Unfortunately, this means that you can't trust what few conclusions are drawn. I only finished it because I had an audiobook. Not worth reading. "
284,038535066X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/18845147-gill,4,"This is a well written, comprehensive account of the life of Alexander von Humboldt, and his influences and influence. I found it an interesting read, and the specialist sections clearly explained. I found the section on his links with Simon Bolívar especially interesting. Well done to Andrea Wulf for introducing a man who was so important in his own time to a present day audience."

Humboldt's legacy of scientific inquiry has style of writing has impacted generations of scientist, writers and readers all around the world. His numerous works and lectures are still revelant as the world faces a global environmental crossroads. I highly encourage readers to pick up this outstanding work."
287,038535066X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/96806543-the-colonial,3,"Alexander von Humboldt’s name can be seen throughout the world’s streets, trails, universities, and rivers, yet the man and his mystique are rarely brought to our actual attention. By the early-nineteenth century, Humboldt had become what today we would call both an Environmentalist and Renaissance Man—as he was a scientist, explorer, naturalist, botanist, and colleague of renowned and like-minded intellectuals of the age. Andrea Wulf weaves all of these traits together in order to discuss Humboldt’s life journey and the groundbreaking ideas that he introduced our world to—some far too ahead of the times for the likes of his contemporaries.The first half of the book appropriately covers Humboldt’s beginnings, from his boyhood and ancestry in Prussia, to his rise in education and esteem in the scientific world. Wulf devotes much attention to Humboldt’s standing in the political world as a whole, where the botanist is doted upon by courtly officials and diplomats from such prosperous world powers as Russia, Great Britain, Spain, and the United States. He is honored by the prestigious Royal Society of London as a foreign member, and throughout his remarkable life he meets the likes of such prominent figures as Joseph Banks, Benjamin Smith Barton, Thomas Jefferson, Benjamin Rush, and a young and upcoming Charles Darwin.Unfortunately, Wulf’s enthusiasm for her subject is too broad in its approach, as she pivots into the second half of the book by focusing on the great men that were influenced by Humboldt—all of which include famous scientists, authors, environmentalists, and inventors. This is collectively balanced out by her engaging and imaginative prose, where she fortunately excels at using her fascination with Humboldt as well as that of nature itself for her inspiration. Wulf majestically explains each and every tour and journey that Humboldt embarked upon, as well as the meetings he held with prominent men of his times:…Humboldt informed Jefferson, where he had collected plants, made astronomical observations, found hieroglyphs of ancient civilizations deep in the rainforest and had amassed important data from the colonial archives of Mexico City. Humboldt also wrote to James Madison, the Secretary of State and Jefferson’s closest political ally, declaring that ‘having witnessed the great spectacle of the majestic Andes and the grandeur of the physical world I intended to enjoy the spectacle of a free people.’ Politics and nature belonged together–an idea that Humboldt would be discussing with the Americans.With almost the final half of the book being dedicated to Thoreau, Darwin, George Perkins Marsh, John Muir, and Ernst Haeckel, the reader unfortunately loses interest on the main subject of Humboldt’s adventurous life—leaving a sense of unfulfillment. It’s apparent that Wulf has so much more to tell on Alexander von Humboldt’s life, which is almost frustrating since the reader is constantly engrossed and intrigued in his story, due to the benefit of her writing style and equal fascination. Apart from the unnecessary segue into like-minded men, there is still much to be gained by the modern reader from reading Wulf’s work on an environmental pioneer and enlightened man of many qualifications and achievements. Maps are provided, a useful “Note on Humboldt’s Publications”, as well as helpful illustrations found throughout the text.

288,038535066X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3007401-biblio-files-takingadayoff,5,"Apparently, in much of Europe, Alexander von Humboldt is as well known as Charles Darwin is to those of us in the United States and Britain. A naturalist and explorer, Humboldt took his upper class education in 18th century Prussia and applied it to becoming a Renaissance man in 19th century Europe and America. Humboldt was especially interested in plant life, but he was an extremely energetic and focused person who also enjoyed studying all forms of life on earth, as well as philosophy, literature and poetry, astronomy, and languages. He loved participating in the frequent salons of the time and became friends with Goethe, and later with Simon Bolivar in his pre-revolutionary days traveling in Europe. He reached out to Thomas Jefferson as a fellow scientist (Jefferson was not only a gentleman farmer, but a scientific farmer as well) and procured an invitation to stay at the President's mansion while he visited Washington, D.C. Later, in Paris, he tried to play diplomat with Napoleon, but was not successful. Still, Napoleon was said to be impressed with his scientific works and to have read Humboldt's books.Humboldt's claim to fame as a scientist is to have been one of the first to see plant life, animal life, the cosmos, geology, everything, as a part of a single ecosystem, rather than as individual and not necessarily connected pieces. This is so basic to our way of thinking today that it seems obvious and not particularly remarkable. But it is as fundamentally different a way of looking at the world as Darwin's idea of natural selection was. Andrea Wulf's biography describes Humboldt's studies, travels, accomplishments -- you feel as if Humboldt would be quite an engaging, if hard to keep up with, fellow. After reading The Invention of Nature, the question that still nagged at me was how I had never learned of this whirlwind before. "
289,038535066X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/241691-kay,4,"“Temperament is destiny,” or so the proverb says, though I have always been suspicious of such broad sweeps of rhetoric. Still, this saying kept echoing through my head as I read this book, for I could not help but wonder: “What makes such a man as Alexander von Humboldt? What motivates him, drives him forward, helps him overcome obstacles, or, perhaps even ultimately, is his very undoing?” It seemed as I read of Humboldt’s life, passions, and seemingly boundless energy, that he must have sprung, almost Athena-like, from his mother’s womb, set from the get-go on a trajectory that would send him around the world in an unceasing round of exploration, research, and writing. Certainly, the advantages of his upbringing and background helped: a stable home, wealth, attentive (if distant) parents, exacting tutors, a library at his disposal. Yet there are other men and women that I can think of, such as the naturalist Alfred Russel Wallace or the explorer Mary Kingsley who had few such advantages, but, like Humboldt, possessed an urge for going, a forward momentum, an insatiable curiosity, and above all, seemingly boundless resources of optimism, courage, and self-reliance. They were, I can’t help but feel, the chosen few, blessed with a rare combination of temperament, intelligence, and energy. It is a magic formula – and, oh, if only I possessed it! The title of this book could well have been “Why Humboldt Matters,” and it’s scarcely a spoiler to reveal that he matters very much, and indeed is perhaps more relevant than ever. Although Humboldt is little thought about or even known about today, in his time he was the most famous scientist in the world - and that was before the term ""scientist"" even existed. It was Humboldt's accounts of his travels in South America and Russia that most captured the public's attention, but among Enlightenment-era and 19th century intellectual circles, his reputation as the authority on a wide range of scientific matters was unquestioned. His vision of nature as an integrated, interconnected and interdependent force, one, furthermore, indifferent to and even damaged by man is what most influenced thinkers of his time, and it is this complex and far-sighted vision which resonates today, perhaps now more than ever in the face of impending environmental threats.Wulf's explanation of why Humboldt fell into relative obscurity during the 20th century, particularly in the U.S.A., wasn't entirely convincing. She cites anti-German sentiment in the wake of the First World War, the fragmentation of science into specialized fields, and the fact that ""Humboldt is not known for a single fact or a discovery but for his worldview. His vision of nature has passed into our consciousness as if by osmosis."" But I think another reason lies within the pages of Wulf's book: Humboldt was the original ""torch bearer,"" but that torch has been taken up by many, some of whom Wulf devotes chapters to, such as Charles Darwin and John Muir. These figures, rather than Humboldt, occupy a larger place in the current public imagination. However, in contemplating Humboldt's scientific eclipse, once again I fell to musing about our fickleness in choosing heroes. Charles Darwin, hero (or blasphemer, depending on your perspective) is universally known if perhaps less than universally understood. (Hence the “blasphemer” part, one could argue.) His less-well-heeled contemporary, Alfred Russel Wallace, simultaneous and independent formulator of the theory of natural selection, while more recently enjoying a bit of an upswing, is still a relative unknown. (And can you guess which of the two is a personal hero? Corr-rect! Wallace it is!) Alfred Einstein, virtually a pop star in the scientific firmament, is but one very bright star in a constellation of equally impressive luminaries – Niels Bohr, Max Planck, Ernest Rutherford, Paul Dirac, James Clerk Maxwell – but it is Einstein who inhabits the popular imagination as the preeminent scientist of all time. (Though many will, of course, at least have a hazy idea, as I do, that Schrödinger and a cat also come into play somewhere.) Yet, after living for years with a physicist, I can confidently state that this much is true: No genius exists in splendid isolation. Each is perched on the shoulders of genii who preceded him. Or her. And so it unquestionably was with Humboldt, whose influences included Johann Wolfgang von Goethe, Captain Cook, Joseph Banks, Immanuel Kant, and indeed the very temper of the Age of Enlightenment. Yet Wulf’s biography focuses primarily on how Humboldt influenced his contemporaries and subsequent generations.  The most prominent of Humboldt’s followers (and that’s not too strong a term, really), was Darwin, who arguably would never have made that voyage on  The Beagle had he not been inspired by Humboldt’s account of his South American travels. Wulf devotes a chapter each to Darwin and four others who fell under Humboldt’s spell: Henry David Thoreau, George Perkins Marsh, Ernst Haeckel, and John Muir. Some of these Humboldtiphiles (Darwin, Thoreau, Muir), I knew something about, though admittedly it seems I knew less about Thoreau than I had thought, while of the remaining two, Marsh and Haeckel, I knew nothing. The chapter on Haeckel I particularly enjoyed, for I have a longstanding interest in Art Nouveau and its various architectural offshoots, and I immediately perceived how Haeckel’s wonderful fusion of art and science became the wellspring for many artists in the new (20th) century. Look at Gaudi’s Casa Batlló and then look at Haeckel’s illustrations of radiolarians (microscopic sea creatures) and the similarities are almost breathtaking. Why, that famous unfinished cathedral in Barcelona is but a radiolarian writ large!In short, I came away not just with a very good idea of Humboldt’s life after reading The Invention of Nature, but also was treated to five succinct mini-biographies of his most influential acolytes. Looking over that group provides a good sense of how all-encompassing Humboldt’s polymath grasp was: he influenced natural scientists, philosopher poets, conservationists, preservationists, earth scientists, artists, and even politicians and kings. Oh, and to add a bit more to this grandiose mix, Humboldt’s friends and contemporaries included the likes of Thomas Jefferson, Simon Bolivar, Joseph Hooker, and practically the entire scientific and intellectual elite of his age, with whom he maintained a voluminous correspondence.But again….that energy! Reading of Humboldt’s travels, experiments, indefatigable correspondence, and the breadth of his expertise practically made my head spin. Wulf makes the point – repeatedly – that perhaps Humboldt’s most singular legacy was his ability to synthesize information from areas which, today, are broken into discrete fields, such as climatology, volcanology, botany, biology, geology, meteorology, seismology, and paleontology, just to name a few. Those fields were all given a hearty kick-start by Humboldt’s grand synthesis, his Cosmos. It is this great overarching view of nature that inspired those that followed. Reading (but, admittedly, not entirely comprehending) how Humboldt achieved this was inspirational. A couple of final notes: firstly, the illustrations in the book were a delight. May I confess how much I enjoy well-selected (and nicely rendered) illustrations? I sometimes feel a little jolt of pleasure whenever I turn the page to find one. The chapter on Haeckel, for example, cried out for some of his radiolarian drawings. And there they were! Along with some equally fetching Medusae. Another not entirely unexpected joy was Wulf’s style. She has one! That is to say, I got a sense of 
her
 from reading this book, but she never intruded upon the subject, which always remained in focus. While it’s clear that Wulf must have loved researching and writing about Humboldt, she judiciously organized the material and trimmed her narrative, then wrote it in a lively yet elegant style that made me think, on the whole, that I would rather enjoy meeting this author. At any rate, I certainly want to read more of her work. "

291,038535066X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/18695911-daniel-chaikin,4,"It was interesting this evening, as I was driving home and listening to Michael Pollan read his latest book, to hear him refer to this book as if it were a major inspiration for him. Humboldt's view of nature as one entire interconnected thing. It is a beautiful concept, one he made at length and, as Wulf shows, elegantly and poetically. Darwin, who eventually met Humboldt, found Humboldt's writing inspirational for his scientific view of nature. Henry Thoreau devoured his writing, and found inspiration of his poetic view of the nature around his small pond. And John Muir, so enraptured he set off for Cuba and South America until he learned the tropical climates made him ill, found in Humboldt an inspiration for the environmental movement. And, I should mention, Simon Bolivar not only found in Humboldt a South American natural identity he raved about, but also used Humboldt's maps in his military campaigns. Wulf follows all these threads and more, in great detail. She rushes headlong through narratives, making them something of a roller coaster ride, and she spends time at the end wondering why the contemporary English speaking world has practically forgotten who Humboldt was or why anyone cares. What did he accomplish anyway, other than create some of the first detailed maps in a few hard to reach parts of South America? He was, it seems, primarily and powerfully, an inspiration. OK, he also invented the idea of nature. Well, maybe. I mean, Wulf makes the claim, over and over again, but it's a claim that reveals a major weakness in the book that bothered me a lot. She presents, ultimately, a very narrow in focus. So, yes, no question, Humboldt has a thought-provoking unified view on nature. But, was he the first? What was the intellectual world around him thinking, and what were the foundations? Is it possible nature as a unified thing was brought up before? Ever? by anyone? Wulf doesn't do context well, or didn't here. Really, mainly what she does is report stories in lengthy but also abbreviated forms. I liked her book and I really liked learning about Humbolt. It's not a perfect work, but it's not like the early 19th century intellectual world is an easy one to capture. So, flawed but still recommended, and who knows, you might be blown away like Michael Pollan.-----------------------------------------------60.

292,038535066X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/67736000-elizabeth-a-g,5,"Andrea Wulf's The Invention of Nature: Alexander von Humboldt's New World is an enjoyable, well-written and researched exploration of one man's vision of the world around him and how his restless spirit and determination gave us a deep appreciation of nature and presented the idea connectedness of all things organic and inorganic. Alexander von Humboldt is little remembered today and this book sheds a light on the scientist, ecologist. educator, and humanist who influenced later, better known naturalists like Darwin, Thoreau, George Perkins Marsh, Ernst Haeckel, and John Muir. Humboldt believed in the power of education and his writings and books were aimed toward a general audience rather than to specifically the scientific community. In fact he sought to show how nature is a living organism and that there is unity in scientific thought and the emotional response to nature that is expressed in poetry, art and music. He is also one of the first to warn that the activities of man in his commercial pursuits are bringing about the destruction of forests and creating climate change. In this book Wulf describes Humboldt's influence on future environmentalists and goes into some detail on these others...my only issue that perhaps the author could have shortened this section of the book by more of a summarization rather such detail (the subjects for a future book, perhaps). The epilogue of the book is excellent."
293,038535066X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/23195904-radiantflux,2,"43rd book for 2018.A hagiography of 19th C polymath/naturalist Alexander von Humboldt that never gets beyond the surface of his eventful life. About half the book is padded with simplistic one chapter biopics of people purported to have been strongly influenced by Humboldt, often to an extent that is hard to credit. So according to Wulf: Goethe modelled Faust on Humboldt; Darwin would not have travelled on the Beagle and eventually developed evolutionary theory; John Muir wouldn't have become a environmentalist and saved the redwoods; Heckel wouldn't have created art that directly lead to Art Nouveau; and Bolívar wouldn't have become a revolutionary leading to the decolonization of Spain in Latin America. Wulf also repeatedly credits him with discovering climate change, centuries before it came to conscious awareness here, despite no evidence that this is true. Near the end of the book, she credits his current day obscurity (which is not really true) from a reaction against all things German after the 2nd World War, but if this was really correct, why are so many other German scientists and writers remembered and him not? Perhaps it is more to do with him never creating a lasting advance in knowledge via synthesis (a la Darwin).A great opportunity that is wasted by lack of in depth research and a critical appraisal of Humboldt's life.2-stars."
294,038535066X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/76176316-alistair-mackay,4,"The most famous man you’ve never heard of. Alexander Von Humboldt was a superstar explorer, botanist, geologist, naturalist. He inspired Charles Darwin and Henry David Thoreau. He was friends with Simon Bolivar. He invented the thermal lines on maps and came up with the idea of ecosystems and climate zones. He was a scientist before that was a word, and a naturalist before all the different disciplines of nature split into their factions. He believed nature needed to be understood with facts and poetry, felt as well as experienced. And he predicted climate change and deforestation... in the 1790s. I don’t usually enjoy biographies but I loved this book. It’s well-researched and well written. It’s a fascinating look at the adventures and contributions of a truly great man, and the grandfather of the environmental movement. He was the most famous man in the world at one point, and he’s been lost to history only because of 20th Century anti-German sentiment. Glad I read this and learnt about Humboldt. We owe him so much. "
295,038535066X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/155776-katharine,5,"Do you like science? Literature? History? Do you have strong emotional reactions to being in nature? Then you should read this book! I will boldly say this book is my favorite book of 2015 and I plan on recommending it to everyone I know. Part of the delight is that I had no knowledge of Humboldt before reading this book and I was amazed to learn how influential and inspiring he was to people in the 18th and 19th centuries. With direct links to American founding fathers, the Romantic Literature movement, and Simon Bolivar's fight for independence in South America, and Charles Darwin Humboldt is seed that many modern ideas are sprung from. Although I read a library copy of this book I promptly went out and bought my own personal copy because it's a book I will treasure for years to come."
296,038535066X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/8942931-steph-post,5,"A gorgeous book for science, art and literature fans alike. This is more than a biography of Humboldt (one of the most interesting scientists and explorers of all time)- it's a dedication to his legacy and an exploration of how his findings and philosophies eventually influenced everything from Art Nouveau to Walden to John Muir. Wide and diverse in breadth and scope, this reminds me of one of my favorite books- The Age of Wonder. "
297,038535066X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/637858-mike,4,"I never knew much about Humboldt, yet I found this book breathtaking. A man of natural science of the 19th century, multitalented, and as smart and as dedicated as they come. Substantial impact on Latin American knowledge, and shared experiences.Well written, insightful, an easy and smooth learning experience."
