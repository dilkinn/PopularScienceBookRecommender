0,0465031714,http://goodreads.com/user/show/812997-ethan,4,"Given the philosophy bashing we've seen lately from celebrity scientists like Stephen Hawking, Lawrence Krauss, and Neil deGrasse Tyson, Gleiser is breath of fresh air. Some of what he says about philosophy is a bit sophomoric by professional standards (his treatment of ancient Greek philosophy is okay for a popular book, but some of his comments on morality would be mediocre in Philosophy 101). A lot of the middle of the book gets a bit bogged down on details about quantum physics, which is interesting but goes on a bit longer than needed to make Gleiser's point. I almost went with a three star rating.But I can forgive the faults of this book, and give it four stars, for the fact that Gleiser is a scientist who is willing to question the sort of dogmatic scientism that seems to be gaining popularity these days. Besides, I'll go easy on him because I'm sure everything I say about science sounds sophomoric to a professional scientist! (Thought experiment on my scientism point: imagine a literature professor with no scientific training denigrating physics - would the media take that person seriously?). I'm particularly thrilled to read a scientist who admits that the history of science shows that we ought to be quite a bit less confident we've gotten things right today than most of us are. Gleiser's metaphor of the island of knowledge, in fact, requires that every expansion of knowledge also involves an expansion of the boundaries between knowledge and ignorance. Not that I'm science bashing. I love science! But what I love about science is what Gleiser seems to love about it, too: science is not a dry collection of facts or data sets or even a mere source of economically lucrative technology, it's one of the ways we as humans brush up against our own ignorance and expand our minds. On this point science and philosophy, while not exactly the same, have a lot in common. It's refreshing to read a scientist who understands this.(More on my blog: http://examinedworlds.blogspot.com/20...)"
1,0465031714,http://goodreads.com/user/show/22224713-john-gribbin,4,"Here is the original version of a review that appeared in edited form in the WSJ, 7 June 2014.The Island of KnowledgeMarcelo GleiserBasic Books In the words of the Lovin’ Spoonful song She is Still a Mystery, written by John B Sebastian, “the more I see, the more I see there is to see.”This should be Marcelo Gleiser’s theme tune, since, as a refreshing antidote to those pessimists who argue that the end of physics is in sight, he claims that there are no limits to science and that there will always be unknowable things. “The more we know,”he says, “the more exposed we are to our ignorance, and the more we know to ask.”This is a liberating insight, which makes science an open-ended pursuit, a “romance with the unknown”. This is brought home by the allegory implicit in the title of his book. What we know, according to Gleiser, is like an island in a sea of the unknown. As we learn more, the island grows; but as the island grows its circumference, the boundary between what is known and what is unknown, also grows. The more we see, indeed, the more we see there is to see. If the sea is infinite, this process will continue forever; and the message we take away from the book is that the sea is indeed infinite. All this is set in the context of a relatively conventional but very accessibly presented resume of the development of science (in particular, physics) from ancient times to the present day. The story is presented in three parts. First, what might loosely be called cosmology, the study of the Universe at large. This is good. Secondly, we have the story of the very small, essentially the story of quantum physics. This is excellent. Finally, we have some speculations about mind and matter. This is the weakest part of the book, but only in comparison with the quality of the earlier sections. One of the key features of the story he tells is a point that I often emphasise when discussing how science works with non-scientists. It is a common misconception that scientists are interested, above all, in getting confirmation of the predictions of their existing theories —in physics the so-called “standard model”, which among other things predicted the existence of the Higgs particle. Physicists were, of course, quite pleased that the particle was indeed found. But they (even Peter Higgs himself!) would have been a lot more pleased if the theory had been found to be incomplete, and there was no sign of the predicted particle. That would have given them the opportunity to learn new things —to expand the island of knowledge. For example, Newton’s theory of gravity failed to explain details of the orbit of Mercury around the Sun, pointing the way towards Einstein’s general theory of relativity. Newton’s theory still works within its limitations, but there is more to gravity than Newton knew. Perhaps there is more to gravity than Einstein knew. Gleiser’s assessment of the future of science is distinctly different from that of many —perhaps a majority -- of scientists and commentators. Back in 1996, John Horgan made a splash with his book proclaiming “The End of Science”. His argument was that the foundations of science, such as the Big Bang theory, the structure of DNA and evolution by natural selection, were well established and not going to be changed, except in detail, by new discoveries. Deliciously, just a couple of years later astronomers were surprised to discover that the expansion of the Universe is accelerating, that, two-thirds of the Universe is composed of mysterious “dark energy”, that the stuff we are made of (atoms) makes up only 5 per cent of the Universe, and the Big Bang theory is not as complete as we thought. But that has not stopped people repeating essentially the same argument as Horgan in the present century. For example, in 2009 CHECK, the science journal Nature, hosted a debate on the future of science (http://blogs.nature.com/nautilus/2009...), where Lewis Wolpert, of University College, argued that fundamental biology is essentially complete and unlikely to spring any major surprises. Although important things remain to be discovered (such as details of the process of the development of an adult organism from a single cell), the “fundamental architecture” is not going to change. I would guess that Gleiser’s counter-argument would involve the puzzle of the interplay between mind and matter discussed towards the end of his book. Until we know what consciousness is, how can we claim to understand biology? At the same meeting, Alison Wright, editor of the journal Nature Physics, took a marginally less extreme position, admitting that although physics is in a very satisfactory state, it is a subject in which the adage “never say never”applies with full force to the prospects for a revolutionary change. She was no doubt aware of the comment often attributed to William Thomson (Lord Kelvin), who is reported as saying in 1900 that “there is nothing new to be discovered in physics now. All that remains is more and more precise measurement”. There is some doubt about the attribution, but no doubt that just after this was allegedly said at a meeting of the British Association for the Advancement of Science physics was shaken by not one but two revolutionary developments —quantum physics and relativity theory. Perhaps with this in mind, and referring to the present Holy Grail quest for a “Theory of Everything”, Gleiser sums up:“Notions of final theories are incompatible with the scientific method. Given that we can only accrue scientific knowledge from measurements of natural processes, it is by definition impossible to be certain that we know all the forces of Nature or the fundamental particles that exist; at any point in time, new technological tools may reveal the new and unexpected and thus force a revision of our current knowledge.” There may be such a revision (or revolution) in progress at present. Astronomers of today will tell you, with great confidence, that the Universe as we know it was born 13.82 billion years ago; the natural question to ask then is, “what happened before that?”Until recently, that was regarded as either unanswerable or meaningless. There was no “before”, we were told. Time itself began at the moment the Universe was born. When I was a student I was told that it was meaningless to ask what happened before the time when the entire Universe had the density of an atomic nucleus —the time of the Big Bang. But now cosmologists also talk confidently about the inflation that preceded the Big Bang, earlier than one ten-thousandth of a second after the birth of the Universe from something like a singularity, a point in spacetime. This involves the process known as inflation, which took a a tiny seed —a “quantum fluctuation”and blew it up to become the Big Bang. Inflation theory has recently received a great boost from the apparent discovery of gravitational ripples produced in this process (although I should caution that these results have not yet been independently confirmed). And inflation theory does tell us what happened “before the beginning”. According to the equations, this inflating spacetime would be just one bubble in an infinitely large and eternal metaverse, with no beginning and no end. Within this metaverse, the story goes, there are regions which form inflating bubbles. Our Universe is such a bubble, and the implication is that there are other universes, other bubbles far away across the inflating sea, like the bubbles that form in the liquid when a bottle of champagne is opened. This seemingly speculative idea counts as a genuine scientific hypothesis, because it makes testable predictions. If other “bubble universes”exist in the metaverse, it is possible that long ago one or more of them may have collided with our Universe, like two soap bubbles touching and moving apart. One effect of such a collision, Gleiser points out, would be to make ripples in the space of both bubble universes that would leave a distinctive, but faint, ring-shaped pattern, known as a “cosmic wake”in the background radiation that fills the Universe. The Planck satellite is testing this prediction right now. Is the metaverse real? “We should know,”says Gleiser, “by mid-2015”. One way or the other, this will not bring an end to the cosmological quest, which itself is just one aspect of the scientific quest. This is, to my mind, an upbeat conclusion. The quest goes on, always presenting us with new things to wonder about, and to wonder at. Without that sense of wonder, as this excellent book makes clear, there would be no point in doing science at all.  John Gribbin is a Visiting Fellow in Astronomy at the University of Sussexand author of In Search of the Multiverse.   "
2,0465031714,http://goodreads.com/user/show/26188-jafar,2,"Gleiser wants to show the inherent limitation of human knowledge due to factors like our being confined to our cosmic horizon, the uncertainty and randomness of quantum mechanics, and the undecidability in mathematics according to Gödel's theorems. As a result, he spends two thirds of the book giving you an overview of cosmology and quantum mechanics. Nothing new that can't be found in any other pop physics books. Of course there's a limit to what we can observe and measure, as physics itself tells us. However, this doesn't mean that the fundamental laws of the universe are unknowable. This is Gleiser's main claim, and even though I agree with him that it's naive and arrogant of us to think that we can understand the nature of reality and the laws governing it, he doesn't offer anything as a proof. He presents an interesting analogy of knowledge being an island in the ocean of unknowns. The bigger the island gets, the more it comes in contact with the surrounding ocean. Nice analogy, but not more than that."
3,0465031714,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1289391-michael,3,"Although not enthralled with Gleiser as a writer, I did enjoy thinking about some of the questions he raised in regard to the limits of what we can know about the universe and about ourselves. His book inspired me to reread Max Weber's excellent essay, ""Wissenschaft als Beruf"" (""Science as Profession""), a lecture given in Munich in 1918 and published in the following year in which Weber considers the role of science in the modern world. Including relevant excerpts from Weber's essay would have been a nice addition to Gleiser's book. Weber makes an excellent point about the disparity in modern civilized societies between what scientists know and what lay people know about the way the world works and contrasts this with the more holistic knowledge of those living in traditional (""primitive"") societies:Machen wir uns zunächst klar, was denn eigentlich diese intellektualistische Rationalisierung durch Wissenschaft und wissenschaftlich orientierte Technik praktisch bedeutet. Etwa, daß wir heute, jeder z. B., der hier im Saale sitzt, eine größere Kenntnis der Lebensbedingungen hat, unter denen er existiert, als ein Indianer oder ein Hottentotte? Schwerlich. Wer von uns auf der Straßenbahn fährt, hat – wenn er nicht Fachphysiker ist – keine Ahnung, wie sie das macht, sich in Bewegung zu setzen. Er braucht auch nichts davon zu wissen. Es genügt ihm, daß er auf das Verhalten des Straßenbahnwagens „rechnen“ kann, er orientiert sein Verhalten daran; aber wie man eine Trambahn so herstellt, daß sie sich bewegt, davon weiß er nichts. Der Wilde weiß das von seinen Werkzeugen ungleich besser. Wenn wir heute Geld ausgeben, so wette ich, dass, sogar wenn nationalökonomische Fachkollegen im Saale [16] sind, fast jeder eine andere Antwort bereit halten wird auf die Frage: Wie macht das Geld es, daß man dafür etwas – bald viel, bald wenig – kaufen kann? Wie der Wilde es macht, um zu seiner täglichen Nahrung zu kommen, und welche Institutionen ihm dabei dienen, das weiß er. Die zunehmende Intellektualisierung und Rationalisierung bedeutet also nicht eine zunehmende allgemeine Kenntnis der Lebensbedingungen, unter denen man steht. Sondern sie bedeutet etwas anderes: das Wissen davon oder den Glauben daran: daß man, wenn man nur wollte, es jederzeit erfahren könnte, daß es also prinzipiell keine geheimnisvollen unberechenbare Mächte gebe, die da hineinspielen, daß man vielmehr alle Dinge – im Prinzip – durch Berechnen beherrschen könne. Das aber bedeutet: die Entzauberung der Welt. Nicht mehr, wie der Wilde, für den es solche Mächte gab, muß man zu magischen Mitteln greifen, um die Geister zu beherrschen oder zu erbitten. Sondern technische Mittel und Berechnung leisten das. Dies vor allem bedeutet die Intellektualisierung als solche.For Weber, the disenchantment (Entzauberung) and intellectualization of the world consists not in everyone knowing how things work but rather in the belief that there are rational answers and that through study anyone can have access thereto. Gleiser suggests the possibility (even the probability) that this is not the case. There may be limits to our ability to know (both technical and biological). He does, however, agree with Weber that the provision of meaning is not the purpose of science. For that we must look within ourselves. "
4,0465031714,http://goodreads.com/user/show/16212136-peter-pete-mcloughlin,4, Very readable and interesting book on the history (and philosophy) of science and the limits of knowledge. I liked the sections on Astronomy and Cosmology and the history of science. My only gripe is the discussion of Quantum Mechanics which I felt left too much of an opening for quantum woo woo but on balance an enjoyable book.
5,0465031714,http://goodreads.com/user/show/82034260-nikhil,3,"I'm inspired to begin this review by citing Plato's Allegory of the Cave as well. I believe that most readers who are not familiar with more than basic physics would see the same shadows upon the wall as the author presents his expertise in the field by stating a couple principles and theories and the person who proposed them in his textbook like fashion and sticking the title of the book towards the end in the brittle candlelight. This is not how the entire book is, though. When talking about fields like philosophy, astronomy, AI, and mathematics, the author is quite down to earth and doesn't cause the reader to swipe a few pages forward to escape the tedium. Many chapters are quite engaging, and if one were to carefully dissect the good veggies from the spoilt ones, I'd be inclined to rate it higher. But I think that the reader should be spared the effort, at least for the most part. I enjoyed the analogies and the attempts to make physics fun here and there, but it's still mostly a slog that no reader should have to endure. "
6,0465031714,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5586131-melora,0,"Okay, not giving this an “official” star rating, as it seems unfair to drag the book down when others, undoubtedly cleverer or with stronger scientific backgrounds or both, enjoyed it very much. Still, for my own reference I'll note that I'd rate this with three stars. There were long two star sections where I was lost or bored. Much here seems to me to be so spectacularly speculative that it barely merits the label “science,” and other sections (or, sometimes, the same sections) seemed somewhat repetitive, though that might just reflect my failure to grasp the nuances in what Gleiser was explaining. There were some bits that were quite interesting, though. Four star sections. So, my unofficial rating averages to three stars.I'm not sure how much of my issue here is attributable to having listened to this as an Audible recording rather than reading a physical copy. In hindsight that was a really dumb choice. I somehow expected this to be more philosophical and less... physics. It's got a Lot of physics. Philosophy too, and Gleiser does do a lovely job of exploring what various scientific concepts (as I said, largely physics-related) might mean to us in a “what can we know about our place in the cosmos” sense. Still, I'd have done better to tackle this as a physical book, where I could read slowly and reread the trickier bits. Actually, I have it as a physical book as well, but it's been sitting in my TBR stack for over a year, looking intriguing but also more than a little intimidating. That's my problem with this sort of book – the speculative, far-out sort of physics that seems as much fantasy as science. Every so often I'll watch a science documentary show, hosted by someone brilliant, but with a knack for presenting difficult concepts to the average viewer, like Carl Sagan or Brian Greene, and I find the notions of things like strings and multiple universes to be fascinating. While the charming host is explaining the things, it almost feels like I can grasp them, but later, when I try to articulate what I found so neat it turns out that I really didn't. So I buy the book. And inevitably find that what seemed interesting on television, when offered up with clever graphics and special effects, is really pretty complicated and I get muddled and put the book aside. Which is why I tried this as an audio, but, as it turns out, that doesn't work for me either. Anyway, despite all the bits where I was lost, there is a reasonable amount here that is engaging. Gleiser offers a nice overview of the history of physics, with an eye especially to how the “limits” of science have changed over time, depending of the accuracy of our tools, on what we can measure, and on what we can conceive of measuring. He points to the ways that recognizing limits is valuable, in terms of appreciating what we don't know and also of surmounting those limits. ”The knowledge that we have defines the knowledge that we can have. Still, this is just what a physicist might call the initial condition: a few steps from the beginning, the game is open-ended and unpredictable. As knowledge shifts, we ask new kinds of questions that couldn't have been anticipated.”This is a thought-provoking exploration of where physics has been and of what things look like today at its cutting edge (and sometimes a bit over that edge, it seemed to me). Lots of interesting material, particularly for readers comfortable with ideas like quantum nonlocality, Heisenberg's Uncertainty Principle, entangled pairs, and so on. For less scientifically minded readers I would suggest that this is best enjoyed slowly, in physical book format, and at a point in the day when your brain is firing on all cylinders, rather than as an audio book after the evening's first cocktail and while walking a rambunctious young golden retriever.

7,0465031714,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6243880-gary-beauregard-bottomley,5,"This author has done it again. I read books in order to find out about our universe and our place in it, and this book does better than any other book since his last book ""A Tear at the Edge of Creation"". I have no idea why his books do not become instant classics and aren't more widely read. He really relates well to my way of thinking and leaves no stone untold while telling his story. And what a story he tells with this book!Yes, we are in Plato's Cave, but we do manage to get out from time to time. It is our ignorance that leads us to knowledge. It is the things we don't know that leads to our further understanding. Our very foundations of reality are based on the constructs that we use to explain the patterns we see in data. Particles are made of matter (electrons, quarks,..) and forces. Fields describes these forces and matter and their interactions. The definition of the field is not precise but we continue to use it in our explanations.The author covers all of the physics that's exciting to me. The Greeks lay the foundations by using intuition and argumentation but never quite adding the empirical. It becomes the void verse matter, the being verse becoming which leads to matter verse energy. Before Einstein, matter needed matter to travel through giving us the aether. The aether makes sense until it's not needed. The Morley Michelson experiments were at first explained by the natural compression of space as objects flow through the aether. The narrative's we use change as our understanding improve and our scientific definitions expand.There is large problem with the understanding of physics. The measurement problem, the dual nature of light (wave and particle), double slit experiments, that darn dead and alive cat, and how does ""spooky action at a distance"" (now known as real and called Entanglement) fit into our narratives. Einstein thought reality had to be understandable and that nature at the most fundamental level had to make sense and it must be our operational levels that were failing us. David Bohm and Einstein thought there must be hidden variables to explain the cosmic complexity at the quantum level. At the local level,they have been shown to be wrong.This book covers all of the controversies associated with the Copenhagen Interruption, and how the act of measuring does change the system being measured. At the heart of understanding nature with the current narratives we have in place there are mysteries that can't be resolved. The more we find out we don't know, the better stories we can end up telling.Our nexus of knowledge doesn't lie outside of us, it lies within us. We our the ones who determine how we understand and when a light flickers in our cave we find another way to describe what we see.He's got a nice section on mathematics, Godol's theorem and Turing's universal machine and the Halting Problem. Plato with his cave says math is always discovered not invented. The author will explain why it's best to think of it as being invented not discovered. The incompleteness, lack of coherence as proof for a system, and the problem of the self realization for a finite solution ('Halting Problem') leads to a better understanding of math. By the way, the author does point out for my hero, Mr. Spock, with his logical consistency and understanding will really never be attainable.This is a book that just keeps on giving. He'll tell the reader about Higgs Bosons, Dark Matter, Dark Energy , expanding universes, what advanced AI can mean for us and a host of other just as interesting things.Needless to say, I would strongly recommend this book and his other book available on Audible (""A Tear at the Edge of Creation""). Regretfully, this author's books seem to be ignored by the public at large, but if I can convince just one more person to read this book, I would have made the world just a little bit better!"
8,0465031714,http://goodreads.com/user/show/19256190-todd-allen,5,"Excellently written book that starts the reader off with a bit of a brain teaser. The paradox of knowledge: the more we know the less we know. (Marcelo Gleiser is much more eloquent and inspiring that I in supporting this paradoxical yet empirically valid assertion, mind you!) In it he interlaces the philosophical, physical and human limitations relating to truth and knowledge. Knowledge is presented as an island that is ever increasing its boundaries, however unrhythmically in fits and starts and regressions. Regardless the shape of the ever increasing perimeter that is the island’s shores, that which is beyond, the unknown, increases in lock step; ergo, the more knowledge we gain the more knowledge there is to be had. Put another way, as the reference section in our cummulateive library of knowledge grows so does the free space that will be required to contain what we don’t yet know but presumably will discover and add---or not be able to discover and add.Revisited is the powerful vision expressed by Plato who likened the human ability to understand to that of a fictional people whose reality is constrained to seeing shadows cast onto a wall from a fire behind them. The source of the shadows totally invisible and inaccessible to them, as they are constrained by nature and thus able to see only the two-dimensional shadows in front of them as they flicker and dance. Their truths are built upon the clever narratives stitched together by themselves or others more capable of divining causal connections between the shadows and their everyday experiences. In this world many find comfort in the predictability of the repetitive, others remain skeptical. Weaving together the personalities of scientist to whom we owe a great deal and the truths about the reality they discovered, Gleiser reveals the limits that are imposed by the discovered rules of the universe by providing explanations of the developments in cosmology, relativity and quantum mechanics, and how our understanding of these very solid yet never immutable theories---and the vast empirical evidence that supports them---guarantees that the shores of knowledge in certain areas are dammed. Never the pessimist or defeatist, the author expresses humility at the incalculable vastness that is still awaiting discovery and refinement.This is the first book I’ve read by Marcelo Gleiser. I must say that his ability to communicate complex ideas is unsurpassed. My reference set of Sagan, Dawkins, Pinker, Kahneman and other notables is limited of course. That said, I very much look forward to reading more of his works."
9,0465031714,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3115107-chimezie-ogbuji,5,"This started off with some presumptions that annoyed me but ended up being one of the best philosophical analysis of science that I have read.The annoyance began with the author making the typical mistake westerners make of beginning their history of rational philosophy with the greeks.Then the author proceeds to make a slow winding path to the heart of an argument that strongly resonates with me: that science is limited and the hubris of thinking that there is an endpoint to science - a point we can get to where we have an understanding of everything - is ill-fated. But this is my subjective reason for liking this book.Objectively, the strength of this book is the breadth of his analysis of science, the major breakthroughs, and fundamental limitations that are well known but often ignored by proponents of theories that are not experimentally verifiable such as string and multiverse theories. His writing is strong and the strength of the book, in my opinion, is that he doesn't fall into the trap (at least not excessively) of using too much jargon and making the very interesting topics inaccessible.If you enjoy philosophical and historical analysis of the study of science, you will enjoy this book and will probably want a copy of it on your bookshelf"
10,0465031714,http://goodreads.com/user/show/11562308-mike,5,"My main takeaway from this book? We don't know everything, and that's ok. We don't need explanations for everything. We can work towards a better understanding of our natural world and universe, but we don't have to make up an answer or pretend we have one when we don't know. We can just be ok with where we're at.This isn't to say we can't hypothesize; in fact, we should. It's natural. But let's be careful about how much stock we put in unsubstantiated hypotheses. If we have what we think is a good idea, then by all means, let's test it. But let's be careful about what counts as evidence and what doesn't."
11,0465031714,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3809399-stormin,4,"This was a really, really great read. Gleiser's thesis is an exploration of the limits of human knowledge, especially scientific knowledge. This limitation comes from basically two places. First, our tools may limit the extent to which we can answer questions about the world around us. Second, the universe itself may be unknowable regardless of our tools.Most of this argument he makes with a variety of interesting--and very persuasive--excursions into quantum mechanics and cosmology. I think he basically proves his point.But along the way he makes a much more interesting argument as well, which is that the exercise of science is not fundamentally different from the effort to know about our world in its broadest sense (embracing both philosophy and even theology.) This is, if anything, a more controversial claim. Gleiser makes a lot of the kind of familiar criticisms you often find from iconoclast scientists critiquing the extent to which science--despite having more error-correction than philosophy or religion--still suffers from social defects like deference to authority. I think this is absolutely right, and it's always nice to have another renowned, atheist scientist who's willing to go on record about it. But Gleiser also makes a really compelling historical argument that the kinds of inquiry scientists are doing today--in quantum mechanics or cosmology in particular--are really no different from the kinds of inquiry we can trace to the pre-Socratics. The essence of this argument could be summed up this way: the only thing that's different between a pre-Socratic speculating on the cosmological origins of the universe and a 21st century PhD physicist is the range of tools available to aid in their inquiry. The motivations, the contours of their answers, quite a lot of the tactics, and even the theories they espouse are actually quite continuous across the last 3,000 years of human history.Along the way he makes a couple of ancilliary points. First, he really hits hard on the extent to which alchemy forms a bridge between pre-modern and modern science. Lots of folks will admit that Newton had weird occult interests, for example, but very few will concede that his theory of gravity was influenced explicitly by alchemical principles. In particular: Newton's theory of gravity unified the motion of celestial bodies with the motion of objects down here on Earth. In other words, ""as above, so below."" That's one of the primary alchemical tablets of the Emerald Tablet. According to Gleiser and his historical sources, this principle directly guided Newton in his formulation of Newtonian mechanics. In other words: alchemy wasn't an embarassing side job, sort of like a physicist who also picks his nose. Alchemy was actually what led to Newtonian mechanics. Not alchemy alone, of course, but it was right there playing a formative role.The guardians of the history of science don't want you to hear things like that. They tend to airbrush out the wacky beliefs that have been common to scientists throughout human history as unfortunate incidentals. Gleiser not only brings those beliefs back to the fore, but he shows how (as with Newton) they were integrated into the scientists' overall beliefs. The view we have of scientific progress is a child's fiction with all the uncomfortable parts removed. It's a myth. Gleiser also makes a detour to attack mathematical realism, which is the idea that mathematics isn't just a human invention, but an actual glimpse into the rules that undergird the universe. I understand his argument in this case, and it is strong as far as it goes: all models are just approximations. So, too, is math. It's just a tool. Gleiser's point is, basically, that if we met another alien species that they'd have their own physical laws and their own math and it wouldn't match ours, but it would do it's job of explaining physical phenomena to them. This is where Gleiser goes beyond epistemological relativism (what we know is subject to our perspective) to ontological relativism (what actually exists is subject to our perspective), although he doesn't seem willing to say so outright. And I can't follow him there, because the argument (as Thomas Nagel forcefully argued in The Last Word) is incoherent and or self-defeating. So, Gleiser says we can't say that mathematical truths are ""out there"" because we can't know anything about what is out there. Well, if he's claiming that they are really not ""out there"" then he is actually making a claim about the kinds of things that are, in fact, ""out there."" In particular he's saying that this objective reality which we can never encounter directly has the principle of not including objective mathematical truths as we understand them. Well... how does he know that?This is one of those atheism vs. agnosticism problems. If you say there's no evidence of God, does it justify the conclusion that there is no God? A lot of people think ""yes,"" falling back on a naive kind of skepticism. But it's a foolish semantic trick. The reality is that no premise can be accepted on the basis of lack of evidence. If you have no proof of a thing, the default position is non-belief. Not disbelief. So if Gleiser merely wants to say, of mathematical objectivity, ""we can't know"" (if he wants to be an agnostic about mathematical realism): OK. But if he goes farther and says, ""It's not there"" then his position is internally contradictory. In short: I side with Nagel on this one. Subjectivism--if it holds--is incomprehensible. Literally all that a human can do is think in terms of realism. You might consider this insufficient proof of realism, and you might have a point, but the debate is kind of silly. If you meet another alien species, they might have different characters, but they're still going to concludes that 2+2=4 because any other variant of math is not going to coincide with the universe. If you believe that--and I contend that no human being can sustainably believe otherwise--then you're in fact a mathematical realist. You think that the rules of math--addition, subtraction, etc--correspond to the real universe.Otherwise you have to throw out the whole idea of convergent evolution and (more relevantly) convergent engineering. (Convergent engineering doesn't have a Wikipedia page, but it should. It's the idea that if totally alien species set out to solve similar problems, e.g. make an aircraft to fly in an atmosphere like ours, they are going to end up with very similar-looking solutions because the solutions are dictated by the laws of physics and those laws of physics are objective. Well, I think logic and reason are also objective in the same sense. Boolean logic is not like preferring vanilla to chocolate. It's just the way reality works. We might not know that with 100% certainty, but attacking it as a delusion (as Gleiser attacks the idea of mathematical realism) makes no practical or logical sense.Still, it was a great book full of interesting insights, really cool physics, surprising history, and a strong, well-argued thesis. Definitely a great start to my 2016 reading."
12,0465031714,http://goodreads.com/user/show/18370648-mishehu,5,"Simply: superb. Gleiser is one of the best (lucid, thought-provoking) popular science writers today. I can't fathom why any other reviewers awarded fewer than five stars. The Island of Knowledge is as close to perfect a read as can be -- provided you're interested in the questions it poses and the positions it adopts. This is my second Gleiser read. I'll definitely be back for more."
13,0465031714,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2531665-charlene,5,"I know I am reading a truly great book when I finish a chapter and am compelled to go back to the beginning of the chapter and read every word again, not because it was too complex or the author lost me, but rather because the information was so necessary, so compact, and so important that it deserved another pass. I reread almost every chapter of this book, at least once. I cannot understand any review that doesn't give this book 5 full stars. It was amazing. So many books provide a history of how we came to know what we know about the universe. The history in this book was rich, unique, extremely important, and simply exquisitely written. I have not enjoyed a history this much since reading Swerve. There were times I wanted Greenblatt to go into more detail (or be more clear) about the ideas and lives of Epicurus and Lucretius. What Greenblatt left out, Gleiser provided, and it was amazing. Gleiser artfully took the reader through one of the best histories ever written in order to help the reader understand our most current picture of the strange and complex universe (multiverse). He built a bridge between the past and present that was incredible for the reader to traverse. It is a rare skill indeed to be able to choose not only the wide scope of space, the universe and multiverse itself, but to put into the contexts of both ancient and modern time. As a byproduct of, what I perceived to be the author's main goal, he was able to successfully do for the 2010s what Tomas Kuhn did for the 1960s, when he helped the public understand how scientific ideas undergo paradigm shifts. I read this book at the same time I read Mathematical Universe by Tegmark. Reading both together was an amazing experience. I have read so many physics books lately. Many of them deserve 5 stars because the information contained within them is worth the 5 stars. However, when I am lucky enough to read a book that is extremely relatable, entertaining, informative, and addictive (one that makes you almost want to cry when it ends because you feel a loss), I often wish there was an extra half star that I could give it. This is that kind of book. I loved it! "
14,0465031714,http://goodreads.com/user/show/14963057-oliver-grin,2,"It is difficult to say with certainty whether or not I can completely recommend this book, for a few specific and semi-circumstantial reasons. First I would like to say that I believe this is a book that is best read in its printed form; I read it as an audio book and found it generally difficult to follow. Another major factor in my difficulty was the fact that I am a person with virtually no background in physics or higher-level mathematics, and much of the book focused on specific theories, scientists, and scientific history. If I had read it on pages rather than through my headphones, perhaps I'd have been able to glean more from it than I did. As it stands, I feel that I did not learn much.From a purely literary stand-point, I can say this: The book begins with an interesting premise (essentially that science is not such a fixed and boundless field that it can or should be treated as absolute truth or more 'correct' than other forms of belief; that spirituality, culture, and scientific research can all benefit one another), but is not executed particularly well. The author's narrative voice is charming enough, with wit and humility, the sort of person I felt I might like to have a coffee with, but he fails to bring together what he feels to be relative points to cohere into his thesis. Thus, much of the book wanders through different theories, intermittently veering off into tangential anecdotes about various scientists of the past, without ever feeling as though it comes to a clear head.Again, perhaps if the circumstances had been somewhat different and I had more familiarity with physics or math, or if I had read the book in print, I might have a different opinion of the book. As such, I found it a bit of a slog, all the while wishing I could enjoy it more."
15,0465031714,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2496732-mark,3,"Much of this book would have been more enjoyable had I not already read several books outlining the advances of science from the Greeks, through the European enlightenment and onward. What this particular author brings to the table, and the primary point of the book, is this: with all the advancements of science, there is simply too much that we will probably never be able to know because of our lack of ability to see. We cannot see into the past. We cannot really see into the immensity of space (only into it's past, not at all into it's present). We cannot see the sub-atomic world, only conjecture from it's behavior. The author is clearly an atheist and is by no means slamming science for any theological edge. He is a scientist who is pointing out that with all our necessary and worthwhile explorations into discovering the nature of our world/universe, we are stuck on an ever-growing island of knowledge, but we will never be able to know it all, or even be able to answer most of our questions."
16,0465031714,http://goodreads.com/user/show/67447577-joseph-schrock,5,"This review of Marcelo Gleiser’s book will contain some praise, but also some significant criticisms. The book is engagingly and elegantly written – sometimes even poetic. In his prologue, Gleiser writes (pages xxii-xxiii): “But just for starters, once we explore the nature of human knowledge --- that is, how we try to make sense of the world and of our place in it --- it should be obvious that our approach is fundamentally limited in scope. This realization should OPEN doors, not close them, since it makes the search for knowledge an open-ended pursuit, an endless romance with the unknown. And what could be more inspiring than knowing that there will always be something new to discover in the natural world, that no matter how much we know there will always be plenty of room for the unexpected….” To my thinking, this very fact should shut tightly the door to atheism, because the unknown – and, I’m convinced, sometimes the unknowable – looms ever before us. Far too limited is the human vista for us to be ever justified in concluding that we can summarily rule out a loving and just Creator whose very existence can potentially be known by us. Fortunately, so far as I am aware, Gleiser never seeks to block out of his epistemology the possibility for a Divine Presence – even if his skepticism might seek to cast aspersions on that possibility. Further along in the book (on page 11), Gleiser recounts the event of telling his young son his views on what happens after we die. He states this:“It breaks my heart to have to tell him that what happens to us is the same thing that happens to the ant he crushes under his feet. He, of course, is not convinced. ‘How do you know, Dad?’ ‘I don’t know for sure, son. Some people believe we do come back; others that we go to a place called Paradise, where we meet everybody else who has died. The problem is that I haven’t heard back from any of them to be sure that that’s where we are headed.’” Without establishing trust with a “Higher Reality”, hope for the future can be painfully dim. In a somewhat relevant vein, Gleiser says the following (page 65):“Plato dreamt of a cave with an exit to the light of perfect knowledge, but it seems wise to accept that no knowledge can be perfect or final.”I do not agree that it is wise to accept that assessment, even if, for now, a person is left feeling compelled to remain embroiled in doubt. For the most fortunate among us, even such doubt can be essentially extinguished. Regarding the limits on what we can truly know about the universe, Gleiser presents the following view (page 92):“The lesson here is distressing: not only are there causal and technological limits to how much we can know of the cosmos, but what information we do manage to gather may be tricking us into constructing an entirely false worldview. What we measure doesn’t tell us the whole story; in fact, it may be telling us an irrelevantly small part of it.”Again on page 100, Gleisers emphasizes the point of how much uncertainty there is about our knowledge of the cosmos:“How can we then be so sure that we are that much better off, that we are not missing a big chunk of the cosmic picture? Science is efficient at discovering what exists, if within reach, but it cannot rule out with any final authority what doesn’t exist.” I believe that this is a critically important point. To my way of thinking, the sometimes touted “Theory of Everything” is little better than a joke. Human science will never do much more than scratch the surface of Ultimate Reality. Gleiser seems to concur with that assessment. Gleiser comments on whether we might live in a multiverse. On page 112 he says this:“Our Big Bang would be a local occurrence in a vast collection of cosmic histories.“Can such an idea, crazy as it sounds, be actually physics and not mere speculation? Any scientific hypothesis must be testable. Experiments or otherwise observational data must be collected to consider its scientific viability. Given that we have no evidence that we live in a multiverse – any direct evidence may well be impossible to gather – we must consider the idea with great care, checking wheat evidence we do have in hand, and add to it what we may collect in the future, if anything….“Taken together, the arguments above suggest that the multiverse is at least theoretically possible” (page 123). He continues with this discussion on page 129: “However, I stress again that even a positive detection of a neighboring universe would not prove the existence of a multiverse. Within the present formulation of physics the multiverse hypothesis is untestable, however compelling it may be.” Regarding some implications of quantum physics, Gleiser observes as follows:“Physics was thus proposing that something could exist without mass, that things could exist without being material. Since what exists defines physical reality, the new physics suggested that reality could be immaterial.” Indeed! Reality may be much more interesting than almost anyone had surmised. If “Spirit” undergirds all reality, then when science gets close enough to the ultimate nature of reality, mysteries might proliferate with a vengeance. Gleiser declares that quantum indeterminacy is intrinsic to mass-energy – not merely the result of our limits on the precision of measurement. On page 174, Gleiser says this:“Perhaps the most puzzling aspect of Heisenberg’s principle is that uncertainty inherent in quantum physics is not a technological problem resulting from instruments with limited precision; quantum uncertainty is fundamentally an expression of how Nature behaves at the shortest distances, an expression of a world alien to our own. We can’t make it go away with better technology.” Gleiser creates an imaginary conversation with a scientific realist. On page 181, he expresses these thoughts:“’Well, perhaps the lesson from quantum mechanics is simply that we can’t understand the nature of reality, that we must learn to live with this realization and accept that we can only have partial knowledge of what reality is. We must learn to let go.’”Here’s more about quantum mysteries (page 214):“Taken together, the experiments rule out local theories of quantum mechanics using hidden variables to explain instantaneous action-at-a-distance. Nonlocality (also sometimes called ‘separability’) – influences acting superluminally between members of spatially separated entangled pairs – is a ghost that seems to be real. Reality is not just stranger than we suppose. It’s far stranger that we CAN suppose.”Gleiser emphasizes that quantum mechanics has proven to present us with unsolvable mysteries. On page 231 he writes:“Quantum mechanics forces us to confront the unknowable head-on. This is why it makes most physicists uncomfortable. ‘Unknowable’ is anathema to the core goal of the scientific program, which is designed to deal with, and ultimately make sense of, unknowns. Einstein, Schrodinger, and the scientific realists shun the possibility that Nature would keep secrets beyond our grasp.” On pages 234-5 he continues: “There are aspects of reality that are permanently beyond our reach. The Island of Knowledge must exist as an island, surrounded not only be what we don’t know but by the unknowable nature of the quantum realm.”And of very great interest to me, Gleiser observes the following:“Inevitably, we will have to confront the role of quantum effects in the brain and its possible relevance to consciousness, beyond what Wigner proposed.” I am quite nearly convinced that quantum physics is closely tied to the fantastically mysterious functions of the brain, the mind, consciousness, freedom of the will, and the fact that the human brain is the most obvious interface between mind and matter that we can ever discover. With regard to whether computers can ever think, Gleiser says this (page 261):“The practical feasibility of thinking machines, then, depends on how the brain functions and the nature of the mind.”That is entirely correct, and according to my view of reality, computers can never be brought into a status whereby they think, feel, or have even a spark of consciousness. Thus, strong AI (artificial intelligence) is ruled out. On page 265, Gleiser comments on the dualism of mind/body:“If the soul is not material, how can it interact with the material? Indeed, if it does interact, it must exchange energy with matter. Such an energy exchange process would make the soul or parts of it material, forcing it t have a detectable signature.” In the margin of my book, next to that paragraph, I wrote this: “Read Whitehead and David Ray Griffin!” In other words, I believe that Alfred North Whitehead generated a philosophy of ontology that renders the viability of the objective existence of mind and its interactions with the body plausible. His book, “Process and Reality”, is profoundly difficult to read, but a “disciple” of Whitehead (David Ray Griffin) is a highly prolific expositor of Whitehead’s profound philosophical system. Gleiser’s book is an excellent production. It contains much expert physics, and it is quite effective at driving home the point that the human acquisition of knowledge will forever be constrained by what is unknown and even what is unknowable. This is, by my reckoning, the best physics/philosophy book I’ve yet read. Some discussions are deep and technical, but overall the book is quite palatable to a fairly educated layman. "
17,0465031714,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4825988-nick,4,"Imagine the knowledge we've accumulated about the world and ourselves as an island in an ocean of the unknown. As we learn, the island grows; but so does the shoreline - our ignorance as a boundary between the known and unknown.Gleiser uses this analogy to illustrate the growth of human knowledge over time, describing scientific discoveries that have added to and refined our little island of knowledge.He tackles some pretty complex topics covering cosmology, quantum physics, and consciousness, and explains them in a very accessible way. After reading this, I definitely feel smarter. And also more ignorant."

But the opportunity to read this again with Peter, an actual scientist!, is too tempting. There was too much I didn't understand, so it will be nice to have an ""expert"" to discuss the contents with. "
19,0465031714,http://goodreads.com/user/show/16080726-sabin,4,"I can't shake the feeling that I've read this book before. Most probably, this is because I've heard almost all of the arguments in this book from different sources at different times. But this book is not about making any new philosophical point.It's a well documented and rigorously constructed survey of the science which probes the limits of human understanding. It's aim is to describe what the actual and virtual limits of our knowledge are, what our current understanding of the world around us is, what we can hope to understand in the future based on what we know now and what is effectively beyond those limits, meaning that we can't prove or disprove statements about them.Gleiser starts by tracing the changes in size of what he calls our island of knowledge throughout history, then goes on to explain our current understanding of reality through relativity theory and quantum mechanics and some of their predictions and interpretations, with a small detour through string theory and other theories which are yet to have been experimentally proven. For these ones, he insists on what such a proof might require and if it is, in fact, logically possible to construct an experiment to test these theories.The last part switches the focus from the world around us to consciousness and how deeply we can probe the inner workings of our minds. It is here that he also tests the simulation hypothesis, unprovable by its very nature, but logically consistent.This book is as much an exploration of the boundaries of scientific understanding as it is a personal confession of faith in the scientific method and its results. It is clear, with very good explanations and notes with references for further study, and while the little stories were at most tolerable, my overall impression was good."
20,0465031714,http://goodreads.com/user/show/8277135-erik,4,"This book contains a good summary of the history of scientific understanding of the world. Then he makes a compelling argument for why there will always be unknowns, we will never understand everything by scientific inquiry. There are things that we can never know, and he is not talking about metaphysical or theological ideas, but things that definitely fall within the purview of science. The author gives this, not as a defeatist attitude, but to tell that there will always be a shoreline to the ""Island of Knowledge"" There will always be something to investigate.I could not help but apply the thesis of this book to my world view as a believing member of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints. I have long been surprised at the large numbers of scientifically minded people who hold the very unscientific view that science proves that there is no God and that religious people are simply deluded. I think this view is folly. The connection with my view and the book's thesis is that there are some questions that cannot be answered with the scientific method, and to think that because a question is not provable by this method indicates that the premise is false is not good science, nor is it good logic."

Marcelo Gleiser taps into one of the essential traits that make us human; namely to continue to push at the barriers of the known, to expand the ""Island Of Knowledge"" with the tools at our disposal, full well knowing there are no ultimate answers.

He covers the history of astronomy, physics, and math and shows how our knowledge expands but also the awareness of our ignorance expands, and in fact it looks like there are many questions that may never be scientifically explored because they may be outside the boundaries of what we can ever observe. There were a few chapters about quantum physics that I didn't really ""get"" but then I have never been able to grasp the quantum world although I've read many explanations targeted at lay people. Other than those chapters I felt like everything made sense to me. Very beautiful and inspiring writing from a scientific but not scientistic viewpoint. "

However, I found the account of quantum physics and cosmology in the middle rather boring. This is not because of the way he wrote about it. It is just that I never believed in them. Perhaps the horizon on the island of knowledge where I live is short. Nevertheless, the book was a worthwhile read."

30,0465031714,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5954293-david-dinaburg,3,"There are lots of things to miss about college; if you want a reminder, the volume of listicles covering “Things You’ll Miss From Your Time at College” stretch across the vastness of the internet like a layer of soot in a steampunk novel’s overly detailed opening paragraph. It is hard to know, at the time, that you’ll one day miss not just the freedom or the experiences or the dozen other movie clichés, but the camaraderie: the like-minded focus of hundreds or thousands of open minds trying to puzzle through the same material in the same physical place at the same general time.If making study groups was kind of lame, it was because it is difficult to parse the pressure from the intention—after a lifetime of exam scores defining your scholastic identity—to recognize that learning is fun; cramming for tests sure isn’t, and when do any collegiate kids talk about what they’re learning outside of that context? I would, at thirty-plus years old, love it if my only job was, ostensibly, a huge book club. That is sort of what college is—a book club where everyone is too scared to skip the assignment and your reviews are graded. Maybe I simply think about book reviews too much.It is why, I think, the impetus behind why tech companies tend to call their industrial parks campuses rather than, say, industrial parks. In the same linguistic gymnastics of employing park to downplay the industrial side of the equation, a campus evokes memories of freewheeling debates over the benefits of green grass on shoeless feet, or why all-hour waffle irons were the greatest thing dining hall could offer students. It all puts a scholastic gloss over the garden-wall segregation that distances upper class employees from their service-sector neighbors. C’est la vie.Having a designated forum for discussion while reading The Island of Knowledge: The Limits of Science and the Search for Meaning would have been a boon. Tugging at the frayed edge of Island of Knowledge’s titular “Island of Knowledge” metaphor as it strained against the page came much more naturally to me than internalizing or discussing candidly the material contained therein. The first half passed smoothly enough—the history of natural philosophy and a rather genial overview of the general scientific method—but then we got to Chapter Sixteen. And I hit a wall. I thought it was me, and it still very much may be. I will say that Chapter Sixteen’s title is Can We Test the Multiverse Hypothesis? Wherein We Explore Whether the Multiverse is a Proper Physical Theory or Mere Speculation. Feel free to draw your own conclusion as to why I found myself rereading whole pages multiple times.After a particularly dense section on cosmology, I had a bit of an “Ah ha!” moment:Back to strings. Once you combine them with supersymmetry, the number of extra spatial dimensions is fixed: superstrings can only live in nine spatial dimensions. Five possible string theories have been found, and mathematical physicist Edward Witten from the Institute for Advanced Study has shown that they are all related in a theory with yet another extra dimension called “M-theory.” So if strings are a theory of Nature, six extra dimensions must be invisible to us. How can this be the case? My doctorate thesis and some of my work during my years as a postdoctoral fellow were dedicated to this question, which then was very new. In particular, if we attempt to combine superstring theory with Big Bang cosmology, how to explain that three dimensions grew while the other six remained small. Ah yes, the author is a professor of physics and astronomy; that explains why his chemistry and biology chapters are cogent for a casual audience yet the topics within his passion—theoretical cosmological astronomy—are rife with locked-door terminology and byzantine concepts. I doubt he is in a position to realize that even his most simplified tours require the reader to bring with them prior knowledge if they are to follow him; he has been practicing this for decades. Recognizing how little a lay audience knows at the start of a lecture is a constant dilemma for any expert. So maybe cosmology is simply a more difficult topic, or I am particularly ignorant of it, or the author is talking past me: more likely, it is all three swirled together like a beautifully choreographed ballet in which I am somehow expected to participate.That was how The Island of Knowledge went; there was neat bits nibbling at the edge of my brain, and then they’d always tie back into that overworked metaphor and I would switch to the simpler path of structural criticism rather than contend with the constant deluge of startling facts:As space keeps on stretching, it will carry away most celestial luminaries, the galaxies that are now within telescopic sight. With time, their receding speeds will surpass the speed of light, and a new cosmological horizon will appear, beyond which their light will no longer reach us. Eventually, only our Local Supercluster, the large agglomerate of galaxies including the Milky Way and Andromeda that are bound together by their mutual gravitational attraction, will be visible in the night, albeit much transformed from its current shape. As noted, in a few billion years, the Milky Way and Andromeda galaxies may merge and become one large galaxy. In about four billion years, our Sun will turn into a red giant, and life on Earth will be impossible. (Actually, this will happen much before then, because of instabilities in the solar energy output.) If cosmologists from this very faraway future don’t have access to past observations, they will conclude that they live in a Universe quite different from ours: with no receding galaxies in sight, they won’t ever know of the expanding Universe, or of the Big Bang. Ironically, their cosmology will return to that of a static cosmos, an island universe comprising the galaxies within the Local Supercluster, surrounded by a vast expanse of dark, empty space. Their Island of Knowledge will shrink and eventually disappear altogether, mirroring the growing darkness surrounding it.There is absolutely nothing I can add to the beauty of the preceding paragraph, aside from editing out the last sentence; that metaphor is too prevalent to keep its strength; it is already a hoary chestnut before the book reaches its halfway marker.The point of The Island of Knowledge (the book, not the metaphor)—beyond all of the details you can pick up from the pages—remains clear; science—much like college—isn’t about the end result but about the experience, the journey. It is a dialectic on what we learn about ourselves when we observe enough to discover what we didn’t realize was even a question we should ask:The fundamental discovery from EPR-related experiments is that randomness is an inherent aspect of Nature. When Alice or Bob measures the spin or polarization of their entangled particles they can’t know which result, “up” or “down,” they will get. We don’t have a theory that predicts the outcome of a single quantum measurement. Worse, given that local hidden variables have been ruled out, this theory doesn’t seem to be possible, even in principle. So, if “a glimpse of its true meaning” reflects the realists’ old expectation of complete knowledge of reality, then we are out of luck. Our approach to knowledge needs to be redefined in light of the discoveries of quantum mechanics. There are aspects of reality that are permanently beyond our reach. The Island of Knowledge must exist as an island, surrounded not only by what we don’t know but by the unknowable nature of the quantum realm.There is nothing defeatist about this realization. I can vividly picture every person that reads the first paragraph to conclude that first paragraph thinking, “That was incredibly defeatist.” I certainly did. Which is why it made me laugh to see the next line; I can quite easily conjure up a scenario in my head in which an editor is fighting for some sort of concession on the alleged defeatist tone, only to get the concessionary hand-waving acknowledgement that it may seem defeatist to the reader, but clearly isn’t because the author has decided to beg the question. And no, I did not forget that The Metaphor was in there, but I simply have nothing to say about it at this point. In fact, it is buried in seven of my eight selected excerpts. Not intentionally. It came up, a lot. There are many things to learn from The Island of Knowledge—the meaning of science and the limits of meaning—but how to keep an extended metaphor fresh and interesting through a lengthy non-fiction book isn’t one of them. The shoreline between knowledge and ignorance continues to grow, its rocky expanse bolstered by the broken husks of the now-forgotten vessels drawn in and dashed against its treacherous coast by the illusive siren’s song of true knowledge. Or something."
31,0465031714,http://goodreads.com/user/show/11189571-ben,4,"""The Island of Knowledge"" visits many subjects I find interesting: history of science, cosmology, quantum physics, and a wee bit of information theory at the end. It rarely gets bogged down in details, making it an easily flowing read if you're already familiar with the set of topics at a layman level. What's more, Gleiser's writing style is disciplined, aided not a small amount by his adherence to brief, focused chapters (despite the occasional pompous section that always seems to pop up in books from highly distinguished academic writers).Overall, worth reading if you're interested in a theoretical physicist's brain-dump on where science is going & what problems it's been running into over the last 100 or so years.The rest of this review is just my personal reaction to his arguments:I came away feeling that the book places many dots but not enough connecting lines. The main thesis as I understood it: science is worth pursuing, even as it runs into fundamental limits (the expanding universe vs the speed of light, quantum uncertainty, Godel's uncertainty theorem) which indicate we'll never reach a grand, final truth. No argument from me that science is worth pursuing, but I couldn't grasp exactly why the ""limits of science"" that he cites are so devastating. eg: Quantum mechanics declares that there's an unavoidable fuzziness to some aspects of reality, which is no doubt unnerving. As a result, humanity can never attain the god-like power of seeing the past & predicting the future with absolute certainty that, 200 years ago, seemed so plausible in theory (if nigh impossible in practice). Gleiser does a fine job recounting this unexpected discovery. But is a peculiar limit on our ability to measure the behavior of the universe also a ""limit of science"" in the sense of preventing new, deeper theories? So what if we can't simultaneously measure position & momentum of a particle with absolute accuracy? It's not obvious that this is an insurmountable obstacle to finding a Theory of Everything or other deep discoveries. Yet Gleiser argues (with some hand-waving) that this must be the case. I certainly respect that Gleiser is much more informed than I will ever be on this point, so I wish he had spent somewhat fewer pages rehashing the history of science and more on fleshing out the links for the argument he's putting forward. Still, an excellent read."
32,0465031714,http://goodreads.com/user/show/513697-kim-marshall,5,"This is an extremely clear description of how I (personally) view the limits of Science, mathematics and Human thought.Marcelo Gleiser is an agnostic that believes atheism is ""inconsistent with the scientific method"", as we have no final proof either for or against the existence of a God. On the other hand I would say he is unlikely to feel much pull toward the Judaeo Christian God, seeing this definition as being actually too human, too limited and thus, by definition, fallible.In this work he describes human knowledge as an ever expanding Island of Knowledge and the ocean surrounding this island as ever expanding as we humans continue to enlarge our horizons. He makes an almost unarguable point that these horizons of knowledge do have an unknowable barrier. The speed of light and the limits of time create this barrier by definition (unless of course we can some how find a way around this universal speed limit). This is a fair, and in my mind, accurate description of human limitations and the state of our scientific knowledge as of the publication of this thesis (2014). Some important quotes:""As we probe Nature and master so many of its facts, it is good to remember that the shores of ignorance grow as the Island of Knowledge grows: the ocean of the unknown feeds on our success. It is also good to remember that science only covers part of the Island, that there are many ways of knowing that can and should feed on one another. While the physical and social sciences surely can illuminate many aspects of knowledge, they shouldn't carry the burden of having all the answers. How small a view of the human spirit (it would be) to cloister all that we can achieve in one corner of knowledge! We are multidimensional creatures and search for answers in many, complementary ways. Each serves a purpose, and we need them all."" ""As Arthur C. Clark famously said, Any sufficiently advanced technology is indistinguishable from magic. That the best we can ever do will always amount to a coarse-grained reconstruction of physical reality means that we will never be godlike, just as our purported simulators cannot be. The laws of Nature and the limits of knowledge will make sure that we remain human and fallible."""
33,0465031714,http://goodreads.com/user/show/35348314-joe-stack,4,"I found this book to be challenging, thought provoking, difficult, and rewarding. The most difficult part was the middle portion where the author surveys quantum physics. While the concepts or ideas in this section are difficult to grasp, I think the reader who stays with it gets a better grasp about science's limitations. I liked the author's allegory of knowledge as an island, and how the island's shore grows and shrinks depending on what science reveals. The more we learn, the more we don't know. In the author's words, ""The goal of science is to clarify, to be best of our ability, the way Nature works. Science is not supposed to answer all questions. In fact, this kind of expectation is meaningless, especially when confronted with the nature of knowledge as we have addressed it in this book: ever-exploratory, ever-changing, reflecting so clearly how we approach the world, the kinds of questions we ask and can ask at a given time. The knowledge that we have defines the knowledge that we can have. . . . As knowledge shifts, we ask new kinds of questions that couldn't have been anticipated."" The author's brief history of science brings the reader to the point that there is a limitation to what we can learn, and what remains a mystery (until resolved) is where myths are/may be created because we seek order, we want answers, we want to understand reality, yet reality may not be as firm as we think. As the author states it, ""The very nature of scientific inquiry, always ongoing and always under revision, necessarily implies the notion of a changing understanding of reality."""
34,0465031714,http://goodreads.com/user/show/748832-susannah,4,"... [A]s the Island of Knowledge grows, so do the shores of our ignorance -- the boundary between the known and the unknown. ...The more we know, the more exposed we are to our ignorance, and the more we know to ask.""Surprise! Human beings are finite, and we will never know everything there is to know. As our tools of discovery have grown more precise, we have continually reshaped our view of the cosmos, but we still don't really understand the nature of our own consciousness, much less the fundamental nature of reality.Not news to me, but apparently a necessary corrective to contemporary science, which often proceeds on the assumption that there is a discoverable final answer to it all. The pursuit of knowledge can always benefit from a dose of humility.The first part of this book is a quick historical survey of science, which I found interesting. I was tracking with the author until very near the end, where he started worrying over the idea that our reality could be a simulation. Multiverse: okay, perhaps. It's a speculative hypothesis, but it does seem to be speculation that rightly belongs within the realm of science. Proposing an elaborate Matrix-like reality seems more like wild conspiracy theorizing to me.Overall, though, it was a great read. Most stuff about quantum physics goes over my head, but I still enjoy reading about it and listening to an informed observer's musings."
35,0465031714,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3941555-carlos,3,"While I disagree with much of what the author had to say, I have to recognize that the book was well written and the author does not cram his argument down the reader’s throat. Gleiser starts by elucidating all the inner workings of working in the sciences, from the straightforward concept of inherent errors in all measurements to the more abstract concepts of scientific realism or instrumentalism, i.e., whether our theories define “Truth” or are simply tools to increase our observations. While I found his style slightly meandering, switching from the history of science to the philosophic understanding of its theories, it all lead to the crux of the book, whether or not to accept the weirdness of quantum theory. While he acknowledges his own preference and even his personal/spiritual basis for it, he is also honest in fairly presenting the alternatives. Therefore, while I disagreed with wholehearted embrace of the reality-bending implications of quantum theory I was thankful for his equally well-reasoned defense of the position taken by those with whom he disagrees. Similarly, I was pleasantly surprised to find quite a number of amazing explanations for some of the sophisticated concepts of modern physics. Overall, I found the book worth the read if only for the honest conversation that Gleiser seeks to have regarding the limitations of the scientific pursuit."
36,0465031714,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6225702-matt,4,"Sometimes our dependence on science for understanding truth is overly intense. It is important to know the limits of science and to understand that there are questions science cannot answer. In its attempts to explain the origins of the universe, science has moved closer towards becoming the very thing it often emphatically claims not to be, religion. Scientists speculate on the origins of the universe, the meaning of consciousness, and the reality of truth. Hiding behind a mask of science are many would be prophets claiming to know truth.There are somethings in the book that I don't agree with, for example in his discussion of consciousness, Gleiser gets hung up on the idea that consciousness is not made of matter, and almost contradicts his whole premise by assuming that we should be able to detect the influence consciousness has on physical matter without considering that what makes us who we are could be made of matter that we are just not yet able to detect (or influences the physical in a way that we are yet unable to detect). If you assume that consciousness is something immaterial and unknowable or beyond the observable horizon, then you have already closed the door on its discovery. "
37,0465031714,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5988834-silas,4,"I highly enjoyed this book. It did a great job of showing the history of science from before science was a thing, beginning in Ancient Greece until the present, covering a variety of disciplines, from physics to biology to chemistry to astronomy. What this book does excellently is address the way that, though science is a great way of learning more about our world, there will always be things that we do not know. This book addresses many of the problems that I see with science advocacy in social media, because science is simply not capable of telling us everything. This doesn't make science unimportant, but it is important to understand the limits of what it can and cannot do. My only main criticism of the book comes from the section on the idea of our reality as a simulation where the author doesn't seem to have expanded his imagination quite enough for my tastes, assuming that the physics of creating a simulation would have to adhere to the rules of our reality within the simulation. Still, this is only a very small part of the book, and if the ideas intrigue you, there are other books more dedicated to that idea."
38,0465031714,http://goodreads.com/user/show/21652446-donn-headley,4,"Not all questions have answers, and that is beneficial to us humans, as this spurs our curiosity to keep searching, keep enquiring, keep reaching. In this fascinating popularization of the current extent and limits of scientific knowledge and our investigations into the nature of the universe, Gleiser establishes three fields: what-is-known, what-is-yet-to-be- known, and what-is-unknowable. For both scientists and laymen, he urges humility. In our pursuit of accurate analogies for (what we think is) reality, we can know, with a fair degree of certainty, the boundary (or shoreline) between fields one and two. What we cannot distinguish is the boundary between fields two and three, and that realization should keep us both humble and curious. As a Christian, I kept seeing God in that field of the unknowable, but Gleiser will not go there. But then, he is a scientist and I am not (merely a historian of philosophy). But this book should be edifying and enthralling to both people of faith and those of science."
39,0465031714,http://goodreads.com/user/show/50004058-michael,4,"The Island of Knowledge has 3 parts: 1 The Origin of the World and the Nature of the Heavens, 2 From Alchemy to the Quantum: The Elusive Nature of Reality, and 3 Mind and Meaning. Gleiser's knowledge is impressive, his writing is crisp, and his passion is inspiring. The book weaves between physics and philosophy: looking at what we know, what we know about knowing, and what those two tell us about each other. It's fascinating. Even more interesting is the metaphor captured in the title. The island is what we know; it's substantial and expanding, but it's surrounded by a sea of the unknown. The boundary is a shore of ignorance, which increases with our knowledge. This is a really interesting and productive way to think about knowing. "
40,0465031714,http://goodreads.com/user/show/80988544-richvt,2,"This book is one of many books attempting to explain modern cosmological theories and connect them to modern life. In this, it is a philosophical work really exploring what can be known and the work of science. A lot of it is fascinating but a lot of it is still too technical to grasp so that you often just take the authors word for a concept after struggling through an exploration of the concept. It is tiring and often tiresome reading. The final conclusions- that the process of science is an intrinsic human yearning rather than the attainment of definite knowledge seems trite and anticlimactic. "
41,0465031714,http://goodreads.com/user/show/812731-kat,3,"Good information and an interesting concept comparing our search for understanding of the nature of the universe to an ever expanding island. However, I didn't feel that the organization of the book helped it much. It seemed to meander from topic to topic, not entirely building on itself. This made it a little hard to follow as an audiobook. At times, it also wanders into highly technical equations as a method of explaining a phenomenon, making it , once again, hard to follow. "

The book is divided into three parts. First, cosmology; second, quantum physics; and third, mind and matter.The author retells the stories related to the discoveries brought up in the book while often reminds us that our boundary of ignorance has expended because there are more we just realize that we don't know. He also argued that maybe there is no ""ultimate theory"" at all, and maybe the theory of everything might not even exist because we have no proof to claim that we have learnt everything there is to learn.What I've read in this book makes me feel more humble, but not vulnerable, to realize that there is perhaps no final answer or the fundamental truth."
51,0465031714,http://goodreads.com/user/show/26849656-alexis-bauer-kolak,5,"I read a lot of random science books, some based on online recommendations, others that are referenced in a book I enjoyed. This lucky find was on the shelf at my library and looked interesting. It was.As opposed to the usual explanation of a scientific discovery with a little historical context, this is more a walk down the path of scientific exploration, demonstrating how the discoveries supersede, contradict of enhance each other in expanding our ""island of knowledge"", the expanse of what we as humans can comprehend, explain and identify. The central message here is that there will always be areas beyond our comprehension, because our ability to learn is constrained by our abilities as conscious beings (or, in the case of quantum physics, because there sometimes nothing definite, just a probability.) You'd think it would be upsetting, this idea that we can never know everything, but Dr. Glider isn't saying there's not a reason to try; a lot of important knowledge can come out of trying to figure out how to work around these limits. It also means that the ability to imagine different worlds and planes of existence that we can't currently see or support might just mean they're in a place that's beyond our ability to see. I had never thought about how there could be universe beyond ""the universe"", because our ability to measure it would be limited by how far cosmic radiation could have spread since the Big Bang. There's also a nice philosophical interplay at work here. Geisel notes that most science is about the ""how"", not the why. We don't understand why gravity is exists; being able to measure it or predict its effect is different than being able to explain how it works. You can say that gravity is the deformation of space-time by mass, but why does it do that? What made that that law of our universe? This doesn't mean that philosophy doesn't play an important role in science, but science can't necessarily se philosophical issues.I think this book would be accessible to anyone, but having some pre-reading background in physics would be helpful. I highly recommend this.Favorite quote: If the Universe were shaped like a sphere, as Einstein wanted, and if it would collapse on itself in the distant future, observers of the final moments (if they existed, which is hard to imagine) would be able to see the backs of their heads. They would vanish, crushed into nothingness, knowing that the cosmos was, after all, finite. With hope in their hearts (if they had hearts), they would die dreaming of a new cycle of existence, in which the energy they once were would find new ways of coalescing into complex material forms, some of them able to contemplate the meaning of infinity."""
52,0465031714,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1717479-terry,3,The Island of Knowledge is a discussion of the limits of scientific understand and how that interfaces with our search for meaning. I thought this would give way to either idiotic discussions of cosmic holism or quantum consciousness but that isn't the case. The author discusses traditional limitations of our understanding like the speed of light + cosmic expansion and the Indeterminacy Principle but also the fundamental limitations of models.The best I can say is that it wasn't bad and that's it's useful to get the ontology of a working scientist. Eh.
53,0465031714,http://goodreads.com/user/show/31584402-mbogo-j,4,"Science has allowed us to have our heads in the clouds and even beyond to the frontiers of the cosmos. That is a good thing, however we forgot that our feet should be firmly planted on the ground. When you hear respected physicists declaring philosophy to be dead, you know that hubris has kicked in.In come the realists such as Lee Smolin, Marcelo Gleiser et al who have made it their mission to show us that knowledge should be grounded in reality and not esoteric mathematical proofs. Just to use one example from the book, if we factor in that the universe is 13.5B years old and the cosmic expansion coupled by doppler effect is pushing the initial light further away, then some of this light will eventually exceed our perception and we will have hit our cosmic horizon beyond which we cannot know- a singularity. There some things we just cannot know. Not forgetting that whole story about quantum coupling. This book is about epistemic humility and I think Marcelo did a pretty good job making his case. "
54,0465031714,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5917740-nilesh,2,"The book's biggest problem is that its purpose and its content have nothing in common.The author has a clear goal: to describe why the knowledge we will have at any point will never be complete. In a way, the author wants to imply that knowledge will always be like an island on the surface of reality's ocean - it can only see/represent/understand a small part of what is out there. There will always be unanswered questions for science no matter how much we progress. Despite many different attempts, the author's supposed revelation/discovery escapes any masterful proof and turns out to be a mere assertion. There is nothing wrong with it except that for many, this assertion is too trivial and obvious to warrant a conversation as there are almost no individuals from any walk of life who believes in the opposite. For those who find something new in this argument, the struggle while reading the book is to find the connection between most of the content of the book and the purpose.Between the opening and the close where the arguments are centred around the key belief, the author simply discusses whichever topics he is comfortable with. One is not to ask why the coverage is limited to physical sciences (while skipping, for instance, computational or biological sciences) with occasional brushes with early Greek philosophy (religions have no place in the discourse as do economics, sociology, eastern philosophies or even post renaissance western philosophies). The author finds time to reflect on aspects of industrial revolution even though the post-1950 electronic/computing revolution seems to have no relevance. Whatever scientific discoveries/theories are touched upon, the selection appears more based on the availability of popular literature material on them (hence the focus on Newtonian and 1900-1950 eras) than anything else.The book's summaries of key relativity and quantum mechanic topics are too short to help the uninitiated or benefit those already somewhat familiar."
55,0465031714,http://goodreads.com/user/show/8980431-aaron,3," The Island of Knowledge: The Limits of Science and the Search for Meaning  is a dense collection of information focusing on the realm of physics, cosmology, and mathematics. If you are looking for a book that addresses the limits of science in a broader sense (e.g. biology, ecology, or geology), Island of Knowledge  won't quite meet your expectations.With that being said, Gleiser offers an interesting paradigm into how humans have approached the mysteries of the world from the Pre-Socratics who sought to displace mythical explanations of natural phenomena to modern physicists who have developed superstring theories. Gleiser argues that our metaphorical island of knowledge is constantly expanding and retracting according to the information we uncover through better technology or by disproving theories that have come in and out of vogue. Throughout the book, there are many examples of the sensory limitations humans have acquired based on the path of our evolution. For example, there is discussion about the nature of reality and time involving whether the ""present"" can ever truly exist since there is always a slight delay in processing sensory information. I loved contemplating these dilemmas because they reminded me of philosophy and its relationship to science. Overall, Island of Knowledge piqued my curiosity and excitement for humanity's need to explore, hypothesize and measure uncharted territories. At times, I had to reread passages because of the complexity of the material or the physics-oriented theories and jargon that made little sense to me. Nevertheless, this book is ideal for those who have an unending fascination with the universe (or multiverses) and the inherent limitations of the type of information we can obtain about it."
56,0465031714,http://goodreads.com/user/show/854049-b-zsi-claussen,4," This was a beautifully written book tracing the history of mathematical/scientific progress through physics. Gleiser, who is a professor of Physics and Astronomy at Dartmouth College, wrote this book after having attended a conference, Law of Nature: Their Nature and Knowability in May, 2010, in which he gave a talk presenting his ideas on the limits of science and, thus, the limits of knowledge. Using the metaphor of our state of knowledge being an Island (of the Known at any given point of time) in the middle of the ocean of the Unknown. The Island expands and/or contracts continually as our tools of investigation become more advanced and precise, leading to constantly ""new knowledge"" or new paradigms, but also, as this body or Island of Knowledge expands, so does its borders, where its edges meet the sea of the Unknown. Thus, as our knowledge expands, the borders of the unknown also expand, and the questions and area that we don't have answers to expand. This, in fact, is an image of how there is and always will be unknowables, for ""as the Island grows so do the shores of our ignorance, and thus our ability to ask questions we couldn't have anticipated. I found his major thesis to be most compelling (but of course I would, as I have thought about knowledge and its ""knowability"" in much this way for years), but especially apt this metaphor and image. Most interesting to me, however, was how lucidly he presents the changing ideas coming from the earliest days (in Western philosophical and mathematical thought) up to the very latest ideas and competing theories and interpretations of those theories in both classical and quantum physics today. I would recommend this book heartily to anyone who is interested in such questions! "

58,0465031714,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4842860-john,4,"I jumped the gun last night in giving this book the coveted 5-star rating immediately after having finished the read. After a little more reflection I think a 4 or 4.5 would suit it well. The material isn't necessarily anything new. As other reviewers have already pointed out, there is plenty of the standard new-wave physics discussed. This isn't a flaw, necessarily, but worthy of mention for anyone wanting to simply dive into novelties. Being a mere admirer of the such scientific findings rather than an expert in them means I enjoy the help that re-reading such things brings.I very much enjoyed the author's unapologetic retreat from the hubris that passes for scientific thought and rhetoric. It seems as if many in the community, not least of all the non-professional but self-proclaimed scientificists, are high on their own product while they enjoy the company provided in their circle-jerk.The reason for bumping down to a 4-4.5 rating is because I would've loved more fodder for thought concerning how to balance the concepts of excitement and realism that are interplaying in Gleiser's line of reasoning. Perhaps it's unrealistic on my own part to expect something definitive in terms of epistemology, but even so ended the book wanting just a little bit more."
59,0465031714,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2945070-thom,4,"This book posits knowledge as an island, with the shore representing the edge of our understanding and the ocean beyond as what we do not (or can not) know. Over the years, our island has gotten bigger, but so has the amount of shoreline.The first part does a really excellent job of describing how science has expanded the shores of the island, leading right up to strings and quantum theories. In the second part, the author takes a step back and works from atoms up through quantum mechanics. While this section has fewer pages than the first, the text and ideas are considerably more dense - a thorough reading was required. The third part is very brief, and returns to the idea of the island and whether there are parts of the ocean that we can not know - and whether or not this is a worrisome thing. I believe one could read the first and third sections only to obtain a complete picture.If you are interested in the aims of science and the big questions of the universe, and you aren't put off by decoherence, nonlocality and quantum weirdness, then by all means read this book."
60,0465031714,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5954293-david-dinaburg,3,"There are lots of things to miss about college; if you want a reminder, the volume of listicles covering “Things You’ll Miss From Your Time at College” stretch across the vastness of the internet like a layer of soot in a steampunk novel’s overly detailed opening paragraph. It is hard to know, at the time, that you’ll one day miss not just the freedom or the experiences or the dozen other movie clichés, but the camaraderie: the like-minded focus of hundreds or thousands of open minds trying to puzzle through the same material in the same physical place at the same general time.If making study groups was kind of lame, it was because it is difficult to parse the pressure from the intention—after a lifetime of exam scores defining your scholastic identity—to recognize that learning is fun; cramming for tests sure isn’t, and when do any collegiate kids talk about what they’re learning outside of that context? I would, at thirty-plus years old, love it if my only job was, ostensibly, a huge book club. That is sort of what college is—a book club where everyone is too scared to skip the assignment and your reviews are graded. Maybe I simply think about book reviews too much.It is why, I think, the impetus behind why tech companies tend to call their industrial parks campuses rather than, say, industrial parks. In the same linguistic gymnastics of employing park to downplay the industrial side of the equation, a campus evokes memories of freewheeling debates over the benefits of green grass on shoeless feet, or why all-hour waffle irons were the greatest thing dining hall could offer students. It all puts a scholastic gloss over the garden-wall segregation that distances upper class employees from their service-sector neighbors. C’est la vie.Having a designated forum for discussion while reading The Island of Knowledge: The Limits of Science and the Search for Meaning would have been a boon. Tugging at the frayed edge of Island of Knowledge’s titular “Island of Knowledge” metaphor as it strained against the page came much more naturally to me than internalizing or discussing candidly the material contained therein. The first half passed smoothly enough—the history of natural philosophy and a rather genial overview of the general scientific method—but then we got to Chapter Sixteen. And I hit a wall. I thought it was me, and it still very much may be. I will say that Chapter Sixteen’s title is Can We Test the Multiverse Hypothesis? Wherein We Explore Whether the Multiverse is a Proper Physical Theory or Mere Speculation. Feel free to draw your own conclusion as to why I found myself rereading whole pages multiple times.After a particularly dense section on cosmology, I had a bit of an “Ah ha!” moment:Back to strings. Once you combine them with supersymmetry, the number of extra spatial dimensions is fixed: superstrings can only live in nine spatial dimensions. Five possible string theories have been found, and mathematical physicist Edward Witten from the Institute for Advanced Study has shown that they are all related in a theory with yet another extra dimension called “M-theory.” So if strings are a theory of Nature, six extra dimensions must be invisible to us. How can this be the case? My doctorate thesis and some of my work during my years as a postdoctoral fellow were dedicated to this question, which then was very new. In particular, if we attempt to combine superstring theory with Big Bang cosmology, how to explain that three dimensions grew while the other six remained small. Ah yes, the author is a professor of physics and astronomy; that explains why his chemistry and biology chapters are cogent for a casual audience yet the topics within his passion—theoretical cosmological astronomy—are rife with locked-door terminology and byzantine concepts. I doubt he is in a position to realize that even his most simplified tours require the reader to bring with them prior knowledge if they are to follow him; he has been practicing this for decades. Recognizing how little a lay audience knows at the start of a lecture is a constant dilemma for any expert. So maybe cosmology is simply a more difficult topic, or I am particularly ignorant of it, or the author is talking past me: more likely, it is all three swirled together like a beautifully choreographed ballet in which I am somehow expected to participate.That was how The Island of Knowledge went; there was neat bits nibbling at the edge of my brain, and then they’d always tie back into that overworked metaphor and I would switch to the simpler path of structural criticism rather than contend with the constant deluge of startling facts:As space keeps on stretching, it will carry away most celestial luminaries, the galaxies that are now within telescopic sight. With time, their receding speeds will surpass the speed of light, and a new cosmological horizon will appear, beyond which their light will no longer reach us. Eventually, only our Local Supercluster, the large agglomerate of galaxies including the Milky Way and Andromeda that are bound together by their mutual gravitational attraction, will be visible in the night, albeit much transformed from its current shape. As noted, in a few billion years, the Milky Way and Andromeda galaxies may merge and become one large galaxy. In about four billion years, our Sun will turn into a red giant, and life on Earth will be impossible. (Actually, this will happen much before then, because of instabilities in the solar energy output.) If cosmologists from this very faraway future don’t have access to past observations, they will conclude that they live in a Universe quite different from ours: with no receding galaxies in sight, they won’t ever know of the expanding Universe, or of the Big Bang. Ironically, their cosmology will return to that of a static cosmos, an island universe comprising the galaxies within the Local Supercluster, surrounded by a vast expanse of dark, empty space. Their Island of Knowledge will shrink and eventually disappear altogether, mirroring the growing darkness surrounding it.There is absolutely nothing I can add to the beauty of the preceding paragraph, aside from editing out the last sentence; that metaphor is too prevalent to keep its strength; it is already a hoary chestnut before the book reaches its halfway marker.The point of The Island of Knowledge (the book, not the metaphor)—beyond all of the details you can pick up from the pages—remains clear; science—much like college—isn’t about the end result but about the experience, the journey. It is a dialectic on what we learn about ourselves when we observe enough to discover what we didn’t realize was even a question we should ask:The fundamental discovery from EPR-related experiments is that randomness is an inherent aspect of Nature. When Alice or Bob measures the spin or polarization of their entangled particles they can’t know which result, “up” or “down,” they will get. We don’t have a theory that predicts the outcome of a single quantum measurement. Worse, given that local hidden variables have been ruled out, this theory doesn’t seem to be possible, even in principle. So, if “a glimpse of its true meaning” reflects the realists’ old expectation of complete knowledge of reality, then we are out of luck. Our approach to knowledge needs to be redefined in light of the discoveries of quantum mechanics. There are aspects of reality that are permanently beyond our reach. The Island of Knowledge must exist as an island, surrounded not only by what we don’t know but by the unknowable nature of the quantum realm.There is nothing defeatist about this realization. I can vividly picture every person that reads the first paragraph to conclude that first paragraph thinking, “That was incredibly defeatist.” I certainly did. Which is why it made me laugh to see the next line; I can quite easily conjure up a scenario in my head in which an editor is fighting for some sort of concession on the alleged defeatist tone, only to get the concessionary hand-waving acknowledgement that it may seem defeatist to the reader, but clearly isn’t because the author has decided to beg the question. And no, I did not forget that The Metaphor was in there, but I simply have nothing to say about it at this point. In fact, it is buried in seven of my eight selected excerpts. Not intentionally. It came up, a lot. There are many things to learn from The Island of Knowledge—the meaning of science and the limits of meaning—but how to keep an extended metaphor fresh and interesting through a lengthy non-fiction book isn’t one of them. The shoreline between knowledge and ignorance continues to grow, its rocky expanse bolstered by the broken husks of the now-forgotten vessels drawn in and dashed against its treacherous coast by the illusive siren’s song of true knowledge. Or something."
61,0465031714,http://goodreads.com/user/show/11189571-ben,4,"""The Island of Knowledge"" visits many subjects I find interesting: history of science, cosmology, quantum physics, and a wee bit of information theory at the end. It rarely gets bogged down in details, making it an easily flowing read if you're already familiar with the set of topics at a layman level. What's more, Gleiser's writing style is disciplined, aided not a small amount by his adherence to brief, focused chapters (despite the occasional pompous section that always seems to pop up in books from highly distinguished academic writers).Overall, worth reading if you're interested in a theoretical physicist's brain-dump on where science is going & what problems it's been running into over the last 100 or so years.The rest of this review is just my personal reaction to his arguments:I came away feeling that the book places many dots but not enough connecting lines. The main thesis as I understood it: science is worth pursuing, even as it runs into fundamental limits (the expanding universe vs the speed of light, quantum uncertainty, Godel's uncertainty theorem) which indicate we'll never reach a grand, final truth. No argument from me that science is worth pursuing, but I couldn't grasp exactly why the ""limits of science"" that he cites are so devastating. eg: Quantum mechanics declares that there's an unavoidable fuzziness to some aspects of reality, which is no doubt unnerving. As a result, humanity can never attain the god-like power of seeing the past & predicting the future with absolute certainty that, 200 years ago, seemed so plausible in theory (if nigh impossible in practice). Gleiser does a fine job recounting this unexpected discovery. But is a peculiar limit on our ability to measure the behavior of the universe also a ""limit of science"" in the sense of preventing new, deeper theories? So what if we can't simultaneously measure position & momentum of a particle with absolute accuracy? It's not obvious that this is an insurmountable obstacle to finding a Theory of Everything or other deep discoveries. Yet Gleiser argues (with some hand-waving) that this must be the case. I certainly respect that Gleiser is much more informed than I will ever be on this point, so I wish he had spent somewhat fewer pages rehashing the history of science and more on fleshing out the links for the argument he's putting forward. Still, an excellent read."
62,0465031714,http://goodreads.com/user/show/513697-kim-marshall,5,"This is an extremely clear description of how I (personally) view the limits of Science, mathematics and Human thought.Marcelo Gleiser is an agnostic that believes atheism is ""inconsistent with the scientific method"", as we have no final proof either for or against the existence of a God. On the other hand I would say he is unlikely to feel much pull toward the Judaeo Christian God, seeing this definition as being actually too human, too limited and thus, by definition, fallible.In this work he describes human knowledge as an ever expanding Island of Knowledge and the ocean surrounding this island as ever expanding as we humans continue to enlarge our horizons. He makes an almost unarguable point that these horizons of knowledge do have an unknowable barrier. The speed of light and the limits of time create this barrier by definition (unless of course we can some how find a way around this universal speed limit). This is a fair, and in my mind, accurate description of human limitations and the state of our scientific knowledge as of the publication of this thesis (2014). Some important quotes:""As we probe Nature and master so many of its facts, it is good to remember that the shores of ignorance grow as the Island of Knowledge grows: the ocean of the unknown feeds on our success. It is also good to remember that science only covers part of the Island, that there are many ways of knowing that can and should feed on one another. While the physical and social sciences surely can illuminate many aspects of knowledge, they shouldn't carry the burden of having all the answers. How small a view of the human spirit (it would be) to cloister all that we can achieve in one corner of knowledge! We are multidimensional creatures and search for answers in many, complementary ways. Each serves a purpose, and we need them all."" ""As Arthur C. Clark famously said, Any sufficiently advanced technology is indistinguishable from magic. That the best we can ever do will always amount to a coarse-grained reconstruction of physical reality means that we will never be godlike, just as our purported simulators cannot be. The laws of Nature and the limits of knowledge will make sure that we remain human and fallible."""
63,0465031714,http://goodreads.com/user/show/35348314-joe-stack,4,"I found this book to be challenging, thought provoking, difficult, and rewarding. The most difficult part was the middle portion where the author surveys quantum physics. While the concepts or ideas in this section are difficult to grasp, I think the reader who stays with it gets a better grasp about science's limitations. I liked the author's allegory of knowledge as an island, and how the island's shore grows and shrinks depending on what science reveals. The more we learn, the more we don't know. In the author's words, ""The goal of science is to clarify, to be best of our ability, the way Nature works. Science is not supposed to answer all questions. In fact, this kind of expectation is meaningless, especially when confronted with the nature of knowledge as we have addressed it in this book: ever-exploratory, ever-changing, reflecting so clearly how we approach the world, the kinds of questions we ask and can ask at a given time. The knowledge that we have defines the knowledge that we can have. . . . As knowledge shifts, we ask new kinds of questions that couldn't have been anticipated."" The author's brief history of science brings the reader to the point that there is a limitation to what we can learn, and what remains a mystery (until resolved) is where myths are/may be created because we seek order, we want answers, we want to understand reality, yet reality may not be as firm as we think. As the author states it, ""The very nature of scientific inquiry, always ongoing and always under revision, necessarily implies the notion of a changing understanding of reality."""
64,0465031714,http://goodreads.com/user/show/748832-susannah,4,"... [A]s the Island of Knowledge grows, so do the shores of our ignorance -- the boundary between the known and the unknown. ...The more we know, the more exposed we are to our ignorance, and the more we know to ask.""Surprise! Human beings are finite, and we will never know everything there is to know. As our tools of discovery have grown more precise, we have continually reshaped our view of the cosmos, but we still don't really understand the nature of our own consciousness, much less the fundamental nature of reality.Not news to me, but apparently a necessary corrective to contemporary science, which often proceeds on the assumption that there is a discoverable final answer to it all. The pursuit of knowledge can always benefit from a dose of humility.The first part of this book is a quick historical survey of science, which I found interesting. I was tracking with the author until very near the end, where he started worrying over the idea that our reality could be a simulation. Multiverse: okay, perhaps. It's a speculative hypothesis, but it does seem to be speculation that rightly belongs within the realm of science. Proposing an elaborate Matrix-like reality seems more like wild conspiracy theorizing to me.Overall, though, it was a great read. Most stuff about quantum physics goes over my head, but I still enjoy reading about it and listening to an informed observer's musings."
65,0465031714,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3941555-carlos,3,"While I disagree with much of what the author had to say, I have to recognize that the book was well written and the author does not cram his argument down the reader’s throat. Gleiser starts by elucidating all the inner workings of working in the sciences, from the straightforward concept of inherent errors in all measurements to the more abstract concepts of scientific realism or instrumentalism, i.e., whether our theories define “Truth” or are simply tools to increase our observations. While I found his style slightly meandering, switching from the history of science to the philosophic understanding of its theories, it all lead to the crux of the book, whether or not to accept the weirdness of quantum theory. While he acknowledges his own preference and even his personal/spiritual basis for it, he is also honest in fairly presenting the alternatives. Therefore, while I disagreed with wholehearted embrace of the reality-bending implications of quantum theory I was thankful for his equally well-reasoned defense of the position taken by those with whom he disagrees. Similarly, I was pleasantly surprised to find quite a number of amazing explanations for some of the sophisticated concepts of modern physics. Overall, I found the book worth the read if only for the honest conversation that Gleiser seeks to have regarding the limitations of the scientific pursuit."
66,0465031714,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6225702-matt,4,"Sometimes our dependence on science for understanding truth is overly intense. It is important to know the limits of science and to understand that there are questions science cannot answer. In its attempts to explain the origins of the universe, science has moved closer towards becoming the very thing it often emphatically claims not to be, religion. Scientists speculate on the origins of the universe, the meaning of consciousness, and the reality of truth. Hiding behind a mask of science are many would be prophets claiming to know truth.There are somethings in the book that I don't agree with, for example in his discussion of consciousness, Gleiser gets hung up on the idea that consciousness is not made of matter, and almost contradicts his whole premise by assuming that we should be able to detect the influence consciousness has on physical matter without considering that what makes us who we are could be made of matter that we are just not yet able to detect (or influences the physical in a way that we are yet unable to detect). If you assume that consciousness is something immaterial and unknowable or beyond the observable horizon, then you have already closed the door on its discovery. "
67,0465031714,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5988834-silas,4,"I highly enjoyed this book. It did a great job of showing the history of science from before science was a thing, beginning in Ancient Greece until the present, covering a variety of disciplines, from physics to biology to chemistry to astronomy. What this book does excellently is address the way that, though science is a great way of learning more about our world, there will always be things that we do not know. This book addresses many of the problems that I see with science advocacy in social media, because science is simply not capable of telling us everything. This doesn't make science unimportant, but it is important to understand the limits of what it can and cannot do. My only main criticism of the book comes from the section on the idea of our reality as a simulation where the author doesn't seem to have expanded his imagination quite enough for my tastes, assuming that the physics of creating a simulation would have to adhere to the rules of our reality within the simulation. Still, this is only a very small part of the book, and if the ideas intrigue you, there are other books more dedicated to that idea."
68,0465031714,http://goodreads.com/user/show/21652446-donn-headley,4,"Not all questions have answers, and that is beneficial to us humans, as this spurs our curiosity to keep searching, keep enquiring, keep reaching. In this fascinating popularization of the current extent and limits of scientific knowledge and our investigations into the nature of the universe, Gleiser establishes three fields: what-is-known, what-is-yet-to-be- known, and what-is-unknowable. For both scientists and laymen, he urges humility. In our pursuit of accurate analogies for (what we think is) reality, we can know, with a fair degree of certainty, the boundary (or shoreline) between fields one and two. What we cannot distinguish is the boundary between fields two and three, and that realization should keep us both humble and curious. As a Christian, I kept seeing God in that field of the unknowable, but Gleiser will not go there. But then, he is a scientist and I am not (merely a historian of philosophy). But this book should be edifying and enthralling to both people of faith and those of science."
69,0465031714,http://goodreads.com/user/show/50004058-michael,4,"The Island of Knowledge has 3 parts: 1 The Origin of the World and the Nature of the Heavens, 2 From Alchemy to the Quantum: The Elusive Nature of Reality, and 3 Mind and Meaning. Gleiser's knowledge is impressive, his writing is crisp, and his passion is inspiring. The book weaves between physics and philosophy: looking at what we know, what we know about knowing, and what those two tell us about each other. It's fascinating. Even more interesting is the metaphor captured in the title. The island is what we know; it's substantial and expanding, but it's surrounded by a sea of the unknown. The boundary is a shore of ignorance, which increases with our knowledge. This is a really interesting and productive way to think about knowing. "
70,0465031714,http://goodreads.com/user/show/80988544-richvt,2,"This book is one of many books attempting to explain modern cosmological theories and connect them to modern life. In this, it is a philosophical work really exploring what can be known and the work of science. A lot of it is fascinating but a lot of it is still too technical to grasp so that you often just take the authors word for a concept after struggling through an exploration of the concept. It is tiring and often tiresome reading. The final conclusions- that the process of science is an intrinsic human yearning rather than the attainment of definite knowledge seems trite and anticlimactic. "
71,0465031714,http://goodreads.com/user/show/812731-kat,3,"Good information and an interesting concept comparing our search for understanding of the nature of the universe to an ever expanding island. However, I didn't feel that the organization of the book helped it much. It seemed to meander from topic to topic, not entirely building on itself.

The book is divided into three parts. First, cosmology; second, quantum physics; and third, mind and matter.The author retells the stories related to the discoveries brought up in the book while often reminds us that our boundary of ignorance has expended because there are more we just realize that we don't know. He also argued that maybe there is no ""ultimate theory"" at all, and maybe the theory of everything might not even exist because we have no proof to claim that we have learnt everything there is to learn.What I've read in this book makes me feel more humble, but not vulnerable, to realize that there is perhaps no final answer or the fundamental truth."
81,0465031714,http://goodreads.com/user/show/26849656-alexis-bauer-kolak,5,"I read a lot of random science books, some based on online recommendations, others that are referenced in a book I enjoyed. This lucky find was on the shelf at my library and looked interesting. It was.As opposed to the usual explanation of a scientific discovery with a little historical context, this is more a walk down the path of scientific exploration, demonstrating how the discoveries supersede, contradict of enhance each other in expanding our ""island of knowledge"", the expanse of what we as humans can comprehend, explain and identify. The central message here is that there will always be areas beyond our comprehension, because our ability to learn is constrained by our abilities as conscious beings (or, in the case of quantum physics, because there sometimes nothing definite, just a probability.) You'd think it would be upsetting, this idea that we can never know everything, but Dr. Glider isn't saying there's not a reason to try; a lot of important knowledge can come out of trying to figure out how to work around these limits. It also means that the ability to imagine different worlds and planes of existence that we can't currently see or support might just mean they're in a place that's beyond our ability to see. I had never thought about how there could be universe beyond ""the universe"", because our ability to measure it would be limited by how far cosmic radiation could have spread since the Big Bang. There's also a nice philosophical interplay at work here. Geisel notes that most science is about the ""how"", not the why. We don't understand why gravity is exists; being able to measure it or predict its effect is different than being able to explain how it works. You can say that gravity is the deformation of space-time by mass, but why does it do that? What made that that law of our universe? This doesn't mean that philosophy doesn't play an important role in science, but science can't necessarily se philosophical issues.I think this book would be accessible to anyone, but having some pre-reading background in physics would be helpful. I highly recommend this.Favorite quote: If the Universe were shaped like a sphere, as Einstein wanted, and if it would collapse on itself in the distant future, observers of the final moments (if they existed, which is hard to imagine) would be able to see the backs of their heads. They would vanish, crushed into nothingness, knowing that the cosmos was, after all, finite. With hope in their hearts (if they had hearts), they would die dreaming of a new cycle of existence, in which the energy they once were would find new ways of coalescing into complex material forms, some of them able to contemplate the meaning of infinity."""
82,0465031714,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1717479-terry,3,The Island of Knowledge is a discussion of the limits of scientific understand and how that interfaces with our search for meaning. I thought this would give way to either idiotic discussions of cosmic holism or quantum consciousness but that isn't the case. The author discusses traditional limitations of our understanding like the speed of light + cosmic expansion and the Indeterminacy Principle but also the fundamental limitations of models.The best I can say is that it wasn't bad and that's it's useful to get the ontology of a working scientist. Eh.
83,0465031714,http://goodreads.com/user/show/31584402-mbogo-j,4,"Science has allowed us to have our heads in the clouds and even beyond to the frontiers of the cosmos. That is a good thing, however we forgot that our feet should be firmly planted on the ground. When you hear respected physicists declaring philosophy to be dead, you know that hubris has kicked in.In come the realists such as Lee Smolin, Marcelo Gleiser et al who have made it their mission to show us that knowledge should be grounded in reality and not esoteric mathematical proofs. Just to use one example from the book, if we factor in that the universe is 13.5B years old and the cosmic expansion coupled by doppler effect is pushing the initial light further away, then some of this light will eventually exceed our perception and we will have hit our cosmic horizon beyond which we cannot know- a singularity. There some things we just cannot know. Not forgetting that whole story about quantum coupling. This book is about epistemic humility and I think Marcelo did a pretty good job making his case. "
84,0465031714,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5917740-nilesh,2,"The book's biggest problem is that its purpose and its content have nothing in common.The author has a clear goal: to describe why the knowledge we will have at any point will never be complete. In a way, the author wants to imply that knowledge will always be like an island on the surface of reality's ocean - it can only see/represent/understand a small part of what is out there. There will always be unanswered questions for science no matter how much we progress. Despite many different attempts, the author's supposed revelation/discovery escapes any masterful proof and turns out to be a mere assertion. There is nothing wrong with it except that for many, this assertion is too trivial and obvious to warrant a conversation as there are almost no individuals from any walk of life who believes in the opposite. For those who find something new in this argument, the struggle while reading the book is to find the connection between most of the content of the book and the purpose.Between the opening and the close where the arguments are centred around the key belief, the author simply discusses whichever topics he is comfortable with. One is not to ask why the coverage is limited to physical sciences (while skipping, for instance, computational or biological sciences) with occasional brushes with early Greek philosophy (religions have no place in the discourse as do economics, sociology, eastern philosophies or even post renaissance western philosophies). The author finds time to reflect on aspects of industrial revolution even though the post-1950 electronic/computing revolution seems to have no relevance. Whatever scientific discoveries/theories are touched upon, the selection appears more based on the availability of popular literature material on them (hence the focus on Newtonian and 1900-1950 eras) than anything else.The book's summaries of key relativity and quantum mechanic topics are too short to help the uninitiated or benefit those already somewhat familiar."
85,0465031714,http://goodreads.com/user/show/8980431-aaron,3," The Island of Knowledge: The Limits of Science and the Search for Meaning  is a dense collection of information focusing on the realm of physics, cosmology, and mathematics. If you are looking for a book that addresses the limits of science in a broader sense (e.g. biology, ecology, or geology), Island of Knowledge  won't quite meet your expectations.With that being said, Gleiser offers an interesting paradigm into how humans have approached the mysteries of the world from the Pre-Socratics who sought to displace mythical explanations of natural phenomena to modern physicists who have developed superstring theories. Gleiser argues that our metaphorical island of knowledge is constantly expanding and retracting according to the information we uncover through better technology or by disproving theories that have come in and out of vogue. Throughout the book, there are many examples of the sensory limitations humans have acquired based on the path of our evolution. For example, there is discussion about the nature of reality and time involving whether the ""present"" can ever truly exist since there is always a slight delay in processing sensory information. I loved contemplating these dilemmas because they reminded me of philosophy and its relationship to science. Overall, Island of Knowledge piqued my curiosity and excitement for humanity's need to explore, hypothesize and measure uncharted territories. At times, I had to reread passages because of the complexity of the material or the physics-oriented theories and jargon that made little sense to me. Nevertheless, this book is ideal for those who have an unending fascination with the universe (or multiverses) and the inherent limitations of the type of information we can obtain about it."
86,0465031714,http://goodreads.com/user/show/854049-b-zsi-claussen,4," This was a beautifully written book tracing the history of mathematical/scientific progress through physics. Gleiser, who is a professor of Physics and Astronomy at Dartmouth College, wrote this book after having attended a conference, Law of Nature: Their Nature and Knowability in May, 2010, in which he gave a talk presenting his ideas on the limits of science and, thus, the limits of knowledge. Using the metaphor of our state of knowledge being an Island (of the Known at any given point of time) in the middle of the ocean of the Unknown. The Island expands and/or contracts continually as our tools of investigation become more advanced and precise, leading to constantly ""new knowledge"" or new paradigms, but also, as this body or Island of Knowledge expands, so does its borders, where its edges meet the sea of the Unknown. Thus, as our knowledge expands, the borders of the unknown also expand, and the questions and area that we don't have answers to expand. This, in fact, is an image of how there is and always will be unknowables, for ""as the Island grows so do the shores of our ignorance, and thus our ability to ask questions we couldn't have anticipated. I found his major thesis to be most compelling (but of course I would, as I have thought about knowledge and its ""knowability"" in much this way for years), but especially apt this metaphor and image. Most interesting to me, however, was how lucidly he presents the changing ideas coming from the earliest days (in Western philosophical and mathematical thought) up to the very latest ideas and competing theories and interpretations of those theories in both classical and quantum physics today. I would recommend this book heartily to anyone who is interested in such questions! "

This isn't a flaw, necessarily, but worthy of mention for anyone wanting to simply dive into novelties. Being a mere admirer of the such scientific findings rather than an expert in them means I enjoy the help that re-reading such things brings.I very much enjoyed the author's unapologetic retreat from the hubris that passes for scientific thought and rhetoric. It seems as if many in the community, not least of all the non-professional but self-proclaimed scientificists, are high on their own product while they enjoy the company provided in their circle-jerk.The reason for bumping down to a 4-4.5 rating is because I would've loved more fodder for thought concerning how to balance the concepts of excitement and realism that are interplaying in Gleiser's line of reasoning. Perhaps it's unrealistic on my own part to expect something definitive in terms of epistemology, but even so ended the book wanting just a little bit more."
89,0465031714,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2945070-thom,4,"This book posits knowledge as an island, with the shore representing the edge of our understanding and the ocean beyond as what we do not (or can not) know. Over the years, our island has gotten bigger, but so has the amount of shoreline.The first part does a really excellent job of describing how science has expanded the shores of the island, leading right up to strings and quantum theories. In the second part, the author takes a step back and works from atoms up through quantum mechanics. While this section has fewer pages than the first, the text and ideas are considerably more dense - a thorough reading was required. The third part is very brief, and returns to the idea of the island and whether there are parts of the ocean that we can not know - and whether or not this is a worrisome thing. I believe one could read the first and third sections only to obtain a complete picture.If you are interested in the aims of science and the big questions of the universe, and you aren't put off by decoherence, nonlocality and quantum weirdness, then by all means read this book."
90,0465031714,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5954293-david-dinaburg,3,"There are lots of things to miss about college; if you want a reminder, the volume of listicles covering “Things You’ll Miss From Your Time at College” stretch across the vastness of the internet like a layer of soot in a steampunk novel’s overly detailed opening paragraph. It is hard to know, at the time, that you’ll one day miss not just the freedom or the experiences or the dozen other movie clichés, but the camaraderie: the like-minded focus of hundreds or thousands of open minds trying to puzzle through the same material in the same physical place at the same general time.If making study groups was kind of lame, it was because it is difficult to parse the pressure from the intention—after a lifetime of exam scores defining your scholastic identity—to recognize that learning is fun; cramming for tests sure isn’t, and when do any collegiate kids talk about what they’re learning outside of that context? I would, at thirty-plus years old, love it if my only job was, ostensibly, a huge book club. That is sort of what college is—a book club where everyone is too scared to skip the assignment and your reviews are graded. Maybe I simply think about book reviews too much.It is why, I think, the impetus behind why tech companies tend to call their industrial parks campuses rather than, say, industrial parks. In the same linguistic gymnastics of employing park to downplay the industrial side of the equation, a campus evokes memories of freewheeling debates over the benefits of green grass on shoeless feet, or why all-hour waffle irons were the greatest thing dining hall could offer students. It all puts a scholastic gloss over the garden-wall segregation that distances upper class employees from their service-sector neighbors. C’est la vie.Having a designated forum for discussion while reading The Island of Knowledge: The Limits of Science and the Search for Meaning would have been a boon. Tugging at the frayed edge of Island of Knowledge’s titular “Island of Knowledge” metaphor as it strained against the page came much more naturally to me than internalizing or discussing candidly the material contained therein. The first half passed smoothly enough—the history of natural philosophy and a rather genial overview of the general scientific method—but then we got to Chapter Sixteen. And I hit a wall. I thought it was me, and it still very much may be. I will say that Chapter Sixteen’s title is Can We Test the Multiverse Hypothesis? Wherein We Explore Whether the Multiverse is a Proper Physical Theory or Mere Speculation. Feel free to draw your own conclusion as to why I found myself rereading whole pages multiple times.After a particularly dense section on cosmology, I had a bit of an “Ah ha!” moment:Back to strings. Once you combine them with supersymmetry, the number of extra spatial dimensions is fixed: superstrings can only live in nine spatial dimensions. Five possible string theories have been found, and mathematical physicist Edward Witten from the Institute for Advanced Study has shown that they are all related in a theory with yet another extra dimension called “M-theory.” So if strings are a theory of Nature, six extra dimensions must be invisible to us. How can this be the case? My doctorate thesis and some of my work during my years as a postdoctoral fellow were dedicated to this question, which then was very new. In particular, if we attempt to combine superstring theory with Big Bang cosmology, how to explain that three dimensions grew while the other six remained small. Ah yes, the author is a professor of physics and astronomy; that explains why his chemistry and biology chapters are cogent for a casual audience yet the topics within his passion—theoretical cosmological astronomy—are rife with locked-door terminology and byzantine concepts. I doubt he is in a position to realize that even his most simplified tours require the reader to bring with them prior knowledge if they are to follow him; he has been practicing this for decades. Recognizing how little a lay audience knows at the start of a lecture is a constant dilemma for any expert. So maybe cosmology is simply a more difficult topic, or I am particularly ignorant of it, or the author is talking past me: more likely, it is all three swirled together like a beautifully choreographed ballet in which I am somehow expected to participate.That was how The Island of Knowledge went; there was neat bits nibbling at the edge of my brain, and then they’d always tie back into that overworked metaphor and I would switch to the simpler path of structural criticism rather than contend with the constant deluge of startling facts:As space keeps on stretching, it will carry away most celestial luminaries, the galaxies that are now within telescopic sight. With time, their receding speeds will surpass the speed of light, and a new cosmological horizon will appear, beyond which their light will no longer reach us. Eventually, only our Local Supercluster, the large agglomerate of galaxies including the Milky Way and Andromeda that are bound together by their mutual gravitational attraction, will be visible in the night, albeit much transformed from its current shape. As noted, in a few billion years, the Milky Way and Andromeda galaxies may merge and become one large galaxy. In about four billion years, our Sun will turn into a red giant, and life on Earth will be impossible. (Actually, this will happen much before then, because of instabilities in the solar energy output.) If cosmologists from this very faraway future don’t have access to past observations, they will conclude that they live in a Universe quite different from ours: with no receding galaxies in sight, they won’t ever know of the expanding Universe, or of the Big Bang. Ironically, their cosmology will return to that of a static cosmos, an island universe comprising the galaxies within the Local Supercluster, surrounded by a vast expanse of dark, empty space. Their Island of Knowledge will shrink and eventually disappear altogether, mirroring the growing darkness surrounding it.There is absolutely nothing I can add to the beauty of the preceding paragraph, aside from editing out the last sentence; that metaphor is too prevalent to keep its strength; it is already a hoary chestnut before the book reaches its halfway marker.The point of The Island of Knowledge (the book, not the metaphor)—beyond all of the details you can pick up from the pages—remains clear; science—much like college—isn’t about the end result but about the experience, the journey. It is a dialectic on what we learn about ourselves when we observe enough to discover what we didn’t realize was even a question we should ask:The fundamental discovery from EPR-related experiments is that randomness is an inherent aspect of Nature. When Alice or Bob measures the spin or polarization of their entangled particles they can’t know which result, “up” or “down,” they will get. We don’t have a theory that predicts the outcome of a single quantum measurement. Worse, given that local hidden variables have been ruled out, this theory doesn’t seem to be possible, even in principle. So, if “a glimpse of its true meaning” reflects the realists’ old expectation of complete knowledge of reality, then we are out of luck. Our approach to knowledge needs to be redefined in light of the discoveries of quantum mechanics. There are aspects of reality that are permanently beyond our reach. The Island of Knowledge must exist as an island, surrounded not only by what we don’t know but by the unknowable nature of the quantum realm.There is nothing defeatist about this realization. I can vividly picture every person that reads the first paragraph to conclude that first paragraph thinking, “That was incredibly defeatist.” I certainly did. Which is why it made me laugh to see the next line; I can quite easily conjure up a scenario in my head in which an editor is fighting for some sort of concession on the alleged defeatist tone, only to get the concessionary hand-waving acknowledgement that it may seem defeatist to the reader, but clearly isn’t because the author has decided to beg the question. And no, I did not forget that The Metaphor was in there, but I simply have nothing to say about it at this point. In fact, it is buried in seven of my eight selected excerpts. Not intentionally. It came up, a lot. There are many things to learn from The Island of Knowledge—the meaning of science and the limits of meaning—but how to keep an extended metaphor fresh and interesting through a lengthy non-fiction book isn’t one of them. The shoreline between knowledge and ignorance continues to grow, its rocky expanse bolstered by the broken husks of the now-forgotten vessels drawn in and dashed against its treacherous coast by the illusive siren’s song of true knowledge. Or something."
91,0465031714,http://goodreads.com/user/show/11189571-ben,4,"""The Island of Knowledge"" visits many subjects I find interesting: history of science, cosmology, quantum physics, and a wee bit of information theory at the end. It rarely gets bogged down in details, making it an easily flowing read if you're already familiar with the set of topics at a layman level. What's more, Gleiser's writing style is disciplined, aided not a small amount by his adherence to brief, focused chapters (despite the occasional pompous section that always seems to pop up in books from highly distinguished academic writers).Overall, worth reading if you're interested in a theoretical physicist's brain-dump on where science is going & what problems it's been running into over the last 100 or so years.The rest of this review is just my personal reaction to his arguments:I came away feeling that the book places many dots but not enough connecting lines. The main thesis as I understood it: science is worth pursuing, even as it runs into fundamental limits (the expanding universe vs the speed of light, quantum uncertainty, Godel's uncertainty theorem) which indicate we'll never reach a grand, final truth. No argument from me that science is worth pursuing, but I couldn't grasp exactly why the ""limits of science"" that he cites are so devastating. eg: Quantum mechanics declares that there's an unavoidable fuzziness to some aspects of reality, which is no doubt unnerving. As a result, humanity can never attain the god-like power of seeing the past & predicting the future with absolute certainty that, 200 years ago, seemed so plausible in theory (if nigh impossible in practice). Gleiser does a fine job recounting this unexpected discovery. But is a peculiar limit on our ability to measure the behavior of the universe also a ""limit of science"" in the sense of preventing new, deeper theories? So what if we can't simultaneously measure position & momentum of a particle with absolute accuracy? It's not obvious that this is an insurmountable obstacle to finding a Theory of Everything or other deep discoveries. Yet Gleiser argues (with some hand-waving) that this must be the case. I certainly respect that Gleiser is much more informed than I will ever be on this point, so I wish he had spent somewhat fewer pages rehashing the history of science and more on fleshing out the links for the argument he's putting forward. Still, an excellent read."
92,0465031714,http://goodreads.com/user/show/513697-kim-marshall,5,"This is an extremely clear description of how I (personally) view the limits of Science, mathematics and Human thought.Marcelo Gleiser is an agnostic that believes atheism is ""inconsistent with the scientific method"", as we have no final proof either for or against the existence of a God. On the other hand I would say he is unlikely to feel much pull toward the Judaeo Christian God, seeing this definition as being actually too human, too limited and thus, by definition, fallible.In this work he describes human knowledge as an ever expanding Island of Knowledge and the ocean surrounding this island as ever expanding as we humans continue to enlarge our horizons. He makes an almost unarguable point that these horizons of knowledge do have an unknowable barrier. The speed of light and the limits of time create this barrier by definition (unless of course we can some how find a way around this universal speed limit). This is a fair, and in my mind, accurate description of human limitations and the state of our scientific knowledge as of the publication of this thesis (2014). Some important quotes:""As we probe Nature and master so many of its facts, it is good to remember that the shores of ignorance grow as the Island of Knowledge grows: the ocean of the unknown feeds on our success. It is also good to remember that science only covers part of the Island, that there are many ways of knowing that can and should feed on one another. While the physical and social sciences surely can illuminate many aspects of knowledge, they shouldn't carry the burden of having all the answers. How small a view of the human spirit (it would be) to cloister all that we can achieve in one corner of knowledge! We are multidimensional creatures and search for answers in many, complementary ways. Each serves a purpose, and we need them all."" ""As Arthur C. Clark famously said, Any sufficiently advanced technology is indistinguishable from magic. That the best we can ever do will always amount to a coarse-grained reconstruction of physical reality means that we will never be godlike, just as our purported simulators cannot be. The laws of Nature and the limits of knowledge will make sure that we remain human and fallible."""
93,0465031714,http://goodreads.com/user/show/35348314-joe-stack,4,"I found this book to be challenging, thought provoking, difficult, and rewarding. The most difficult part was the middle portion where the author surveys quantum physics. While the concepts or ideas in this section are difficult to grasp, I think the reader who stays with it gets a better grasp about science's limitations. I liked the author's allegory of knowledge as an island, and how the island's shore grows and shrinks depending on what science reveals. The more we learn, the more we don't know. In the author's words, ""The goal of science is to clarify, to be best of our ability, the way Nature works. Science is not supposed to answer all questions. In fact, this kind of expectation is meaningless, especially when confronted with the nature of knowledge as we have addressed it in this book: ever-exploratory, ever-changing, reflecting so clearly how we approach the world, the kinds of questions we ask and can ask at a given time. The knowledge that we have defines the knowledge that we can have. . . . As knowledge shifts, we ask new kinds of questions that couldn't have been anticipated."" The author's brief history of science brings the reader to the point that there is a limitation to what we can learn, and what remains a mystery (until resolved) is where myths are/may be created because we seek order, we want answers, we want to understand reality, yet reality may not be as firm as we think. As the author states it, ""The very nature of scientific inquiry, always ongoing and always under revision, necessarily implies the notion of a changing understanding of reality."""

[A]s the Island of Knowledge grows, so do the shores of our ignorance -- the boundary between the known and the unknown. ...The more we know, the more exposed we are to our ignorance, and the more we know to ask.""Surprise! Human beings are finite, and we will never know everything there is to know. As our tools of discovery have grown more precise, we have continually reshaped our view of the cosmos, but we still don't really understand the nature of our own consciousness, much less the fundamental nature of reality.Not news to me, but apparently a necessary corrective to contemporary science, which often proceeds on the assumption that there is a discoverable final answer to it all. The pursuit of knowledge can always benefit from a dose of humility.The first part of this book is a quick historical survey of science, which I found interesting. I was tracking with the author until very near the end, where he started worrying over the idea that our reality could be a simulation. Multiverse: okay, perhaps. It's a speculative hypothesis, but it does seem to be speculation that rightly belongs within the realm of science. Proposing an elaborate Matrix-like reality seems more like wild conspiracy theorizing to me.Overall, though, it was a great read. Most stuff about quantum physics goes over my head, but I still enjoy reading about it and listening to an informed observer's musings."
95,0465031714,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3941555-carlos,3,"While I disagree with much of what the author had to say, I have to recognize that the book was well written and the author does not cram his argument down the reader’s throat. Gleiser starts by elucidating all the inner workings of working in the sciences, from the straightforward concept of inherent errors in all measurements to the more abstract concepts of scientific realism or instrumentalism, i.e., whether our theories define “Truth” or are simply tools to increase our observations. While I found his style slightly meandering, switching from the history of science to the philosophic understanding of its theories, it all lead to the crux of the book, whether or not to accept the weirdness of quantum theory. While he acknowledges his own preference and even his personal/spiritual basis for it, he is also honest in fairly presenting the alternatives. Therefore, while I disagreed with wholehearted embrace of the reality-bending implications of quantum theory I was thankful for his equally well-reasoned defense of the position taken by those with whom he disagrees. Similarly, I was pleasantly surprised to find quite a number of amazing explanations for some of the sophisticated concepts of modern physics. Overall, I found the book worth the read if only for the honest conversation that Gleiser seeks to have regarding the limitations of the scientific pursuit."
96,0465031714,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6225702-matt,4,"Sometimes our dependence on science for understanding truth is overly intense. It is important to know the limits of science and to understand that there are questions science cannot answer. In its attempts to explain the origins of the universe, science has moved closer towards becoming the very thing it often emphatically claims not to be, religion. Scientists speculate on the origins of the universe, the meaning of consciousness, and the reality of truth. Hiding behind a mask of science are many would be prophets claiming to know truth.There are somethings in the book that I don't agree with, for example in his discussion of consciousness, Gleiser gets hung up on the idea that consciousness is not made of matter, and almost contradicts his whole premise by assuming that we should be able to detect the influence consciousness has on physical matter without considering that what makes us who we are could be made of matter that we are just not yet able to detect (or influences the physical in a way that we are yet unable to detect). If you assume that consciousness is something immaterial and unknowable or beyond the observable horizon, then you have already closed the door on its discovery. "
97,0465031714,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5988834-silas,4,"I highly enjoyed this book. It did a great job of showing the history of science from before science was a thing, beginning in Ancient Greece until the present, covering a variety of disciplines, from physics to biology to chemistry to astronomy. What this book does excellently is address the way that, though science is a great way of learning more about our world, there will always be things that we do not know. This book addresses many of the problems that I see with science advocacy in social media, because science is simply not capable of telling us everything. This doesn't make science unimportant, but it is important to understand the limits of what it can and cannot do. My only main criticism of the book comes from the section on the idea of our reality as a simulation where the author doesn't seem to have expanded his imagination quite enough for my tastes, assuming that the physics of creating a simulation would have to adhere to the rules of our reality within the simulation. Still, this is only a very small part of the book, and if the ideas intrigue you, there are other books more dedicated to that idea."
98,0465031714,http://goodreads.com/user/show/21652446-donn-headley,4,"Not all questions have answers, and that is beneficial to us humans, as this spurs our curiosity to keep searching, keep enquiring, keep reaching. In this fascinating popularization of the current extent and limits of scientific knowledge and our investigations into the nature of the universe, Gleiser establishes three fields: what-is-known, what-is-yet-to-be- known, and what-is-unknowable. For both scientists and laymen, he urges humility. In our pursuit of accurate analogies for (what we think is) reality, we can know, with a fair degree of certainty, the boundary (or shoreline) between fields one and two. What we cannot distinguish is the boundary between fields two and three, and that realization should keep us both humble and curious. As a Christian, I kept seeing God in that field of the unknowable, but Gleiser will not go there. But then, he is a scientist and I am not (merely a historian of philosophy). But this book should be edifying and enthralling to both people of faith and those of science."

Gleiser's knowledge is impressive, his writing is crisp, and his passion is inspiring. The book weaves between physics and philosophy: looking at what we know, what we know about knowing, and what those two tell us about each other. It's fascinating. Even more interesting is the metaphor captured in the title. The island is what we know; it's substantial and expanding, but it's surrounded by a sea of the unknown. The boundary is a shore of ignorance, which increases with our knowledge. This is a really interesting and productive way to think about knowing. "
100,0465031714,http://goodreads.com/user/show/80988544-richvt,2,"This book is one of many books attempting to explain modern cosmological theories and connect them to modern life. In this, it is a philosophical work really exploring what can be known and the work of science. A lot of it is fascinating but a lot of it is still too technical to grasp so that you often just take the authors word for a concept after struggling through an exploration of the concept. It is tiring and often tiresome reading. The final conclusions- that the process of science is an intrinsic human yearning rather than the attainment of definite knowledge seems trite and anticlimactic. "

The book is divided into three parts. First, cosmology; second, quantum physics; and third, mind and matter.The author retells the stories related to the discoveries brought up in the book while often reminds us that our boundary of ignorance has expended because there are more we just realize that we don't know. He also argued that maybe there is no ""ultimate theory"" at all, and maybe the theory of everything might not even exist because we have no proof to claim that we have learnt everything there is to learn.What I've read in this book makes me feel more humble, but not vulnerable, to realize that there is perhaps no final answer or the fundamental truth."

This lucky find was on the shelf at my library and looked interesting. It was.As opposed to the usual explanation of a scientific discovery with a little historical context, this is more a walk down the path of scientific exploration, demonstrating how the discoveries supersede, contradict of enhance each other in expanding our ""island of knowledge"", the expanse of what we as humans can comprehend, explain and identify. The central message here is that there will always be areas beyond our comprehension, because our ability to learn is constrained by our abilities as conscious beings (or, in the case of quantum physics, because there sometimes nothing definite, just a probability.) You'd think it would be upsetting, this idea that we can never know everything, but Dr. Glider isn't saying there's not a reason to try; a lot of important knowledge can come out of trying to figure out how to work around these limits. It also means that the ability to imagine different worlds and planes of existence that we can't currently see or support might just mean they're in a place that's beyond our ability to see. I had never thought about how there could be universe beyond ""the universe"", because our ability to measure it would be limited by how far cosmic radiation could have spread since the Big Bang. There's also a nice philosophical interplay at work here. Geisel notes that most science is about the ""how"", not the why. We don't understand why gravity is exists; being able to measure it or predict its effect is different than being able to explain how it works. You can say that gravity is the deformation of space-time by mass, but why does it do that? What made that that law of our universe? This doesn't mean that philosophy doesn't play an important role in science, but science can't necessarily se philosophical issues.I think this book would be accessible to anyone, but having some pre-reading background in physics would be helpful. I highly recommend this.Favorite quote: If the Universe were shaped like a sphere, as Einstein wanted, and if it would collapse on itself in the distant future, observers of the final moments (if they existed, which is hard to imagine) would be able to see the backs of their heads. They would vanish, crushed into nothingness, knowing that the cosmos was, after all, finite. With hope in their hearts (if they had hearts), they would die dreaming of a new cycle of existence, in which the energy they once were would find new ways of coalescing into complex material forms, some of them able to contemplate the meaning of infinity."""
112,0465031714,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1717479-terry,3,The Island of Knowledge is a discussion of the limits of scientific understand and how that interfaces with our search for meaning. I thought this would give way to either idiotic discussions of cosmic holism or quantum consciousness but that isn't the case. The author discusses traditional limitations of our understanding like the speed of light + cosmic expansion and the Indeterminacy Principle but also the fundamental limitations of models.The best I can say is that it wasn't bad and that's it's useful to get the ontology of a working scientist. Eh.
113,0465031714,http://goodreads.com/user/show/31584402-mbogo-j,4,"Science has allowed us to have our heads in the clouds and even beyond to the frontiers of the cosmos. That is a good thing, however we forgot that our feet should be firmly planted on the ground. When you hear respected physicists declaring philosophy to be dead, you know that hubris has kicked in.In come the realists such as Lee Smolin, Marcelo Gleiser et al who have made it their mission to show us that knowledge should be grounded in reality and not esoteric mathematical proofs. Just to use one example from the book, if we factor in that the universe is 13.5B years old and the cosmic expansion coupled by doppler effect is pushing the initial light further away, then some of this light will eventually exceed our perception and we will have hit our cosmic horizon beyond which we cannot know- a singularity. There some things we just cannot know. Not forgetting that whole story about quantum coupling. This book is about epistemic humility and I think Marcelo did a pretty good job making his case. "
114,0465031714,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5917740-nilesh,2,"The book's biggest problem is that its purpose and its content have nothing in common.The author has a clear goal: to describe why the knowledge we will have at any point will never be complete. In a way, the author wants to imply that knowledge will always be like an island on the surface of reality's ocean - it can only see/represent/understand a small part of what is out there. There will always be unanswered questions for science no matter how much we progress. Despite many different attempts, the author's supposed revelation/discovery escapes any masterful proof and turns out to be a mere assertion. There is nothing wrong with it except that for many, this assertion is too trivial and obvious to warrant a conversation as there are almost no individuals from any walk of life who believes in the opposite. For those who find something new in this argument, the struggle while reading the book is to find the connection between most of the content of the book and the purpose.Between the opening and the close where the arguments are centred around the key belief, the author simply discusses whichever topics he is comfortable with. One is not to ask why the coverage is limited to physical sciences (while skipping, for instance, computational or biological sciences) with occasional brushes with early Greek philosophy (religions have no place in the discourse as do economics, sociology, eastern philosophies or even post renaissance western philosophies). The author finds time to reflect on aspects of industrial revolution even though the post-1950 electronic/computing revolution seems to have no relevance. Whatever scientific discoveries/theories are touched upon, the selection appears more based on the availability of popular literature material on them (hence the focus on Newtonian and 1900-1950 eras) than anything else.The book's summaries of key relativity and quantum mechanic topics are too short to help the uninitiated or benefit those already somewhat familiar."
115,0465031714,http://goodreads.com/user/show/8980431-aaron,3," The Island of Knowledge: The Limits of Science and the Search for Meaning  is a dense collection of information focusing on the realm of physics, cosmology, and mathematics. If you are looking for a book that addresses the limits of science in a broader sense (e.g. biology, ecology, or geology), Island of Knowledge  won't quite meet your expectations.With that being said, Gleiser offers an interesting paradigm into how humans have approached the mysteries of the world from the Pre-Socratics who sought to displace mythical explanations of natural phenomena to modern physicists who have developed superstring theories. Gleiser argues that our metaphorical island of knowledge is constantly expanding and retracting according to the information we uncover through better technology or by disproving theories that have come in and out of vogue. Throughout the book, there are many examples of the sensory limitations humans have acquired based on the path of our evolution. For example, there is discussion about the nature of reality and time involving whether the ""present"" can ever truly exist since there is always a slight delay in processing sensory information. I loved contemplating these dilemmas because they reminded me of philosophy and its relationship to science. Overall, Island of Knowledge piqued my curiosity and excitement for humanity's need to explore, hypothesize and measure uncharted territories. At times, I had to reread passages because of the complexity of the material or the physics-oriented theories and jargon that made little sense to me. Nevertheless, this book is ideal for those who have an unending fascination with the universe (or multiverses) and the inherent limitations of the type of information we can obtain about it."
116,0465031714,http://goodreads.com/user/show/854049-b-zsi-claussen,4," This was a beautifully written book tracing the history of mathematical/scientific progress through physics. Gleiser, who is a professor of Physics and Astronomy at Dartmouth College, wrote this book after having attended a conference, Law of Nature: Their Nature and Knowability in May, 2010, in which he gave a talk presenting his ideas on the limits of science and, thus, the limits of knowledge. Using the metaphor of our state of knowledge being an Island (of the Known at any given point of time) in the middle of the ocean of the Unknown. The Island expands and/or contracts continually as our tools of investigation become more advanced and precise, leading to constantly ""new knowledge"" or new paradigms, but also, as this body or Island of Knowledge expands, so does its borders, where its edges meet the sea of the Unknown. Thus, as our knowledge expands, the borders of the unknown also expand, and the questions and area that we don't have answers to expand. This, in fact, is an image of how there is and always will be unknowables, for ""as the Island grows so do the shores of our ignorance, and thus our ability to ask questions we couldn't have anticipated. I found his major thesis to be most compelling (but of course I would, as I have thought about knowledge and its ""knowability"" in much this way for years), but especially apt this metaphor and image. Most interesting to me, however, was how lucidly he presents the changing ideas coming from the earliest days (in Western philosophical and mathematical thought) up to the very latest ideas and competing theories and interpretations of those theories in both classical and quantum physics today. I would recommend this book heartily to anyone who is interested in such questions! "

118,0465031714,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4842860-john,4,"I jumped the gun last night in giving this book the coveted 5-star rating immediately after having finished the read. After a little more reflection I think a 4 or 4.5 would suit it well. The material isn't necessarily anything new. As other reviewers have already pointed out, there is plenty of the standard new-wave physics discussed. This isn't a flaw, necessarily, but worthy of mention for anyone wanting to simply dive into novelties. Being a mere admirer of the such scientific findings rather than an expert in them means I enjoy the help that re-reading such things brings.I very much enjoyed the author's unapologetic retreat from the hubris that passes for scientific thought and rhetoric. It seems as if many in the community, not least of all the non-professional but self-proclaimed scientificists, are high on their own product while they enjoy the company provided in their circle-jerk.The reason for bumping down to a 4-4.5 rating is because I would've loved more fodder for thought concerning how to balance the concepts of excitement and realism that are interplaying in Gleiser's line of reasoning. Perhaps it's unrealistic on my own part to expect something definitive in terms of epistemology, but even so ended the book wanting just a little bit more."
119,0465031714,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2945070-thom,4,"This book posits knowledge as an island, with the shore representing the edge of our understanding and the ocean beyond as what we do not (or can not) know. Over the years, our island has gotten bigger, but so has the amount of shoreline.The first part does a really excellent job of describing how science has expanded the shores of the island, leading right up to strings and quantum theories. In the second part, the author takes a step back and works from atoms up through quantum mechanics. While this section has fewer pages than the first, the text and ideas are considerably more dense - a thorough reading was required. The third part is very brief, and returns to the idea of the island and whether there are parts of the ocean that we can not know - and whether or not this is a worrisome thing. I believe one could read the first and third sections only to obtain a complete picture.If you are interested in the aims of science and the big questions of the universe, and you aren't put off by decoherence, nonlocality and quantum weirdness, then by all means read this book."
120,0465031714,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5954293-david-dinaburg,3,"There are lots of things to miss about college; if you want a reminder, the volume of listicles covering “Things You’ll Miss From Your Time at College” stretch across the vastness of the internet like a layer of soot in a steampunk novel’s overly detailed opening paragraph. It is hard to know, at the time, that you’ll one day miss not just the freedom or the experiences or the dozen other movie clichés, but the camaraderie: the like-minded focus of hundreds or thousands of open minds trying to puzzle through the same material in the same physical place at the same general time.If making study groups was kind of lame, it was because it is difficult to parse the pressure from the intention—after a lifetime of exam scores defining your scholastic identity—to recognize that learning is fun; cramming for tests sure isn’t, and when do any collegiate kids talk about what they’re learning outside of that context? I would, at thirty-plus years old, love it if my only job was, ostensibly, a huge book club. That is sort of what college is—a book club where everyone is too scared to skip the assignment and your reviews are graded. Maybe I simply think about book reviews too much.It is why, I think, the impetus behind why tech companies tend to call their industrial parks campuses rather than, say, industrial parks. In the same linguistic gymnastics of employing park to downplay the industrial side of the equation, a campus evokes memories of freewheeling debates over the benefits of green grass on shoeless feet, or why all-hour waffle irons were the greatest thing dining hall could offer students. It all puts a scholastic gloss over the garden-wall segregation that distances upper class employees from their service-sector neighbors. C’est la vie.Having a designated forum for discussion while reading The Island of Knowledge: The Limits of Science and the Search for Meaning would have been a boon. Tugging at the frayed edge of Island of Knowledge’s titular “Island of Knowledge” metaphor as it strained against the page came much more naturally to me than internalizing or discussing candidly the material contained therein. The first half passed smoothly enough—the history of natural philosophy and a rather genial overview of the general scientific method—but then we got to Chapter Sixteen. And I hit a wall. I thought it was me, and it still very much may be. I will say that Chapter Sixteen’s title is Can We Test the Multiverse Hypothesis? Wherein We Explore Whether the Multiverse is a Proper Physical Theory or Mere Speculation. Feel free to draw your own conclusion as to why I found myself rereading whole pages multiple times.After a particularly dense section on cosmology, I had a bit of an “Ah ha!” moment:Back to strings. Once you combine them with supersymmetry, the number of extra spatial dimensions is fixed: superstrings can only live in nine spatial dimensions. Five possible string theories have been found, and mathematical physicist Edward Witten from the Institute for Advanced Study has shown that they are all related in a theory with yet another extra dimension called “M-theory.” So if strings are a theory of Nature, six extra dimensions must be invisible to us. How can this be the case? My doctorate thesis and some of my work during my years as a postdoctoral fellow were dedicated to this question, which then was very new. In particular, if we attempt to combine superstring theory with Big Bang cosmology, how to explain that three dimensions grew while the other six remained small. Ah yes, the author is a professor of physics and astronomy; that explains why his chemistry and biology chapters are cogent for a casual audience yet the topics within his passion—theoretical cosmological astronomy—are rife with locked-door terminology and byzantine concepts. I doubt he is in a position to realize that even his most simplified tours require the reader to bring with them prior knowledge if they are to follow him; he has been practicing this for decades. Recognizing how little a lay audience knows at the start of a lecture is a constant dilemma for any expert. So maybe cosmology is simply a more difficult topic, or I am particularly ignorant of it, or the author is talking past me: more likely, it is all three swirled together like a beautifully choreographed ballet in which I am somehow expected to participate.That was how The Island of Knowledge went; there was neat bits nibbling at the edge of my brain, and then they’d always tie back into that overworked metaphor and I would switch to the simpler path of structural criticism rather than contend with the constant deluge of startling facts:As space keeps on stretching, it will carry away most celestial luminaries, the galaxies that are now within telescopic sight. With time, their receding speeds will surpass the speed of light, and a new cosmological horizon will appear, beyond which their light will no longer reach us. Eventually, only our Local Supercluster, the large agglomerate of galaxies including the Milky Way and Andromeda that are bound together by their mutual gravitational attraction, will be visible in the night, albeit much transformed from its current shape. As noted, in a few billion years, the Milky Way and Andromeda galaxies may merge and become one large galaxy. In about four billion years, our Sun will turn into a red giant, and life on Earth will be impossible. (Actually, this will happen much before then, because of instabilities in the solar energy output.) If cosmologists from this very faraway future don’t have access to past observations, they will conclude that they live in a Universe quite different from ours: with no receding galaxies in sight, they won’t ever know of the expanding Universe, or of the Big Bang. Ironically, their cosmology will return to that of a static cosmos, an island universe comprising the galaxies within the Local Supercluster, surrounded by a vast expanse of dark, empty space. Their Island of Knowledge will shrink and eventually disappear altogether, mirroring the growing darkness surrounding it.There is absolutely nothing I can add to the beauty of the preceding paragraph, aside from editing out the last sentence; that metaphor is too prevalent to keep its strength; it is already a hoary chestnut before the book reaches its halfway marker.The point of The Island of Knowledge (the book, not the metaphor)—beyond all of the details you can pick up from the pages—remains clear; science—much like college—isn’t about the end result but about the experience, the journey. It is a dialectic on what we learn about ourselves when we observe enough to discover what we didn’t realize was even a question we should ask:The fundamental discovery from EPR-related experiments is that randomness is an inherent aspect of Nature. When Alice or Bob measures the spin or polarization of their entangled particles they can’t know which result, “up” or “down,” they will get. We don’t have a theory that predicts the outcome of a single quantum measurement. Worse, given that local hidden variables have been ruled out, this theory doesn’t seem to be possible, even in principle. So, if “a glimpse of its true meaning” reflects the realists’ old expectation of complete knowledge of reality, then we are out of luck. Our approach to knowledge needs to be redefined in light of the discoveries of quantum mechanics. There are aspects of reality that are permanently beyond our reach. The Island of Knowledge must exist as an island, surrounded not only by what we don’t know but by the unknowable nature of the quantum realm.There is nothing defeatist about this realization. I can vividly picture every person that reads the first paragraph to conclude that first paragraph thinking, “That was incredibly defeatist.” I certainly did. Which is why it made me laugh to see the next line; I can quite easily conjure up a scenario in my head in which an editor is fighting for some sort of concession on the alleged defeatist tone, only to get the concessionary hand-waving acknowledgement that it may seem defeatist to the reader, but clearly isn’t because the author has decided to beg the question. And no, I did not forget that The Metaphor was in there, but I simply have nothing to say about it at this point. In fact, it is buried in seven of my eight selected excerpts. Not intentionally. It came up, a lot. There are many things to learn from The Island of Knowledge—the meaning of science and the limits of meaning—but how to keep an extended metaphor fresh and interesting through a lengthy non-fiction book isn’t one of them. The shoreline between knowledge and ignorance continues to grow, its rocky expanse bolstered by the broken husks of the now-forgotten vessels drawn in and dashed against its treacherous coast by the illusive siren’s song of true knowledge. Or something."
121,0465031714,http://goodreads.com/user/show/11189571-ben,4,"""The Island of Knowledge"" visits many subjects I find interesting: history of science, cosmology, quantum physics, and a wee bit of information theory at the end. It rarely gets bogged down in details, making it an easily flowing read if you're already familiar with the set of topics at a layman level. What's more, Gleiser's writing style is disciplined, aided not a small amount by his adherence to brief, focused chapters (despite the occasional pompous section that always seems to pop up in books from highly distinguished academic writers).Overall, worth reading if you're interested in a theoretical physicist's brain-dump on where science is going & what problems it's been running into over the last 100 or so years.The rest of this review is just my personal reaction to his arguments:I came away feeling that the book places many dots but not enough connecting lines. The main thesis as I understood it: science is worth pursuing, even as it runs into fundamental limits (the expanding universe vs the speed of light, quantum uncertainty, Godel's uncertainty theorem) which indicate we'll never reach a grand, final truth. No argument from me that science is worth pursuing, but I couldn't grasp exactly why the ""limits of science"" that he cites are so devastating. eg: Quantum mechanics declares that there's an unavoidable fuzziness to some aspects of reality, which is no doubt unnerving. As a result, humanity can never attain the god-like power of seeing the past & predicting the future with absolute certainty that, 200 years ago, seemed so plausible in theory (if nigh impossible in practice). Gleiser does a fine job recounting this unexpected discovery. But is a peculiar limit on our ability to measure the behavior of the universe also a ""limit of science"" in the sense of preventing new, deeper theories? So what if we can't simultaneously measure position & momentum of a particle with absolute accuracy? It's not obvious that this is an insurmountable obstacle to finding a Theory of Everything or other deep discoveries. Yet Gleiser argues (with some hand-waving) that this must be the case. I certainly respect that Gleiser is much more informed than I will ever be on this point, so I wish he had spent somewhat fewer pages rehashing the history of science and more on fleshing out the links for the argument he's putting forward. Still, an excellent read."
122,0465031714,http://goodreads.com/user/show/513697-kim-marshall,5,"This is an extremely clear description of how I (personally) view the limits of Science, mathematics and Human thought.Marcelo Gleiser is an agnostic that believes atheism is ""inconsistent with the scientific method"", as we have no final proof either for or against the existence of a God. On the other hand I would say he is unlikely to feel much pull toward the Judaeo Christian God, seeing this definition as being actually too human, too limited and thus, by definition, fallible.In this work he describes human knowledge as an ever expanding Island of Knowledge and the ocean surrounding this island as ever expanding as we humans continue to enlarge our horizons. He makes an almost unarguable point that these horizons of knowledge do have an unknowable barrier. The speed of light and the limits of time create this barrier by definition (unless of course we can some how find a way around this universal speed limit). This is a fair, and in my mind, accurate description of human limitations and the state of our scientific knowledge as of the publication of this thesis (2014). Some important quotes:""As we probe Nature and master so many of its facts, it is good to remember that the shores of ignorance grow as the Island of Knowledge grows: the ocean of the unknown feeds on our success. It is also good to remember that science only covers part of the Island, that there are many ways of knowing that can and should feed on one another. While the physical and social sciences surely can illuminate many aspects of knowledge, they shouldn't carry the burden of having all the answers. How small a view of the human spirit (it would be) to cloister all that we can achieve in one corner of knowledge! We are multidimensional creatures and search for answers in many, complementary ways. Each serves a purpose, and we need them all."" ""As Arthur C. Clark famously said, Any sufficiently advanced technology is indistinguishable from magic. That the best we can ever do will always amount to a coarse-grained reconstruction of physical reality means that we will never be godlike, just as our purported simulators cannot be. The laws of Nature and the limits of knowledge will make sure that we remain human and fallible."""
123,0465031714,http://goodreads.com/user/show/35348314-joe-stack,4,"I found this book to be challenging, thought provoking, difficult, and rewarding. The most difficult part was the middle portion where the author surveys quantum physics. While the concepts or ideas in this section are difficult to grasp, I think the reader who stays with it gets a better grasp about science's limitations. I liked the author's allegory of knowledge as an island, and how the island's shore grows and shrinks depending on what science reveals. The more we learn, the more we don't know. In the author's words, ""The goal of science is to clarify, to be best of our ability, the way Nature works. Science is not supposed to answer all questions. In fact, this kind of expectation is meaningless, especially when confronted with the nature of knowledge as we have addressed it in this book: ever-exploratory, ever-changing, reflecting so clearly how we approach the world, the kinds of questions we ask and can ask at a given time. The knowledge that we have defines the knowledge that we can have. . . . As knowledge shifts, we ask new kinds of questions that couldn't have been anticipated."" The author's brief history of science brings the reader to the point that there is a limitation to what we can learn, and what remains a mystery (until resolved) is where myths are/may be created because we seek order, we want answers, we want to understand reality, yet reality may not be as firm as we think. As the author states it, ""The very nature of scientific inquiry, always ongoing and always under revision, necessarily implies the notion of a changing understanding of reality."""

[A]s the Island of Knowledge grows, so do the shores of our ignorance -- the boundary between the known and the unknown. ...The more we know, the more exposed we are to our ignorance, and the more we know to ask.""Surprise! Human beings are finite, and we will never know everything there is to know. As our tools of discovery have grown more precise, we have continually reshaped our view of the cosmos, but we still don't really understand the nature of our own consciousness, much less the fundamental nature of reality.Not news to me, but apparently a necessary corrective to contemporary science, which often proceeds on the assumption that there is a discoverable final answer to it all. The pursuit of knowledge can always benefit from a dose of humility.The first part of this book is a quick historical survey of science, which I found interesting. I was tracking with the author until very near the end, where he started worrying over the idea that our reality could be a simulation. Multiverse: okay, perhaps. It's a speculative hypothesis, but it does seem to be speculation that rightly belongs within the realm of science. Proposing an elaborate Matrix-like reality seems more like wild conspiracy theorizing to me.Overall, though, it was a great read. Most stuff about quantum physics goes over my head, but I still enjoy reading about it and listening to an informed observer's musings."
125,0465031714,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3941555-carlos,3,"While I disagree with much of what the author had to say, I have to recognize that the book was well written and the author does not cram his argument down the reader’s throat. Gleiser starts by elucidating all the inner workings of working in the sciences, from the straightforward concept of inherent errors in all measurements to the more abstract concepts of scientific realism or instrumentalism, i.e., whether our theories define “Truth” or are simply tools to increase our observations. While I found his style slightly meandering, switching from the history of science to the philosophic understanding of its theories, it all lead to the crux of the book, whether or not to accept the weirdness of quantum theory. While he acknowledges his own preference and even his personal/spiritual basis for it, he is also honest in fairly presenting the alternatives. Therefore, while I disagreed with wholehearted embrace of the reality-bending implications of quantum theory I was thankful for his equally well-reasoned defense of the position taken by those with whom he disagrees. Similarly, I was pleasantly surprised to find quite a number of amazing explanations for some of the sophisticated concepts of modern physics. Overall, I found the book worth the read if only for the honest conversation that Gleiser seeks to have regarding the limitations of the scientific pursuit."
126,0465031714,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6225702-matt,4,"Sometimes our dependence on science for understanding truth is overly intense. It is important to know the limits of science and to understand that there are questions science cannot answer. In its attempts to explain the origins of the universe, science has moved closer towards becoming the very thing it often emphatically claims not to be, religion. Scientists speculate on the origins of the universe, the meaning of consciousness, and the reality of truth. Hiding behind a mask of science are many would be prophets claiming to know truth.There are somethings in the book that I don't agree with, for example in his discussion of consciousness, Gleiser gets hung up on the idea that consciousness is not made of matter, and almost contradicts his whole premise by assuming that we should be able to detect the influence consciousness has on physical matter without considering that what makes us who we are could be made of matter that we are just not yet able to detect (or influences the physical in a way that we are yet unable to detect). If you assume that consciousness is something immaterial and unknowable or beyond the observable horizon, then you have already closed the door on its discovery. "
127,0465031714,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5988834-silas,4,"I highly enjoyed this book. It did a great job of showing the history of science from before science was a thing, beginning in Ancient Greece until the present, covering a variety of disciplines, from physics to biology to chemistry to astronomy. What this book does excellently is address the way that, though science is a great way of learning more about our world, there will always be things that we do not know. This book addresses many of the problems that I see with science advocacy in social media, because science is simply not capable of telling us everything. This doesn't make science unimportant, but it is important to understand the limits of what it can and cannot do. My only main criticism of the book comes from the section on the idea of our reality as a simulation where the author doesn't seem to have expanded his imagination quite enough for my tastes, assuming that the physics of creating a simulation would have to adhere to the rules of our reality within the simulation. Still, this is only a very small part of the book, and if the ideas intrigue you, there are other books more dedicated to that idea."
128,0465031714,http://goodreads.com/user/show/21652446-donn-headley,4,"Not all questions have answers, and that is beneficial to us humans, as this spurs our curiosity to keep searching, keep enquiring, keep reaching. In this fascinating popularization of the current extent and limits of scientific knowledge and our investigations into the nature of the universe, Gleiser establishes three fields: what-is-known, what-is-yet-to-be- known, and what-is-unknowable. For both scientists and laymen, he urges humility. In our pursuit of accurate analogies for (what we think is) reality, we can know, with a fair degree of certainty, the boundary (or shoreline) between fields one and two. What we cannot distinguish is the boundary between fields two and three, and that realization should keep us both humble and curious. As a Christian, I kept seeing God in that field of the unknowable, but Gleiser will not go there. But then, he is a scientist and I am not (merely a historian of philosophy). But this book should be edifying and enthralling to both people of faith and those of science."

Gleiser's knowledge is impressive, his writing is crisp, and his passion is inspiring. The book weaves between physics and philosophy: looking at what we know, what we know about knowing, and what those two tell us about each other. It's fascinating. Even more interesting is the metaphor captured in the title. The island is what we know; it's substantial and expanding, but it's surrounded by a sea of the unknown. The boundary is a shore of ignorance, which increases with our knowledge. This is a really interesting and productive way to think about knowing. "

In this, it is a philosophical work really exploring what can be known and the work of science. A lot of it is fascinating but a lot of it is still too technical to grasp so that you often just take the authors word for a concept after struggling through an exploration of the concept. It is tiring and often tiresome reading. The final conclusions- that the process of science is an intrinsic human yearning rather than the attainment of definite knowledge seems trite and anticlimactic. "

He also argued that maybe there is no ""ultimate theory"" at all, and maybe the theory of everything might not even exist because we have no proof to claim that we have learnt everything there is to learn.What I've read in this book makes me feel more humble, but not vulnerable, to realize that there is perhaps no final answer or the fundamental truth."
141,0465031714,http://goodreads.com/user/show/26849656-alexis-bauer-kolak,5,"I read a lot of random science books, some based on online recommendations, others that are referenced in a book I enjoyed. This lucky find was on the shelf at my library and looked interesting. It was.As opposed to the usual explanation of a scientific discovery with a little historical context, this is more a walk down the path of scientific exploration, demonstrating how the discoveries supersede, contradict of enhance each other in expanding our ""island of knowledge"", the expanse of what we as humans can comprehend, explain and identify. The central message here is that there will always be areas beyond our comprehension, because our ability to learn is constrained by our abilities as conscious beings (or, in the case of quantum physics, because there sometimes nothing definite, just a probability.) You'd think it would be upsetting, this idea that we can never know everything, but Dr. Glider isn't saying there's not a reason to try; a lot of important knowledge can come out of trying to figure out how to work around these limits. It also means that the ability to imagine different worlds and planes of existence that we can't currently see or support might just mean they're in a place that's beyond our ability to see. I had never thought about how there could be universe beyond ""the universe"", because our ability to measure it would be limited by how far cosmic radiation could have spread since the Big Bang. There's also a nice philosophical interplay at work here. Geisel notes that most science is about the ""how"", not the why. We don't understand why gravity is exists; being able to measure it or predict its effect is different than being able to explain how it works. You can say that gravity is the deformation of space-time by mass, but why does it do that? What made that that law of our universe? This doesn't mean that philosophy doesn't play an important role in science, but science can't necessarily se philosophical issues.I think this book would be accessible to anyone, but having some pre-reading background in physics would be helpful. I highly recommend this.Favorite quote: If the Universe were shaped like a sphere, as Einstein wanted, and if it would collapse on itself in the distant future, observers of the final moments (if they existed, which is hard to imagine) would be able to see the backs of their heads. They would vanish, crushed into nothingness, knowing that the cosmos was, after all, finite. With hope in their hearts (if they had hearts), they would die dreaming of a new cycle of existence, in which the energy they once were would find new ways of coalescing into complex material forms, some of them able to contemplate the meaning of infinity."""
142,0465031714,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1717479-terry,3,The Island of Knowledge is a discussion of the limits of scientific understand and how that interfaces with our search for meaning. I thought this would give way to either idiotic discussions of cosmic holism or quantum consciousness but that isn't the case. The author discusses traditional limitations of our understanding like the speed of light + cosmic expansion and the Indeterminacy Principle but also the fundamental limitations of models.The best I can say is that it wasn't bad and that's it's useful to get the ontology of a working scientist. Eh.
143,0465031714,http://goodreads.com/user/show/31584402-mbogo-j,4,"Science has allowed us to have our heads in the clouds and even beyond to the frontiers of the cosmos. That is a good thing, however we forgot that our feet should be firmly planted on the ground. When you hear respected physicists declaring philosophy to be dead, you know that hubris has kicked in.In come the realists such as Lee Smolin, Marcelo Gleiser et al who have made it their mission to show us that knowledge should be grounded in reality and not esoteric mathematical proofs. Just to use one example from the book, if we factor in that the universe is 13.5B years old and the cosmic expansion coupled by doppler effect is pushing the initial light further away, then some of this light will eventually exceed our perception and we will have hit our cosmic horizon beyond which we cannot know- a singularity. There some things we just cannot know. Not forgetting that whole story about quantum coupling. This book is about epistemic humility and I think Marcelo did a pretty good job making his case. "
144,0465031714,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5917740-nilesh,2,"The book's biggest problem is that its purpose and its content have nothing in common.The author has a clear goal: to describe why the knowledge we will have at any point will never be complete. In a way, the author wants to imply that knowledge will always be like an island on the surface of reality's ocean - it can only see/represent/understand a small part of what is out there. There will always be unanswered questions for science no matter how much we progress. Despite many different attempts, the author's supposed revelation/discovery escapes any masterful proof and turns out to be a mere assertion. There is nothing wrong with it except that for many, this assertion is too trivial and obvious to warrant a conversation as there are almost no individuals from any walk of life who believes in the opposite. For those who find something new in this argument, the struggle while reading the book is to find the connection between most of the content of the book and the purpose.Between the opening and the close where the arguments are centred around the key belief, the author simply discusses whichever topics he is comfortable with. One is not to ask why the coverage is limited to physical sciences (while skipping, for instance, computational or biological sciences) with occasional brushes with early Greek philosophy (religions have no place in the discourse as do economics, sociology, eastern philosophies or even post renaissance western philosophies). The author finds time to reflect on aspects of industrial revolution even though the post-1950 electronic/computing revolution seems to have no relevance. Whatever scientific discoveries/theories are touched upon, the selection appears more based on the availability of popular literature material on them (hence the focus on Newtonian and 1900-1950 eras) than anything else.The book's summaries of key relativity and quantum mechanic topics are too short to help the uninitiated or benefit those already somewhat familiar."
145,0465031714,http://goodreads.com/user/show/8980431-aaron,3," The Island of Knowledge: The Limits of Science and the Search for Meaning  is a dense collection of information focusing on the realm of physics, cosmology, and mathematics. If you are looking for a book that addresses the limits of science in a broader sense (e.g. biology, ecology, or geology), Island of Knowledge  won't quite meet your expectations.With that being said, Gleiser offers an interesting paradigm into how humans have approached the mysteries of the world from the Pre-Socratics who sought to displace mythical explanations of natural phenomena to modern physicists who have developed superstring theories. Gleiser argues that our metaphorical island of knowledge is constantly expanding and retracting according to the information we uncover through better technology or by disproving theories that have come in and out of vogue. Throughout the book, there are many examples of the sensory limitations humans have acquired based on the path of our evolution. For example, there is discussion about the nature of reality and time involving whether the ""present"" can ever truly exist since there is always a slight delay in processing sensory information. I loved contemplating these dilemmas because they reminded me of philosophy and its relationship to science. Overall, Island of Knowledge piqued my curiosity and excitement for humanity's need to explore, hypothesize and measure uncharted territories. At times, I had to reread passages because of the complexity of the material or the physics-oriented theories and jargon that made little sense to me. Nevertheless, this book is ideal for those who have an unending fascination with the universe (or multiverses) and the inherent limitations of the type of information we can obtain about it."
146,0465031714,http://goodreads.com/user/show/854049-b-zsi-claussen,4," This was a beautifully written book tracing the history of mathematical/scientific progress through physics. Gleiser, who is a professor of Physics and Astronomy at Dartmouth College, wrote this book after having attended a conference, Law of Nature: Their Nature and Knowability in May, 2010, in which he gave a talk presenting his ideas on the limits of science and, thus, the limits of knowledge. Using the metaphor of our state of knowledge being an Island (of the Known at any given point of time) in the middle of the ocean of the Unknown. The Island expands and/or contracts continually as our tools of investigation become more advanced and precise, leading to constantly ""new knowledge"" or new paradigms, but also, as this body or Island of Knowledge expands, so does its borders, where its edges meet the sea of the Unknown. Thus, as our knowledge expands, the borders of the unknown also expand, and the questions and area that we don't have answers to expand. This, in fact, is an image of how there is and always will be unknowables, for ""as the Island grows so do the shores of our ignorance, and thus our ability to ask questions we couldn't have anticipated. I found his major thesis to be most compelling (but of course I would, as I have thought about knowledge and its ""knowability"" in much this way for years), but especially apt this metaphor and image. Most interesting to me, however, was how lucidly he presents the changing ideas coming from the earliest days (in Western philosophical and mathematical thought) up to the very latest ideas and competing theories and interpretations of those theories in both classical and quantum physics today. I would recommend this book heartily to anyone who is interested in such questions! "

148,0465031714,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4842860-john,4,"I jumped the gun last night in giving this book the coveted 5-star rating immediately after having finished the read. After a little more reflection I think a 4 or 4.5 would suit it well. The material isn't necessarily anything new. As other reviewers have already pointed out, there is plenty of the standard new-wave physics discussed. This isn't a flaw, necessarily, but worthy of mention for anyone wanting to simply dive into novelties. Being a mere admirer of the such scientific findings rather than an expert in them means I enjoy the help that re-reading such things brings.I very much enjoyed the author's unapologetic retreat from the hubris that passes for scientific thought and rhetoric. It seems as if many in the community, not least of all the non-professional but self-proclaimed scientificists, are high on their own product while they enjoy the company provided in their circle-jerk.The reason for bumping down to a 4-4.5 rating is because I would've loved more fodder for thought concerning how to balance the concepts of excitement and realism that are interplaying in Gleiser's line of reasoning. Perhaps it's unrealistic on my own part to expect something definitive in terms of epistemology, but even so ended the book wanting just a little bit more."
149,0465031714,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2945070-thom,4,"This book posits knowledge as an island, with the shore representing the edge of our understanding and the ocean beyond as what we do not (or can not) know. Over the years, our island has gotten bigger, but so has the amount of shoreline.The first part does a really excellent job of describing how science has expanded the shores of the island, leading right up to strings and quantum theories. In the second part, the author takes a step back and works from atoms up through quantum mechanics. While this section has fewer pages than the first, the text and ideas are considerably more dense - a thorough reading was required. The third part is very brief, and returns to the idea of the island and whether there are parts of the ocean that we can not know - and whether or not this is a worrisome thing. I believe one could read the first and third sections only to obtain a complete picture.If you are interested in the aims of science and the big questions of the universe, and you aren't put off by decoherence, nonlocality and quantum weirdness, then by all means read this book."
150,0465031714,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5954293-david-dinaburg,3,"There are lots of things to miss about college; if you want a reminder, the volume of listicles covering “Things You’ll Miss From Your Time at College” stretch across the vastness of the internet like a layer of soot in a steampunk novel’s overly detailed opening paragraph. It is hard to know, at the time, that you’ll one day miss not just the freedom or the experiences or the dozen other movie clichés, but the camaraderie: the like-minded focus of hundreds or thousands of open minds trying to puzzle through the same material in the same physical place at the same general time.If making study groups was kind of lame, it was because it is difficult to parse the pressure from the intention—after a lifetime of exam scores defining your scholastic identity—to recognize that learning is fun; cramming for tests sure isn’t, and when do any collegiate kids talk about what they’re learning outside of that context? I would, at thirty-plus years old, love it if my only job was, ostensibly, a huge book club. That is sort of what college is—a book club where everyone is too scared to skip the assignment and your reviews are graded. Maybe I simply think about book reviews too much.It is why, I think, the impetus behind why tech companies tend to call their industrial parks campuses rather than, say, industrial parks. In the same linguistic gymnastics of employing park to downplay the industrial side of the equation, a campus evokes memories of freewheeling debates over the benefits of green grass on shoeless feet, or why all-hour waffle irons were the greatest thing dining hall could offer students. It all puts a scholastic gloss over the garden-wall segregation that distances upper class employees from their service-sector neighbors. C’est la vie.Having a designated forum for discussion while reading The Island of Knowledge: The Limits of Science and the Search for Meaning would have been a boon. Tugging at the frayed edge of Island of Knowledge’s titular “Island of Knowledge” metaphor as it strained against the page came much more naturally to me than internalizing or discussing candidly the material contained therein. The first half passed smoothly enough—the history of natural philosophy and a rather genial overview of the general scientific method—but then we got to Chapter Sixteen. And I hit a wall. I thought it was me, and it still very much may be. I will say that Chapter Sixteen’s title is Can We Test the Multiverse Hypothesis? Wherein We Explore Whether the Multiverse is a Proper Physical Theory or Mere Speculation. Feel free to draw your own conclusion as to why I found myself rereading whole pages multiple times.After a particularly dense section on cosmology, I had a bit of an “Ah ha!” moment:Back to strings. Once you combine them with supersymmetry, the number of extra spatial dimensions is fixed: superstrings can only live in nine spatial dimensions. Five possible string theories have been found, and mathematical physicist Edward Witten from the Institute for Advanced Study has shown that they are all related in a theory with yet another extra dimension called “M-theory.” So if strings are a theory of Nature, six extra dimensions must be invisible to us. How can this be the case? My doctorate thesis and some of my work during my years as a postdoctoral fellow were dedicated to this question, which then was very new. In particular, if we attempt to combine superstring theory with Big Bang cosmology, how to explain that three dimensions grew while the other six remained small. Ah yes, the author is a professor of physics and astronomy; that explains why his chemistry and biology chapters are cogent for a casual audience yet the topics within his passion—theoretical cosmological astronomy—are rife with locked-door terminology and byzantine concepts. I doubt he is in a position to realize that even his most simplified tours require the reader to bring with them prior knowledge if they are to follow him; he has been practicing this for decades. Recognizing how little a lay audience knows at the start of a lecture is a constant dilemma for any expert. So maybe cosmology is simply a more difficult topic, or I am particularly ignorant of it, or the author is talking past me: more likely, it is all three swirled together like a beautifully choreographed ballet in which I am somehow expected to participate.That was how The Island of Knowledge went; there was neat bits nibbling at the edge of my brain, and then they’d always tie back into that overworked metaphor and I would switch to the simpler path of structural criticism rather than contend with the constant deluge of startling facts:As space keeps on stretching, it will carry away most celestial luminaries, the galaxies that are now within telescopic sight. With time, their receding speeds will surpass the speed of light, and a new cosmological horizon will appear, beyond which their light will no longer reach us. Eventually, only our Local Supercluster, the large agglomerate of galaxies including the Milky Way and Andromeda that are bound together by their mutual gravitational attraction, will be visible in the night, albeit much transformed from its current shape. As noted, in a few billion years, the Milky Way and Andromeda galaxies may merge and become one large galaxy. In about four billion years, our Sun will turn into a red giant, and life on Earth will be impossible. (Actually, this will happen much before then, because of instabilities in the solar energy output.) If cosmologists from this very faraway future don’t have access to past observations, they will conclude that they live in a Universe quite different from ours: with no receding galaxies in sight, they won’t ever know of the expanding Universe, or of the Big Bang. Ironically, their cosmology will return to that of a static cosmos, an island universe comprising the galaxies within the Local Supercluster, surrounded by a vast expanse of dark, empty space. Their Island of Knowledge will shrink and eventually disappear altogether, mirroring the growing darkness surrounding it.There is absolutely nothing I can add to the beauty of the preceding paragraph, aside from editing out the last sentence; that metaphor is too prevalent to keep its strength; it is already a hoary chestnut before the book reaches its halfway marker.The point of The Island of Knowledge (the book, not the metaphor)—beyond all of the details you can pick up from the pages—remains clear; science—much like college—isn’t about the end result but about the experience, the journey. It is a dialectic on what we learn about ourselves when we observe enough to discover what we didn’t realize was even a question we should ask:The fundamental discovery from EPR-related experiments is that randomness is an inherent aspect of Nature. When Alice or Bob measures the spin or polarization of their entangled particles they can’t know which result, “up” or “down,” they will get. We don’t have a theory that predicts the outcome of a single quantum measurement. Worse, given that local hidden variables have been ruled out, this theory doesn’t seem to be possible, even in principle. So, if “a glimpse of its true meaning” reflects the realists’ old expectation of complete knowledge of reality, then we are out of luck. Our approach to knowledge needs to be redefined in light of the discoveries of quantum mechanics. There are aspects of reality that are permanently beyond our reach. The Island of Knowledge must exist as an island, surrounded not only by what we don’t know but by the unknowable nature of the quantum realm.There is nothing defeatist about this realization. I can vividly picture every person that reads the first paragraph to conclude that first paragraph thinking, “That was incredibly defeatist.” I certainly did. Which is why it made me laugh to see the next line; I can quite easily conjure up a scenario in my head in which an editor is fighting for some sort of concession on the alleged defeatist tone, only to get the concessionary hand-waving acknowledgement that it may seem defeatist to the reader, but clearly isn’t because the author has decided to beg the question. And no, I did not forget that The Metaphor was in there, but I simply have nothing to say about it at this point. In fact, it is buried in seven of my eight selected excerpts. Not intentionally. It came up, a lot. There are many things to learn from The Island of Knowledge—the meaning of science and the limits of meaning—but how to keep an extended metaphor fresh and interesting through a lengthy non-fiction book isn’t one of them. The shoreline between knowledge and ignorance continues to grow, its rocky expanse bolstered by the broken husks of the now-forgotten vessels drawn in and dashed against its treacherous coast by the illusive siren’s song of true knowledge. Or something."
151,0465031714,http://goodreads.com/user/show/11189571-ben,4,"""The Island of Knowledge"" visits many subjects I find interesting: history of science, cosmology, quantum physics, and a wee bit of information theory at the end. It rarely gets bogged down in details, making it an easily flowing read if you're already familiar with the set of topics at a layman level. What's more, Gleiser's writing style is disciplined, aided not a small amount by his adherence to brief, focused chapters (despite the occasional pompous section that always seems to pop up in books from highly distinguished academic writers).Overall, worth reading if you're interested in a theoretical physicist's brain-dump on where science is going & what problems it's been running into over the last 100 or so years.The rest of this review is just my personal reaction to his arguments:I came away feeling that the book places many dots but not enough connecting lines. The main thesis as I understood it: science is worth pursuing, even as it runs into fundamental limits (the expanding universe vs the speed of light, quantum uncertainty, Godel's uncertainty theorem) which indicate we'll never reach a grand, final truth. No argument from me that science is worth pursuing, but I couldn't grasp exactly why the ""limits of science"" that he cites are so devastating. eg: Quantum mechanics declares that there's an unavoidable fuzziness to some aspects of reality, which is no doubt unnerving. As a result, humanity can never attain the god-like power of seeing the past & predicting the future with absolute certainty that, 200 years ago, seemed so plausible in theory (if nigh impossible in practice). Gleiser does a fine job recounting this unexpected discovery. But is a peculiar limit on our ability to measure the behavior of the universe also a ""limit of science"" in the sense of preventing new, deeper theories? So what if we can't simultaneously measure position & momentum of a particle with absolute accuracy? It's not obvious that this is an insurmountable obstacle to finding a Theory of Everything or other deep discoveries. Yet Gleiser argues (with some hand-waving) that this must be the case. I certainly respect that Gleiser is much more informed than I will ever be on this point, so I wish he had spent somewhat fewer pages rehashing the history of science and more on fleshing out the links for the argument he's putting forward. Still, an excellent read."
152,0465031714,http://goodreads.com/user/show/513697-kim-marshall,5,"This is an extremely clear description of how I (personally) view the limits of Science, mathematics and Human thought.Marcelo Gleiser is an agnostic that believes atheism is ""inconsistent with the scientific method"", as we have no final proof either for or against the existence of a God. On the other hand I would say he is unlikely to feel much pull toward the Judaeo Christian God, seeing this definition as being actually too human, too limited and thus, by definition, fallible.In this work he describes human knowledge as an ever expanding Island of Knowledge and the ocean surrounding this island as ever expanding as we humans continue to enlarge our horizons. He makes an almost unarguable point that these horizons of knowledge do have an unknowable barrier. The speed of light and the limits of time create this barrier by definition (unless of course we can some how find a way around this universal speed limit). This is a fair, and in my mind, accurate description of human limitations and the state of our scientific knowledge as of the publication of this thesis (2014). Some important quotes:""As we probe Nature and master so many of its facts, it is good to remember that the shores of ignorance grow as the Island of Knowledge grows: the ocean of the unknown feeds on our success. It is also good to remember that science only covers part of the Island, that there are many ways of knowing that can and should feed on one another. While the physical and social sciences surely can illuminate many aspects of knowledge, they shouldn't carry the burden of having all the answers. How small a view of the human spirit (it would be) to cloister all that we can achieve in one corner of knowledge! We are multidimensional creatures and search for answers in many, complementary ways. Each serves a purpose, and we need them all."" ""As Arthur C. Clark famously said, Any sufficiently advanced technology is indistinguishable from magic. That the best we can ever do will always amount to a coarse-grained reconstruction of physical reality means that we will never be godlike, just as our purported simulators cannot be. The laws of Nature and the limits of knowledge will make sure that we remain human and fallible."""
153,0465031714,http://goodreads.com/user/show/35348314-joe-stack,4,"I found this book to be challenging, thought provoking, difficult, and rewarding. The most difficult part was the middle portion where the author surveys quantum physics. While the concepts or ideas in this section are difficult to grasp, I think the reader who stays with it gets a better grasp about science's limitations. I liked the author's allegory of knowledge as an island, and how the island's shore grows and shrinks depending on what science reveals. The more we learn, the more we don't know. In the author's words, ""The goal of science is to clarify, to be best of our ability, the way Nature works. Science is not supposed to answer all questions. In fact, this kind of expectation is meaningless, especially when confronted with the nature of knowledge as we have addressed it in this book: ever-exploratory, ever-changing, reflecting so clearly how we approach the world, the kinds of questions we ask and can ask at a given time. The knowledge that we have defines the knowledge that we can have. . . . As knowledge shifts, we ask new kinds of questions that couldn't have been anticipated."" The author's brief history of science brings the reader to the point that there is a limitation to what we can learn, and what remains a mystery (until resolved) is where myths are/may be created because we seek order, we want answers, we want to understand reality, yet reality may not be as firm as we think. As the author states it, ""The very nature of scientific inquiry, always ongoing and always under revision, necessarily implies the notion of a changing understanding of reality."""

[A]s the Island of Knowledge grows, so do the shores of our ignorance -- the boundary between the known and the unknown. ...The more we know, the more exposed we are to our ignorance, and the more we know to ask.""Surprise! Human beings are finite, and we will never know everything there is to know. As our tools of discovery have grown more precise, we have continually reshaped our view of the cosmos, but we still don't really understand the nature of our own consciousness, much less the fundamental nature of reality.Not news to me, but apparently a necessary corrective to contemporary science, which often proceeds on the assumption that there is a discoverable final answer to it all. The pursuit of knowledge can always benefit from a dose of humility.The first part of this book is a quick historical survey of science, which I found interesting. I was tracking with the author until very near the end, where he started worrying over the idea that our reality could be a simulation. Multiverse: okay, perhaps. It's a speculative hypothesis, but it does seem to be speculation that rightly belongs within the realm of science. Proposing an elaborate Matrix-like reality seems more like wild conspiracy theorizing to me.Overall, though, it was a great read. Most stuff about quantum physics goes over my head, but I still enjoy reading about it and listening to an informed observer's musings."
155,0465031714,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3941555-carlos,3,"While I disagree with much of what the author had to say, I have to recognize that the book was well written and the author does not cram his argument down the reader’s throat. Gleiser starts by elucidating all the inner workings of working in the sciences, from the straightforward concept of inherent errors in all measurements to the more abstract concepts of scientific realism or instrumentalism, i.e., whether our theories define “Truth” or are simply tools to increase our observations. While I found his style slightly meandering, switching from the history of science to the philosophic understanding of its theories, it all lead to the crux of the book, whether or not to accept the weirdness of quantum theory. While he acknowledges his own preference and even his personal/spiritual basis for it, he is also honest in fairly presenting the alternatives. Therefore, while I disagreed with wholehearted embrace of the reality-bending implications of quantum theory I was thankful for his equally well-reasoned defense of the position taken by those with whom he disagrees. Similarly, I was pleasantly surprised to find quite a number of amazing explanations for some of the sophisticated concepts of modern physics. Overall, I found the book worth the read if only for the honest conversation that Gleiser seeks to have regarding the limitations of the scientific pursuit."
156,0465031714,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6225702-matt,4,"Sometimes our dependence on science for understanding truth is overly intense. It is important to know the limits of science and to understand that there are questions science cannot answer. In its attempts to explain the origins of the universe, science has moved closer towards becoming the very thing it often emphatically claims not to be, religion. Scientists speculate on the origins of the universe, the meaning of consciousness, and the reality of truth. Hiding behind a mask of science are many would be prophets claiming to know truth.There are somethings in the book that I don't agree with, for example in his discussion of consciousness, Gleiser gets hung up on the idea that consciousness is not made of matter, and almost contradicts his whole premise by assuming that we should be able to detect the influence consciousness has on physical matter without considering that what makes us who we are could be made of matter that we are just not yet able to detect (or influences the physical in a way that we are yet unable to detect). If you assume that consciousness is something immaterial and unknowable or beyond the observable horizon, then you have already closed the door on its discovery. "
157,0465031714,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5988834-silas,4,"I highly enjoyed this book. It did a great job of showing the history of science from before science was a thing, beginning in Ancient Greece until the present, covering a variety of disciplines, from physics to biology to chemistry to astronomy. What this book does excellently is address the way that, though science is a great way of learning more about our world, there will always be things that we do not know. This book addresses many of the problems that I see with science advocacy in social media, because science is simply not capable of telling us everything. This doesn't make science unimportant, but it is important to understand the limits of what it can and cannot do. My only main criticism of the book comes from the section on the idea of our reality as a simulation where the author doesn't seem to have expanded his imagination quite enough for my tastes, assuming that the physics of creating a simulation would have to adhere to the rules of our reality within the simulation.

In this fascinating popularization of the current extent and limits of scientific knowledge and our investigations into the nature of the universe, Gleiser establishes three fields: what-is-known, what-is-yet-to-be- known, and what-is-unknowable. For both scientists and laymen, he urges humility. In our pursuit of accurate analogies for (what we think is) reality, we can know, with a fair degree of certainty, the boundary (or shoreline) between fields one and two. What we cannot distinguish is the boundary between fields two and three, and that realization should keep us both humble and curious. As a Christian, I kept seeing God in that field of the unknowable, but Gleiser will not go there. But then, he is a scientist and I am not (merely a historian of philosophy). But this book should be edifying and enthralling to both people of faith and those of science."

Gleiser's knowledge is impressive, his writing is crisp, and his passion is inspiring. The book weaves between physics and philosophy: looking at what we know, what we know about knowing, and what those two tell us about each other. It's fascinating. Even more interesting is the metaphor captured in the title. The island is what we know; it's substantial and expanding, but it's surrounded by a sea of the unknown. The boundary is a shore of ignorance, which increases with our knowledge. This is a really interesting and productive way to think about knowing. "

In this, it is a philosophical work really exploring what can be known and the work of science. A lot of it is fascinating but a lot of it is still too technical to grasp so that you often just take the authors word for a concept after struggling through an exploration of the concept. It is tiring and often tiresome reading. The final conclusions- that the process of science is an intrinsic human yearning rather than the attainment of definite knowledge seems trite and anticlimactic. "

The book is divided into three parts. First, cosmology; second, quantum physics; and third, mind and matter.The author retells the stories related to the discoveries brought up in the book while often reminds us that our boundary of ignorance has expended because there are more we just realize that we don't know. He also argued that maybe there is no ""ultimate theory"" at all, and maybe the theory of everything might not even exist because we have no proof to claim that we have learnt everything there is to learn.What I've read in this book makes me feel more humble, but not vulnerable, to realize that there is perhaps no final answer or the fundamental truth."
171,0465031714,http://goodreads.com/user/show/26849656-alexis-bauer-kolak,5,"I read a lot of random science books, some based on online recommendations, others that are referenced in a book I enjoyed. This lucky find was on the shelf at my library and looked interesting. It was.As opposed to the usual explanation of a scientific discovery with a little historical context, this is more a walk down the path of scientific exploration, demonstrating how the discoveries supersede, contradict of enhance each other in expanding our ""island of knowledge"", the expanse of what we as humans can comprehend, explain and identify. The central message here is that there will always be areas beyond our comprehension, because our ability to learn is constrained by our abilities as conscious beings (or, in the case of quantum physics, because there sometimes nothing definite, just a probability.) You'd think it would be upsetting, this idea that we can never know everything, but Dr. Glider isn't saying there's not a reason to try; a lot of important knowledge can come out of trying to figure out how to work around these limits. It also means that the ability to imagine different worlds and planes of existence that we can't currently see or support might just mean they're in a place that's beyond our ability to see. I had never thought about how there could be universe beyond ""the universe"", because our ability to measure it would be limited by how far cosmic radiation could have spread since the Big Bang. There's also a nice philosophical interplay at work here. Geisel notes that most science is about the ""how"", not the why. We don't understand why gravity is exists; being able to measure it or predict its effect is different than being able to explain how it works. You can say that gravity is the deformation of space-time by mass, but why does it do that? What made that that law of our universe? This doesn't mean that philosophy doesn't play an important role in science, but science can't necessarily se philosophical issues.I think this book would be accessible to anyone, but having some pre-reading background in physics would be helpful. I highly recommend this.Favorite quote: If the Universe were shaped like a sphere, as Einstein wanted, and if it would collapse on itself in the distant future, observers of the final moments (if they existed, which is hard to imagine) would be able to see the backs of their heads. They would vanish, crushed into nothingness, knowing that the cosmos was, after all, finite. With hope in their hearts (if they had hearts), they would die dreaming of a new cycle of existence, in which the energy they once were would find new ways of coalescing into complex material forms, some of them able to contemplate the meaning of infinity."""
172,0465031714,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1717479-terry,3,The Island of Knowledge is a discussion of the limits of scientific understand and how that interfaces with our search for meaning. I thought this would give way to either idiotic discussions of cosmic holism or quantum consciousness but that isn't the case. The author discusses traditional limitations of our understanding like the speed of light + cosmic expansion and the Indeterminacy Principle but also the fundamental limitations of models.The best I can say is that it wasn't bad and that's it's useful to get the ontology of a working scientist. Eh.
173,0465031714,http://goodreads.com/user/show/31584402-mbogo-j,4,"Science has allowed us to have our heads in the clouds and even beyond to the frontiers of the cosmos. That is a good thing, however we forgot that our feet should be firmly planted on the ground. When you hear respected physicists declaring philosophy to be dead, you know that hubris has kicked in.In come the realists such as Lee Smolin, Marcelo Gleiser et al who have made it their mission to show us that knowledge should be grounded in reality and not esoteric mathematical proofs. Just to use one example from the book, if we factor in that the universe is 13.5B years old and the cosmic expansion coupled by doppler effect is pushing the initial light further away, then some of this light will eventually exceed our perception and we will have hit our cosmic horizon beyond which we cannot know- a singularity. There some things we just cannot know. Not forgetting that whole story about quantum coupling. This book is about epistemic humility and I think Marcelo did a pretty good job making his case. "
174,0465031714,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5917740-nilesh,2,"The book's biggest problem is that its purpose and its content have nothing in common.The author has a clear goal: to describe why the knowledge we will have at any point will never be complete. In a way, the author wants to imply that knowledge will always be like an island on the surface of reality's ocean - it can only see/represent/understand a small part of what is out there. There will always be unanswered questions for science no matter how much we progress. Despite many different attempts, the author's supposed revelation/discovery escapes any masterful proof and turns out to be a mere assertion. There is nothing wrong with it except that for many, this assertion is too trivial and obvious to warrant a conversation as there are almost no individuals from any walk of life who believes in the opposite. For those who find something new in this argument, the struggle while reading the book is to find the connection between most of the content of the book and the purpose.Between the opening and the close where the arguments are centred around the key belief, the author simply discusses whichever topics he is comfortable with. One is not to ask why the coverage is limited to physical sciences (while skipping, for instance, computational or biological sciences) with occasional brushes with early Greek philosophy (religions have no place in the discourse as do economics, sociology, eastern philosophies or even post renaissance western philosophies). The author finds time to reflect on aspects of industrial revolution even though the post-1950 electronic/computing revolution seems to have no relevance. Whatever scientific discoveries/theories are touched upon, the selection appears more based on the availability of popular literature material on them (hence the focus on Newtonian and 1900-1950 eras) than anything else.The book's summaries of key relativity and quantum mechanic topics are too short to help the uninitiated or benefit those already somewhat familiar."
175,0465031714,http://goodreads.com/user/show/8980431-aaron,3," The Island of Knowledge: The Limits of Science and the Search for Meaning  is a dense collection of information focusing on the realm of physics, cosmology, and mathematics. If you are looking for a book that addresses the limits of science in a broader sense (e.g. biology, ecology, or geology), Island of Knowledge  won't quite meet your expectations.With that being said, Gleiser offers an interesting paradigm into how humans have approached the mysteries of the world from the Pre-Socratics who sought to displace mythical explanations of natural phenomena to modern physicists who have developed superstring theories. Gleiser argues that our metaphorical island of knowledge is constantly expanding and retracting according to the information we uncover through better technology or by disproving theories that have come in and out of vogue. Throughout the book, there are many examples of the sensory limitations humans have acquired based on the path of our evolution. For example, there is discussion about the nature of reality and time involving whether the ""present"" can ever truly exist since there is always a slight delay in processing sensory information. I loved contemplating these dilemmas because they reminded me of philosophy and its relationship to science. Overall, Island of Knowledge piqued my curiosity and excitement for humanity's need to explore, hypothesize and measure uncharted territories. At times, I had to reread passages because of the complexity of the material or the physics-oriented theories and jargon that made little sense to me. Nevertheless, this book is ideal for those who have an unending fascination with the universe (or multiverses) and the inherent limitations of the type of information we can obtain about it."
176,0465031714,http://goodreads.com/user/show/854049-b-zsi-claussen,4," This was a beautifully written book tracing the history of mathematical/scientific progress through physics. Gleiser, who is a professor of Physics and Astronomy at Dartmouth College, wrote this book after having attended a conference, Law of Nature: Their Nature and Knowability in May, 2010, in which he gave a talk presenting his ideas on the limits of science and, thus, the limits of knowledge. Using the metaphor of our state of knowledge being an Island (of the Known at any given point of time) in the middle of the ocean of the Unknown. The Island expands and/or contracts continually as our tools of investigation become more advanced and precise, leading to constantly ""new knowledge"" or new paradigms, but also, as this body or Island of Knowledge expands, so does its borders, where its edges meet the sea of the Unknown. Thus, as our knowledge expands, the borders of the unknown also expand, and the questions and area that we don't have answers to expand. This, in fact, is an image of how there is and always will be unknowables, for ""as the Island grows so do the shores of our ignorance, and thus our ability to ask questions we couldn't have anticipated. I found his major thesis to be most compelling (but of course I would, as I have thought about knowledge and its ""knowability"" in much this way for years), but especially apt this metaphor and image. Most interesting to me, however, was how lucidly he presents the changing ideas coming from the earliest days (in Western philosophical and mathematical thought) up to the very latest ideas and competing theories and interpretations of those theories in both classical and quantum physics today. I would recommend this book heartily to anyone who is interested in such questions! "

178,0465031714,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4842860-john,4,"I jumped the gun last night in giving this book the coveted 5-star rating immediately after having finished the read. After a little more reflection I think a 4 or 4.5 would suit it well. The material isn't necessarily anything new. As other reviewers have already pointed out, there is plenty of the standard new-wave physics discussed. This isn't a flaw, necessarily, but worthy of mention for anyone wanting to simply dive into novelties. Being a mere admirer of the such scientific findings rather than an expert in them means I enjoy the help that re-reading such things brings.I very much enjoyed the author's unapologetic retreat from the hubris that passes for scientific thought and rhetoric. It seems as if many in the community, not least of all the non-professional but self-proclaimed scientificists, are high on their own product while they enjoy the company provided in their circle-jerk.The reason for bumping down to a 4-4.5 rating is because I would've loved more fodder for thought concerning how to balance the concepts of excitement and realism that are interplaying in Gleiser's line of reasoning. Perhaps it's unrealistic on my own part to expect something definitive in terms of epistemology, but even so ended the book wanting just a little bit more."
179,0465031714,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2945070-thom,4,"This book posits knowledge as an island, with the shore representing the edge of our understanding and the ocean beyond as what we do not (or can not) know. Over the years, our island has gotten bigger, but so has the amount of shoreline.The first part does a really excellent job of describing how science has expanded the shores of the island, leading right up to strings and quantum theories. In the second part, the author takes a step back and works from atoms up through quantum mechanics. While this section has fewer pages than the first, the text and ideas are considerably more dense - a thorough reading was required. The third part is very brief, and returns to the idea of the island and whether there are parts of the ocean that we can not know - and whether or not this is a worrisome thing. I believe one could read the first and third sections only to obtain a complete picture.If you are interested in the aims of science and the big questions of the universe, and you aren't put off by decoherence, nonlocality and quantum weirdness, then by all means read this book."
180,0465031714,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5954293-david-dinaburg,3,"There are lots of things to miss about college; if you want a reminder, the volume of listicles covering “Things You’ll Miss From Your Time at College” stretch across the vastness of the internet like a layer of soot in a steampunk novel’s overly detailed opening paragraph. It is hard to know, at the time, that you’ll one day miss not just the freedom or the experiences or the dozen other movie clichés, but the camaraderie: the like-minded focus of hundreds or thousands of open minds trying to puzzle through the same material in the same physical place at the same general time.If making study groups was kind of lame, it was because it is difficult to parse the pressure from the intention—after a lifetime of exam scores defining your scholastic identity—to recognize that learning is fun; cramming for tests sure isn’t, and when do any collegiate kids talk about what they’re learning outside of that context? I would, at thirty-plus years old, love it if my only job was, ostensibly, a huge book club. That is sort of what college is—a book club where everyone is too scared to skip the assignment and your reviews are graded. Maybe I simply think about book reviews too much.It is why, I think, the impetus behind why tech companies tend to call their industrial parks campuses rather than, say, industrial parks. In the same linguistic gymnastics of employing park to downplay the industrial side of the equation, a campus evokes memories of freewheeling debates over the benefits of green grass on shoeless feet, or why all-hour waffle irons were the greatest thing dining hall could offer students. It all puts a scholastic gloss over the garden-wall segregation that distances upper class employees from their service-sector neighbors. C’est la vie.Having a designated forum for discussion while reading The Island of Knowledge: The Limits of Science and the Search for Meaning would have been a boon. Tugging at the frayed edge of Island of Knowledge’s titular “Island of Knowledge” metaphor as it strained against the page came much more naturally to me than internalizing or discussing candidly the material contained therein. The first half passed smoothly enough—the history of natural philosophy and a rather genial overview of the general scientific method—but then we got to Chapter Sixteen. And I hit a wall. I thought it was me, and it still very much may be. I will say that Chapter Sixteen’s title is Can We Test the Multiverse Hypothesis? Wherein We Explore Whether the Multiverse is a Proper Physical Theory or Mere Speculation. Feel free to draw your own conclusion as to why I found myself rereading whole pages multiple times.After a particularly dense section on cosmology, I had a bit of an “Ah ha!” moment:Back to strings. Once you combine them with supersymmetry, the number of extra spatial dimensions is fixed: superstrings can only live in nine spatial dimensions. Five possible string theories have been found, and mathematical physicist Edward Witten from the Institute for Advanced Study has shown that they are all related in a theory with yet another extra dimension called “M-theory.” So if strings are a theory of Nature, six extra dimensions must be invisible to us. How can this be the case? My doctorate thesis and some of my work during my years as a postdoctoral fellow were dedicated to this question, which then was very new. In particular, if we attempt to combine superstring theory with Big Bang cosmology, how to explain that three dimensions grew while the other six remained small. Ah yes, the author is a professor of physics and astronomy; that explains why his chemistry and biology chapters are cogent for a casual audience yet the topics within his passion—theoretical cosmological astronomy—are rife with locked-door terminology and byzantine concepts. I doubt he is in a position to realize that even his most simplified tours require the reader to bring with them prior knowledge if they are to follow him; he has been practicing this for decades. Recognizing how little a lay audience knows at the start of a lecture is a constant dilemma for any expert. So maybe cosmology is simply a more difficult topic, or I am particularly ignorant of it, or the author is talking past me: more likely, it is all three swirled together like a beautifully choreographed ballet in which I am somehow expected to participate.That was how The Island of Knowledge went; there was neat bits nibbling at the edge of my brain, and then they’d always tie back into that overworked metaphor and I would switch to the simpler path of structural criticism rather than contend with the constant deluge of startling facts:As space keeps on stretching, it will carry away most celestial luminaries, the galaxies that are now within telescopic sight. With time, their receding speeds will surpass the speed of light, and a new cosmological horizon will appear, beyond which their light will no longer reach us. Eventually, only our Local Supercluster, the large agglomerate of galaxies including the Milky Way and Andromeda that are bound together by their mutual gravitational attraction, will be visible in the night, albeit much transformed from its current shape. As noted, in a few billion years, the Milky Way and Andromeda galaxies may merge and become one large galaxy. In about four billion years, our Sun will turn into a red giant, and life on Earth will be impossible. (Actually, this will happen much before then, because of instabilities in the solar energy output.) If cosmologists from this very faraway future don’t have access to past observations, they will conclude that they live in a Universe quite different from ours: with no receding galaxies in sight, they won’t ever know of the expanding Universe, or of the Big Bang. Ironically, their cosmology will return to that of a static cosmos, an island universe comprising the galaxies within the Local Supercluster, surrounded by a vast expanse of dark, empty space. Their Island of Knowledge will shrink and eventually disappear altogether, mirroring the growing darkness surrounding it.There is absolutely nothing I can add to the beauty of the preceding paragraph, aside from editing out the last sentence; that metaphor is too prevalent to keep its strength; it is already a hoary chestnut before the book reaches its halfway marker.The point of The Island of Knowledge (the book, not the metaphor)—beyond all of the details you can pick up from the pages—remains clear; science—much like college—isn’t about the end result but about the experience, the journey. It is a dialectic on what we learn about ourselves when we observe enough to discover what we didn’t realize was even a question we should ask:The fundamental discovery from EPR-related experiments is that randomness is an inherent aspect of Nature. When Alice or Bob measures the spin or polarization of their entangled particles they can’t know which result, “up” or “down,” they will get. We don’t have a theory that predicts the outcome of a single quantum measurement. Worse, given that local hidden variables have been ruled out, this theory doesn’t seem to be possible, even in principle. So, if “a glimpse of its true meaning” reflects the realists’ old expectation of complete knowledge of reality, then we are out of luck. Our approach to knowledge needs to be redefined in light of the discoveries of quantum mechanics. There are aspects of reality that are permanently beyond our reach. The Island of Knowledge must exist as an island, surrounded not only by what we don’t know but by the unknowable nature of the quantum realm.There is nothing defeatist about this realization. I can vividly picture every person that reads the first paragraph to conclude that first paragraph thinking, “That was incredibly defeatist.” I certainly did. Which is why it made me laugh to see the next line; I can quite easily conjure up a scenario in my head in which an editor is fighting for some sort of concession on the alleged defeatist tone, only to get the concessionary hand-waving acknowledgement that it may seem defeatist to the reader, but clearly isn’t because the author has decided to beg the question. And no, I did not forget that The Metaphor was in there, but I simply have nothing to say about it at this point. In fact, it is buried in seven of my eight selected excerpts. Not intentionally. It came up, a lot. There are many things to learn from The Island of Knowledge—the meaning of science and the limits of meaning—but how to keep an extended metaphor fresh and interesting through a lengthy non-fiction book isn’t one of them. The shoreline between knowledge and ignorance continues to grow, its rocky expanse bolstered by the broken husks of the now-forgotten vessels drawn in and dashed against its treacherous coast by the illusive siren’s song of true knowledge. Or something."
181,0465031714,http://goodreads.com/user/show/11189571-ben,4,"""The Island of Knowledge"" visits many subjects I find interesting: history of science, cosmology, quantum physics, and a wee bit of information theory at the end. It rarely gets bogged down in details, making it an easily flowing read if you're already familiar with the set of topics at a layman level. What's more, Gleiser's writing style is disciplined, aided not a small amount by his adherence to brief, focused chapters (despite the occasional pompous section that always seems to pop up in books from highly distinguished academic writers).Overall, worth reading if you're interested in a theoretical physicist's brain-dump on where science is going & what problems it's been running into over the last 100 or so years.The rest of this review is just my personal reaction to his arguments:I came away feeling that the book places many dots but not enough connecting lines. The main thesis as I understood it: science is worth pursuing, even as it runs into fundamental limits (the expanding universe vs the speed of light, quantum uncertainty, Godel's uncertainty theorem) which indicate we'll never reach a grand, final truth. No argument from me that science is worth pursuing, but I couldn't grasp exactly why the ""limits of science"" that he cites are so devastating. eg: Quantum mechanics declares that there's an unavoidable fuzziness to some aspects of reality, which is no doubt unnerving. As a result, humanity can never attain the god-like power of seeing the past & predicting the future with absolute certainty that, 200 years ago, seemed so plausible in theory (if nigh impossible in practice). Gleiser does a fine job recounting this unexpected discovery. But is a peculiar limit on our ability to measure the behavior of the universe also a ""limit of science"" in the sense of preventing new, deeper theories? So what if we can't simultaneously measure position & momentum of a particle with absolute accuracy? It's not obvious that this is an insurmountable obstacle to finding a Theory of Everything or other deep discoveries. Yet Gleiser argues (with some hand-waving) that this must be the case. I certainly respect that Gleiser is much more informed than I will ever be on this point, so I wish he had spent somewhat fewer pages rehashing the history of science and more on fleshing out the links for the argument he's putting forward. Still, an excellent read."
182,0465031714,http://goodreads.com/user/show/513697-kim-marshall,5,"This is an extremely clear description of how I (personally) view the limits of Science, mathematics and Human thought.Marcelo Gleiser is an agnostic that believes atheism is ""inconsistent with the scientific method"", as we have no final proof either for or against the existence of a God. On the other hand I would say he is unlikely to feel much pull toward the Judaeo Christian God, seeing this definition as being actually too human, too limited and thus, by definition, fallible.In this work he describes human knowledge as an ever expanding Island of Knowledge and the ocean surrounding this island as ever expanding as we humans continue to enlarge our horizons. He makes an almost unarguable point that these horizons of knowledge do have an unknowable barrier. The speed of light and the limits of time create this barrier by definition (unless of course we can some how find a way around this universal speed limit). This is a fair, and in my mind, accurate description of human limitations and the state of our scientific knowledge as of the publication of this thesis (2014). Some important quotes:""As we probe Nature and master so many of its facts, it is good to remember that the shores of ignorance grow as the Island of Knowledge grows: the ocean of the unknown feeds on our success. It is also good to remember that science only covers part of the Island, that there are many ways of knowing that can and should feed on one another. While the physical and social sciences surely can illuminate many aspects of knowledge, they shouldn't carry the burden of having all the answers. How small a view of the human spirit (it would be) to cloister all that we can achieve in one corner of knowledge! We are multidimensional creatures and search for answers in many, complementary ways. Each serves a purpose, and we need them all."" ""As Arthur C. Clark famously said, Any sufficiently advanced technology is indistinguishable from magic. That the best we can ever do will always amount to a coarse-grained reconstruction of physical reality means that we will never be godlike, just as our purported simulators cannot be. The laws of Nature and the limits of knowledge will make sure that we remain human and fallible."""
183,0465031714,http://goodreads.com/user/show/35348314-joe-stack,4,"I found this book to be challenging, thought provoking, difficult, and rewarding. The most difficult part was the middle portion where the author surveys quantum physics. While the concepts or ideas in this section are difficult to grasp, I think the reader who stays with it gets a better grasp about science's limitations. I liked the author's allegory of knowledge as an island, and how the island's shore grows and shrinks depending on what science reveals. The more we learn, the more we don't know. In the author's words, ""The goal of science is to clarify, to be best of our ability, the way Nature works. Science is not supposed to answer all questions. In fact, this kind of expectation is meaningless, especially when confronted with the nature of knowledge as we have addressed it in this book: ever-exploratory, ever-changing, reflecting so clearly how we approach the world, the kinds of questions we ask and can ask at a given time. The knowledge that we have defines the knowledge that we can have. . . . As knowledge shifts, we ask new kinds of questions that couldn't have been anticipated."" The author's brief history of science brings the reader to the point that there is a limitation to what we can learn, and what remains a mystery (until resolved) is where myths are/may be created because we seek order, we want answers, we want to understand reality, yet reality may not be as firm as we think. As the author states it, ""The very nature of scientific inquiry, always ongoing and always under revision, necessarily implies the notion of a changing understanding of reality."""

[A]s the Island of Knowledge grows, so do the shores of our ignorance -- the boundary between the known and the unknown. ...The more we know, the more exposed we are to our ignorance, and the more we know to ask.""Surprise! Human beings are finite, and we will never know everything there is to know. As our tools of discovery have grown more precise, we have continually reshaped our view of the cosmos, but we still don't really understand the nature of our own consciousness, much less the fundamental nature of reality.Not news to me, but apparently a necessary corrective to contemporary science, which often proceeds on the assumption that there is a discoverable final answer to it all. The pursuit of knowledge can always benefit from a dose of humility.The first part of this book is a quick historical survey of science, which I found interesting. I was tracking with the author until very near the end, where he started worrying over the idea that our reality could be a simulation. Multiverse: okay, perhaps. It's a speculative hypothesis, but it does seem to be speculation that rightly belongs within the realm of science. Proposing an elaborate Matrix-like reality seems more like wild conspiracy theorizing to me.Overall, though, it was a great read. Most stuff about quantum physics goes over my head, but I still enjoy reading about it and listening to an informed observer's musings."
185,0465031714,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3941555-carlos,3,"While I disagree with much of what the author had to say, I have to recognize that the book was well written and the author does not cram his argument down the reader’s throat. Gleiser starts by elucidating all the inner workings of working in the sciences, from the straightforward concept of inherent errors in all measurements to the more abstract concepts of scientific realism or instrumentalism, i.e., whether our theories define “Truth” or are simply tools to increase our observations. While I found his style slightly meandering, switching from the history of science to the philosophic understanding of its theories, it all lead to the crux of the book, whether or not to accept the weirdness of quantum theory. While he acknowledges his own preference and even his personal/spiritual basis for it, he is also honest in fairly presenting the alternatives. Therefore, while I disagreed with wholehearted embrace of the reality-bending implications of quantum theory I was thankful for his equally well-reasoned defense of the position taken by those with whom he disagrees. Similarly, I was pleasantly surprised to find quite a number of amazing explanations for some of the sophisticated concepts of modern physics. Overall, I found the book worth the read if only for the honest conversation that Gleiser seeks to have regarding the limitations of the scientific pursuit."
186,0465031714,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6225702-matt,4,"Sometimes our dependence on science for understanding truth is overly intense. It is important to know the limits of science and to understand that there are questions science cannot answer. In its attempts to explain the origins of the universe, science has moved closer towards becoming the very thing it often emphatically claims not to be, religion. Scientists speculate on the origins of the universe, the meaning of consciousness, and the reality of truth. Hiding behind a mask of science are many would be prophets claiming to know truth.There are somethings in the book that I don't agree with, for example in his discussion of consciousness, Gleiser gets hung up on the idea that consciousness is not made of matter, and almost contradicts his whole premise by assuming that we should be able to detect the influence consciousness has on physical matter without considering that what makes us who we are could be made of matter that we are just not yet able to detect (or influences the physical in a way that we are yet unable to detect). If you assume that consciousness is something immaterial and unknowable or beyond the observable horizon, then you have already closed the door on its discovery. "
187,0465031714,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5988834-silas,4,"I highly enjoyed this book. It did a great job of showing the history of science from before science was a thing, beginning in Ancient Greece until the present, covering a variety of disciplines, from physics to biology to chemistry to astronomy. What this book does excellently is address the way that, though science is a great way of learning more about our world, there will always be things that we do not know. This book addresses many of the problems that I see with science advocacy in social media, because science is simply not capable of telling us everything. This doesn't make science unimportant, but it is important to understand the limits of what it can and cannot do. My only main criticism of the book comes from the section on the idea of our reality as a simulation where the author doesn't seem to have expanded his imagination quite enough for my tastes, assuming that the physics of creating a simulation would have to adhere to the rules of our reality within the simulation. Still, this is only a very small part of the book, and if the ideas intrigue you, there are other books more dedicated to that idea."
188,0465031714,http://goodreads.com/user/show/21652446-donn-headley,4,"Not all questions have answers, and that is beneficial to us humans, as this spurs our curiosity to keep searching, keep enquiring, keep reaching. In this fascinating popularization of the current extent and limits of scientific knowledge and our investigations into the nature of the universe, Gleiser establishes three fields: what-is-known, what-is-yet-to-be- known, and what-is-unknowable. For both scientists and laymen, he urges humility. In our pursuit of accurate analogies for (what we think is) reality, we can know, with a fair degree of certainty, the boundary (or shoreline) between fields one and two. What we cannot distinguish is the boundary between fields two and three, and that realization should keep us both humble and curious. As a Christian, I kept seeing God in that field of the unknowable, but Gleiser will not go there. But then, he is a scientist and I am not (merely a historian of philosophy). But this book should be edifying and enthralling to both people of faith and those of science."
189,0465031714,http://goodreads.com/user/show/50004058-michael,4,"The Island of Knowledge has 3 parts: 1 The Origin of the World and the Nature of the Heavens, 2 From Alchemy to the Quantum: The Elusive Nature of Reality, and 3 Mind and Meaning. Gleiser's knowledge is impressive, his writing is crisp, and his passion is inspiring. The book weaves between physics and philosophy: looking at what we know, what we know about knowing, and what those two tell us about each other. It's fascinating. Even more interesting is the metaphor captured in the title. The island is what we know; it's substantial and expanding, but it's surrounded by a sea of the unknown. The boundary is a shore of ignorance, which increases with our knowledge. This is a really interesting and productive way to think about knowing. "
190,0465031714,http://goodreads.com/user/show/80988544-richvt,2,"This book is one of many books attempting to explain modern cosmological theories and connect them to modern life. In this, it is a philosophical work really exploring what can be known and the work of science. A lot of it is fascinating but a lot of it is still too technical to grasp so that you often just take the authors word for a concept after struggling through an exploration of the concept. It is tiring and often tiresome reading. The final conclusions- that the process of science is an intrinsic human yearning rather than the attainment of definite knowledge seems trite and anticlimactic. "
191,0465031714,http://goodreads.com/user/show/812731-kat,3,"Good information and an interesting concept comparing our search for understanding of the nature of the universe to an ever expanding island. However, I didn't feel that the organization of the book helped it much. It seemed to meander from topic to topic, not entirely building on itself. This made it a little hard to follow as an audiobook. At times, it also wanders into highly technical equations as a method of explaining a phenomenon, making it , once again, hard to follow. "

The book is divided into three parts. First, cosmology; second, quantum physics; and third, mind and matter.The author retells the stories related to the discoveries brought up in the book while often reminds us that our boundary of ignorance has expended because there are more we just realize that we don't know. He also argued that maybe there is no ""ultimate theory"" at all, and maybe the theory of everything might not even exist because we have no proof to claim that we have learnt everything there is to learn.What I've read in this book makes me feel more humble, but not vulnerable, to realize that there is perhaps no final answer or the fundamental truth."
201,0465031714,http://goodreads.com/user/show/26849656-alexis-bauer-kolak,5,"I read a lot of random science books, some based on online recommendations, others that are referenced in a book I enjoyed. This lucky find was on the shelf at my library and looked interesting. It was.As opposed to the usual explanation of a scientific discovery with a little historical context, this is more a walk down the path of scientific exploration, demonstrating how the discoveries supersede, contradict of enhance each other in expanding our ""island of knowledge"", the expanse of what we as humans can comprehend, explain and identify. The central message here is that there will always be areas beyond our comprehension, because our ability to learn is constrained by our abilities as conscious beings (or, in the case of quantum physics, because there sometimes nothing definite, just a probability.) You'd think it would be upsetting, this idea that we can never know everything, but Dr. Glider isn't saying there's not a reason to try; a lot of important knowledge can come out of trying to figure out how to work around these limits. It also means that the ability to imagine different worlds and planes of existence that we can't currently see or support might just mean they're in a place that's beyond our ability to see. I had never thought about how there could be universe beyond ""the universe"", because our ability to measure it would be limited by how far cosmic radiation could have spread since the Big Bang. There's also a nice philosophical interplay at work here. Geisel notes that most science is about the ""how"", not the why. We don't understand why gravity is exists; being able to measure it or predict its effect is different than being able to explain how it works. You can say that gravity is the deformation of space-time by mass, but why does it do that? What made that that law of our universe? This doesn't mean that philosophy doesn't play an important role in science, but science can't necessarily se philosophical issues.I think this book would be accessible to anyone, but having some pre-reading background in physics would be helpful. I highly recommend this.Favorite quote: If the Universe were shaped like a sphere, as Einstein wanted, and if it would collapse on itself in the distant future, observers of the final moments (if they existed, which is hard to imagine) would be able to see the backs of their heads. They would vanish, crushed into nothingness, knowing that the cosmos was, after all, finite. With hope in their hearts (if they had hearts), they would die dreaming of a new cycle of existence, in which the energy they once were would find new ways of coalescing into complex material forms, some of them able to contemplate the meaning of infinity."""
202,0465031714,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1717479-terry,3,The Island of Knowledge is a discussion of the limits of scientific understand and how that interfaces with our search for meaning. I thought this would give way to either idiotic discussions of cosmic holism or quantum consciousness but that isn't the case. The author discusses traditional limitations of our understanding like the speed of light + cosmic expansion and the Indeterminacy Principle but also the fundamental limitations of models.The best I can say is that it wasn't bad and that's it's useful to get the ontology of a working scientist. Eh.
203,0465031714,http://goodreads.com/user/show/31584402-mbogo-j,4,"Science has allowed us to have our heads in the clouds and even beyond to the frontiers of the cosmos. That is a good thing, however we forgot that our feet should be firmly planted on the ground. When you hear respected physicists declaring philosophy to be dead, you know that hubris has kicked in.In come the realists such as Lee Smolin, Marcelo Gleiser et al who have made it their mission to show us that knowledge should be grounded in reality and not esoteric mathematical proofs. Just to use one example from the book, if we factor in that the universe is 13.5B years old and the cosmic expansion coupled by doppler effect is pushing the initial light further away, then some of this light will eventually exceed our perception and we will have hit our cosmic horizon beyond which we cannot know- a singularity. There some things we just cannot know. Not forgetting that whole story about quantum coupling. This book is about epistemic humility and I think Marcelo did a pretty good job making his case. "
204,0465031714,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5917740-nilesh,2,"The book's biggest problem is that its purpose and its content have nothing in common.The author has a clear goal: to describe why the knowledge we will have at any point will never be complete. In a way, the author wants to imply that knowledge will always be like an island on the surface of reality's ocean - it can only see/represent/understand a small part of what is out there. There will always be unanswered questions for science no matter how much we progress. Despite many different attempts, the author's supposed revelation/discovery escapes any masterful proof and turns out to be a mere assertion. There is nothing wrong with it except that for many, this assertion is too trivial and obvious to warrant a conversation as there are almost no individuals from any walk of life who believes in the opposite. For those who find something new in this argument, the struggle while reading the book is to find the connection between most of the content of the book and the purpose.Between the opening and the close where the arguments are centred around the key belief, the author simply discusses whichever topics he is comfortable with. One is not to ask why the coverage is limited to physical sciences (while skipping, for instance, computational or biological sciences) with occasional brushes with early Greek philosophy (religions have no place in the discourse as do economics, sociology, eastern philosophies or even post renaissance western philosophies). The author finds time to reflect on aspects of industrial revolution even though the post-1950 electronic/computing revolution seems to have no relevance. Whatever scientific discoveries/theories are touched upon, the selection appears more based on the availability of popular literature material on them (hence the focus on Newtonian and 1900-1950 eras) than anything else.The book's summaries of key relativity and quantum mechanic topics are too short to help the uninitiated or benefit those already somewhat familiar."
205,0465031714,http://goodreads.com/user/show/8980431-aaron,3," The Island of Knowledge: The Limits of Science and the Search for Meaning  is a dense collection of information focusing on the realm of physics, cosmology, and mathematics. If you are looking for a book that addresses the limits of science in a broader sense (e.g. biology, ecology, or geology), Island of Knowledge  won't quite meet your expectations.With that being said, Gleiser offers an interesting paradigm into how humans have approached the mysteries of the world from the Pre-Socratics who sought to displace mythical explanations of natural phenomena to modern physicists who have developed superstring theories. Gleiser argues that our metaphorical island of knowledge is constantly expanding and retracting according to the information we uncover through better technology or by disproving theories that have come in and out of vogue. Throughout the book, there are many examples of the sensory limitations humans have acquired based on the path of our evolution. For example, there is discussion about the nature of reality and time involving whether the ""present"" can ever truly exist since there is always a slight delay in processing sensory information. I loved contemplating these dilemmas because they reminded me of philosophy and its relationship to science. Overall, Island of Knowledge piqued my curiosity and excitement for humanity's need to explore, hypothesize and measure uncharted territories. At times, I had to reread passages because of the complexity of the material or the physics-oriented theories and jargon that made little sense to me. Nevertheless, this book is ideal for those who have an unending fascination with the universe (or multiverses) and the inherent limitations of the type of information we can obtain about it."
206,0465031714,http://goodreads.com/user/show/854049-b-zsi-claussen,4," This was a beautifully written book tracing the history of mathematical/scientific progress through physics. Gleiser, who is a professor of Physics and Astronomy at Dartmouth College, wrote this book after having attended a conference, Law of Nature: Their Nature and Knowability in May, 2010, in which he gave a talk presenting his ideas on the limits of science and, thus, the limits of knowledge. Using the metaphor of our state of knowledge being an Island (of the Known at any given point of time) in the middle of the ocean of the Unknown. The Island expands and/or contracts continually as our tools of investigation become more advanced and precise, leading to constantly ""new knowledge"" or new paradigms, but also, as this body or Island of Knowledge expands, so does its borders, where its edges meet the sea of the Unknown. Thus, as our knowledge expands, the borders of the unknown also expand, and the questions and area that we don't have answers to expand. This, in fact, is an image of how there is and always will be unknowables, for ""as the Island grows so do the shores of our ignorance, and thus our ability to ask questions we couldn't have anticipated. I found his major thesis to be most compelling (but of course I would, as I have thought about knowledge and its ""knowability"" in much this way for years), but especially apt this metaphor and image. Most interesting to me, however, was how lucidly he presents the changing ideas coming from the earliest days (in Western philosophical and mathematical thought) up to the very latest ideas and competing theories and interpretations of those theories in both classical and quantum physics today. I would recommend this book heartily to anyone who is interested in such questions! "

208,0465031714,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4842860-john,4,"I jumped the gun last night in giving this book the coveted 5-star rating immediately after having finished the read. After a little more reflection I think a 4 or 4.5 would suit it well. The material isn't necessarily anything new. As other reviewers have already pointed out, there is plenty of the standard new-wave physics discussed. This isn't a flaw, necessarily, but worthy of mention for anyone wanting to simply dive into novelties. Being a mere admirer of the such scientific findings rather than an expert in them means I enjoy the help that re-reading such things brings.I very much enjoyed the author's unapologetic retreat from the hubris that passes for scientific thought and rhetoric. It seems as if many in the community, not least of all the non-professional but self-proclaimed scientificists, are high on their own product while they enjoy the company provided in their circle-jerk.The reason for bumping down to a 4-4.5 rating is because I would've loved more fodder for thought concerning how to balance the concepts of excitement and realism that are interplaying in Gleiser's line of reasoning. Perhaps it's unrealistic on my own part to expect something definitive in terms of epistemology, but even so ended the book wanting just a little bit more."
209,0465031714,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2945070-thom,4,"This book posits knowledge as an island, with the shore representing the edge of our understanding and the ocean beyond as what we do not (or can not) know. Over the years, our island has gotten bigger, but so has the amount of shoreline.The first part does a really excellent job of describing how science has expanded the shores of the island, leading right up to strings and quantum theories. In the second part, the author takes a step back and works from atoms up through quantum mechanics. While this section has fewer pages than the first, the text and ideas are considerably more dense - a thorough reading was required. The third part is very brief, and returns to the idea of the island and whether there are parts of the ocean that we can not know - and whether or not this is a worrisome thing. I believe one could read the first and third sections only to obtain a complete picture.If you are interested in the aims of science and the big questions of the universe, and you aren't put off by decoherence, nonlocality and quantum weirdness, then by all means read this book."
210,0465031714,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5954293-david-dinaburg,3,"There are lots of things to miss about college; if you want a reminder, the volume of listicles covering “Things You’ll Miss From Your Time at College” stretch across the vastness of the internet like a layer of soot in a steampunk novel’s overly detailed opening paragraph. It is hard to know, at the time, that you’ll one day miss not just the freedom or the experiences or the dozen other movie clichés, but the camaraderie: the like-minded focus of hundreds or thousands of open minds trying to puzzle through the same material in the same physical place at the same general time.If making study groups was kind of lame, it was because it is difficult to parse the pressure from the intention—after a lifetime of exam scores defining your scholastic identity—to recognize that learning is fun; cramming for tests sure isn’t, and when do any collegiate kids talk about what they’re learning outside of that context? I would, at thirty-plus years old, love it if my only job was, ostensibly, a huge book club. That is sort of what college is—a book club where everyone is too scared to skip the assignment and your reviews are graded. Maybe I simply think about book reviews too much.It is why, I think, the impetus behind why tech companies tend to call their industrial parks campuses rather than, say, industrial parks. In the same linguistic gymnastics of employing park to downplay the industrial side of the equation, a campus evokes memories of freewheeling debates over the benefits of green grass on shoeless feet, or why all-hour waffle irons were the greatest thing dining hall could offer students. It all puts a scholastic gloss over the garden-wall segregation that distances upper class employees from their service-sector neighbors. C’est la vie.Having a designated forum for discussion while reading The Island of Knowledge: The Limits of Science and the Search for Meaning would have been a boon. Tugging at the frayed edge of Island of Knowledge’s titular “Island of Knowledge” metaphor as it strained against the page came much more naturally to me than internalizing or discussing candidly the material contained therein. The first half passed smoothly enough—the history of natural philosophy and a rather genial overview of the general scientific method—but then we got to Chapter Sixteen. And I hit a wall. I thought it was me, and it still very much may be. I will say that Chapter Sixteen’s title is Can We Test the Multiverse Hypothesis? Wherein We Explore Whether the Multiverse is a Proper Physical Theory or Mere Speculation. Feel free to draw your own conclusion as to why I found myself rereading whole pages multiple times.After a particularly dense section on cosmology, I had a bit of an “Ah ha!” moment:Back to strings. Once you combine them with supersymmetry, the number of extra spatial dimensions is fixed: superstrings can only live in nine spatial dimensions. Five possible string theories have been found, and mathematical physicist Edward Witten from the Institute for Advanced Study has shown that they are all related in a theory with yet another extra dimension called “M-theory.” So if strings are a theory of Nature, six extra dimensions must be invisible to us. How can this be the case? My doctorate thesis and some of my work during my years as a postdoctoral fellow were dedicated to this question, which then was very new. In particular, if we attempt to combine superstring theory with Big Bang cosmology, how to explain that three dimensions grew while the other six remained small. Ah yes, the author is a professor of physics and astronomy; that explains why his chemistry and biology chapters are cogent for a casual audience yet the topics within his passion—theoretical cosmological astronomy—are rife with locked-door terminology and byzantine concepts. I doubt he is in a position to realize that even his most simplified tours require the reader to bring with them prior knowledge if they are to follow him; he has been practicing this for decades. Recognizing how little a lay audience knows at the start of a lecture is a constant dilemma for any expert. So maybe cosmology is simply a more difficult topic, or I am particularly ignorant of it, or the author is talking past me: more likely, it is all three swirled together like a beautifully choreographed ballet in which I am somehow expected to participate.That was how The Island of Knowledge went; there was neat bits nibbling at the edge of my brain, and then they’d always tie back into that overworked metaphor and I would switch to the simpler path of structural criticism rather than contend with the constant deluge of startling facts:As space keeps on stretching, it will carry away most celestial luminaries, the galaxies that are now within telescopic sight. With time, their receding speeds will surpass the speed of light, and a new cosmological horizon will appear, beyond which their light will no longer reach us. Eventually, only our Local Supercluster, the large agglomerate of galaxies including the Milky Way and Andromeda that are bound together by their mutual gravitational attraction, will be visible in the night, albeit much transformed from its current shape. As noted, in a few billion years, the Milky Way and Andromeda galaxies may merge and become one large galaxy. In about four billion years, our Sun will turn into a red giant, and life on Earth will be impossible. (Actually, this will happen much before then, because of instabilities in the solar energy output.) If cosmologists from this very faraway future don’t have access to past observations, they will conclude that they live in a Universe quite different from ours: with no receding galaxies in sight, they won’t ever know of the expanding Universe, or of the Big Bang. Ironically, their cosmology will return to that of a static cosmos, an island universe comprising the galaxies within the Local Supercluster, surrounded by a vast expanse of dark, empty space. Their Island of Knowledge will shrink and eventually disappear altogether, mirroring the growing darkness surrounding it.There is absolutely nothing I can add to the beauty of the preceding paragraph, aside from editing out the last sentence; that metaphor is too prevalent to keep its strength; it is already a hoary chestnut before the book reaches its halfway marker.The point of The Island of Knowledge (the book, not the metaphor)—beyond all of the details you can pick up from the pages—remains clear; science—much like college—isn’t about the end result but about the experience, the journey. It is a dialectic on what we learn about ourselves when we observe enough to discover what we didn’t realize was even a question we should ask:The fundamental discovery from EPR-related experiments is that randomness is an inherent aspect of Nature. When Alice or Bob measures the spin or polarization of their entangled particles they can’t know which result, “up” or “down,” they will get. We don’t have a theory that predicts the outcome of a single quantum measurement. Worse, given that local hidden variables have been ruled out, this theory doesn’t seem to be possible, even in principle. So, if “a glimpse of its true meaning” reflects the realists’ old expectation of complete knowledge of reality, then we are out of luck. Our approach to knowledge needs to be redefined in light of the discoveries of quantum mechanics. There are aspects of reality that are permanently beyond our reach. The Island of Knowledge must exist as an island, surrounded not only by what we don’t know but by the unknowable nature of the quantum realm.There is nothing defeatist about this realization. I can vividly picture every person that reads the first paragraph to conclude that first paragraph thinking, “That was incredibly defeatist.” I certainly did. Which is why it made me laugh to see the next line; I can quite easily conjure up a scenario in my head in which an editor is fighting for some sort of concession on the alleged defeatist tone, only to get the concessionary hand-waving acknowledgement that it may seem defeatist to the reader, but clearly isn’t because the author has decided to beg the question. And no, I did not forget that The Metaphor was in there, but I simply have nothing to say about it at this point. In fact, it is buried in seven of my eight selected excerpts. Not intentionally. It came up, a lot. There are many things to learn from The Island of Knowledge—the meaning of science and the limits of meaning—but how to keep an extended metaphor fresh and interesting through a lengthy non-fiction book isn’t one of them. The shoreline between knowledge and ignorance continues to grow, its rocky expanse bolstered by the broken husks of the now-forgotten vessels drawn in and dashed against its treacherous coast by the illusive siren’s song of true knowledge. Or something."
211,0465031714,http://goodreads.com/user/show/11189571-ben,4,"""The Island of Knowledge"" visits many subjects I find interesting: history of science, cosmology, quantum physics, and a wee bit of information theory at the end. It rarely gets bogged down in details, making it an easily flowing read if you're already familiar with the set of topics at a layman level. What's more, Gleiser's writing style is disciplined, aided not a small amount by his adherence to brief, focused chapters (despite the occasional pompous section that always seems to pop up in books from highly distinguished academic writers).Overall, worth reading if you're interested in a theoretical physicist's brain-dump on where science is going & what problems it's been running into over the last 100 or so years.The rest of this review is just my personal reaction to his arguments:I came away feeling that the book places many dots but not enough connecting lines. The main thesis as I understood it: science is worth pursuing, even as it runs into fundamental limits (the expanding universe vs the speed of light, quantum uncertainty, Godel's uncertainty theorem) which indicate we'll never reach a grand, final truth. No argument from me that science is worth pursuing, but I couldn't grasp exactly why the ""limits of science"" that he cites are so devastating. eg: Quantum mechanics declares that there's an unavoidable fuzziness to some aspects of reality, which is no doubt unnerving. As a result, humanity can never attain the god-like power of seeing the past & predicting the future with absolute certainty that, 200 years ago, seemed so plausible in theory (if nigh impossible in practice). Gleiser does a fine job recounting this unexpected discovery. But is a peculiar limit on our ability to measure the behavior of the universe also a ""limit of science"" in the sense of preventing new, deeper theories? So what if we can't simultaneously measure position & momentum of a particle with absolute accuracy? It's not obvious that this is an insurmountable obstacle to finding a Theory of Everything or other deep discoveries. Yet Gleiser argues (with some hand-waving) that this must be the case. I certainly respect that Gleiser is much more informed than I will ever be on this point, so I wish he had spent somewhat fewer pages rehashing the history of science and more on fleshing out the links for the argument he's putting forward. Still, an excellent read."
212,0465031714,http://goodreads.com/user/show/513697-kim-marshall,5,"This is an extremely clear description of how I (personally) view the limits of Science, mathematics and Human thought.Marcelo Gleiser is an agnostic that believes atheism is ""inconsistent with the scientific method"", as we have no final proof either for or against the existence of a God. On the other hand I would say he is unlikely to feel much pull toward the Judaeo Christian God, seeing this definition as being actually too human, too limited and thus, by definition, fallible.In this work he describes human knowledge as an ever expanding Island of Knowledge and the ocean surrounding this island as ever expanding as we humans continue to enlarge our horizons. He makes an almost unarguable point that these horizons of knowledge do have an unknowable barrier. The speed of light and the limits of time create this barrier by definition (unless of course we can some how find a way around this universal speed limit). This is a fair, and in my mind, accurate description of human limitations and the state of our scientific knowledge as of the publication of this thesis (2014). Some important quotes:""As we probe Nature and master so many of its facts, it is good to remember that the shores of ignorance grow as the Island of Knowledge grows: the ocean of the unknown feeds on our success. It is also good to remember that science only covers part of the Island, that there are many ways of knowing that can and should feed on one another. While the physical and social sciences surely can illuminate many aspects of knowledge, they shouldn't carry the burden of having all the answers. How small a view of the human spirit (it would be) to cloister all that we can achieve in one corner of knowledge! We are multidimensional creatures and search for answers in many, complementary ways. Each serves a purpose, and we need them all."" ""As Arthur C. Clark famously said, Any sufficiently advanced technology is indistinguishable from magic. That the best we can ever do will always amount to a coarse-grained reconstruction of physical reality means that we will never be godlike, just as our purported simulators cannot be. The laws of Nature and the limits of knowledge will make sure that we remain human and fallible."""
213,0465031714,http://goodreads.com/user/show/35348314-joe-stack,4,"I found this book to be challenging, thought provoking, difficult, and rewarding. The most difficult part was the middle portion where the author surveys quantum physics. While the concepts or ideas in this section are difficult to grasp, I think the reader who stays with it gets a better grasp about science's limitations. I liked the author's allegory of knowledge as an island, and how the island's shore grows and shrinks depending on what science reveals. The more we learn, the more we don't know. In the author's words, ""The goal of science is to clarify, to be best of our ability, the way Nature works. Science is not supposed to answer all questions. In fact, this kind of expectation is meaningless, especially when confronted with the nature of knowledge as we have addressed it in this book: ever-exploratory, ever-changing, reflecting so clearly how we approach the world, the kinds of questions we ask and can ask at a given time. The knowledge that we have defines the knowledge that we can have. . . . As knowledge shifts, we ask new kinds of questions that couldn't have been anticipated."" The author's brief history of science brings the reader to the point that there is a limitation to what we can learn, and what remains a mystery (until resolved) is where myths are/may be created because we seek order, we want answers, we want to understand reality, yet reality may not be as firm as we think. As the author states it, ""The very nature of scientific inquiry, always ongoing and always under revision, necessarily implies the notion of a changing understanding of reality."""
214,0465031714,http://goodreads.com/user/show/748832-susannah,4,"... [A]s the Island of Knowledge grows, so do the shores of our ignorance -- the boundary between the known and the unknown. ...The more we know, the more exposed we are to our ignorance, and the more we know to ask.""Surprise! Human beings are finite, and we will never know everything there is to know. As our tools of discovery have grown more precise, we have continually reshaped our view of the cosmos, but we still don't really understand the nature of our own consciousness, much less the fundamental nature of reality.Not news to me, but apparently a necessary corrective to contemporary science, which often proceeds on the assumption that there is a discoverable final answer to it all. The pursuit of knowledge can always benefit from a dose of humility.The first part of this book is a quick historical survey of science, which I found interesting. I was tracking with the author until very near the end, where he started worrying over the idea that our reality could be a simulation. Multiverse: okay, perhaps. It's a speculative hypothesis, but it does seem to be speculation that rightly belongs within the realm of science. Proposing an elaborate Matrix-like reality seems more like wild conspiracy theorizing to me.Overall, though, it was a great read. Most stuff about quantum physics goes over my head, but I still enjoy reading about it and listening to an informed observer's musings."
215,0465031714,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3941555-carlos,3,"While I disagree with much of what the author had to say, I have to recognize that the book was well written and the author does not cram his argument down the reader’s throat. Gleiser starts by elucidating all the inner workings of working in the sciences, from the straightforward concept of inherent errors in all measurements to the more abstract concepts of scientific realism or instrumentalism, i.e., whether our theories define “Truth” or are simply tools to increase our observations. While I found his style slightly meandering, switching from the history of science to the philosophic understanding of its theories, it all lead to the crux of the book, whether or not to accept the weirdness of quantum theory. While he acknowledges his own preference and even his personal/spiritual basis for it, he is also honest in fairly presenting the alternatives. Therefore, while I disagreed with wholehearted embrace of the reality-bending implications of quantum theory I was thankful for his equally well-reasoned defense of the position taken by those with whom he disagrees. Similarly, I was pleasantly surprised to find quite a number of amazing explanations for some of the sophisticated concepts of modern physics. Overall, I found the book worth the read if only for the honest conversation that Gleiser seeks to have regarding the limitations of the scientific pursuit."
216,0465031714,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6225702-matt,4,"Sometimes our dependence on science for understanding truth is overly intense. It is important to know the limits of science and to understand that there are questions science cannot answer. In its attempts to explain the origins of the universe, science has moved closer towards becoming the very thing it often emphatically claims not to be, religion. Scientists speculate on the origins of the universe, the meaning of consciousness, and the reality of truth. Hiding behind a mask of science are many would be prophets claiming to know truth.There are somethings in the book that I don't agree with, for example in his discussion of consciousness, Gleiser gets hung up on the idea that consciousness is not made of matter, and almost contradicts his whole premise by assuming that we should be able to detect the influence consciousness has on physical matter without considering that what makes us who we are could be made of matter that we are just not yet able to detect (or influences the physical in a way that we are yet unable to detect). If you assume that consciousness is something immaterial and unknowable or beyond the observable horizon, then you have already closed the door on its discovery. "
217,0465031714,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5988834-silas,4,"I highly enjoyed this book. It did a great job of showing the history of science from before science was a thing, beginning in Ancient Greece until the present, covering a variety of disciplines, from physics to biology to chemistry to astronomy. What this book does excellently is address the way that, though science is a great way of learning more about our world, there will always be things that we do not know. This book addresses many of the problems that I see with science advocacy in social media, because science is simply not capable of telling us everything. This doesn't make science unimportant, but it is important to understand the limits of what it can and cannot do. My only main criticism of the book comes from the section on the idea of our reality as a simulation where the author doesn't seem to have expanded his imagination quite enough for my tastes, assuming that the physics of creating a simulation would have to adhere to the rules of our reality within the simulation. Still, this is only a very small part of the book, and if the ideas intrigue you, there are other books more dedicated to that idea."
218,0465031714,http://goodreads.com/user/show/21652446-donn-headley,4,"Not all questions have answers, and that is beneficial to us humans, as this spurs our curiosity to keep searching, keep enquiring, keep reaching. In this fascinating popularization of the current extent and limits of scientific knowledge and our investigations into the nature of the universe, Gleiser establishes three fields: what-is-known, what-is-yet-to-be- known, and what-is-unknowable. For both scientists and laymen, he urges humility. In our pursuit of accurate analogies for (what we think is) reality, we can know, with a fair degree of certainty, the boundary (or shoreline) between fields one and two. What we cannot distinguish is the boundary between fields two and three, and that realization should keep us both humble and curious. As a Christian, I kept seeing God in that field of the unknowable, but Gleiser will not go there. But then, he is a scientist and I am not (merely a historian of philosophy). But this book should be edifying and enthralling to both people of faith and those of science."

Gleiser's knowledge is impressive, his writing is crisp, and his passion is inspiring. The book weaves between physics and philosophy: looking at what we know, what we know about knowing, and what those two tell us about each other. It's fascinating. Even more interesting is the metaphor captured in the title. The island is what we know; it's substantial and expanding, but it's surrounded by a sea of the unknown. The boundary is a shore of ignorance, which increases with our knowledge. This is a really interesting and productive way to think about knowing. "
220,0465031714,http://goodreads.com/user/show/80988544-richvt,2,"This book is one of many books attempting to explain modern cosmological theories and connect them to modern life. In this, it is a philosophical work really exploring what can be known and the work of science. A lot of it is fascinating but a lot of it is still too technical to grasp so that you often just take the authors word for a concept after struggling through an exploration of the concept. It is tiring and often tiresome reading. The final conclusions- that the process of science is an intrinsic human yearning rather than the attainment of definite knowledge seems trite and anticlimactic. "

The book is divided into three parts. First, cosmology; second, quantum physics; and third, mind and matter.The author retells the stories related to the discoveries brought up in the book while often reminds us that our boundary of ignorance has expended because there are more we just realize that we don't know. He also argued that maybe there is no ""ultimate theory"" at all, and maybe the theory of everything might not even exist because we have no proof to claim that we have learnt everything there is to learn.What I've read in this book makes me feel more humble, but not vulnerable, to realize that there is perhaps no final answer or the fundamental truth."
231,0465031714,http://goodreads.com/user/show/26849656-alexis-bauer-kolak,5,"I read a lot of random science books, some based on online recommendations, others that are referenced in a book I enjoyed. This lucky find was on the shelf at my library and looked interesting. It was.As opposed to the usual explanation of a scientific discovery with a little historical context, this is more a walk down the path of scientific exploration, demonstrating how the discoveries supersede, contradict of enhance each other in expanding our ""island of knowledge"", the expanse of what we as humans can comprehend, explain and identify. The central message here is that there will always be areas beyond our comprehension, because our ability to learn is constrained by our abilities as conscious beings (or, in the case of quantum physics, because there sometimes nothing definite, just a probability.) You'd think it would be upsetting, this idea that we can never know everything, but Dr. Glider isn't saying there's not a reason to try; a lot of important knowledge can come out of trying to figure out how to work around these limits. It also means that the ability to imagine different worlds and planes of existence that we can't currently see or support might just mean they're in a place that's beyond our ability to see. I had never thought about how there could be universe beyond ""the universe"", because our ability to measure it would be limited by how far cosmic radiation could have spread since the Big Bang. There's also a nice philosophical interplay at work here. Geisel notes that most science is about the ""how"", not the why. We don't understand why gravity is exists; being able to measure it or predict its effect is different than being able to explain how it works. You can say that gravity is the deformation of space-time by mass, but why does it do that? What made that that law of our universe? This doesn't mean that philosophy doesn't play an important role in science, but science can't necessarily se philosophical issues.I think this book would be accessible to anyone, but having some pre-reading background in physics would be helpful. I highly recommend this.Favorite quote: If the Universe were shaped like a sphere, as Einstein wanted, and if it would collapse on itself in the distant future, observers of the final moments (if they existed, which is hard to imagine) would be able to see the backs of their heads. They would vanish, crushed into nothingness, knowing that the cosmos was, after all, finite. With hope in their hearts (if they had hearts), they would die dreaming of a new cycle of existence, in which the energy they once were would find new ways of coalescing into complex material forms, some of them able to contemplate the meaning of infinity."""
232,0465031714,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1717479-terry,3,The Island of Knowledge is a discussion of the limits of scientific understand and how that interfaces with our search for meaning. I thought this would give way to either idiotic discussions of cosmic holism or quantum consciousness but that isn't the case. The author discusses traditional limitations of our understanding like the speed of light + cosmic expansion and the Indeterminacy Principle but also the fundamental limitations of models.The best I can say is that it wasn't bad and that's it's useful to get the ontology of a working scientist. Eh.
233,0465031714,http://goodreads.com/user/show/31584402-mbogo-j,4,"Science has allowed us to have our heads in the clouds and even beyond to the frontiers of the cosmos. That is a good thing, however we forgot that our feet should be firmly planted on the ground. When you hear respected physicists declaring philosophy to be dead, you know that hubris has kicked in.In come the realists such as Lee Smolin, Marcelo Gleiser et al who have made it their mission to show us that knowledge should be grounded in reality and not esoteric mathematical proofs. Just to use one example from the book, if we factor in that the universe is 13.5B years old and the cosmic expansion coupled by doppler effect is pushing the initial light further away, then some of this light will eventually exceed our perception and we will have hit our cosmic horizon beyond which we cannot know- a singularity. There some things we just cannot know. Not forgetting that whole story about quantum coupling. This book is about epistemic humility and I think Marcelo did a pretty good job making his case. "
234,0465031714,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5917740-nilesh,2,"The book's biggest problem is that its purpose and its content have nothing in common.The author has a clear goal: to describe why the knowledge we will have at any point will never be complete. In a way, the author wants to imply that knowledge will always be like an island on the surface of reality's ocean - it can only see/represent/understand a small part of what is out there. There will always be unanswered questions for science no matter how much we progress. Despite many different attempts, the author's supposed revelation/discovery escapes any masterful proof and turns out to be a mere assertion. There is nothing wrong with it except that for many, this assertion is too trivial and obvious to warrant a conversation as there are almost no individuals from any walk of life who believes in the opposite. For those who find something new in this argument, the struggle while reading the book is to find the connection between most of the content of the book and the purpose.Between the opening and the close where the arguments are centred around the key belief, the author simply discusses whichever topics he is comfortable with. One is not to ask why the coverage is limited to physical sciences (while skipping, for instance, computational or biological sciences) with occasional brushes with early Greek philosophy (religions have no place in the discourse as do economics, sociology, eastern philosophies or even post renaissance western philosophies). The author finds time to reflect on aspects of industrial revolution even though the post-1950 electronic/computing revolution seems to have no relevance. Whatever scientific discoveries/theories are touched upon, the selection appears more based on the availability of popular literature material on them (hence the focus on Newtonian and 1900-1950 eras) than anything else.The book's summaries of key relativity and quantum mechanic topics are too short to help the uninitiated or benefit those already somewhat familiar."
235,0465031714,http://goodreads.com/user/show/8980431-aaron,3," The Island of Knowledge: The Limits of Science and the Search for Meaning  is a dense collection of information focusing on the realm of physics, cosmology, and mathematics. If you are looking for a book that addresses the limits of science in a broader sense (e.g. biology, ecology, or geology), Island of Knowledge  won't quite meet your expectations.With that being said, Gleiser offers an interesting paradigm into how humans have approached the mysteries of the world from the Pre-Socratics who sought to displace mythical explanations of natural phenomena to modern physicists who have developed superstring theories. Gleiser argues that our metaphorical island of knowledge is constantly expanding and retracting according to the information we uncover through better technology or by disproving theories that have come in and out of vogue. Throughout the book, there are many examples of the sensory limitations humans have acquired based on the path of our evolution. For example, there is discussion about the nature of reality and time involving whether the ""present"" can ever truly exist since there is always a slight delay in processing sensory information. I loved contemplating these dilemmas because they reminded me of philosophy and its relationship to science. Overall, Island of Knowledge piqued my curiosity and excitement for humanity's need to explore, hypothesize and measure uncharted territories. At times, I had to reread passages because of the complexity of the material or the physics-oriented theories and jargon that made little sense to me. Nevertheless, this book is ideal for those who have an unending fascination with the universe (or multiverses) and the inherent limitations of the type of information we can obtain about it."
236,0465031714,http://goodreads.com/user/show/854049-b-zsi-claussen,4," This was a beautifully written book tracing the history of mathematical/scientific progress through physics. Gleiser, who is a professor of Physics and Astronomy at Dartmouth College, wrote this book after having attended a conference, Law of Nature: Their Nature and Knowability in May, 2010, in which he gave a talk presenting his ideas on the limits of science and, thus, the limits of knowledge. Using the metaphor of our state of knowledge being an Island (of the Known at any given point of time) in the middle of the ocean of the Unknown. The Island expands and/or contracts continually as our tools of investigation become more advanced and precise, leading to constantly ""new knowledge"" or new paradigms, but also, as this body or Island of Knowledge expands, so does its borders, where its edges meet the sea of the Unknown. Thus, as our knowledge expands, the borders of the unknown also expand, and the questions and area that we don't have answers to expand. This, in fact, is an image of how there is and always will be unknowables, for ""as the Island grows so do the shores of our ignorance, and thus our ability to ask questions we couldn't have anticipated. I found his major thesis to be most compelling (but of course I would, as I have thought about knowledge and its ""knowability"" in much this way for years), but especially apt this metaphor and image. Most interesting to me, however, was how lucidly he presents the changing ideas coming from the earliest days (in Western philosophical and mathematical thought) up to the very latest ideas and competing theories and interpretations of those theories in both classical and quantum physics today. I would recommend this book heartily to anyone who is interested in such questions! "

After a little more reflection I think a 4 or 4.5 would suit it well. The material isn't necessarily anything new. As other reviewers have already pointed out, there is plenty of the standard new-wave physics discussed. This isn't a flaw, necessarily, but worthy of mention for anyone wanting to simply dive into novelties. Being a mere admirer of the such scientific findings rather than an expert in them means I enjoy the help that re-reading such things brings.I very much enjoyed the author's unapologetic retreat from the hubris that passes for scientific thought and rhetoric. It seems as if many in the community, not least of all the non-professional but self-proclaimed scientificists, are high on their own product while they enjoy the company provided in their circle-jerk.The reason for bumping down to a 4-4.5 rating is because I would've loved more fodder for thought concerning how to balance the concepts of excitement and realism that are interplaying in Gleiser's line of reasoning. Perhaps it's unrealistic on my own part to expect something definitive in terms of epistemology, but even so ended the book wanting just a little bit more."

Over the years, our island has gotten bigger, but so has the amount of shoreline.The first part does a really excellent job of describing how science has expanded the shores of the island, leading right up to strings and quantum theories. In the second part, the author takes a step back and works from atoms up through quantum mechanics. While this section has fewer pages than the first, the text and ideas are considerably more dense - a thorough reading was required. The third part is very brief, and returns to the idea of the island and whether there are parts of the ocean that we can not know - and whether or not this is a worrisome thing. I believe one could read the first and third sections only to obtain a complete picture.If you are interested in the aims of science and the big questions of the universe, and you aren't put off by decoherence, nonlocality and quantum weirdness, then by all means read this book."

It is hard to know, at the time, that you’ll one day miss not just the freedom or the experiences or the dozen other movie clichés, but the camaraderie: the like-minded focus of hundreds or thousands of open minds trying to puzzle through the same material in the same physical place at the same general time.If making study groups was kind of lame, it was because it is difficult to parse the pressure from the intention—after a lifetime of exam scores defining your scholastic identity—to recognize that learning is fun; cramming for tests sure isn’t, and when do any collegiate kids talk about what they’re learning outside of that context? I would, at thirty-plus years old, love it if my only job was, ostensibly, a huge book club. That is sort of what college is—a book club where everyone is too scared to skip the assignment and your reviews are graded. Maybe I simply think about book reviews too much.It is why, I think, the impetus behind why tech companies tend to call their industrial parks campuses rather than, say, industrial parks. In the same linguistic gymnastics of employing park to downplay the industrial side of the equation, a campus evokes memories of freewheeling debates over the benefits of green grass on shoeless feet, or why all-hour waffle irons were the greatest thing dining hall could offer students. It all puts a scholastic gloss over the garden-wall segregation that distances upper class employees from their service-sector neighbors. C’est la vie.Having a designated forum for discussion while reading The Island of Knowledge: The Limits of Science and the Search for Meaning would have been a boon. Tugging at the frayed edge of Island of Knowledge’s titular “Island of Knowledge” metaphor as it strained against the page came much more naturally to me than internalizing or discussing candidly the material contained therein. The first half passed smoothly enough—the history of natural philosophy and a rather genial overview of the general scientific method—but then we got to Chapter Sixteen. And I hit a wall. I thought it was me, and it still very much may be. I will say that Chapter Sixteen’s title is Can We Test the Multiverse Hypothesis? Wherein We Explore Whether the Multiverse is a Proper Physical Theory or Mere Speculation. Feel free to draw your own conclusion as to why I found myself rereading whole pages multiple times.After a particularly dense section on cosmology, I had a bit of an “Ah ha!” moment:Back to strings. Once you combine them with supersymmetry, the number of extra spatial dimensions is fixed: superstrings can only live in nine spatial dimensions. Five possible string theories have been found, and mathematical physicist Edward Witten from the Institute for Advanced Study has shown that they are all related in a theory with yet another extra dimension called “M-theory.” So if strings are a theory of Nature, six extra dimensions must be invisible to us. How can this be the case? My doctorate thesis and some of my work during my years as a postdoctoral fellow were dedicated to this question, which then was very new. In particular, if we attempt to combine superstring theory with Big Bang cosmology, how to explain that three dimensions grew while the other six remained small. Ah yes, the author is a professor of physics and astronomy; that explains why his chemistry and biology chapters are cogent for a casual audience yet the topics within his passion—theoretical cosmological astronomy—are rife with locked-door terminology and byzantine concepts. I doubt he is in a position to realize that even his most simplified tours require the reader to bring with them prior knowledge if they are to follow him; he has been practicing this for decades. Recognizing how little a lay audience knows at the start of a lecture is a constant dilemma for any expert. So maybe cosmology is simply a more difficult topic, or I am particularly ignorant of it, or the author is talking past me: more likely, it is all three swirled together like a beautifully choreographed ballet in which I am somehow expected to participate.That was how The Island of Knowledge went; there was neat bits nibbling at the edge of my brain, and then they’d always tie back into that overworked metaphor and I would switch to the simpler path of structural criticism rather than contend with the constant deluge of startling facts:As space keeps on stretching, it will carry away most celestial luminaries, the galaxies that are now within telescopic sight. With time, their receding speeds will surpass the speed of light, and a new cosmological horizon will appear, beyond which their light will no longer reach us. Eventually, only our Local Supercluster, the large agglomerate of galaxies including the Milky Way and Andromeda that are bound together by their mutual gravitational attraction, will be visible in the night, albeit much transformed from its current shape. As noted, in a few billion years, the Milky Way and Andromeda galaxies may merge and become one large galaxy. In about four billion years, our Sun will turn into a red giant, and life on Earth will be impossible. (Actually, this will happen much before then, because of instabilities in the solar energy output.) If cosmologists from this very faraway future don’t have access to past observations, they will conclude that they live in a Universe quite different from ours: with no receding galaxies in sight, they won’t ever know of the expanding Universe, or of the Big Bang. Ironically, their cosmology will return to that of a static cosmos, an island universe comprising the galaxies within the Local Supercluster, surrounded by a vast expanse of dark, empty space. Their Island of Knowledge will shrink and eventually disappear altogether, mirroring the growing darkness surrounding it.There is absolutely nothing I can add to the beauty of the preceding paragraph, aside from editing out the last sentence; that metaphor is too prevalent to keep its strength; it is already a hoary chestnut before the book reaches its halfway marker.The point of The Island of Knowledge (the book, not the metaphor)—beyond all of the details you can pick up from the pages—remains clear; science—much like college—isn’t about the end result but about the experience, the journey. It is a dialectic on what we learn about ourselves when we observe enough to discover what we didn’t realize was even a question we should ask:The fundamental discovery from EPR-related experiments is that randomness is an inherent aspect of Nature. When Alice or Bob measures the spin or polarization of their entangled particles they can’t know which result, “up” or “down,” they will get. We don’t have a theory that predicts the outcome of a single quantum measurement. Worse, given that local hidden variables have been ruled out, this theory doesn’t seem to be possible, even in principle. So, if “a glimpse of its true meaning” reflects the realists’ old expectation of complete knowledge of reality, then we are out of luck. Our approach to knowledge needs to be redefined in light of the discoveries of quantum mechanics. There are aspects of reality that are permanently beyond our reach. The Island of Knowledge must exist as an island, surrounded not only by what we don’t know but by the unknowable nature of the quantum realm.There is nothing defeatist about this realization. I can vividly picture every person that reads the first paragraph to conclude that first paragraph thinking, “That was incredibly defeatist.” I certainly did. Which is why it made me laugh to see the next line; I can quite easily conjure up a scenario in my head in which an editor is fighting for some sort of concession on the alleged defeatist tone, only to get the concessionary hand-waving acknowledgement that it may seem defeatist to the reader, but clearly isn’t because the author has decided to beg the question. And no, I did not forget that The Metaphor was in there, but I simply have nothing to say about it at this point. In fact, it is buried in seven of my eight selected excerpts. Not intentionally. It came up, a lot. There are many things to learn from The Island of Knowledge—the meaning of science and the limits of meaning—but how to keep an extended metaphor fresh and interesting through a lengthy non-fiction book isn’t one of them. The shoreline between knowledge and ignorance continues to grow, its rocky expanse bolstered by the broken husks of the now-forgotten vessels drawn in and dashed against its treacherous coast by the illusive siren’s song of true knowledge. Or something."
241,0465031714,http://goodreads.com/user/show/11189571-ben,4,"""The Island of Knowledge"" visits many subjects I find interesting: history of science, cosmology, quantum physics, and a wee bit of information theory at the end. It rarely gets bogged down in details, making it an easily flowing read if you're already familiar with the set of topics at a layman level. What's more, Gleiser's writing style is disciplined, aided not a small amount by his adherence to brief, focused chapters (despite the occasional pompous section that always seems to pop up in books from highly distinguished academic writers).Overall, worth reading if you're interested in a theoretical physicist's brain-dump on where science is going & what problems it's been running into over the last 100 or so years.The rest of this review is just my personal reaction to his arguments:I came away feeling that the book places many dots but not enough connecting lines. The main thesis as I understood it: science is worth pursuing, even as it runs into fundamental limits (the expanding universe vs the speed of light, quantum uncertainty, Godel's uncertainty theorem) which indicate we'll never reach a grand, final truth. No argument from me that science is worth pursuing, but I couldn't grasp exactly why the ""limits of science"" that he cites are so devastating. eg: Quantum mechanics declares that there's an unavoidable fuzziness to some aspects of reality, which is no doubt unnerving. As a result, humanity can never attain the god-like power of seeing the past & predicting the future with absolute certainty that, 200 years ago, seemed so plausible in theory (if nigh impossible in practice). Gleiser does a fine job recounting this unexpected discovery. But is a peculiar limit on our ability to measure the behavior of the universe also a ""limit of science"" in the sense of preventing new, deeper theories? So what if we can't simultaneously measure position & momentum of a particle with absolute accuracy? It's not obvious that this is an insurmountable obstacle to finding a Theory of Everything or other deep discoveries. Yet Gleiser argues (with some hand-waving) that this must be the case. I certainly respect that Gleiser is much more informed than I will ever be on this point, so I wish he had spent somewhat fewer pages rehashing the history of science and more on fleshing out the links for the argument he's putting forward. Still, an excellent read."
242,0465031714,http://goodreads.com/user/show/513697-kim-marshall,5,"This is an extremely clear description of how I (personally) view the limits of Science, mathematics and Human thought.Marcelo Gleiser is an agnostic that believes atheism is ""inconsistent with the scientific method"", as we have no final proof either for or against the existence of a God. On the other hand I would say he is unlikely to feel much pull toward the Judaeo Christian God, seeing this definition as being actually too human, too limited and thus, by definition, fallible.In this work he describes human knowledge as an ever expanding Island of Knowledge and the ocean surrounding this island as ever expanding as we humans continue to enlarge our horizons. He makes an almost unarguable point that these horizons of knowledge do have an unknowable barrier. The speed of light and the limits of time create this barrier by definition (unless of course we can some how find a way around this universal speed limit). This is a fair, and in my mind, accurate description of human limitations and the state of our scientific knowledge as of the publication of this thesis (2014). Some important quotes:""As we probe Nature and master so many of its facts, it is good to remember that the shores of ignorance grow as the Island of Knowledge grows: the ocean of the unknown feeds on our success. It is also good to remember that science only covers part of the Island, that there are many ways of knowing that can and should feed on one another. While the physical and social sciences surely can illuminate many aspects of knowledge, they shouldn't carry the burden of having all the answers. How small a view of the human spirit (it would be) to cloister all that we can achieve in one corner of knowledge! We are multidimensional creatures and search for answers in many, complementary ways. Each serves a purpose, and we need them all."" ""As Arthur C. Clark famously said, Any sufficiently advanced technology is indistinguishable from magic. That the best we can ever do will always amount to a coarse-grained reconstruction of physical reality means that we will never be godlike, just as our purported simulators cannot be. The laws of Nature and the limits of knowledge will make sure that we remain human and fallible."""
243,0465031714,http://goodreads.com/user/show/35348314-joe-stack,4,"I found this book to be challenging, thought provoking, difficult, and rewarding. The most difficult part was the middle portion where the author surveys quantum physics. While the concepts or ideas in this section are difficult to grasp, I think the reader who stays with it gets a better grasp about science's limitations. I liked the author's allegory of knowledge as an island, and how the island's shore grows and shrinks depending on what science reveals. The more we learn, the more we don't know. In the author's words, ""The goal of science is to clarify, to be best of our ability, the way Nature works. Science is not supposed to answer all questions. In fact, this kind of expectation is meaningless, especially when confronted with the nature of knowledge as we have addressed it in this book: ever-exploratory, ever-changing, reflecting so clearly how we approach the world, the kinds of questions we ask and can ask at a given time. The knowledge that we have defines the knowledge that we can have. . . . As knowledge shifts, we ask new kinds of questions that couldn't have been anticipated."" The author's brief history of science brings the reader to the point that there is a limitation to what we can learn, and what remains a mystery (until resolved) is where myths are/may be created because we seek order, we want answers, we want to understand reality, yet reality may not be as firm as we think. As the author states it, ""The very nature of scientific inquiry, always ongoing and always under revision, necessarily implies the notion of a changing understanding of reality."""

[A]s the Island of Knowledge grows, so do the shores of our ignorance -- the boundary between the known and the unknown. ...The more we know, the more exposed we are to our ignorance, and the more we know to ask.""Surprise! Human beings are finite, and we will never know everything there is to know. As our tools of discovery have grown more precise, we have continually reshaped our view of the cosmos, but we still don't really understand the nature of our own consciousness, much less the fundamental nature of reality.Not news to me, but apparently a necessary corrective to contemporary science, which often proceeds on the assumption that there is a discoverable final answer to it all. The pursuit of knowledge can always benefit from a dose of humility.The first part of this book is a quick historical survey of science, which I found interesting. I was tracking with the author until very near the end, where he started worrying over the idea that our reality could be a simulation. Multiverse: okay, perhaps. It's a speculative hypothesis, but it does seem to be speculation that rightly belongs within the realm of science. Proposing an elaborate Matrix-like reality seems more like wild conspiracy theorizing to me.Overall, though, it was a great read. Most stuff about quantum physics goes over my head, but I still enjoy reading about it and listening to an informed observer's musings."
245,0465031714,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3941555-carlos,3,"While I disagree with much of what the author had to say, I have to recognize that the book was well written and the author does not cram his argument down the reader’s throat. Gleiser starts by elucidating all the inner workings of working in the sciences, from the straightforward concept of inherent errors in all measurements to the more abstract concepts of scientific realism or instrumentalism, i.e., whether our theories define “Truth” or are simply tools to increase our observations. While I found his style slightly meandering, switching from the history of science to the philosophic understanding of its theories, it all lead to the crux of the book, whether or not to accept the weirdness of quantum theory. While he acknowledges his own preference and even his personal/spiritual basis for it, he is also honest in fairly presenting the alternatives. Therefore, while I disagreed with wholehearted embrace of the reality-bending implications of quantum theory I was thankful for his equally well-reasoned defense of the position taken by those with whom he disagrees. Similarly, I was pleasantly surprised to find quite a number of amazing explanations for some of the sophisticated concepts of modern physics. Overall, I found the book worth the read if only for the honest conversation that Gleiser seeks to have regarding the limitations of the scientific pursuit."
246,0465031714,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6225702-matt,4,"Sometimes our dependence on science for understanding truth is overly intense. It is important to know the limits of science and to understand that there are questions science cannot answer. In its attempts to explain the origins of the universe, science has moved closer towards becoming the very thing it often emphatically claims not to be, religion. Scientists speculate on the origins of the universe, the meaning of consciousness, and the reality of truth. Hiding behind a mask of science are many would be prophets claiming to know truth.There are somethings in the book that I don't agree with, for example in his discussion of consciousness, Gleiser gets hung up on the idea that consciousness is not made of matter, and almost contradicts his whole premise by assuming that we should be able to detect the influence consciousness has on physical matter without considering that what makes us who we are could be made of matter that we are just not yet able to detect (or influences the physical in a way that we are yet unable to detect). If you assume that consciousness is something immaterial and unknowable or beyond the observable horizon, then you have already closed the door on its discovery. "
247,0465031714,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5988834-silas,4,"I highly enjoyed this book. It did a great job of showing the history of science from before science was a thing, beginning in Ancient Greece until the present, covering a variety of disciplines, from physics to biology to chemistry to astronomy. What this book does excellently is address the way that, though science is a great way of learning more about our world, there will always be things that we do not know. This book addresses many of the problems that I see with science advocacy in social media, because science is simply not capable of telling us everything. This doesn't make science unimportant, but it is important to understand the limits of what it can and cannot do. My only main criticism of the book comes from the section on the idea of our reality as a simulation where the author doesn't seem to have expanded his imagination quite enough for my tastes, assuming that the physics of creating a simulation would have to adhere to the rules of our reality within the simulation. Still, this is only a very small part of the book, and if the ideas intrigue you, there are other books more dedicated to that idea."
248,0465031714,http://goodreads.com/user/show/21652446-donn-headley,4,"Not all questions have answers, and that is beneficial to us humans, as this spurs our curiosity to keep searching, keep enquiring, keep reaching. In this fascinating popularization of the current extent and limits of scientific knowledge and our investigations into the nature of the universe, Gleiser establishes three fields: what-is-known, what-is-yet-to-be- known, and what-is-unknowable. For both scientists and laymen, he urges humility. In our pursuit of accurate analogies for (what we think is) reality, we can know, with a fair degree of certainty, the boundary (or shoreline) between fields one and two. What we cannot distinguish is the boundary between fields two and three, and that realization should keep us both humble and curious. As a Christian, I kept seeing God in that field of the unknowable, but Gleiser will not go there. But then, he is a scientist and I am not (merely a historian of philosophy). But this book should be edifying and enthralling to both people of faith and those of science."
249,0465031714,http://goodreads.com/user/show/50004058-michael,4,"The Island of Knowledge has 3 parts: 1 The Origin of the World and the Nature of the Heavens, 2 From Alchemy to the Quantum: The Elusive Nature of Reality, and 3 Mind and Meaning. Gleiser's knowledge is impressive, his writing is crisp, and his passion is inspiring. The book weaves between physics and philosophy: looking at what we know, what we know about knowing, and what those two tell us about each other. It's fascinating. Even more interesting is the metaphor captured in the title. The island is what we know; it's substantial and expanding, but it's surrounded by a sea of the unknown. The boundary is a shore of ignorance, which increases with our knowledge. This is a really interesting and productive way to think about knowing. "
250,0465031714,http://goodreads.com/user/show/80988544-richvt,2,"This book is one of many books attempting to explain modern cosmological theories and connect them to modern life. In this, it is a philosophical work really exploring what can be known and the work of science. A lot of it is fascinating but a lot of it is still too technical to grasp so that you often just take the authors word for a concept after struggling through an exploration of the concept. It is tiring and often tiresome reading. The final conclusions- that the process of science is an intrinsic human yearning rather than the attainment of definite knowledge seems trite and anticlimactic. "
251,0465031714,http://goodreads.com/user/show/812731-kat,3,"Good information and an interesting concept comparing our search for understanding of the nature of the universe to an ever expanding island. However, I didn't feel that the organization of the book helped it much. It seemed to meander from topic to topic, not entirely building on itself. This made it a little hard to follow as an audiobook. At times, it also wanders into highly technical equations as a method of explaining a phenomenon, making it , once again, hard to follow. "

The book is divided into three parts. First, cosmology; second, quantum physics; and third, mind and matter.The author retells the stories related to the discoveries brought up in the book while often reminds us that our boundary of ignorance has expended because there are more we just realize that we don't know. He also argued that maybe there is no ""ultimate theory"" at all, and maybe the theory of everything might not even exist because we have no proof to claim that we have learnt everything there is to learn.What I've read in this book makes me feel more humble, but not vulnerable, to realize that there is perhaps no final answer or the fundamental truth."

This lucky find was on the shelf at my library and looked interesting. It was.As opposed to the usual explanation of a scientific discovery with a little historical context, this is more a walk down the path of scientific exploration, demonstrating how the discoveries supersede, contradict of enhance each other in expanding our ""island of knowledge"", the expanse of what we as humans can comprehend, explain and identify. The central message here is that there will always be areas beyond our comprehension, because our ability to learn is constrained by our abilities as conscious beings (or, in the case of quantum physics, because there sometimes nothing definite, just a probability.) You'd think it would be upsetting, this idea that we can never know everything, but Dr. Glider isn't saying there's not a reason to try; a lot of important knowledge can come out of trying to figure out how to work around these limits. It also means that the ability to imagine different worlds and planes of existence that we can't currently see or support might just mean they're in a place that's beyond our ability to see. I had never thought about how there could be universe beyond ""the universe"", because our ability to measure it would be limited by how far cosmic radiation could have spread since the Big Bang. There's also a nice philosophical interplay at work here. Geisel notes that most science is about the ""how"", not the why. We don't understand why gravity is exists; being able to measure it or predict its effect is different than being able to explain how it works. You can say that gravity is the deformation of space-time by mass, but why does it do that? What made that that law of our universe? This doesn't mean that philosophy doesn't play an important role in science, but science can't necessarily se philosophical issues.I think this book would be accessible to anyone, but having some pre-reading background in physics would be helpful. I highly recommend this.Favorite quote: If the Universe were shaped like a sphere, as Einstein wanted, and if it would collapse on itself in the distant future, observers of the final moments (if they existed, which is hard to imagine) would be able to see the backs of their heads. They would vanish, crushed into nothingness, knowing that the cosmos was, after all, finite. With hope in their hearts (if they had hearts), they would die dreaming of a new cycle of existence, in which the energy they once were would find new ways of coalescing into complex material forms, some of them able to contemplate the meaning of infinity."""
262,0465031714,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1717479-terry,3,The Island of Knowledge is a discussion of the limits of scientific understand and how that interfaces with our search for meaning. I thought this would give way to either idiotic discussions of cosmic holism or quantum consciousness but that isn't the case. The author discusses traditional limitations of our understanding like the speed of light + cosmic expansion and the Indeterminacy Principle but also the fundamental limitations of models.The best I can say is that it wasn't bad and that's it's useful to get the ontology of a working scientist. Eh.
263,0465031714,http://goodreads.com/user/show/31584402-mbogo-j,4,"Science has allowed us to have our heads in the clouds and even beyond to the frontiers of the cosmos. That is a good thing, however we forgot that our feet should be firmly planted on the ground. When you hear respected physicists declaring philosophy to be dead, you know that hubris has kicked in.In come the realists such as Lee Smolin, Marcelo Gleiser et al who have made it their mission to show us that knowledge should be grounded in reality and not esoteric mathematical proofs. Just to use one example from the book, if we factor in that the universe is 13.5B years old and the cosmic expansion coupled by doppler effect is pushing the initial light further away, then some of this light will eventually exceed our perception and we will have hit our cosmic horizon beyond which we cannot know- a singularity. There some things we just cannot know. Not forgetting that whole story about quantum coupling. This book is about epistemic humility and I think Marcelo did a pretty good job making his case. "
264,0465031714,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5917740-nilesh,2,"The book's biggest problem is that its purpose and its content have nothing in common.The author has a clear goal: to describe why the knowledge we will have at any point will never be complete. In a way, the author wants to imply that knowledge will always be like an island on the surface of reality's ocean - it can only see/represent/understand a small part of what is out there. There will always be unanswered questions for science no matter how much we progress. Despite many different attempts, the author's supposed revelation/discovery escapes any masterful proof and turns out to be a mere assertion. There is nothing wrong with it except that for many, this assertion is too trivial and obvious to warrant a conversation as there are almost no individuals from any walk of life who believes in the opposite. For those who find something new in this argument, the struggle while reading the book is to find the connection between most of the content of the book and the purpose.Between the opening and the close where the arguments are centred around the key belief, the author simply discusses whichever topics he is comfortable with. One is not to ask why the coverage is limited to physical sciences (while skipping, for instance, computational or biological sciences) with occasional brushes with early Greek philosophy (religions have no place in the discourse as do economics, sociology, eastern philosophies or even post renaissance western philosophies). The author finds time to reflect on aspects of industrial revolution even though the post-1950 electronic/computing revolution seems to have no relevance. Whatever scientific discoveries/theories are touched upon, the selection appears more based on the availability of popular literature material on them (hence the focus on Newtonian and 1900-1950 eras) than anything else.The book's summaries of key relativity and quantum mechanic topics are too short to help the uninitiated or benefit those already somewhat familiar."
265,0465031714,http://goodreads.com/user/show/8980431-aaron,3," The Island of Knowledge: The Limits of Science and the Search for Meaning  is a dense collection of information focusing on the realm of physics, cosmology, and mathematics. If you are looking for a book that addresses the limits of science in a broader sense (e.g. biology, ecology, or geology), Island of Knowledge  won't quite meet your expectations.With that being said, Gleiser offers an interesting paradigm into how humans have approached the mysteries of the world from the Pre-Socratics who sought to displace mythical explanations of natural phenomena to modern physicists who have developed superstring theories. Gleiser argues that our metaphorical island of knowledge is constantly expanding and retracting according to the information we uncover through better technology or by disproving theories that have come in and out of vogue. Throughout the book, there are many examples of the sensory limitations humans have acquired based on the path of our evolution. For example, there is discussion about the nature of reality and time involving whether the ""present"" can ever truly exist since there is always a slight delay in processing sensory information. I loved contemplating these dilemmas because they reminded me of philosophy and its relationship to science. Overall, Island of Knowledge piqued my curiosity and excitement for humanity's need to explore, hypothesize and measure uncharted territories. At times, I had to reread passages because of the complexity of the material or the physics-oriented theories and jargon that made little sense to me. Nevertheless, this book is ideal for those who have an unending fascination with the universe (or multiverses) and the inherent limitations of the type of information we can obtain about it."
266,0465031714,http://goodreads.com/user/show/854049-b-zsi-claussen,4," This was a beautifully written book tracing the history of mathematical/scientific progress through physics. Gleiser, who is a professor of Physics and Astronomy at Dartmouth College, wrote this book after having attended a conference, Law of Nature: Their Nature and Knowability in May, 2010, in which he gave a talk presenting his ideas on the limits of science and, thus, the limits of knowledge. Using the metaphor of our state of knowledge being an Island (of the Known at any given point of time) in the middle of the ocean of the Unknown. The Island expands and/or contracts continually as our tools of investigation become more advanced and precise, leading to constantly ""new knowledge"" or new paradigms, but also, as this body or Island of Knowledge expands, so does its borders, where its edges meet the sea of the Unknown. Thus, as our knowledge expands, the borders of the unknown also expand, and the questions and area that we don't have answers to expand. This, in fact, is an image of how there is and always will be unknowables, for ""as the Island grows so do the shores of our ignorance, and thus our ability to ask questions we couldn't have anticipated. I found his major thesis to be most compelling (but of course I would, as I have thought about knowledge and its ""knowability"" in much this way for years), but especially apt this metaphor and image. Most interesting to me, however, was how lucidly he presents the changing ideas coming from the earliest days (in Western philosophical and mathematical thought) up to the very latest ideas and competing theories and interpretations of those theories in both classical and quantum physics today. I would recommend this book heartily to anyone who is interested in such questions! "

268,0465031714,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4842860-john,4,"I jumped the gun last night in giving this book the coveted 5-star rating immediately after having finished the read. After a little more reflection I think a 4 or 4.5 would suit it well. The material isn't necessarily anything new. As other reviewers have already pointed out, there is plenty of the standard new-wave physics discussed. This isn't a flaw, necessarily, but worthy of mention for anyone wanting to simply dive into novelties. Being a mere admirer of the such scientific findings rather than an expert in them means I enjoy the help that re-reading such things brings.I very much enjoyed the author's unapologetic retreat from the hubris that passes for scientific thought and rhetoric. It seems as if many in the community, not least of all the non-professional but self-proclaimed scientificists, are high on their own product while they enjoy the company provided in their circle-jerk.The reason for bumping down to a 4-4.5 rating is because I would've loved more fodder for thought concerning how to balance the concepts of excitement and realism that are interplaying in Gleiser's line of reasoning. Perhaps it's unrealistic on my own part to expect something definitive in terms of epistemology, but even so ended the book wanting just a little bit more."
269,0465031714,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2945070-thom,4,"This book posits knowledge as an island, with the shore representing the edge of our understanding and the ocean beyond as what we do not (or can not) know. Over the years, our island has gotten bigger, but so has the amount of shoreline.The first part does a really excellent job of describing how science has expanded the shores of the island, leading right up to strings and quantum theories. In the second part, the author takes a step back and works from atoms up through quantum mechanics. While this section has fewer pages than the first, the text and ideas are considerably more dense - a thorough reading was required. The third part is very brief, and returns to the idea of the island and whether there are parts of the ocean that we can not know - and whether or not this is a worrisome thing. I believe one could read the first and third sections only to obtain a complete picture.If you are interested in the aims of science and the big questions of the universe, and you aren't put off by decoherence, nonlocality and quantum weirdness, then by all means read this book."
270,0465031714,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5954293-david-dinaburg,3,"There are lots of things to miss about college; if you want a reminder, the volume of listicles covering “Things You’ll Miss From Your Time at College” stretch across the vastness of the internet like a layer of soot in a steampunk novel’s overly detailed opening paragraph. It is hard to know, at the time, that you’ll one day miss not just the freedom or the experiences or the dozen other movie clichés, but the camaraderie: the like-minded focus of hundreds or thousands of open minds trying to puzzle through the same material in the same physical place at the same general time.If making study groups was kind of lame, it was because it is difficult to parse the pressure from the intention—after a lifetime of exam scores defining your scholastic identity—to recognize that learning is fun; cramming for tests sure isn’t, and when do any collegiate kids talk about what they’re learning outside of that context? I would, at thirty-plus years old, love it if my only job was, ostensibly, a huge book club. That is sort of what college is—a book club where everyone is too scared to skip the assignment and your reviews are graded. Maybe I simply think about book reviews too much.It is why, I think, the impetus behind why tech companies tend to call their industrial parks campuses rather than, say, industrial parks. In the same linguistic gymnastics of employing park to downplay the industrial side of the equation, a campus evokes memories of freewheeling debates over the benefits of green grass on shoeless feet, or why all-hour waffle irons were the greatest thing dining hall could offer students. It all puts a scholastic gloss over the garden-wall segregation that distances upper class employees from their service-sector neighbors. C’est la vie.Having a designated forum for discussion while reading The Island of Knowledge: The Limits of Science and the Search for Meaning would have been a boon. Tugging at the frayed edge of Island of Knowledge’s titular “Island of Knowledge” metaphor as it strained against the page came much more naturally to me than internalizing or discussing candidly the material contained therein. The first half passed smoothly enough—the history of natural philosophy and a rather genial overview of the general scientific method—but then we got to Chapter Sixteen. And I hit a wall. I thought it was me, and it still very much may be. I will say that Chapter Sixteen’s title is Can We Test the Multiverse Hypothesis? Wherein We Explore Whether the Multiverse is a Proper Physical Theory or Mere Speculation. Feel free to draw your own conclusion as to why I found myself rereading whole pages multiple times.After a particularly dense section on cosmology, I had a bit of an “Ah ha!” moment:Back to strings. Once you combine them with supersymmetry, the number of extra spatial dimensions is fixed: superstrings can only live in nine spatial dimensions. Five possible string theories have been found, and mathematical physicist Edward Witten from the Institute for Advanced Study has shown that they are all related in a theory with yet another extra dimension called “M-theory.” So if strings are a theory of Nature, six extra dimensions must be invisible to us. How can this be the case? My doctorate thesis and some of my work during my years as a postdoctoral fellow were dedicated to this question, which then was very new. In particular, if we attempt to combine superstring theory with Big Bang cosmology, how to explain that three dimensions grew while the other six remained small. Ah yes, the author is a professor of physics and astronomy; that explains why his chemistry and biology chapters are cogent for a casual audience yet the topics within his passion—theoretical cosmological astronomy—are rife with locked-door terminology and byzantine concepts. I doubt he is in a position to realize that even his most simplified tours require the reader to bring with them prior knowledge if they are to follow him; he has been practicing this for decades. Recognizing how little a lay audience knows at the start of a lecture is a constant dilemma for any expert. So maybe cosmology is simply a more difficult topic, or I am particularly ignorant of it, or the author is talking past me: more likely, it is all three swirled together like a beautifully choreographed ballet in which I am somehow expected to participate.That was how The Island of Knowledge went; there was neat bits nibbling at the edge of my brain, and then they’d always tie back into that overworked metaphor and I would switch to the simpler path of structural criticism rather than contend with the constant deluge of startling facts:As space keeps on stretching, it will carry away most celestial luminaries, the galaxies that are now within telescopic sight. With time, their receding speeds will surpass the speed of light, and a new cosmological horizon will appear, beyond which their light will no longer reach us. Eventually, only our Local Supercluster, the large agglomerate of galaxies including the Milky Way and Andromeda that are bound together by their mutual gravitational attraction, will be visible in the night, albeit much transformed from its current shape. As noted, in a few billion years, the Milky Way and Andromeda galaxies may merge and become one large galaxy. In about four billion years, our Sun will turn into a red giant, and life on Earth will be impossible. (Actually, this will happen much before then, because of instabilities in the solar energy output.) If cosmologists from this very faraway future don’t have access to past observations, they will conclude that they live in a Universe quite different from ours: with no receding galaxies in sight, they won’t ever know of the expanding Universe, or of the Big Bang. Ironically, their cosmology will return to that of a static cosmos, an island universe comprising the galaxies within the Local Supercluster, surrounded by a vast expanse of dark, empty space. Their Island of Knowledge will shrink and eventually disappear altogether, mirroring the growing darkness surrounding it.There is absolutely nothing I can add to the beauty of the preceding paragraph, aside from editing out the last sentence; that metaphor is too prevalent to keep its strength; it is already a hoary chestnut before the book reaches its halfway marker.The point of The Island of Knowledge (the book, not the metaphor)—beyond all of the details you can pick up from the pages—remains clear; science—much like college—isn’t about the end result but about the experience, the journey. It is a dialectic on what we learn about ourselves when we observe enough to discover what we didn’t realize was even a question we should ask:The fundamental discovery from EPR-related experiments is that randomness is an inherent aspect of Nature. When Alice or Bob measures the spin or polarization of their entangled particles they can’t know which result, “up” or “down,” they will get. We don’t have a theory that predicts the outcome of a single quantum measurement. Worse, given that local hidden variables have been ruled out, this theory doesn’t seem to be possible, even in principle. So, if “a glimpse of its true meaning” reflects the realists’ old expectation of complete knowledge of reality, then we are out of luck. Our approach to knowledge needs to be redefined in light of the discoveries of quantum mechanics. There are aspects of reality that are permanently beyond our reach. The Island of Knowledge must exist as an island, surrounded not only by what we don’t know but by the unknowable nature of the quantum realm.There is nothing defeatist about this realization. I can vividly picture every person that reads the first paragraph to conclude that first paragraph thinking, “That was incredibly defeatist.” I certainly did. Which is why it made me laugh to see the next line; I can quite easily conjure up a scenario in my head in which an editor is fighting for some sort of concession on the alleged defeatist tone, only to get the concessionary hand-waving acknowledgement that it may seem defeatist to the reader, but clearly isn’t because the author has decided to beg the question. And no, I did not forget that The Metaphor was in there, but I simply have nothing to say about it at this point. In fact, it is buried in seven of my eight selected excerpts. Not intentionally. It came up, a lot. There are many things to learn from The Island of Knowledge—the meaning of science and the limits of meaning—but how to keep an extended metaphor fresh and interesting through a lengthy non-fiction book isn’t one of them. The shoreline between knowledge and ignorance continues to grow, its rocky expanse bolstered by the broken husks of the now-forgotten vessels drawn in and dashed against its treacherous coast by the illusive siren’s song of true knowledge. Or something."
271,0465031714,http://goodreads.com/user/show/11189571-ben,4,"""The Island of Knowledge"" visits many subjects I find interesting: history of science, cosmology, quantum physics, and a wee bit of information theory at the end. It rarely gets bogged down in details, making it an easily flowing read if you're already familiar with the set of topics at a layman level. What's more, Gleiser's writing style is disciplined, aided not a small amount by his adherence to brief, focused chapters (despite the occasional pompous section that always seems to pop up in books from highly distinguished academic writers).Overall, worth reading if you're interested in a theoretical physicist's brain-dump on where science is going & what problems it's been running into over the last 100 or so years.The rest of this review is just my personal reaction to his arguments:I came away feeling that the book places many dots but not enough connecting lines. The main thesis as I understood it: science is worth pursuing, even as it runs into fundamental limits (the expanding universe vs the speed of light, quantum uncertainty, Godel's uncertainty theorem) which indicate we'll never reach a grand, final truth. No argument from me that science is worth pursuing, but I couldn't grasp exactly why the ""limits of science"" that he cites are so devastating. eg: Quantum mechanics declares that there's an unavoidable fuzziness to some aspects of reality, which is no doubt unnerving. As a result, humanity can never attain the god-like power of seeing the past & predicting the future with absolute certainty that, 200 years ago, seemed so plausible in theory (if nigh impossible in practice). Gleiser does a fine job recounting this unexpected discovery. But is a peculiar limit on our ability to measure the behavior of the universe also a ""limit of science"" in the sense of preventing new, deeper theories? So what if we can't simultaneously measure position & momentum of a particle with absolute accuracy? It's not obvious that this is an insurmountable obstacle to finding a Theory of Everything or other deep discoveries. Yet Gleiser argues (with some hand-waving) that this must be the case. I certainly respect that Gleiser is much more informed than I will ever be on this point, so I wish he had spent somewhat fewer pages rehashing the history of science and more on fleshing out the links for the argument he's putting forward. Still, an excellent read."
272,0465031714,http://goodreads.com/user/show/513697-kim-marshall,5,"This is an extremely clear description of how I (personally) view the limits of Science, mathematics and Human thought.Marcelo Gleiser is an agnostic that believes atheism is ""inconsistent with the scientific method"", as we have no final proof either for or against the existence of a God. On the other hand I would say he is unlikely to feel much pull toward the Judaeo Christian God, seeing this definition as being actually too human, too limited and thus, by definition, fallible.In this work he describes human knowledge as an ever expanding Island of Knowledge and the ocean surrounding this island as ever expanding as we humans continue to enlarge our horizons. He makes an almost unarguable point that these horizons of knowledge do have an unknowable barrier. The speed of light and the limits of time create this barrier by definition (unless of course we can some how find a way around this universal speed limit). This is a fair, and in my mind, accurate description of human limitations and the state of our scientific knowledge as of the publication of this thesis (2014). Some important quotes:""As we probe Nature and master so many of its facts, it is good to remember that the shores of ignorance grow as the Island of Knowledge grows: the ocean of the unknown feeds on our success. It is also good to remember that science only covers part of the Island, that there are many ways of knowing that can and should feed on one another. While the physical and social sciences surely can illuminate many aspects of knowledge, they shouldn't carry the burden of having all the answers. How small a view of the human spirit (it would be) to cloister all that we can achieve in one corner of knowledge! We are multidimensional creatures and search for answers in many, complementary ways. Each serves a purpose, and we need them all."" ""As Arthur C. Clark famously said, Any sufficiently advanced technology is indistinguishable from magic. That the best we can ever do will always amount to a coarse-grained reconstruction of physical reality means that we will never be godlike, just as our purported simulators cannot be. The laws of Nature and the limits of knowledge will make sure that we remain human and fallible."""
273,0465031714,http://goodreads.com/user/show/35348314-joe-stack,4,"I found this book to be challenging, thought provoking, difficult, and rewarding. The most difficult part was the middle portion where the author surveys quantum physics. While the concepts or ideas in this section are difficult to grasp, I think the reader who stays with it gets a better grasp about science's limitations. I liked the author's allegory of knowledge as an island, and how the island's shore grows and shrinks depending on what science reveals. The more we learn, the more we don't know. In the author's words, ""The goal of science is to clarify, to be best of our ability, the way Nature works. Science is not supposed to answer all questions. In fact, this kind of expectation is meaningless, especially when confronted with the nature of knowledge as we have addressed it in this book: ever-exploratory, ever-changing, reflecting so clearly how we approach the world, the kinds of questions we ask and can ask at a given time. The knowledge that we have defines the knowledge that we can have. . . . As knowledge shifts, we ask new kinds of questions that couldn't have been anticipated."" The author's brief history of science brings the reader to the point that there is a limitation to what we can learn, and what remains a mystery (until resolved) is where myths are/may be created because we seek order, we want answers, we want to understand reality, yet reality may not be as firm as we think. As the author states it, ""The very nature of scientific inquiry, always ongoing and always under revision, necessarily implies the notion of a changing understanding of reality."""
274,0465031714,http://goodreads.com/user/show/748832-susannah,4,"... [A]s the Island of Knowledge grows, so do the shores of our ignorance -- the boundary between the known and the unknown. ...The more we know, the more exposed we are to our ignorance, and the more we know to ask.""Surprise! Human beings are finite, and we will never know everything there is to know. As our tools of discovery have grown more precise, we have continually reshaped our view of the cosmos, but we still don't really understand the nature of our own consciousness, much less the fundamental nature of reality.Not news to me, but apparently a necessary corrective to contemporary science, which often proceeds on the assumption that there is a discoverable final answer to it all. The pursuit of knowledge can always benefit from a dose of humility.The first part of this book is a quick historical survey of science, which I found interesting. I was tracking with the author until very near the end, where he started worrying over the idea that our reality could be a simulation. Multiverse: okay, perhaps. It's a speculative hypothesis, but it does seem to be speculation that rightly belongs within the realm of science. Proposing an elaborate Matrix-like reality seems more like wild conspiracy theorizing to me.Overall, though, it was a great read. Most stuff about quantum physics goes over my head, but I still enjoy reading about it and listening to an informed observer's musings."
275,0465031714,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3941555-carlos,3,"While I disagree with much of what the author had to say, I have to recognize that the book was well written and the author does not cram his argument down the reader’s throat. Gleiser starts by elucidating all the inner workings of working in the sciences, from the straightforward concept of inherent errors in all measurements to the more abstract concepts of scientific realism or instrumentalism, i.e., whether our theories define “Truth” or are simply tools to increase our observations. While I found his style slightly meandering, switching from the history of science to the philosophic understanding of its theories, it all lead to the crux of the book, whether or not to accept the weirdness of quantum theory. While he acknowledges his own preference and even his personal/spiritual basis for it, he is also honest in fairly presenting the alternatives. Therefore, while I disagreed with wholehearted embrace of the reality-bending implications of quantum theory I was thankful for his equally well-reasoned defense of the position taken by those with whom he disagrees. Similarly, I was pleasantly surprised to find quite a number of amazing explanations for some of the sophisticated concepts of modern physics. Overall, I found the book worth the read if only for the honest conversation that Gleiser seeks to have regarding the limitations of the scientific pursuit."
276,0465031714,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6225702-matt,4,"Sometimes our dependence on science for understanding truth is overly intense. It is important to know the limits of science and to understand that there are questions science cannot answer. In its attempts to explain the origins of the universe, science has moved closer towards becoming the very thing it often emphatically claims not to be, religion. Scientists speculate on the origins of the universe, the meaning of consciousness, and the reality of truth. Hiding behind a mask of science are many would be prophets claiming to know truth.There are somethings in the book that I don't agree with, for example in his discussion of consciousness, Gleiser gets hung up on the idea that consciousness is not made of matter, and almost contradicts his whole premise by assuming that we should be able to detect the influence consciousness has on physical matter without considering that what makes us who we are could be made of matter that we are just not yet able to detect (or influences the physical in a way that we are yet unable to detect). If you assume that consciousness is something immaterial and unknowable or beyond the observable horizon, then you have already closed the door on its discovery. "
277,0465031714,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5988834-silas,4,"I highly enjoyed this book. It did a great job of showing the history of science from before science was a thing, beginning in Ancient Greece until the present, covering a variety of disciplines, from physics to biology to chemistry to astronomy. What this book does excellently is address the way that, though science is a great way of learning more about our world, there will always be things that we do not know. This book addresses many of the problems that I see with science advocacy in social media, because science is simply not capable of telling us everything. This doesn't make science unimportant, but it is important to understand the limits of what it can and cannot do. My only main criticism of the book comes from the section on the idea of our reality as a simulation where the author doesn't seem to have expanded his imagination quite enough for my tastes, assuming that the physics of creating a simulation would have to adhere to the rules of our reality within the simulation. Still, this is only a very small part of the book, and if the ideas intrigue you, there are other books more dedicated to that idea."
278,0465031714,http://goodreads.com/user/show/21652446-donn-headley,4,"Not all questions have answers, and that is beneficial to us humans, as this spurs our curiosity to keep searching, keep enquiring, keep reaching. In this fascinating popularization of the current extent and limits of scientific knowledge and our investigations into the nature of the universe, Gleiser establishes three fields: what-is-known, what-is-yet-to-be- known, and what-is-unknowable. For both scientists and laymen, he urges humility. In our pursuit of accurate analogies for (what we think is) reality, we can know, with a fair degree of certainty, the boundary (or shoreline) between fields one and two. What we cannot distinguish is the boundary between fields two and three, and that realization should keep us both humble and curious. As a Christian, I kept seeing God in that field of the unknowable, but Gleiser will not go there. But then, he is a scientist and I am not (merely a historian of philosophy). But this book should be edifying and enthralling to both people of faith and those of science."

Gleiser's knowledge is impressive, his writing is crisp, and his passion is inspiring. The book weaves between physics and philosophy: looking at what we know, what we know about knowing, and what those two tell us about each other. It's fascinating. Even more interesting is the metaphor captured in the title. The island is what we know; it's substantial and expanding, but it's surrounded by a sea of the unknown. The boundary is a shore of ignorance, which increases with our knowledge. This is a really interesting and productive way to think about knowing. "

In this, it is a philosophical work really exploring what can be known and the work of science. A lot of it is fascinating but a lot of it is still too technical to grasp so that you often just take the authors word for a concept after struggling through an exploration of the concept. It is tiring and often tiresome reading. The final conclusions- that the process of science is an intrinsic human yearning rather than the attainment of definite knowledge seems trite and anticlimactic. "

The book is divided into three parts. First, cosmology; second, quantum physics; and third, mind and matter.The author retells the stories related to the discoveries brought up in the book while often reminds us that our boundary of ignorance has expended because there are more we just realize that we don't know. He also argued that maybe there is no ""ultimate theory"" at all, and maybe the theory of everything might not even exist because we have no proof to claim that we have learnt everything there is to learn.What I've read in this book makes me feel more humble, but not vulnerable, to realize that there is perhaps no final answer or the fundamental truth."
291,0465031714,http://goodreads.com/user/show/26849656-alexis-bauer-kolak,5,"I read a lot of random science books, some based on online recommendations, others that are referenced in a book I enjoyed. This lucky find was on the shelf at my library and looked interesting. It was.As opposed to the usual explanation of a scientific discovery with a little historical context, this is more a walk down the path of scientific exploration, demonstrating how the discoveries supersede, contradict of enhance each other in expanding our ""island of knowledge"", the expanse of what we as humans can comprehend, explain and identify. The central message here is that there will always be areas beyond our comprehension, because our ability to learn is constrained by our abilities as conscious beings (or, in the case of quantum physics, because there sometimes nothing definite, just a probability.) You'd think it would be upsetting, this idea that we can never know everything, but Dr. Glider isn't saying there's not a reason to try; a lot of important knowledge can come out of trying to figure out how to work around these limits. It also means that the ability to imagine different worlds and planes of existence that we can't currently see or support might just mean they're in a place that's beyond our ability to see. I had never thought about how there could be universe beyond ""the universe"", because our ability to measure it would be limited by how far cosmic radiation could have spread since the Big Bang. There's also a nice philosophical interplay at work here. Geisel notes that most science is about the ""how"", not the why. We don't understand why gravity is exists; being able to measure it or predict its effect is different than being able to explain how it works. You can say that gravity is the deformation of space-time by mass, but why does it do that? What made that that law of our universe? This doesn't mean that philosophy doesn't play an important role in science, but science can't necessarily se philosophical issues.I think this book would be accessible to anyone, but having some pre-reading background in physics would be helpful. I highly recommend this.Favorite quote: If the Universe were shaped like a sphere, as Einstein wanted, and if it would collapse on itself in the distant future, observers of the final moments (if they existed, which is hard to imagine) would be able to see the backs of their heads. They would vanish, crushed into nothingness, knowing that the cosmos was, after all, finite. With hope in their hearts (if they had hearts), they would die dreaming of a new cycle of existence, in which the energy they once were would find new ways of coalescing into complex material forms, some of them able to contemplate the meaning of infinity."""
292,0465031714,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1717479-terry,3,The Island of Knowledge is a discussion of the limits of scientific understand and how that interfaces with our search for meaning. I thought this would give way to either idiotic discussions of cosmic holism or quantum consciousness but that isn't the case. The author discusses traditional limitations of our understanding like the speed of light + cosmic expansion and the Indeterminacy Principle but also the fundamental limitations of models.The best I can say is that it wasn't bad and that's it's useful to get the ontology of a working scientist. Eh.
293,0465031714,http://goodreads.com/user/show/31584402-mbogo-j,4,"Science has allowed us to have our heads in the clouds and even beyond to the frontiers of the cosmos. That is a good thing, however we forgot that our feet should be firmly planted on the ground. When you hear respected physicists declaring philosophy to be dead, you know that hubris has kicked in.In come the realists such as Lee Smolin, Marcelo Gleiser et al who have made it their mission to show us that knowledge should be grounded in reality and not esoteric mathematical proofs. Just to use one example from the book, if we factor in that the universe is 13.5B years old and the cosmic expansion coupled by doppler effect is pushing the initial light further away, then some of this light will eventually exceed our perception and we will have hit our cosmic horizon beyond which we cannot know- a singularity. There some things we just cannot know. Not forgetting that whole story about quantum coupling. This book is about epistemic humility and I think Marcelo did a pretty good job making his case. "
294,0465031714,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5917740-nilesh,2,"The book's biggest problem is that its purpose and its content have nothing in common.The author has a clear goal: to describe why the knowledge we will have at any point will never be complete. In a way, the author wants to imply that knowledge will always be like an island on the surface of reality's ocean - it can only see/represent/understand a small part of what is out there. There will always be unanswered questions for science no matter how much we progress. Despite many different attempts, the author's supposed revelation/discovery escapes any masterful proof and turns out to be a mere assertion. There is nothing wrong with it except that for many, this assertion is too trivial and obvious to warrant a conversation as there are almost no individuals from any walk of life who believes in the opposite. For those who find something new in this argument, the struggle while reading the book is to find the connection between most of the content of the book and the purpose.Between the opening and the close where the arguments are centred around the key belief, the author simply discusses whichever topics he is comfortable with. One is not to ask why the coverage is limited to physical sciences (while skipping, for instance, computational or biological sciences) with occasional brushes with early Greek philosophy (religions have no place in the discourse as do economics, sociology, eastern philosophies or even post renaissance western philosophies). The author finds time to reflect on aspects of industrial revolution even though the post-1950 electronic/computing revolution seems to have no relevance. Whatever scientific discoveries/theories are touched upon, the selection appears more based on the availability of popular literature material on them (hence the focus on Newtonian and 1900-1950 eras) than anything else.The book's summaries of key relativity and quantum mechanic topics are too short to help the uninitiated or benefit those already somewhat familiar."
295,0465031714,http://goodreads.com/user/show/8980431-aaron,3," The Island of Knowledge: The Limits of Science and the Search for Meaning  is a dense collection of information focusing on the realm of physics, cosmology, and mathematics. If you are looking for a book that addresses the limits of science in a broader sense (e.g. biology, ecology, or geology), Island of Knowledge  won't quite meet your expectations.With that being said, Gleiser offers an interesting paradigm into how humans have approached the mysteries of the world from the Pre-Socratics who sought to displace mythical explanations of natural phenomena to modern physicists who have developed superstring theories. Gleiser argues that our metaphorical island of knowledge is constantly expanding and retracting according to the information we uncover through better technology or by disproving theories that have come in and out of vogue. Throughout the book, there are many examples of the sensory limitations humans have acquired based on the path of our evolution. For example, there is discussion about the nature of reality and time involving whether the ""present"" can ever truly exist since there is always a slight delay in processing sensory information. I loved contemplating these dilemmas because they reminded me of philosophy and its relationship to science. Overall, Island of Knowledge piqued my curiosity and excitement for humanity's need to explore, hypothesize and measure uncharted territories. At times, I had to reread passages because of the complexity of the material or the physics-oriented theories and jargon that made little sense to me. Nevertheless, this book is ideal for those who have an unending fascination with the universe (or multiverses) and the inherent limitations of the type of information we can obtain about it."
296,0465031714,http://goodreads.com/user/show/854049-b-zsi-claussen,4," This was a beautifully written book tracing the history of mathematical/scientific progress through physics. Gleiser, who is a professor of Physics and Astronomy at Dartmouth College, wrote this book after having attended a conference, Law of Nature: Their Nature and Knowability in May, 2010, in which he gave a talk presenting his ideas on the limits of science and, thus, the limits of knowledge. Using the metaphor of our state of knowledge being an Island (of the Known at any given point of time) in the middle of the ocean of the Unknown. The Island expands and/or contracts continually as our tools of investigation become more advanced and precise, leading to constantly ""new knowledge"" or new paradigms, but also, as this body or Island of Knowledge expands, so does its borders, where its edges meet the sea of the Unknown. Thus, as our knowledge expands, the borders of the unknown also expand, and the questions and area that we don't have answers to expand. This, in fact, is an image of how there is and always will be unknowables, for ""as the Island grows so do the shores of our ignorance, and thus our ability to ask questions we couldn't have anticipated. I found his major thesis to be most compelling (but of course I would, as I have thought about knowledge and its ""knowability"" in much this way for years), but especially apt this metaphor and image. Most interesting to me, however, was how lucidly he presents the changing ideas coming from the earliest days (in Western philosophical and mathematical thought) up to the very latest ideas and competing theories and interpretations of those theories in both classical and quantum physics today. I would recommend this book heartily to anyone who is interested in such questions! "

Challenging thoughts, but the possibilities are provocative!Dog-ears and highlights:pg. xvi - ""Our senses capture only a sliver of what goes on around us.""pg. xxii - ""our approach is fundamentally limited in scope. This realization should open doors, not close them...an endless romance with the unknown.""pg. 30 - ""To claim that we know how the Universe emerged is both untrue and a great disservice to the public understanding of science.""pg. 65 - How can something without mass exist? Light is perhaps the greatest mystery.pg. 73 - Chapter 10 - There is No Nowpg. 82 - ""We can think of these star systems as different families, with children that share a common parent, the originating gas cloud.""

298,0465031714,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4842860-john,4,"I jumped the gun last night in giving this book the coveted 5-star rating immediately after having finished the read. After a little more reflection I think a 4 or 4.5 would suit it well. The material isn't necessarily anything new. As other reviewers have already pointed out, there is plenty of the standard new-wave physics discussed. This isn't a flaw, necessarily, but worthy of mention for anyone wanting to simply dive into novelties. Being a mere admirer of the such scientific findings rather than an expert in them means I enjoy the help that re-reading such things brings.I very much enjoyed the author's unapologetic retreat from the hubris that passes for scientific thought and rhetoric. It seems as if many in the community, not least of all the non-professional but self-proclaimed scientificists, are high on their own product while they enjoy the company provided in their circle-jerk.The reason for bumping down to a 4-4.5 rating is because I would've loved more fodder for thought concerning how to balance the concepts of excitement and realism that are interplaying in Gleiser's line of reasoning. Perhaps it's unrealistic on my own part to expect something definitive in terms of epistemology, but even so ended the book wanting just a little bit more."
299,0465031714,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2945070-thom,4,"This book posits knowledge as an island, with the shore representing the edge of our understanding and the ocean beyond as what we do not (or can not) know. Over the years, our island has gotten bigger, but so has the amount of shoreline.The first part does a really excellent job of describing how science has expanded the shores of the island, leading right up to strings and quantum theories. In the second part, the author takes a step back and works from atoms up through quantum mechanics. While this section has fewer pages than the first, the text and ideas are considerably more dense - a thorough reading was required. The third part is very brief, and returns to the idea of the island and whether there are parts of the ocean that we can not know - and whether or not this is a worrisome thing. I believe one could read the first and third sections only to obtain a complete picture.If you are interested in the aims of science and the big questions of the universe, and you aren't put off by decoherence, nonlocality and quantum weirdness, then by all means read this book."
