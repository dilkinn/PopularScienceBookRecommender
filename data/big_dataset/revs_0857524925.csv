0,0857524925,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1237196-petra-x,1,"I've read over 100 pages. I've learned all about the author's teenage years working as a Saturday girl in a butcher's shop, about her grandfather's death and her uncle Willie's. And I am bored. Worse, I am totally irritated by the extreme and extended characterisation of death as 'She' whom we should get to know better so we can understand ""her"". José Saramago did this brilliantly in All the Names where she, Death, was a fully-fledged character and the linchpin of the story. The author has no such success in depicting death as a person.For a professor of anatomy and forensic anatomy I had expected more. The best book I've ever read on anatomy and death (and philosophy, in the form of thoughful essays) is by F. González-Crussí. His The Day of the Dead: And Other Mortal Reflections is so stupendous, and so brilliantly written I was never able to come up with a review that would accurately reflect my impressions of it.I might be out of step with other reviewers who loved this book, no problem, I have a bookshop, I'm used to my customers not liking my recommendations and me not liking what they read, that is why we have such diversification in book subjects. (Unless the author is chasing money in which case it will be a Twilight situation with a million teenage vampire romances.)So, final judgement. I thought this book was awful."

I read a lot of crime fiction, I've watched Bones and Silent Witness, I knew this was definitely going to be my cup of tea. [I urge you all to listen if you can http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b06j0wf3].The programme was even more fascinating than I could have imagined and helped me discover more about both the process of identifying human remains and what kind of person it takes to do it. This book expands on much of what was in that interview, as well as adding more details about her life, work, and the cases in which she's been involved. It's a mish-mash of history, science, memoir, police investigations, cold cases, natural disasters, education and invention...not to mention some handy tips for would be murderers er...writers about procedure. For example, dismembering a body in certain ways cases too much leakage, making it harder to move and there really is a best way to remove a human head. And don't forget about the smell if you try to hide body parts in your cupboard or beneath your driveway (yes, she's seen this). Since the bathtub is well sized for a human body, people usually use it to cut up their inconveniently sized dead so Scene of Crime officers start their search there as a matter of course. Apparently it's hard to cut up/saw through a corpse without scratching the bath surface and it's very difficult to clean all the necessary drainage parts. Sadly, she didn't suggest better alternatives but I have these snippets of advice mentally shelved in case I ever need them. Which I won't, obviously. Some parts of the book are discussed with relative humour and she has a knack for particularly apt descriptions of body parts and fluids that you might not want to read around dinner time. Or any time. One particular story about accidentally getting something in her mouth during an autopsy was enough to make me put the book down for a solid five minutes. But i'm a hardy sort and it was too interesting to set aside for long. Her no-nonsense practicality towards death and the human corpse gives the whole book a grounding that lifts it out of some kind of macabre show into a very necessary and frank discussion about what happens when we're dead, whether that be by fair or foul means. Other parts of the book have an altogether different tone. Though she always emphasises how imperative it is for those who work with the dead to show the proper respect, there's an added gravity in her tone when talking about the victims of atrocities in Kosovo. How can it be otherwise when you meet a man who lost 11 members of his family to an RPG, including 8 children, one a baby, and struggled to find pieces of their bodies to bury while bleeding out from being shot by a sniper himself? Her time there, as part of a team investigating war crimes, clearly had a significant effect on her as a person and that really comes across in the text. It's hard to read so how can we even imagine how it must be to experience? Both for those who suffered through it and those like Professor Black, who had to give these unidentified bodies their identities back and find the evidence necessary to prosecute the offenders. It's just another example of how incredibly important her work is.My only criticism about the book is that I wanted more of it. There's so much in here that I felt Professor Black only touched the surface of what she could show and teach us, and I really hope she wants to write more for the public sometime soon.ARC via Netgalley**Anyone interested in her writing or interviews, see her page below:http://cahid.dundee.ac.uk/staff/sue-b..."
2,0857524925,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1170391-sara,4,"I received a copy of this book in exchange for an honest review. I’m (yet again) finding it difficult to organise my thoughts surrounding this book. It’s an intense, sometimes clinical, portrayal of death in a very pragmatic and scientific way. It’s equal parts cold and without feeling in its descriptions of death, yet also simultaneously deeply emotive and moving. I found that at times I had to step away from it, because although fascinating, I found myself becoming too attached to the cases. I’m also deeply in awe of the author’s knowledge, enthusiasm and respect for the subject she teaches. This is a very personal look at the many faces of death as described by one of Britain’s leading forensic anthropologists, and covers everything from the various ways a body can be buried or preserved, what happens to a body after death, and how forensic anthropologists can establish any number of things about an individual from their remains. It also goes into detail about various interesting cases the author has been directly involved with, and how forensics have helped to build a case or resolve a mystery surrounding an individual’s death or that of a major disaster. It was these chapters I found the most interesting, as it builds on knowledge the reader takes from earlier chapters. I do think it helped that I have an anthropological/medical background however, as some of the terms used are quite medical in nature. The book also documents the author’s time spent in Kosovo and some of the atrocities witnessed there. I think it was these chapters that effected me the most deeply, as the descriptions of some of the scenes Sue Black is involved with are, simply, horrendous. However, it again highlights the invaluable work undertaken within the profession. I suppose I was less taken with the small sections near the beginning of the book that seemed to be more like a familial memoir or history rather than delivering facts and experiences. Although there was always a reason for them, such as a device to further expand the readers understanding of various biological processes etc., I just wasn’t that taken with them in comparison to the later chapters. That said, I really enjoyed this. It was informative, well written and interesting. As Sue Black herself states,  ‘humans cannot fail to be affected by the stories of other humans’, and when you’ve lead a life as full as this, it’s hard not to agree. Read it. You won’t be disappointed."
3,0857524925,http://goodreads.com/user/show/28323108-a-rather-bookish,5,"I'm not going to lie, but this book made my spine tingle, profusely. A book based on the matter of death, probably shouldn't excite and intrigue a being as much as it has, but that day, earlier this year, when I bought this book in Waterstones, I had my Mum with me at the time, and although we have similar tastes, she has been known to raise that right eyebrow at some of mine.Sue Black had me hooked from the first page, and hell, that woman can write. Black writes truthfully, and sometimes painfully but it all has a profound impact on the reader, and that is what has made this an amazing read. Does death frighten me? No, but I can't say I'm ready to throw in the towel just yet.Black is a Forensic Anthropologist and a professor at Dundee University, and is obviously an expert in her work, and it is clear, that she holds a passion for what she does. It fascinates me and I'm always hungry for more information on this subject, but when push comes to shove, I don't think I could do that kind of work, day in, day out. It takes a certain individual, I think, which is the same with many professions.Sue Black has been involved with scenes of mass fatalities, and identifying people along with the causes of their death. What surprises me, is that she can walk into an area where there are many fatalities, including women and children, who have been through needless suffering, but she is scared shitless of rats. Even the toughest of individuals are only human. Black recalls her life, and how she came into the profession, and here we learn about her parents, and her Father's suffering with what we know today as dementia. The way in which she described this time in her life, had more of an impact on me that I had expected. I lost my Nan to dementia, and it was a long, painful five years that she endured it, until she died peacefully in hospital, next to my Mum. I can definitely relate to that pain. It is a dreadful disease. Black seems to enjoy the dead, more than the living, and investigating mutilated limbs is her icing on the cake. She likes a challenge, and appears to have never turned one down, and to me, she is an inspiration. She is able to give people peace, especially when it is a murder enquiry, and the family wish to know what events unfolded at that time. That takes a certain skill, and that is admirable. I'm so glad that I got around to reading this difficult, but powerful read, and I would definitely recommend it, as I think it might surprise people, at just how interesting death, and all the science surrounding it, actually is."

Infact, this interesting and engaging book has many life lessons, so it is as much about life and living as about death. The author gives us an engrossing account of her life, career and experience with death (dead people). This book also helps us understand the vitally important work being done by anatomists and anthropologists, in advancing science and life research. ""Unusual people. Unusual circumstances. Extraordinary commitment.""A fascinating must-read for all those who like life, science and death. (*a note from personal experience, just avoid combining reading and eating food for the first few chapters...)"

This book is deeply poignant and Black writes very emotionally about humanity, but very scientifically about the field of forensic anthropology. It's beautifully done."
6,0857524925,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6181069-ingrid,4,"It's fascinating to read about Sue Black's work. The book is written well which makes most of it interesting to the lay person as well. How I wish she had left it at that. I could have read it with distance and be energised by it. Unfortunately she decided to bring in personal stories, how she experienced the death of her loved ones. I found this painful and upsetting because involuntarily I compared them with my own experiences. At some instant I even wondered if I should read on. I also had difficulties with the times she posed her opinion as fact, a trap for non-fiction authors. So a 4 star rating instead of a 5 star, which I would have given if she had stayed with what she knows best."
7,0857524925,http://goodreads.com/user/show/38875452-luca,4,"Reading memoirs by people I have never heard of before is something I very much enjoy. The thought that each and every human being on this planet is leading their own life which is unique and distinct from all others is an unfathomable idea and yet so fascinating. This particular memoir is written by Sue Black who is a Scottish professor of forensic anthropology and anatomy. Through her field of expertise, Sue finds herself confronted with death all the time. In All That Remains, she tells her readers what death has taught her, what impact her work has had on her as a person, and does this through a number of actual cases she has dealt with. At first I was hesitant with this book, because there is just no way around it that death is a topic that easily gets gruesome. But this book turned out to be so much more intriguing than I could have guessed up front. What impressed me most is that Sue’s warm personality is clearly present from beginning to end. You get to know her as a loving mother, a no-nonsense woman, and she never fails to keep in mind morality. Reading this book is like watching your favorite crime series only much more down to earth and more realistic. Just as thrilling, because Sue has experienced a fair share of ghastly situations, but shows you the relevance of her work, and why respectful treatment is important. My rating for this book is 3.75 out of 5 stars. This book is perfect for you if you are an avid (true) crime reader, who is looking to expand their interest in the non-fiction genre. I received a digital review copy of this book from Netgalley in exchange for an honest review. All opinions are entirely my own. My review is susceptible to changes in the final copy of this work."
8,0857524925,http://goodreads.com/user/show/12818720-kazen,3,"As is probably well established by now I love medical nonfiction so I was excited to pick this book up, especially because the publisher compares Black's writing to Caitlin Doughty and Mary Roach. When I think of Doughty and Roach the first word that pops into mind is ""funny"".It's unfortunate because while this book is many things, it's not funny.From the beginning it's clear that Black is not a forensic pathologist, determining causes of death via autopsy, nor an overly science-y person all together. Her first job was at a butcher shop and she carried the experience forward, studying anatomy in college and becoming a forensic anthropologist concentrating on the bones of the deceased.The first third of the book reads like a memoir. In addition to telling us about her start in the field Black muses on the nature of death, the meaning of identity, and discusses the last days of three family members in great detail. There's nothing wrong with this per ce, but it's a hundred pages in the front that's completely separated from what I thought I was getting - crime! Analyzing bones! Maybe some gory stuff! If you don't know what's coming you may be tempted to give up here.Around a third of the way in we finally get into some cases and the narrative takes off. A lot of Black's work revolves around disaster victim identification, or DVI. She has gone all around the world to help return those killed in war or disaster to their loved ones, from Kosovo to Thailand. As you can guess she sees the aftermath of horrific events, and the stories are quite touching (as well as possibly triggering, fair warning). I love that she talks about the cognitive and emotional difficulties of the job and the strategies she uses for her own mental health.Luckily not every case is heartbreaking in the here and now. Black was on a BBC show where, along with a team of fellow scientists, they examined remains of people who lived hundreds of years ago in an effort to figure out who they were and how they died. She speaks of the interesting people she meets as part of her work in a university anatomy department, and delicate but not awful experiences like giving a potential full body donor a tour of the cadaver lab in use. And there are some stories from court, including the surreal experience of giving testimony and having no idea what to expect from either the prosecution or the defense.I admire the work that Black has done over the years, from teaching to disaster response, from the BBC show to founding an anatomy lab. She also gets love because she shouts out the interpreters her team worked in with Kosovo and recognizes to the mental and emotional toll of communicating the words of those who have been through such horrors.But when it comes down to it the book is split into two parts - memoir and philosophy in the first 100 pages, and your standard forensic nonfiction in the rest. The accounts of her parents' deaths can be skipped over completely with no loss, so I wonder why they're given so many pages in the first place.The last two thirds make for a solid, but not outstanding, addition to a shelf about death. Just know that you can gloss over the aforementioned sections and you won't miss a thing.Thanks to Arcade and Edelweiss for providing a review copy."
9,0857524925,http://goodreads.com/user/show/15945083-nigel,5,"Briefly - fascinating, powerful and very well written. Without question this will be one of my best books of the year.In fullSue Black (Professor) is probably the country's leading expert in forensic anthropology. In this book she looks at her life in death. This is in part biography and in part an exploration of cases and events she has dealt with. She deals with ""remains"" - what is left when one of us die. Her expertise has been used in many a varied situations over the year. Murders and unknown bodies discovered are her bread and butter (did I really just write that!). However she has also dealt with truly horrifying events such as mass graves in Kosovo and the aftermath of the Indian Ocean Tsunami.This starts off with a very good intro introduction to death in general and forensic anthropology in particular. I immediately for the writing easy and so the reading was too. Sue Black comes over as one of those rather rare experts who are good at communicating too. From the start there is humour and humanity amongst visceral scenes. The writing manages to feel objectively scientific and warmly human at the same time.The book explores aspects of the author's life - part biographic and part recounting of significant cases she has dealt with. While I loved this book I frequently felt I wanted more, particularly about the cases. You are left with the feeling throughout this book that few people in the world know more about her subject than Sue Black.There are a wide variety of cases offered to the reader in the course of this book. I'd rather people discovered the stories for themselves. However I would just say that the Kosovo chapter was far the hardest to read and made me shed a tear. It might well have been the one with most humour in too. Certainly the Indian Ocean Tsunami and the Kosovo chapters show just how determinedly outspoken the author can be although she appears to be listened too increasingly as well.Towards the end of the book there is a chapter that looks at what to most of us would be the horrors of Sue Black's work. The humanity, delicacy and sheer grit exhibited here and elsewhere in the book would alone have me recommending this book. It ends (other than a comprehensive index) with her thoughts on her own mortality. They came as little surprise to me but were worth the read too.I simply found this book fascinating in the broadest sense of the word. Sue Black writes with a remarkably light touch, humorously at times however still gentle in the troubled and troubling parts. One of the best non fiction reads to me and it will certainly be a ""best book of the year"". If the subject matter interests you do read it - I would be surprised if many did not find it very interesting at the least.Note - I received a digital copy of this book from the publisher in exchange for a fair reviewhttp://viewson.org.uk/non-fiction/all..."
10,0857524925,http://goodreads.com/user/show/16212447-sharon-barrow-wilfong,3,"Sue Black is a Scottish professor of forensic anthropologist and anatomy. This means she studies dead people. Her actual case studies were quite interesting. She gives us some backstory as to how she became interested in studying the anatomy of the deceased and also personal stories about deaths occurring in her family. She describes finding the bodies of missing people, how that is accomplished, how to pinpoint time and cause of death. Sometimes these people are known, sometimes they are not.She includes a number of cold cases. Murders that have never been solved. I found this rather unsatisfying. I know her motive was to hopefully shed light on these murders and hopefully bring justice to the murderers and give the victims' families a sense of closure, but they leave the reader hanging, like an unresolved chord at the end of a symphony.I will say that I cannot agree with her when she justifies tearing up several thousand trees to hopefully find the remains of a woman and her child who had gone missing over thirty years ago. I know the family would like to know what happened to them, but to sacrifice an entire forest? Was that going to bring the victims back to life if they found them?And the worst is, they didn't. They found nothing resembling humans in the entire area.Black also went to Kosovo to identify Albanian victims murdered by Zoran Stojanović.She gets into some gritty detail as to how some murderers dismember their victims, planting the body parts in different places and how one reassembles the body and also how one can convict the murderer through their butchering technique (or lack there of).What I did not like about the books was that she spent too many chapters philosophizing about life and death (""what is life; what is death...what makes a person a person...what constitutes identity et al..."") The other aspect of her book that I vehemently disagreed with and, in my opinion, had no place in such a book was her mini-dissertation on why she believes people should be able to decide their own life spans. She uses chilling terms like when someone ""no longer has value"" ""and ""doesn't want to be a burden"" or really just doesn't want to live anymore. Shouldn't they have the right to decide to end their life legally and safely? Hmmm...legal and safe...where have we heard those terms before?My attitude is, one does not have the right to determine when to die because that is God's right. And if you don't believe in God, at least be wise enough to look at where such dangerous thinking leads. First you get to decide, but what if you are mentally incompetent? Who decides then? In Belgium and in Holland, it's the family members' and doctors' decision now.And what if you want to live, but other people decide you have no value, that you're a ""useless feeder"" as Hitler termed it. What if your family can't afford the financial burden of caring for you? What if the government decides they can't fit your care into the budget? This is already the case with socialized medicine. Thousands of Canadians can attest to the fact that they are receiving treatment in the U.S. because they didn't qualify for treatment in their own country.Would I recommend this book? I think there must be better books out there that could describe forensics and pathology in a more clinical, better written and interesting way without the philosophical meanderings."
11,0857524925,http://goodreads.com/user/show/21413858-k-j-charles,0,"I'm not as blown away as many by this book. The accounts of anatomy and what happens after death are fascinating, and it's an interesting light on how to cope with a job that many people would find horrifying, but it's written in a very chatty way as many of these are--as if transcribed from a long talk in the pub rather than written--so a lot depends on whether the reader finds that endearing or otherwise. Generally I don't, The Ravenmaster: My Life with the Ravens at the Tower of London being a huge exception. And that's a completely different sort of weird job that needed to be told like a shaggy dog story.Loads of good stuff, very accessibly written, much of sense to say about death, and invaluable decomposition and dismemberment tips for writers to nick. But, just a bit heavy on the moralising for me, although I dare say you spend a lot of time thinking about morality in the author's job. "

The title for this book is the perfect description of what unfolds. She gives background on the profession and the day-to-day expectations in her various careers, combined with her roles as a mother, grandmother, wife, daughter, sister, friend, and mentor.I truly loved all the different parts of the telling of her stories, her opining, what she knows, what she doesn’t know, frustrations, joys, and her passion for the work, her deeply felt calling for it and satisfaction at the opportunities and obligations it has provided her. I like the way she thinks, love her humor and am amazed at her tolerance for incredibly trying situations. Unpleasantness I would run from. Horrors that would slay my every ability to respond at all, and she breathes deeply and reaches for her gloves. I could no more think of this kind of work than I could read it straight through. There were times I had to stop and do something else. We are lucky there are people in the world like Sue Black. She’s a super hero, right up there with all the others. Honestly, my five stars are for a great book, but mostly they are for the woman she is and the service she so willingly provides."

"
15,0857524925,http://goodreads.com/user/show/10281457-laura,4,"Book reviews on www.snazzybooks.com All That Remains is an interesting, frank look at death, how this natural but much-feared process is treated by society, and her work as a forensic anthropologist spanning 30 years. I have to say, I never properly thought about the difference between forensic pathologists and forensic anthropologists until I read this this book.All The Remains is intense and thought-provoking, and though some parts made me feel a little sad at times, and even uncomfortable, I really enjoyed it. Often I find that listening to something on audiobook struggles to keep my attention properly, but – perhaps because it was the author Sue Black herself reading this novel – I found this captivating. There were, however, some parts that I found less interesting – namely the parts near the beginning which focussed more on family matters and her personal history. As harsh as it may sound, the reason I picked up this book (/audiobook) was to learn more about the process of forensic anthropology itself, and I was far more intrigued by the chapters on how the amazing skills of her and her team were used to help with some high-scale disasters and incidents all over the world, as well as how it’s integrated into the less dramatic but more ‘everyday’ process of dealing with dead bodies.I have to say, I don't tend to read a lot of non-fiction normally so it has to really grab me  (and, as I said especially when listened to on audiobook!) so the fact I listened to this to the end is a testament to how interesting it is. I loved the passages on how people try to ‘get rid’ of a body, and how a body breaks down after a certain amount of time. I’ve always found information like this very interesting, and as I listened to this audiobook I couldn’t help thinking ‘I’d love to do this’… conveniently forgetting that I have zero scientific skill and am not a fan of gore.I would have liked even more information about the cases she’s worked on and the amazing ways forensic anthropology can have such an impact in today’s world - I certainly found that I enjoyed this book more and more as it went on, not wanting it to end!"
16,0857524925,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5875398-rebecca,3,"Black, a world-leading forensic anthropologist, was part of the war crimes investigation in Kosovo and the recovery effort in Thailand after the 2004 tsunami. She is frequently called into trials to give evidence, has advised the U.K. government on disaster preparedness, and is a co-author of the textbook Developmental Juvenile Osteology (2000). Whether working in a butcher’s shop as a teenager or exploring a cadaver for an anatomy class at the University of Aberdeen, she’s always been comfortable with death. “I never had any desire to work with the living,” she confesses; “The dead are much more predictable and co-operative.”The book considers death in its clinical and personal aspects: the seven stages of postmortem alteration and the challenges of identifying the sex and age of remains; versus her own experiences with losing her grandmother, uncle and parents. Black wants her skeleton to go to Dundee University’s teaching collection. It doesn’t creep her out to think of that, no more than it did to meet her future cadaver, a matter-of-fact, curious elderly gentleman named Arthur. My favorite chapter was on Kosovo; elsewhere I found the mixture of science and memoir slightly off, and the voice never fully drew me in.Favorite line: “Perhaps forensic anthropologists are the sin-eaters of our day, addressing the unpleasant and unimaginable so that others don’t have to.”"

18,0857524925,http://goodreads.com/user/show/20608600-laura,4,"An intriguing, often heartbreaking look at the fascinating work of forensic anthropology. As someone thoroughly interested in true crime, I can’t say I have ever given much thought to this area of the investigative process. This book taught me a lot and gave me a new found respect for the work that these professionals do. The amount of knowledge and skill they possess is mind-blowing.Yes parts of this book are technical and can make for slightly tough reading if you aren’t from a scientific background, but there are lots of areas dedicated to the genuine respect for those being examined by the anthropologists. The author is well travelled and her time spent working abroad on various natural disasters and war zones are riveting reading. An extremely worthwhile read for those interested in the sciences, human biology and anatomy. "
19,0857524925,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6203318-emma,3,"A very matter of fact book from Sue Black, Forensic Anthropologist. She is a Professor at Dundee University, and an expert in her field. She explains what happens when someone chooses to leave their body to science, which was fascinating and incredibly respectful. It’s made me think about this as an option when I pop my clogs. Sue has also been lead investigator at the scenes of mass fatalities such as the 2004 Tsunami. She also worked on many tours of Kossovo, and the chapter describing her work there was particularly hard to read. She is an incredibly down to earth woman, with a great sense of humour and this comes across very clearly in the book. It’s not an easy read, and it did take me some time to plough through, but it was very interesting and probably would be great as a book club read as there would be a lot to talk about. "
20,0857524925,http://goodreads.com/user/show/51454575-nick-davies,5,"I struggled a little to decide whether to award this four or five stars, in the end my objectivity took precedence - this is a honest and interesting book, part memoir and part history of anatomy, written by the eminent Scottish forensic anthropologist, anatomist and academic, Dame Susan Black. Discussing both her professional life, and aspects of the field in general, I can completely understand why this has won such critical acclaim, and would recommend it to anyone curious about the subject of death and post-mortem.The only problem to me was the writing style. I just found it a little strange - as obviously intelligent and important a contributor to the field she is, at times the author came across a little unfocused, as if musing on a train of thought without a clear destination. Strange to admit so, but I would possibly have preferred a drier and more formal book, a more traditional style, less biography and more science. It didn't spoil what was an enjoyable read, but it did slightly knock me off track at times."

I think I misinterpreted the title and only read ""forensics"" and ""solving crimes"", because, well, that is me. This year I have been really into thrillers and true crime so I guess I just read what I wanted in the title and I was expecting to read about forensics in trying to solve crimes and cold cases. And sure, this book has its bits and pieces about how the work of the author has contributed to identifying victims of crime but this is a minor part of the overall content of the book. This book is mostly an essay on the author's career, how she became interested in forensics and how she has grown passionate about a job that can be tough at times -for example, when identifying victims of genocide like in Kosovo - but also satisfying when you can actually help others. There are also some interesting aspects that Black points correctly -how humanity has seen death and how much we fear it when it is perhaps the most natural thing in the world and the only secure thing humanity shares. I would recommend if you are interested in the science behind forensics and on deeper thoughts about death. _____Disfruté este libro aunque no fue lo que esperaba, debido a que leí mal el título. Por alguna extraña razón, mi cerebro solo registró las palabras “forense” y “resolviendo crímenes” y me dije, de aquí soy. Estos últimos meses he leído demasiados thrillers y crímenes reales y parece que no tengo llenadera, lo cual fue en parte responsable de que me decidiera por este libro pensando que encontraría mucha información y datos forenses interesantes sobre crímenes actuales y pasados. Y si bien es cierto que el libro contiene algunas de las experiencias de la autora aplicando sus conocimientos para descifrar crímenes y misterios, creo que es algo mínimo. Este libro es más bien un ensayo sobre la carrera de la autora, de cómo se interesó en la ciencia forense y cómo se apasionó por un trabajo que puede ser muy difícil en ocasiones (por ejemplo, al identificar a las víctimas de genocidio como en Kosovo) pero también muy satisfactorio cuando se puede ayudar a otros con esos descubrimiento. Hay algunos puntos interesantes que Black señala de manera correcta, por ejemplo cómo la humanidad ve a la muerte y cuánto le teme, a pesar de que es el proceso más natural del mundo y la única seguridad que compartimos y tenemos los seres humanos. Recomiendo esta lectura para aquellos interesados en la ciencia forense y en reflexiones profundas y detalladas sobre la muerte. "
22,0857524925,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3805912-jessica,5,"Fascinating, passionate, and refreshingly frank, Dr. Sue Black’s respect for the dead and complete dedication to her subject is palpable.At once sobering, bittersweet, funny, and thought-provoking, All That Remains dissects a life and career as a world leader in forensic anthropology. From friendly cadavers called Henry, to private meetings with the prime minister: From crippling rat phobias, to the horrors of war crimes in Kosovo. Each moment is explored with poignant honesty and great sensitivity.In the Audible version of All That Remains, Dr. Black herself narrates and her soft Scottish lilt and genuine connection with the text makes listening a real pleasure. There’s something very intimate about listening to someone recount stories from their own life, and one feels by the end that you almost know the author. Hearing the smile in her voice when she tells an amusing or embarrassing story and the professional detachment and sensitivity with which she deals with the most harrowing of situations is a real privilege and for once, I’m truly glad that I had to choose the audiobook over the hardback.For some, All That Remains may effect a re-examination of how they think about death, dying, and what comes after; It may even convince them to bequeath their own body to science. For others, it may be Black’s examination of how we treat death as a society that draws them in. Her thoughts on how we treat the dying, what we do with them once they are gone, and the rights of the individual to decide how they meet death, are all told through Black’s own life experiences and anecdotes. Her comfort with the subject is clear in the way she moves seamlessly between quiet contemplation and a wry, irreverent humour that can’t help but bring a smile to your face.In All That Remains, the open discussion of death processes and the incredible importance of forensic anthropology for science and criminal investigation is both comfortingly gentle and crisply pragmatic. Like the lady herself, Black’s writing seems to balance on the precarious line between the emotional heartbreak of loss, and the hopeful yet unwavering fortitude of hard science.With a funny and uplifting final chapter reflecting on her own mortality, Black discusses how she wants her body to be used and how she feels about chronic illness and society’s obsession with extending human life. Truly a book for every body (pun entirely intended).The verdict: 🥄🥄🥄🥄🥄"
23,0857524925,http://goodreads.com/user/show/14882361-elizabeth,5,"For fans of Caitlin Doughty, Mary Roach, and CSI shows, a renowned forensic scientist on death and mortality.Dame Sue Black is an internationally renowned forensic anthropologist and human anatomist. She has lived her life eye to eye with the Grim Reaper, and she writes vividly about it in this book, which is part primer on the basics of identifying human remains, part frank memoir of a woman whose first paying job as a schoolgirl was to apprentice in a butcher shop, and part no-nonsense but deeply humane introduction to the reality of death in our lives. It is a treat for CSI junkies, murder mystery and thriller readers, and anyone seeking a clear-eyed guide to a subject that touches us all.Cutting through hype, romanticism, and clichÃ©, she recounts her first dissection; her own first acquaintance with a loved one’s death; the mortal remains in her lab and at burial sites as well as scenes of violence, murder, and criminal dismemberment; and about investigating mass fatalities due to war, accident, or natural disaster, such as the 2004 Indian Ocean tsunami. She uses key cases to reveal how forensic science has developed and what her work has taught her about human nature.Acclaimed by bestselling crime writers and fellow scientists alike, All That Remains is neither sad nor macabre. While Professor Black tells of tragedy, she also infuses her stories with a wicked sense of humor and much common senseMy thoughts rating : 5 stars Wow what a great read , and I couldn't put it down. The author gives you in-depth information about what a forensic anthropologist and human anatomist does , and how they work case that are solved and might have never be solved at all, and while its a very serious matter to talk about , she does throw in some humor to brake it up.She makes it very easy to understand how important they are , and has a why of making her job more realistic then the tv shows does , with that said i want to thank Edelwiss for letting me read and review it in change for my honest opinion and i will differentially be on the look out for books by her ."

However I did find this memoir compulsive reading. I really enjoyed reading about Dr Black’s childhood, career and her musings around death. As a therapist I’m fascinated by people’s thoughts and beliefs around death and although this book focussed on the physical she did touch on society’s perception around death which she thoughtfully gave the pronoun ‘she’."
25,0857524925,http://goodreads.com/user/show/64657392-christian,2,"Interesting, slow & too many tangents. No drive to pick it up but after the first 167 pages I enjoyed it."
26,0857524925,http://goodreads.com/user/show/20046265-jane,5,"What a book! Maybe not for the faint hearted, but a fascinating insight into the life and work of a world renowned forensic anthropologist. I was absolutely amazed and the evidence these clever people can ascertain from the remains of a corpse. I can not recommend this book highly enough utterly unputdownable! "
27,0857524925,http://goodreads.com/user/show/33461315-olivia,4,This was such a fascinating book- Sue Black's work and accounts of her experience in her field are just so awe-inspiring.
28,0857524925,http://goodreads.com/user/show/56337479-h-a-leuschel,5,"If you want to read a compassionate, beautifully written and honest book about death and what it takes to confront it on a daily basis, looked at from all its angles, fearlessly and without leaving any details out, in my view this book is a perfect start. There is something incredibly disarming about the way the author describes her fascination as well as her deep respect for the many bodies she has had to dissect, try and make sense of to reconstruct as best she could who the person was and what their life was like. Black's book has filled me with awe for her work as anatomist and forensic anthropologist and I was particularly moved by her words about what she would like the final hours to be like for her:'I am only ever going to experience it once, after all. I want to be able to recognise death, to hear her coming, to see her, to touch her, smell her and taste her ... to understand her as completely as is humanely possible.'"
29,0857524925,http://goodreads.com/user/show/54066321-alice-mc,5,"A confession... I am a new screaming fangirl of Dame Sue Black. I attended an event in Dundee where she spoke about this book, which is both a memoir of her real life experiences and her own reflections on living and dying. She was awesome , and what a role model.As one of the UK's top tier of Forensic Anthropologists and Professor of Anatomy, her work is fascinating and she talks and writes about it with such insight, intelligence and straight-forwardness. Given the nature of the job some parts make for extremely difficult reading (for example she worked extensively identifying victims of Kosovo war crimes in various states of decomposition) whilst some stories are so touching they moved me to tears. I also really enjoyed the epilogue and reading her matter-of-fact views on death, how she would like to die and what she would like to happen to her body (donated to an anatomy department, of course). Even speaking as someone who works in a hospital and is fairly comfortable (or so I thought) talking about death, I found the frankness of her words both unusual and refreshing.I have been struggling with my reading over the last couple of months, just lacking motivation to pick up a book. But once I started this I couldn't put this down, and I hope it might have pulled me out of my reading rut!"
30,0857524925,http://goodreads.com/user/show/75985470-kate-yates,5,"I absolutely loved this book which I found by accident while shelving books at work. I have just finished a very short online introductory course to forensic facial reconstruction and this has reawakened my interest in old bones and anthropology. This book, although on the whole has had top reviews, has received some criticisms on Good Reads and I think this must be down to it being a very hard book to categorise. For me this is a memoir of a leading forensic anthropologist and anatomist and it includes a lot of science, lots of emotion and some philosophy. If you pick it up and expect it to give you the meaning of death I can see why you would be disappointed. If you're looking for an accessible and frank description of death, both natural and unnatural, you will find it. There are also graphic yet respectful descriptions (no pictures) of bodies after death and plenty of genuine and raw emotion - from both me and the author!"
31,0857524925,http://goodreads.com/user/show/83016163-babs-green,3,"An interesting read but not quite what I expected (hence the 3*). I was expecting a more philosophical tome about how as a society we avoid conversations about death. Of course if I’d researched it properly before choosing to read it I would have known that! There’s loads of detail and Prof Black is clearly erudite but perhaps a challenge for the lay reader or maybe just me 😉 One of her observations which I did like was, ‘...if, in striving to stay alive for as long as possible at all costs, all we are in fact doing is prolonging our dying’. "
32,0857524925,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1740824-jo,5,Professor Dame Sue Black is one of the UK's foremost forensic anthropologists. In this book she recounts personal and professional stories that detail her life dealing with death. Absolutely fascinating.
33,0857524925,http://goodreads.com/user/show/17315128-meredith,4,"Author Sue Black has extensive and varied experience with in-field criminal investigations (including the search for and identification of missing persons, and exhumations in support of prosecuting war crimes in Kosovo), court testimonies, teaching UK police forces about disaster victim identification (a program that the author herself developed). She has even worked with crime fiction authors to raise funds to upgrade an academic mortuary and school of anatomy to become the most state of the art in Britain. In All That Remains, the author provides fascinating details of the methods of real-world forensic anthropology alongside very personal accounts of various ways that death and its traditions have touched her life. I recall the occurrence of many of the global events that are related in this book (war in the former Yugoslavia, tsunami in the Indian Ocean) but am ashamed to say that before reading this I had not appreciated the degree of carnage wrought by these disasters. Some of the anecdotes are very harrowing. There are descriptions of shocking cruelty and destruction in the civil war zones and heaps of bodies decaying in Thailand after the deadly tsunami. But then some are a bit lightweight, long-winded and slightly off topic; the author's rodent phobia comes to mind (a bit more editing might have made this a five-star book for me). But the main point most beautifully illustrated is that death is a part of the natural progression of life, and that despite our deep-seated cultural aversions we should be open and accepting of mortality rather than fearful. We should be more shocked and angered by cruelties inflicted by people on each other, and by the long slow clinical decline supported by the modern medical industry. These aren't new ideas, but from this author, they don't sound like empty clichés.https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sue_Bla..."
34,0857524925,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4739605-helen-costello,4,"Another medical memoir that I found fascinating. Sue Black is no doubtably extremely knowledgeable about death. This book describes what happens after death in great details - there are stories on autopsies, donating bodies to medical science, exhuming bodies and death itself intros book. Its not a light book obviously but there are some moments of mild humour. I really liked the author, she comes across as a good person - I enjoyed the glimpse into her upbringing and her relationship with her parents. This book did take me absolutely ages to read though - I'm not sure why, it could be that it was packed with information."
35,0857524925,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4568901-avid,4,"3.5 stars. Sue Black grew on me. I almost gave up on this after a few chapters. It was not quite what i was expecting. But once i accepted that she’s no mary roach (“stiff” - highly recommend), i was able to settle in with her style and started to actually look forward to hearing her tell her story. Her experience is in the UK, not the US, so there’s not a complete overlap between what she experiences and what i have become familiar with in the US’s death industry. I can’t say i highly recommend this one, but i think it can be a satisfying read if your expectations are in the right place for it. "
36,0857524925,http://goodreads.com/user/show/71202495-laura,4,"Memoirs of a forensic anthropologist’s job and experiences of death, explained and discussed on informative, scientific and personal levels. As a nurse, it’s rather interesting (and important) to interpret death in these different ways. Sue Black has been very descriptive and informative on her views and experiences of death on these levels. Personally, as a nurse, it’s rather interesting (and important) to interpret death in these different ways. At times, parts of the book ramble on and seem somewhat irrelevant; and lead off the specific subject being discussed within a paragraph, segment or chapter. On the whole, a very interesting read. "
37,0857524925,http://goodreads.com/user/show/57459227-louise-durrant,3,Interesting...but also a little boring 😬
38,0857524925,http://goodreads.com/user/show/38665063-kelsey,4,"I'm not usually one for non-fiction, but this caught my eye IMMEDIATELY, especially as Kathy Reichs commented on how good it was. It was super interesting, informative and, at times, incredibly personal and emotive. On the other hand, it still maintained a generally very clinical and scientific view throughout, showcasing the mindset you need to possess to do a job such as this.A truly unique read that I highly recommend!"
39,0857524925,http://goodreads.com/user/show/676450-jen-ifer-s-inklings,5,This was way more fascinating and informative than I expected. It also has me reconsidering my end of life arrangements. 
40,0857524925,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1104010-nicki-markus,4,"All That Remains was a truly fascinating read. Death is something that is always on my mind. Coupled with old age, it terrifies me, which is probably why I love vampires so much; I'd jump at the chance to stay young and live forever. Anyhow, that preoccupation with death is what made me request Sue Black's book from NetGalley, and I found it intriguing. Professor Black has certainly had an interesting working life, and I was captivated by her tales from her student days and from her more recent work in places like Kosovo. Black offers readers an interesting reflection on death, alongside wonderful descriptions of the work of both anatomists and forensic anthropologists. For instance, I had no idea you could still bequeath your body to anatomy schools.All That Remains will certainly appeal to general readers looking for something different in non-fiction. However, I believe it holds even more value for authors. I am a writer myself, and my current WIP involves murder scenes (albeit of a supernatural nature). It occurred to me that Black's detailed descriptions of things such as the DVI process and the various stages of decomposition would be of use to crime writers seeking to ensure their scenes feel authentic.I am glad I gave this book a read. It certainly got me thinking, in more ways than one, and it's one I would now considering purchasing, if only for the research value it would offer me as a writer. I did skim through a couple of chapters, which didn't full capture my attention. However, overall, it was an enjoyable work, so I am giving it 4 stars.I received this book as a free eBook ARC via NetGalley."
41,0857524925,http://goodreads.com/user/show/37820690-clarissa-marley,5,"I was very excited to read this book given that I studied an MSc in Forensic Anthropology and Sue Black is very, very well known in the field. It did not disappoint! It is very witty and written in a way that really engages you with the field of Forensic Anthropology, without going into too much detail that may discourage readers who perhaps do not know what it is. I very much enjoyed reading about both Sue Black's experiences within the field and also her more personal experiences with death and the like. I feel like she writes about death in a way that is oddly comforting and I really appreciated that, it added a certain depth of emotion to this book that I wasn't expecting. Even as a graduate this book taught me a lot of new and fascinating things about Forensic Anthropology i had no idea about! Every chapter i found myself getting excited over a case or a certain method of identification etc and excitedly telling whoever was in the room with me at the time. I will definitely be recommending this to my family and friends. I also recommend it to anyone who has an interest in forensics, Forensic Anth i think is still relatively unknown when people actually think of the different forensic fields (no-one i know knew what is was anyway!), but it is so important and can do so much good... i think it should be given the attention it deserves! "
42,0857524925,http://goodreads.com/user/show/39109173-karolina-kat,2,"I have expected a completely different reading, one that would be insightful and dwell on the nuances of forensic anthropology, highly informative and eye-opening. And don’t get me wrong, the book offers some brilliant bits that let you truly rethink people’s mortality and modern attitude towards death, and which shed a lot of light on the difficulty of the forensic work. Unfortunately these are only moments, lost in the long and overwhelming trails of thought of the author. More an autobiography/memoir, than a scientific read, unfortunately.And there is nothing wrong with that when you deal with a leader in her field like Dame Sue Black, it’s just that I expected something else. "
43,0857524925,http://goodreads.com/user/show/20934860-molly,1,"Our Book Club: 10(Scott's pick)I absolutly hated it. It was way too long, it was full of ramblings and the writer constantly went off on tangents that lasted around 5 pages! I never wanted to pick it up and frankly it was a trial to read! There definitely were some very interesting facts within it but they weren't worth it for me! I felt the entire book didn't really get anywhere and didn't have a point... personally wouldn't recommend."
44,0857524925,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5657249-edward-rathke,3,"There's a lot of really interesting information in here and the book is well written and all that. However, I found Sue Black, the person, to be at least lightly annoying. Anytime the book drifted into memoir, I liked it less and less. To the point that part of me wants to give it a much lower rating. But, even so, the bulk of the book is good and interesting.Because Black's occupation has to do with identifying the dead, she's pretty cavalier and dismissive of privacy concerns, among other things. Anything to make her job, and the police's job, easier, yeah? She also comes with that sort of professional bias. That being, anyone in her field or in a related field is a moral paragon who only has the best intentions of the public in mind. And this might be true! But Black is of the opinion that science and politics are unrelated and that nothing a scientist does can ever be related to something politicians do...which is a bit of a gaping blindspot.But, yeah, I have some issues with the writer. Like how dismissive she is of the psychologists whose job it was to talk to her and her colleagues exhuming human remains after an atrocity. She goes out of her way to basically call them worthless and mock them for even attempting to give any kind of aid. Weirdly, a few chapters later, she mentions how important it is for trauma survivors to receive this kind of help, and then goes on to wonder if she herself suffers from PTSD, only to then attack the psychiatric and psychological profession again.Anyrate. The book is good when it's good and maybe only annoying to me when it's annoying. I did find myself agreeing with her on a number of things, but I always find the way she builds her personal case to be somewhat unpleasant. As if the only way to make a point is to tear down someone else. Anyway...this shouldn't really be about her. It is a memoir, I suppose--though I was unaware going into it, sadly--so maybe I should adjust my rating based on her own behavior in her own book about her own life. I think I'll stick to the middle. The information about death and bodies is fascinating and worth the price of admission, but the memoir aspects, which make up the bulk of the book, are a bit unpleasant to me."
45,0857524925,http://goodreads.com/user/show/68424191-katie-wife-of-book,4,"This was an excellent book about death in all its forms. Telling people you're reading a book about death makes you sound like a bit of an oddball, but Black gives this book an informative yet casual tone...she makes death sound like something no one needs to fear.Sue Black has lived an impressive and varied life and she shares with the reader her various experiences of death; from her personal stories of deaths in the family, to her time helping to identify bodies in a war zone. This is a great read for any fan of either True Crime or Crime Fiction as Black goes into detail about the reality of body disposal and the ins and outs of decomposition.Some sections are not recommended while you're eating your dinner, but overall Black has written an entertaining, touching, and very interesting book on a topic that most people do not like to talk about at all.I enjoyed the stories from her time as an anatomy student and the people who want to donate their bodies to science...this book is an unintentional advert for donating your body, and a reminder of what anatomy students can go on and do, and how thankful they are to those people who allow them to learn the skills they need.The sections on identification were very intriguing, again, a good read for anyone with an interesting in crime fiction or non-fiction.This book is a great read, and leaves you feeling comforted about death."

night mode reading
 ; skaitom nakties rezimuAbout: The book presents a handful of various cases with information on them available in public domains. Sue Black chose these as the most memorable to her, and proceeds telling us about it, of what happened, why it happened if it’s know, what exactly was done, how it was solved, and so on. There’s always this personal touch to every story, vividly painted surroundings, respectful jokes, and tales of adventures. And the cases themselves range from kidnappings, dismembering, mass murder, war, or mass death due to natural disasters.Mine: The information provided will never be dry or left unexplained. You don’t have to have any knowledge prior to read this, for I certainly don’t. Author is very meticulous, but very human too, so it’s always very interesting to read what she has to say, her insight, and details of cases too. I was glad to read of her views, the science behind it, and I’m just in general glad I got to reading this.If I get my hands on any more works by Sue Black, I am absolutely reading it. This one gets 5 out of 5 and I very much so recommend to those who aren’t made uncomfortable by death. It’s okay if you are, though. We’ve all the right to our feelings."
47,0857524925,http://goodreads.com/user/show/24756706-david-nelson,4,"I went into this quite blind based on Emma's recommendation and enjoyed my time with it. My first surprise was that Sue Black is Scottish, which is pretty cool. We're a self-deprecating bunch at the best of times, but it was genuinely fascinating to learn that Black and her team at Dundee seem to be at the absolute forefront of the science worldwide, and not some big shot American like we're culturally trained to assume.The first third of the book surprised and slightly disappointed me - I guess I was expecting a bunch of anecdotes and stories about murder scenes, but it's more like Black's musings on death and childhood encounters with it. The gory stuff comes later in the book, and having taken in the whole thing I see the purpose of this introduction as a framing device, but it was a tad dull to begin with.When things got juicy it was very interesting, informative and at times entertaining. Her recollections are thoughtful and well-written, and manage to find some humour in the bleak content. Her expertise and ability comes through and she cuts an impressive figure - extremely knowledgeable and able to communicate that to the layman very clearly. Her dedication and passion is also very evident and it's by turns beautiful and odd to see someone be so enthusiastic about this subject matter. Another benefit to her being Scottish was that a lot of her experiences are quite local, which adds to the appeal for me, but it was also very interesting to learn about how these teams respond to massive loss-of-life events around the world.Has it changed how I view death? Quite possibly. It's refreshing to see someone speak so frankly about it, and to play down all the stuff that goes with it. It's difficult to work out if I'd like to be as comfortable and unafraid of the end as she is - intellectually it's not something I'm so scared of, but emotionally I'm not there by a long shot. At times the book made me feel very mortal and temporary."
48,0857524925,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4078732-julie,5,"What a great read - I felt sad when it ended, and could have carried on for many more chapters, as I am sure the author has had to edit down many of the stories that she carries around her. Sue Black is the Professor of Anatomy and Forensic Anthropology at Dundee University and she talks us through both her own life and shares her knowledge about death. Not only is she involved with prominent cases in the UK, she also goes to Kosovo to help identify many of the victims killed during the war there, and it is hard not to be moved to tears when she talks about the brutal way adults and children were killed and butchered. She also goes to Thailand after the devastating 2004 Boxing Day Tsunami in the Indian Ocean. It is hard to imagine the terrible conditions that they were working in and she brings a sense of humanity and compassion to the stories of the victims. Although sometimes challenging to read, I felt I learnt something in each chapter and it will certainly be one of my top reads for 2018."
49,0857524925,http://goodreads.com/user/show/54689236-nicole,4,"This was a really interesting non fiction book about death and forensic anthropology.I have to be honest, I found the first couple of chapters quite hard. It focused a lot on death in a more general sense and I found that quite challenging to read. However, once the book got going and the chapters started to be about her job and the cases she has worked on, I started to enjoy myself and I definitely learnt a lot.I wasn't a fan on the last chapter, which focused again on death in a more general way which was tough to read.This book was definitely fascinating, I learnt a lot about the human body. I really take my hat off to Sue Black and her team they do such a difficult job, I really admire them. Overall, I learnt so much from this although it was a challenging read at time I definitely gained something from it and would definitely recommend itTW: death, disease, major disasters, suicide and child death"
50,0857524925,http://goodreads.com/user/show/54657090-aimee-went,5,"Well congratulations, a book that actually made me cry. The chapters on Black's parents passing away are intensely emotional and really do place you in the room with her and her family. What a beautifully personal way of ensuring that we, the reader, become more personally acquainted with death. I was expecting a very clinical, almost humourous portrayal of Black's work in forensic anthropology and pathology and whilst this is still very much presented, I was not prepared for what an absolute gut-punch of a book this would be. Raw and emotional, a face upon the cold slate of death.Unlike Black however, I am more interested in the ancient than the modern dead so whilst I still really enjoyed this book, I felt that it was lacking a little bit but I totally understand that is my own personal, archaeologically minded preference. I loved the chapter on Kosovo and again, the human element wrapped up in the clinical environment. At the end Black talks about how she keeps her work and personal lives seperate, something that she most be absolutely masterful at considering how interwoven the elements of the book are. Kudos to her, seriously. "
51,0857524925,http://goodreads.com/user/show/33674419-hanna,5,"It took me a year plus to finish this, mainly because I would put it down after reading a couple of chapters to read other fictions that were on my TBR list. It wasn’t because this book is boring either, it’s more of the sense of comfort that I find when reading it. So whenever I picked it up again, it felt cozy. I suppose it is kind of strange to describe a book that discusses the science and certainty of death as something like a comfort food or your favourite rom-com, but it did feel like that for me. And I am glad.All That Remains is a combination of science and faith, in my opinion. Faith, not necessarily in god alone, but in the fact that things will somehow fall into place eventually and that justice will be served. "

This book mixes personal anecdotes so that the reader gets to know her, the person, with the more clinical and procedural side of her job in regards to the body and how the identification process works. I do not believe that death should be a taboo. I believe that we should talk about death because it is inevitable and death is what gives life its meaning. "
53,0857524925,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5005092-katherine,3,3.5 This started strong for me but the further I got into the book the more I struggled to maintain my attention.I find medical information fascinating and have been intrigued by anatomy for a long time- so the subject area is one I am interested in. The mixture of personal experience along with the information didn’t particularly jar for me either... I think perhaps it is the length of personal discussion and an imbalance of that with factual info. I’m not entirely sure (may be that I’m just tired!)- it was a decent read though. 
54,0857524925,http://goodreads.com/user/show/33986628-ellen,4,"This is not a book I would normally read and I think I initially put it on Goodreads because I thought it was about death generally (obviously) but not about Black's career as such. I am so glad that my preconceptions were incorrect because Black is one fascinating and wonderful lady, with a wicked sense of humour and the ability to present the most technical information to her audience with great ease, without complicating the matter. I learnt a lot from this book and it has posed questions that I hope to explore further with people in my own life. A truly unique and informative read. "
55,0857524925,http://goodreads.com/user/show/27029130-alicia,4,"A very curious book. Part memoir, part philosophy, part ""What CSI gets wrong"" - very interesting in places but the way the parts hang together doesn't entirely land for me. I saw Sue Black talking about the book at an event a couple of weeks ago: she was incredibly interesting and her voice comes through very clearly but there was just something that didn't quite gel.The bit about tattoo ink staying in your lymph nodes is fascinating though."
56,0857524925,http://goodreads.com/user/show/78510209-neil-fulwood,4,"Part memoir, part discourse on the history and techniques of forensic anthropology, part meditation on death and dying, ‘All That Remains’ promises to be grim, dour and depressing - and the chapters on Kosovo and on the human cost of large-scale disasters certainly don’t make for light reading - but Black’s no-nonsense approach to the subject, and her flashes of mordant humour, elevate the book to something write affirmative."
57,0857524925,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6032841-michelle,3,"Took me a while to finish it. I've learned some new things like how she and her team did the Disaster Victim Identification process, raised fund for a new morgue, and also how she compartmentalised her personal life and professional life thus avoided suffering post-traumatic stress syndrome. I can see why she's a giant in her field. "
58,0857524925,http://goodreads.com/user/show/32312279-jo-chambers,4,"Dr Sue Black is a forensic anthropologist who I've often seen on TV. Her career is fascinating and she tells her stories well, with compassion and decency, particularly her times in Kosovo, detailing terrible crimes against humanity. I found some of her personal musings on death though a little tedious. I am however now thinking of donating my future dead body to medical science!"
59,0857524925,http://goodreads.com/user/show/73151994-susanne-mills,5,I was unsure of reading this book but I’m glad I did. I absolutely loved her honesty and the way she explained forensics was fascinating. I’d often joked about leaving my body to science but had never known it was a reality. Her explanation and descriptions of war were very difficult to read but she also managed to bring some humour to the rest of the book. My favourite book of the year :)
