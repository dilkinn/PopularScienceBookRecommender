0,0330343475,http://goodreads.com/user/show/48650982-always-pouting,4,I've read about neurologist Oliver Sacks in other books but I'm pretty sure this was my first experience reading one of his books and I actually really enjoyed it. Sacks writes up narratives for patients he works with or people he meets with neurological conditions in a way that makes it much easier to step into the perspective of the person and gives them a story. I personally don't enjoy reading case studies in academia because they do tend to stay detached from the person being talked about and so I really liked Sacks more personal accounts of other people. I especially liked reading about Tourette's syndrome and the surgeon who has Tourette's syndrome because I didn't have as much familiarity with it. The other account I enjoyed was the one of the artist who becomes colorblind later in life and found the neurophysiology discussion of the situation really cool because I already had some knowledge of the visual pathways. At times he can seem to go on and on when writing and it can be tedious but I think the over all material was really interesting and I look forward to reading more of his work.
1,0330343475,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1713956-manny,4,"This book contains an extended, very sympathetic case-study of Temple Grandin, the world's most famous autistic person. I read it when my older son, Jonathan, was diagnosed autistic at age about 10. Obviously, given that it took so long to figure out why he was odd, he isn't that much like Grandin, but the book did give me some important insights. If you're autistic, your fundamental problem is that you don't naturally understand how other people think and feel. Many women summarize this as ""you're like a man, but more so"". If you're strongly autistic, you have so little ability to relate to other people that you don't even pick up language skills. People who are mildly autistic learn to speak, but they almost always talk in a more or less unusual way. Their prosody is odd (they speak with flat or unnatural intonation), and they haven't picked up all of the subtle rules that govern correct use of language. As a linguist, I can pinpoint some of the things Jonathan does. For instance, he forms certain WH-questions that aren't permitted in standard English. He'll say, of someone he likes, ""What do you think I'm doing to Sarah?"", to which the intended answer is ""I'm missing her"". Try explaining just why this is wrong! More seriously, he has trouble understanding why things are not permitted by the rules of social interaction, which can get him into trouble.What's fascinating about Temple Grandin is that she's shown how an autistic person can to a large extent overcome their problems, consciously learning behaviors which most people acquire without ever even knowing they are doing it. She's become a well-known advocate for autistic people, and argues convincingly that they often have compensating skills which ""normal"" people lack. I agree with her; I know a lot of mathematicians, and, once you are familiar with the literature on autism, it's obvious that it's not uncommon in the world of mathematics. You see that the ability to shut out the world and focus intensely on an abstract problem can be a huge strength.Jonathan, who's now 23, has an incredibly retentive memory. He can give you minute descriptions of things that happened to him when he was three or four years old. But he hasn't figured out how to get his act together and use his abilities systematically, and it's not clear he ever will."
2,0330343475,http://goodreads.com/user/show/70580-cathy,5,"In An Anthropologist on Mars, Oliver Sacks seamlessly weaves fascinating patient stories and lessons in neurology for the layperson. This may sound quite dry if you're not into reading about bizarre behavior from brain circuitry goes awry, but Sacks makes the science very palatable. He acts as our well-traveled tour guide as we explore the everyday lives and thinking processes of seven people who have made creative use of their cognitive hiccups.Some of the patients featured in this collection of case studies have managed neurological differences from birth; others have had to re-program and mourn grave deficits due to freak events. Dr. Sacks explains the malleability and compensatory functions built into the brain when one portion becomes dim. Perhaps more importantly, he demonstrates via his subjects how the human spirit also adapts after sensory loss. His tale of a painter who was made colorblind after a car accident is an example of the latter: Sacks works through myriad possible explanations for this man’s newly colorless world; however, he is eventually left without a reason—or a cure. During this process, the artist manages to reform his creative identity; he comes to see his newly gray vision as ""pure"" and not “distracted by color”, so previously unseen forms begin to shape his noirish, multi-shadowed work. I read this book about 4 years ago and the story that has stayed with me is that of a surgeon with uncontrollable Tourette's. This man is unable to stop his violent tics and outbursts even for a few moments, but he is allowed a mysteriously zen-like reprieve when his hands (and quite possibly his mind) are steadied as he performs surgery. The story illustrates for me what I think is Sacks' message: People are not their pathologies, and talents and interests should always be encouraged, even in the face of what we sometimes misdiagnose as deficits. Neurology for Sacks is a vocation, not a career. He conducts his research and writing in a truly humanistic spirit, and what I most love about both is the compassion and respect he shows his patients; they are not treated as curious oddities or guinea pigs, as is the case in so many medical and psychological case studies. Throughout all his work Sacks maintains a sense of wonder about the people he treats. He demonstrates that people who seem detached from experience can have full lives, and in some cases, an inner life that is cognitively richer than that of ""normal"" folks ( i.e. those of us unhindered by neurological or physical challenges). The Man Who Mistook his Wife for a Hat is considered essential Sacks, but for reasons stated--especially that surgeon--I much prefer this collection. "

I must admit - friends, judge not lest ye be judged - that I boohooed my way through the last part of Awakenings The Movie, with all those frozen people coming back to life and catching tennis balls and (spoiler alerts) then living life to the FULL for one brief shining moment, and doing the hoochy coochy, which is the only dance they could remember from the 1920s which is when they all froze up, and then Mr De Niro doing the herky jerk dance which was one of his own invention, and then reverting back to catatonia (the condition not the band) and to cap it all Robin Williams not asking out that hot nurse. I mean, boo hoo hoo! You had to have a heart made of the purest cabbage not to.Anyway, Oliver Sachs makes me queasy with a capital Q. He's peddling a modern freak show, in the politest possible way. As you probably know this book contains seven tales of psychological weirdness and it's all very further reaches of the human brain and yet the indomitable human spirit conquering all and isn't life wonderful. Feel-good autism with haemorrhages. I get the feeling someone calls up Dr Sachs and says ""I found a good one for you, over in Montana, twin 70 year old sisters who all talk backwards and live in a house they made out of Herman's Hermits albums"" and Dr Sachs is out of the door already, flagging down the nearest taxi, his laptop aquivering.It may be I'm being a trifle unfair here."
4,0330343475,http://goodreads.com/user/show/155663-david,5,"This is a fascinating book about seven people with very special, mental conditions. Oliver Sacks is a neurologist, and he spent a lot of time with each of these people in their homes and in their environments. As a result, Sacks can go into great detail about each of the seven, and explains their histories, their mental conditions, and how they cope with their situations. He tells their stories with wonderful insight, and with empathy. The most interesting aspect is how Sacks, like a detective, tries to figure out what is going on in their brains.Each of the seven people is special, and different. One of them is an artist who had an accident, and as a result became completely color-blind! He had to learn how to cope with his new handicap, and continue being a very creative artist. This case is singular for two reasons; first, almost all people who are color-blind are born that way, and second, very few people are completely color-blind like this artist.Another chapter is about a blind man who undergoes eye operations and can suddenly see, for the first time since early childhood. Even though he regains his sight, he has trouble integrating what he sees into a coherent world-view. Absolutely fascinating!Yet another chapter is about a surgeon with Tourette's syndrome. He has numerous and bizarre tics and habits, which his family and his community has grown to accept. He also flies a plane! But when he is in surgery, or when he flies, his strange behavior is temporarily suspended and acts quite normally.Two of the chapters are about autistic people: Steve is a youth who has an amazing artistic talent. He is capable of taking in a scene in a few seconds, and later drawing it in detail. He also has a remarkable musical talent. The last chapter is the amazing story about Temple Grandin, a professor of animal science at Colorado State University and well-known author of books about autism and animal behavior. While Temple Grandin freely admits not being able to understand human behavior, emotions, and social cues and communications, she is able to articulate her mode of thinking and her outlook on life to a remarkable degree.I've read a number of books by Oliver Sacks--this one is my favorite!"
5,0330343475,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6237864-nandakishore-varma,5,"This was my first introduction to Sacks, and the fascinating world of neural disorders. The colour-blind artist, the man who kept on painting the same place from memory, the man without long term memory, the autistic professor - I found all the tales absolutely rivetting."
6,0330343475,http://goodreads.com/user/show/166376-david,2,"For some reason, the essays of Oliver Sacks don't rock my world. He's got the attention-grabbing title thing down pat, and each case study does have a kernel of interest. But generally, I'd be just as happy if each essay were cut by 50% - most chapters didn't really sustain my interest to the end.Full disclosure: my faint generalized lack of enthusiasm for Dr S may stem from nothing more than guilt by association with Robin Williams. I have never denied being shallow.If you're in the mood for fun medical case studies (yes, I mean *you*, ""House"" fans), I'd recommend Berton Roueche's ""The Medical Detectives"", culled from his ""Annals of Medicine"" pieces in The New Yorker, over this collection."
7,0330343475,http://goodreads.com/user/show/12086858-yousif-al-zeera,5,"Matching the ""7 Wonders of the Ancient World"", this book delves into the ""7 Wonders of the Human World"". It expands the human capacity to better understand the strengths and capabilities of what we might consider a pathology.These real stories really move you and instill some much-needed optimism to whatever seemingly negative traits or deficiencies you might possess or carry that are considered abnormal compared to the traits enjoyed by the mass. Whether yourself, a family member or a friend is colorblind or autistic, suffer from a cerebral blindness or Tourette's or became one fine day amnesiac and wouldn't be able to recollect anything happening to you till the rest of your life; this book shows how humans are fine-tuned to ""adapt"" to such circumstances above our expectations."
8,0330343475,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1045774-mehrsa,5,"Such a fascinating and illuminating book. I've followed Sacks' work for a while so none of these stories were new, but the book is so well written and the analysis is brilliant. I loved the first and last stories the best--the story of color and the last of autism. Sachs probes into the meaning of life, the nature of humanity, friendship, love, art, and intelligence by looking at neurological dysfunction. Such wonderful insights."
9,0330343475,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2526638-claudia-turner,5,"This is the kind of book you wish you had read with others merely because it has revelations and insights everyone should have and you want everyone to have them with you.Some parts feel like anthropological Notes, others medical, others like the intimate impressions in a poetic diary, and you’re not sure as a reader if you’ve just experienced a new revelation or something that you understood all along. Oliver Sacks is one of a kind. I miss him greatly."
10,0330343475,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2715247-james-klagge,5,"This is a paradigm of a good Oliver Sacks book--several essays allowing him to move from topic to topic, occasionally returning to earlier topics, not calling for any grand theory, but noting similarities and differences. He treated autism in several places. But the most interesting essay to me was the 4th one: ""To See and Not to See."" Here he studies a man who is essentially given sight in adulthood after a cataract operation. The man did not have a great desire for this operation, but his fiancee did--who was excited by the expanded life this man would have. However, the story is a tragedy more than anything else. He never gets very good at seeing, mostly regresses/retreats into blindness, and soon dies. What is impressive about the story is how you come to sympathize with the man. While Sacks never mentions the parallel, it sounds much like Plato's Parable of the Cave, and gives me new insight into the attitude of the chained prisoners who don't want to be freed or taken from the cave. The man had developed a complete world--not a world in which something was missing. So when a new dimension was opened up, there was no obvious place for it to go. Rather as though someone offered to give you an additional sense--wouldn't you want it? But the problem is how to incorporate it into the complete world that you already inhabit. This gave me an understanding of people who insist that blindness or deafness are not ""disabilities."" While there are certain (of our) abilities that such people lack, they are compensated for by the enhancement of other abilities (probably to a degree that we lack). And I can see why such people do not want to be considered disabled or handicapped. The story also made clear how sight is an achievement, not simply a window on the world, that is developed over many months, if not years, and developed at a time in brain development when space for it is provided. When that space is not used at the appropriate time, it doubtless gets devoted to other things (and so the enhanced senses that we others lack). Oliver Sacks died 3 months ago today, and he is and will be sorely missed. I hope to learn of other humanistic scientists, or scientists who are storytellers. But he was a great one. Thanks. RIP."
11,0330343475,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1187160-caitlin-constantine,5,"The theme of this book can be summed up in one single idea, about the plasticity of the human brain, and the way the deficit of disability can be turned into the benefit of compensation. Isn't that such a cool thought? What seems like a disability may ultimately end up a gift.That's what this whole book is about. Sacks is a neurologist with a bit of Sherlock Holmes mixed in, and he finds himself drawn to some of the most inexplicable cases, like a painter who goes completely colorblind after a concussion, a young boy with autism who also happens to be an extremely gifted visual artist. (I was very compelled by the story of the man, blind since childhood, who gets his sight back and finds himself profoundly disturbed by the experience, although I also loved reading about his time with Temple Grandin.) He is a writer of enormous sensitivity, and you never get the sense that he has dehumanized his subjects. Rather, what makes his writing so remarkable is his tremendous respect for everyone he writes about, even if they sometimes annoy him (as with one man, who obsessively paints his memories of the ruined Sicilian village in which he was born.)But Sacks isn't content to just stay on the surface, to just write out case histories of these people. He delves into theory and literature on subjects that, well, I can't speak for anyone else, but subjects that I take for granted, things like color, emotion, memory and perspective. Things that enrich our lives tremendously, but are also such an integral part of our existences that it can be impossible to imagine life without them. I suppose it makes sense that a book about brains would be so thought-provoking, not just because, hey, it's about brains, but because our brains are the centers of our existence, the way we perceive everything that is going on within and without. I came away from this book with a new appreciation, not just for my own mind, but also for the myriad ways in which people grow and develop, and for all of the strange and beautiful gifts such differences bestow upon us.Recommended for anyone with an interest in....well, actually, recommended for anyone.

12,0330343475,http://goodreads.com/user/show/35855553-siobhan,3,"An Anthropologist on Mars is one of those books that has been mentioned countless times across my academic career, with lectures and students alike constantly referencing it. It took me a long time to work around to it, but I can finally say I’ve given it a read.For me, An Anthropologist on Mars was an interesting read. Considering how much people had enjoyed it, though, I had expected a little bit more. It covered seven interesting cases, allowing me to better understand the specific cases mentioned rather than simply having the knowledge of someone who had glossed over the cases during studying. I’d expected to be more engaged, I’d expected to be pulled right into the cases, yet I found it wasn’t as engaging as other academic reads have been.Don’t get me wrong, it was enjoyable; it simply felt harder to get through than it should have. "
13,0330343475,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2531665-charlene,5,"Oliver sacks provides entertaining and informative stories of people living with various brain abnormalities. In this book, sacks focused on abnormalities that often compelled the individual to record their environment in extreme ways. For example, Sacks suggest maybe we are all hardwired for recording history, since our only tools for millions of years were our brains and voices, and we handed down an oral history of human existence, throughout the generations. However, in some individuals, the areas responsible for this are overly active, and often the other parts of the brain are under-active. This results in echolalia, a perfect recording of the environment that can be reproduced over and over, a perfect memory that can produce drawings of whole cities-- even years after the artist saw it, a replication of various sounds-- such as instruments, an obsession on preserving the past-- as with someone stuck in the past and unable to live in the present day. Sacks also gives a wonderful account of his interviews and examinations of Temple Grandin. Instead of seeing her brain as defective, Sacks truly wants to understand how she might simply think differently. Even when Grandin herself views her brain as defective, it is clear Sacks is more interested in understanding the way her brain works than he is in judging if it's defective or not. Sacks is an excellent writer. The pages flew by and in no time, the book was sadly over. I love him so much; time to start a new Sacks book. "
14,0330343475,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5072847-will-ansbacher,5,"After a couple of Sacks’s books that were a little disappointing, this is one that I really enjoyed and was totally absorbed in. Perhaps because there are only a few (seven) stories, rather than the reams of case notes that Sacks normally uses to illustrate anything, and they are fleshed out enough so that you do actually care about the subjects. They are all obsessive in one way or another – an artist who only draws perfectly remembered scenes from his childhood village, a surgeon with Tourette’s Syndrome. I must be the only person who had never heard of Temple Grandin; that was a fascinating interview, but in fact the other characters grabbed me more. "
15,0330343475,http://goodreads.com/user/show/74115850-jess,5,"Whoa. What a journey. This book makes my heart goes ugh, makes me in awe, and ultimately makes me realize how vast our world is. My favorite ones would be The Last Hippie. This book makes me realize, that so many out there who are suffering, who are blessed, and who can use their weakness as their advantages towards their passion and dream. It teaches me that, even if straught by bad luck, humans will be able to seek its positivity out of themThis book is magical.

17,0330343475,http://goodreads.com/user/show/8998350-jarrah,3,"An Anthropologist on Mars is an engaging collection of seven neurological case studies that illustrate a supposed paradox - that what is perceived as disability or neurological deficit can result in amazing adaptations that make it a kind of gift. For example, a painter sustains a brain injury that makes him unable to see colour, and after a period of initial depression and disorientation, begins to appreciate his new way of seeing, and to reproduce it in black and white art. The most famous case outlined in this book is of Temple Grandin, the renowned animal scientist and autism spokesperson. But the case I found most compelling was that of Virgil, a man in his fifties blind since childhood, who regains vision through surgery and finds his entire identity and way of life destabilized. Sacks weaves together his subjects' case histories and stories of his visits with excerpts from medical, scientific, historical, psychoanalytic and classic literature. At times it gets a little bogged down in the history of research of a particular condition, but overall it remains accessible. I don't doubt Sacks' good intentions towards his subjects - his goal was clearly to get a ""normal"" audience to understand his subjects' experiences and think about them as more than their disability or condition. In a few cases it's clear Sacks provided some useful treatment and advice to the people he writes about - such as the colourblind artist he studies or Greg, ""the last hippie"" - a man whose brain tumour dramatically affected his memory, personality and sense of time. However, there were moments that gave me pause from an ethical perspective. Ultimately he is profiting off stories of people who, in some cases, can't fully consent to this or appreciate his words (Greg being the best example). This becomes especially problematic when he uses his expert status to override their voices. For example he describes some subjects somewhat condescendingly (e.g. his references to Virgil's weight and ill health) and questions the wisdom of friends and families who actually observe the subjects on a more regular basis (e.g. questioning Margaret's faith that Stephen Wiltshire experiences emotions). While these may all be fair medical observations, I would have been interested to know more about conversations Sacks would have had with the subjects and their advocates before publishing their stories."
18,0330343475,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4824495-cindy,5,"Fascinating reading of seven case histories of people with neurological disorders including Temple Grandin who is autistic and the author of Emergence, Labeled Autistic which I read several years ago and loved. The case of the colorblind painter and to see and not to see were very interesting to me. People who had long term blindness, upon having sight restored have no visual memories to support a perception of what they are seeing. They cannot understand size or distance. Someone living their whole life in a dense rainforest who is brought out to a wide empty plain, may reach out to touch the mountaintops with their hands; no concept of how far away they are.A man cannot recognize his dog as being the same animal when it turns in different angles. He can sometimes see an eye, the ear, or nose, but cannot see them together as a whole.Also: the blind live in time, not space. Space is reduced to one's own body when blind. The position of the body is known not by what objects have been passed, but by how long it has been in motion. For the blind, people are not there unless they speak. People are in motion, they are temporal, they come and they go. They come out of nothing; they disappear."
19,0330343475,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7226831-josh-friedlander,4,"Sacks is a humanist, holding a quill along with his scalpel, and honestly befriending his patients. It's amazing how little we know about the mind. Rather than looking for a solution to their ailments, the author seems to just get to know them, see the world as they do, and set it out journalistically. The result is captivating and moving. "
20,0330343475,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2514493-gwayle,4,"Seven chapters feature seven people with unusual neurological issues: Mr. I, a painter, can no longer see color; Greg F., a religious disciple, has lost his ability to make longterm memories; Carl Bennett, who has Tourette's, nonetheless manages a career as a surgeon; Virgil, a blind masseuse, has an operation to recover his sight; Franco Magnani, another painter, has extraordinarily vivid memories of his Italian hometown prewar; Stephen Wiltshire is an artistic prodigy with autism; and Temple Grandin, also autistic, designs animal enclosures and is a passionate animal rights advocate.With the exception of Virgil, whose tale has some suspense to it, most of the chapters center around Sacks's interactions with the patients, their slowly revealed circumstances and Sacks's musings about what is going on with reference to fascinating medical and historical context. The writing is lovely, both accessible and empathetic. Every now and then I was struck by an unusual (even mildly discordant) adamance about a certain point, which would get repeated several times; also, it wasn't until I learned that Sacks had prosopagnosia that I realized that there was a notable absence of description of the patients' facial expressions. This was my first encounter with the renowned Sacks, and while I liked this collection quite a bit, I feel more pull toward his memoirs now rather than more case studies. (I actually read this in anticipation of Lawrence Weschler's new biographical memoir of Sacks,

“He feels he has been given “a whole new world”, which the rest of us, distracted by color, are insensitive to. He no longer thinks of color, pines for it, grieves its loss. He has almost come to see his achromatopsia as a strange gift, one that has ushered him into a new state of sensibility and being.”
Oliver Sacks grabs my attention and holds it. He moves me and he keeps me enthralled in worlds of special personality and behavioural traits, where ambiguity of “communication”, “perception”, “memory”, “intelligence” and “illness” prevails. Through his writing, Oliver Sacks connects his own subjects to their surrounding contexts seamlessly and introduces me to a different angle of the ways of the brain.And in 
An Anthropologist On Mars
 he does it again. This book is an extremely interesting account of seven odd, mind-bending neurological cases that Sacks, again, approaches with care, sensitivity and personal feel.My only complaint, having also read his excellent Man (who mistook his wife for a hat), is that the Anthropologist felt a little dry by comparison. A little “let’s get the clinical stuff down first and I’ll add the emotion later on”. But that’s literally a little and only by comparison.A fascinating introduction to the quirks of the human mind by a highly acclaimed scientist and wonderful author. Definitely recommended (but read the Man as well)."

But what do these men mean, nine times out of ten, when they use it nowadays? When they say detection is a science? When they say criminology is a science? They mean getting outside a man and studying him as if he were a gigantic insect; in what they would call a dry impartial light; in what I should call a dead and dehumanized light. They mean getting a long way off him, as if he were a distant prehistoric monster; staring at the shape of his “criminal skull” as if it were a sort of eerie growth, like the horn on a rhinoceros’s nose. When the scientist talks about a type, he never means himself, but always his neighbour; probably his poorer neighbour. I don’t deny the dry light may sometimes do good; though in one sense it’s the very reverse of science. So far from being knowledge, it’s actually suppression of what we know. It’s treating a friend as a stranger, and pretending that something familiar is really remote and mysterious. It’s like saying that a man has a proboscis between the eyes, or that he falls down in a fit of insensibility once every twenty-four hours. Well, what you call “the secret” is exactly the opposite. I don’t try to get outside the man. I try to get inside.”"

Actually, I really enjoyed reading about Stephen Wiltshire, as well, and I wish Sacks had confined that study to just him. In fact, I highly recommend googling Stephen Wiltshire, and catching a glimpse of him and his work on the documentary tv show Extraordinary People. Sacks is good at describing Wiltshire's extraordinary talent, but not as good at illustrating Wiltshire's charming personality. The first few case studies really opened up some new ideas for me, ideas that broaden my understanding of art and memory, and it's pairing well with my other current read, Memory Wall: Storiesas the title story's main character struggles with memory in interesting ways. The last study on Temple Grandin was really rather dull, maybe because Grandin has done so well speaking for herself, his study seems redundant. Plus, his telling never really gave me a good feel for her, though I surmise Sacks never had a real understanding of her, either. "

The details he gave of their lives were often not the details I wanted to know, and I found myself skimming through some of this. However, the people profiled have undeniably fascinating neurological conditions: an artist who suffers sudden-onset colorblindness; a man whose vision is restored after decades of blindness; a young man with a brain tumor which destroyed his ability to form new memories.I was looking forward to the chapter on Temple Grandin, a high-functioning autistic woman who is the subject of an excellent HBO movie, but it was mildly disappointing. I suppose my favorite chapter was the one about the surgeon with Tourette Syndrome."

Rather than focusing on the limitations they face, Sachs highlights human adaptability to an alien reality. The story that really impressed me was the artist involved in a traffic accident that left him unable to see color. Rather than hampering him, he turned it into an advantage. Blacks, whites and grays became a new way of seeing and his work richer and more nuanced. These stories illustrate how reality is a creation of our brains and how it colors (or not) what we think is true."

Oliver Sacks is a scientist, but he knows to put his patients before their afflictions. It makes for both a vivid and instructive read. It makes, above all, for a bizarre journey through the baffling inner corners of our brains!There are seven individuals whose conditions are portrayed in here; allowing Sacks to delve from our how we perceive the world around us to memory, from our sense of self to how, bottom line, we define so-called 'disabilities'. Some stories are echoing each others (eg. the colour-blind painter and the blind man who 'regained' sight). Some feel like celebrity portraits, as when he interacts with a couple of amazing characters famous for their savant skills (eg. Stephen Wiltshire, Temple Grandin). All, though, are a startling testimony to brain plasticity, and all the bizarre and intricate modelling and re-modelling our minds can come up with to adjust to pretty much any situations - even if with weird yet fascinating consequences. I only have one reservation: the author is at times so captivated and admirative of his subjects that, he tells us more about them as individuals than about their conditions. I have learnt a lot on achromatopsia, agnosia, and amnesia; not so much on savant syndrome... Yet, I felt there were more pages dedicated to such autistic individuals than others! (Or was it just my impression?) This aside, here's an engrossing journey into the land of the bizarre: the human mind.'Defects, disorders, diseases (…) can play a paradoxical role, by bringing out latent powers, developments, evolutions, forms of life, that might never be seen, or even be imaginable, in their absence.' Indeed! A captivating read. "

Certainly learned a lot about tourettes, autism and other conditions, but what's really revelatory is how compassionate and empathetic Sacks is toward everyone in this book, and how they seem to change him as he studies them."

31,0330343475,http://goodreads.com/user/show/45836-blaker,2,"I expected more from this than a series of vignettes. Even the back cover says ""seven paradoxical tales,"" the last word implying some sort of narrative or plot structure within each section. Yet there is little narrative and no resolution, with the conclusions to each section being abrupt and consistently unsatisfying. Each story is merely a glimpse into the lives of people experiencing extraordinary circumstances -- circumstances borne of what is generally thought of as illness or disease but in reality is often just an alternative neurological process that in many ways is equally as valid as what we consider ""normal.""Each of these vignettes could have easily been reduced by 75% and conveyed virtually as much information. To pad it, Sacks adds in historical details and scientific philosophy to talk about the condition of each of his patients. These details bored me and I skipped most of them, eager to return to each individual under discussion, eager because I imagined more was coming than just a blanket description of their issues and in some cases how their condition progresses over time. Sadly, I mis-imagined. But the people are fascinating, and Sacks, when focusing his writing on them, tells their story artfully. The writing is competent (but for the conclusions) and approachable, though he does give off a subtle vibe of self-aggrandizement. The best and most informative vignettes were of Dr. Carl Bennett, a Tourettic surgeon; Virgil, the lifelong blind man who regained sight; and the titular ""Anthropologist on Mars,"" Temple Grandin, perhaps the most famous person with autism in the world.With Grandin in particular, you get a wonderful perspective on what it must truly be like to live life autistically. And I love how she and Sacks hint at an idea that has long seemed convincing to me: that autism is not as much a malady as it is a different way of experiencing the world. Yes it has many drawbacks attached, but having autism is not necessarily the tragedy that many people make it out to be in our culture at large.One discussion I really liked was in Virgil's section, where Sacks argues that human sight, which we simply assume is automatic and innate, is actually learned. It's not inherent that we make sense of the shapes and colors around us; we have to learn how to do it and if we don't when we're a kid then it might be too late to ever learn. This idea fascinates me as it actually calls into question the objectivity of our visual reality. That is, if we know that some people, like Virgil, do not get the consensus output with the same input as everyone else, then it's not too far a leap to reason that none of us is actually perceiving the same physical objects in the same way. It opens up some intriguing philosophical questions.All in all, the book felt like a series of magazine features that was padded out to book length. It's not the worst way to pass the time, but it offers no overarching substance or even a coherent argument (e.g., because these fascinating conditions exist, we should adopt a more flexible understanding of reality and learn greater compassion). Despite Sacks's obvious brilliance and all of the wonderful endeavors he is pursuing, the book itself felt a little lazy.Not Bad Reviews@blakerosser1"
32,0330343475,http://goodreads.com/user/show/66632-matt,4,"As someone who thinks a fair amount about memory, consciousness, intelligence, etc, I have developed a minor obsession with Oliver Sacks. ""The Man Who Mistook his Wife for a Hat"" probably taught me more about the way our brains work than all of the psychology classes I took in school - if for no other reason than the fact that the neurology is always seen through Sacks' humanistic lens. ""Anthropologist"" is another collection of case studies - much longer than their counterparts in ""Man"", since the entire books consists of only seven cases. However, while ""Anthropologist"" gains something in length, it seems to lose a little bit of depth. Both ""Awakenings"" and ""The Man Who Mistook his Wife for a Hat"" were based on Sacks' own patients, and that gives his analysis a clinical grounding that is lacking in some of these essays. Sacks obviously still cares very much for his subjects, but he's forced more often into generalizations and abstraction due to his relative distance from the subjects. Nonetheless, the book provides amazing insight into subjects such as memory, vision, autism, and Tourette's, and is well worth a read. Just go to ""Man"" first."

In one case study, an artist, after being in a car accident, obtained incredibly sharp vision--the artist said he could see a worm wriggling a block away--but could now only see in black and white.Another artist, after having an feverish illness, became obsessed with painting his hometown--from memory, yet accurately. Dr. Sacks compares him to the character Funes in the Borges story ""Funes the Memorious"": ""He is not at liberty to misremember, nor is he at liberty to stop remembering...""Another essay in the book is entitles ""Prodigies."" One example was a blind teenager in the 19th century, who had no musical training yet learned to play the piano from hearing others, learns airs and tunes from hearing them sung, and can play any piece on first trial as well as the most accomplished performer. Another savant had read Gibbon's _Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire_ in a single reading and imprinted it in memory."

You will be so amazed at all the things we take for granted because our brain processes the information before we even realized what we perceive as reality has already been processed by our brains, but the patients in these 7 paradoxical cases learn the hard way how crucial every part of the brain really is.

These concepts are tossed around now as if everybody has known about them for ever, but that is far from the truth. The Anthropologist from Mars helped me to understand the scope of what these conditions mean, not least that people who have them can function perfectly well in everyday life, even succeed brilliantly as Temple Grandison has done in a most unexpected field. It has helped us to understand members of our family and our friends' families who are on the spectrum and to accept the way they choose to live their lives. "

41,0330343475,http://goodreads.com/user/show/9310150-quiver,5,"A book about seven remarkable people who struggle with their different neurological afflictions, coping, succeeding, failing, and sometimes turning what would traditionally be considered societal disadvantages into advantages.Sacks writes clearly, with copious footnotes which vary between erudite and reference heavy to anecdotal and light-hearted. Crucially, he treats the people he describes as people, not as cases to be described statistically or through stilted language—on the contrary, he shows how much every person, healthy or ill, is very much an individual and ought to be treated with due respect.Here is a short preview of the chapters:The Case of the Colour-blind Painter: Mr I, a painter, suffers achromatopsia (colour blindness) as a result of a car accident. In distress, seeks treatment and detailed diagnosis, but eventually accepts his condition, and doesn’t want to attempt reverting it. He does new art in greytone.The Last Hippie: As a young man, Greg, had a tumour which led to blindness and loss of short-term memory. He remains locked in his hippie past. Music animates him.A Surgeon’s Life: Dr Carl Bennett is a surgeon with Tourette’s. When performing surgery or some other continuous actions like cycling stationary bike, the verbal/mental/physical tics don’t occur to him. He doesn’t ever remember he’s a Touretter. Flies plane, drives, has family and thriving practice.To See and Not See: Virgil, a fifty-year-old man, virtually blind since early childhood, had his cataracts removed. Trouble adjusting to the sighted world, shapes and depth and distances particularly hard to distinguish (struggled to tell apart his cat and dog). Easier: colours, motion, size. Sight became harder when he was tired.The Landscape of His Dreams: Franco Magnani left the Italian village of Pontito in 1942, aged twelve, and started being haunted by exceedingly detailed 3-D hallucinations of the town. As a way of dealing with this affliction, draws and paints in amazing detail the town from all directions.Prodigies: Chapter talks about other savants, but focuses on Stephen Wiltshire, a savant artist with a rich smell-world and later-discovered prodigious musical abilities. His drawings exhibit a gift for reproducing “thingness”, though he has a limited abstraction abilities and his talents are compartmentalised.An Anthropologist on Mars: Temple Grandin is a highly skilled slaughterhouse and animal welfare scientist with Asperger’s. She wrote a book about her experiences and is unusual in that she studies herself. Notable points: she doesn’t feel what ‘sublime’ means (even though she can understand it linguistically) and she constructed a hug-machine."
42,0330343475,http://goodreads.com/user/show/54399136-jessica,3,"Oliver Sacks was a very descriptive narrator and he tried to incorporate as much background, relevant, and interesting information into each case he discussed in his books. The way he presented his cases, for me, was a bit overwhelming at times. And yet, it's interesting that even though Sacks' books are not always easy to read but the content always leaves a lasting impression and becomes subjects of dinner conversations. In this book, I found the tourretted surgeon most fascinating. Temple Grandin's story was also very interesting though slightly less impressive as I have read other books written by Grandin herself already. I think what strike me the most in every Sacks' book I have read so far, are his diligence and humility. It's evident that he found most cases he saw enthralling, even if they were of the same neurological disorder. He must have kept detailed records of all the cases he had worked on, and not just as sets of symptoms, but as complete pictures of patient history, lifestyle, symptoms, etc. I will continue with my journey through all Oliver Sacks' books. I do find it easier to listen to his books in the audio format though. "
43,0330343475,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2334272-irina-kebreau,5,"Oliver Sacks is most and foremost a humanist. He is not simply an anthropologist or neurologist, but he is someone who is deeply moved by the humanity of others. By far, that was the overwhelming underpinning of the book - Mr. Sack's strong belief that every life, no matter how seemingly unusual, has something positive to bring to our understanding of humanity. The book opens up with a story of a colorblind painter, but it is never colorless. While the perceptions of the protagonist change with the loss of color perception, one never gets any sense of loss as Sacks describes many adaptations by the brain adopted by the painter. Similarly, whether Sacks talks about a severe amnesia or savantism coupled with autism, the reader is always left with the sense that the brain powerfully adapts to provide the fullness of experience in ways unexpected by unafflicted people. Having little background and experience with autism or Tourretes, it was eyeopening to read about how the world is perceived by low and high functioning children and adults. In sum, this was a book of hope, of warmth and of wonder. "
44,0330343475,http://goodreads.com/user/show/93871934-kathy,5,"At a loss for words to express how verily I wish we could teach everyone to ask questions like Oliver Sacks and observe their thoroughly human worlds like Sacks and err on the side of compassion like Sacks and I think this is what happens when I respect someone so deeply I nearly sully the name jumping over myself to explain why. Suffice it to say I only regret that the man couldn't live long enough to portray everyone in his 360-degree Sacksian way, and I am deeply appreciative of the stories he did live — and you can tell, he lived for this — to tell.As an aside one of my favourite qualities about Sacks the academic is that he never shies from nor makes an issue of admitting where he misassumed, or underestimated, or otherwise failed to do a subject justice, and this, even more so than the uniqueness of his thought, makes his work valuable for everyone to learn from. We're godawful at impressing upon children that deeper understanding comes only from grappling with the million errors we make along the way. Small wonder we end up with a population of insecure, incurious, resentful adults to run the world ever after."

The one that intrigued me the most is anthropologist on Mars. I wonder how my son feels about living on this planet often with a set of rules made up by humans who are not his kind. I often wonder about savants who have autism. Do they really feel lacking in other aspects where most of the world seems to have no problem? I had to go back and read thrice the paragraph about a guy who sabotaged Temple’s equipment because he felt jealous of her that- in her words- an autistic weirdo gets to do so much. I couldn’t sleep an entire night. Do I feel happy she can’t understand jealousy and other such emotions? Do I feel happy savants can go and have a life but have such shortcomings? I don’t know. Boy, does Sacks make you think."

I expected it to be about the triumph of the human spirit over the obstacles of neurological disorders, but it isn't. There's some of that in here, but it is much more of a fascinating look at the way we think of disorders and the brain. I also didn't realize Oliver Sacks had done so much work with autism. I was pleasantly surprised by his take on his autistic patients. He approaches them with frankness and compassion. His attitude is that we're still learning about the brain's capabilities and limitations, and each of these stories presents new insights. It was a surprisingly fun read. "

I really enjoyed his anecdotal experiences with his patients and the incredible people he’s met during his career. Though some of the research he mentioned may have been a little outdated, he quoted lots of important historical findings for which I also found really interested. Apart from finding some of the chapters a little repetitive (i.e. 3 out of the 7 chapters are dedicated to artists) and sometimes a little too complex; I would definitely recommend this book for anyone looking to deepens their knowledge of the humain brain! "
48,0330343475,http://goodreads.com/user/show/64463278-maya,5,"I usually do not enjoy non-fiction books about science. I find that authors use far too technical terms, leaving me lost and forcing me to dump the book halfway. However, this was certainly not the case for Mr. Sacks' ""An Anthropologist on Mars"". I found that all technical neurological terms were explained in a fairly simple but non-condescending manner. While it would normally be difficult for people to understand those who have brain damage, I found myself sympathizing more and more with the characters. One can truly tell that Mr. Sacks cares about his patients and observes them thoroughly. I really enjoyed this book and would recommend it to anyone. "
49,0330343475,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4243437-viv-jm,4,"In “An Anthropologist on Mars” Oliver Sacks writes about seven different people with a variety of interesting neurological disorders, for example a surgeon with Tourette’s syndrome, an artist who loses his colour vision following an accident and an autistic savant artist. These people are clearly of interest to the author from a neurological and scientific point of view but what struck me was the humanity and empathy with which Sacks treats the individual cases – he is not exploiting his subjects’ differences, but seeks to learn from them. An altogether fascinating book."

I’d recommend the book on the strength of these two alone. I also very much enjoyed the section on Tourette’s syndrome. Later on, however, he has 2 stories discussing autism and savant syndromes, which I found rather outdated - the book was published in 1995 and there’s been so much new research on these topics since then. Overall, four stars. "

I was also introduced to the famous Temple Gradin, a professor of animal science with autism. Her account gave me a better understanding of people on the spectrum and how differently they think and view the world. Her book is definitely on my to-read list."

It's also not as hard to read as though it might be, my psychology background does help a lot, but even without that Sacks makes sure he explains things to the best of his abilities. While every tale had it's own uniqueness and merits, the ones I was looking forward to were the autism-focused ones. He surprised me by his all constant attempts to see the person and not just the autism, which is not something we see much in doctors or behaviorism based psychologists. "

As ever Sacks is a great philosopher and humanist. The collection makes for some compelling reading. There is a surgeon who suffers from Tourette's ticks but can still perform at work and an artist who is obsessed with painting his childhood town in Italy as it was frozen in time in his memory.These are tales about survival, the ability to adapt and form resilience. The men and women in the cases are modern day 'X-men' who feel that their condition is integral to who they are, Dr. Bennett, the surgeon with Tourettes saw his condition as very much a part of who he is.The case of Shirl Jennings was the most interesting, he was blind since birth, his sight was partially restored but he had trouble identifying objects that he had previously experienced through touch. Dr. Sacks was drafted in to help.I preferred the first series 'The man who mistook his wife for a hat', but this was still a good read."

56,0330343475,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1627591-robert,4,"If I were to generalize about Oliver Sacks’s collection of essays entitled, An Anthropologist on Mars, I suppose I would say it confronts the astonishing range of human phenomena that are considered abnormal...but may not be. Most people experience some form of obsessional thinking or compulsive behavior at some point in their lives; most people are inexplicably “good” at certain things and “bad” at others; most people have emotional blind spots and insensitivities; and most people think they see with their eyes, not their brains.Taken to extremes and concentrated in unique ways these qualities generate what Sacks and others call idiot savants, prodigies, autistic individuals and individuals who “suffer” from Tourette’s Syndrome.This is what Sacks writes about: extremes. Multiply your uncle’s quirky way of repeating what you say to him 100 times and you have someone who is manifesting echolalia. Think back on how many times you have returned to check on a door you know you’ve locked...imagine yourself doing this 100 times... and you’ve got compulsivity (the same thing goes with hand-washing, or certain phobias, or other species of irrational psycho-physical behavior).One figure in this book can look at a cityscape for five seconds, go to his apartment, sit down and drawn all the buildings he’s seen in that fast glimpse with astonishing accuracy. What he can’t do is engage in something that shows up in many of Sacks’s case studies: relate his subjective self to your subjective self. He is alone with his perceptions more than with his feelings. His inter-connectedness is not the same as most people’s.Another figure in the book obsessively paints, in excruciating detail, the village in Italy where he grew up 25 years ago. He sees that village in 3-D while working in his garage in California, and he’s got to record it from every angle and perspective, catching all the structural features and the way every stone “used to look.” When he revisits the village, the stones don’t look that way anymore and the village is just about dead. That’s hard on him. But after ten days shock, he returns to his old task: recreating the images of his childhood again and again and again.What are we to make of this? Again, I’d submit there’s some of it in all of us, and it’s fascinating. A surgeon with Tourette’s Syndrome crying out weird noises and tapping his head and clicking his heels and making funny faces...who becomes utterly focused and expert in the operating room? Not possible? Yes, possible...and interesting to encounter.Even more interesting is the implicit question Sacks’s scientific observations raise: are we, in our more “normal” feeling, subjective, integrated mode simply highly functioning animate conglomerations of matter...or is there some additive spirit or soul that pulls us together...while failing to do so for people who are autistic?I was somewhat astonished to read that Picasso said something to the effect that artists are made rather than born. If you look at his drawings from childhood, you’d think he was a born artist, but in comparison to the artistic prodigy known as Nadia, perhaps Picasso had a point.On the other hand, if Nadia and others could produce graphic gems at very, very early ages, wasn’t she born with this gift? And if she had the gift, don’t we all? And if we all have it, how could we summon it...or nurture it...or at least not suppress and ruin it through our conventional upbringing?The final essay in the book, “An Anthropologist on Mars,” focuses on the famous autistic scientist, Temple Grandin. What she possesses is immense technical and objective skill, an affinity for animals, and a great deal of confusion when it comes to “relating” to human beings. She doesn’t react to other people so much as try to figure them out; she does a pretty good job of it, but her emotional life appears quite constrained. For her there will be no lover, no children. There just won’t be. She knows she doesn’t get that kind of relationship, and she’s written it off.Again, if Temple can feel strongly about cows and pigs, and design mechanisms to improve their lives as they are fattened for death, but doesn’t feel quite so strongly about human beings, does she lack something soulful? Something most of us would not care to surrender to be as smart as she is?Sacks doesn’t have an answer for these questions other than to point out that humanity is not a homogenized, perfectly evolved unity...nor should anyone feel ostracized for possessing some gifts to such an extent, almost beyond comprehension, that they lack others.This is a very good book, definitely worth reading. It’s about human nature. It’s about us.For more of my comments on contemporary writing, see Tuppence Reviews (Kindle)."
57,0330343475,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7392004-quo,4,"Books by Dr. Oliver Sachs are not so easy to review or to recommend, at least not without knowing one's fellow reader fairly well. To suggest that the author's books deal in case studies of people with neurological deficits would not normally seem a very compelling inducement for a non-clinician to read them, except that Dr. Sachs makes these case studies and the people who manifest the conditions detailed within them seem very compelling indeed. Oliver Sachs writes in manner that makes his own natural curiosity & level of fascination with the people profiled most contagious for the general reader, definitely not an easy task. And as with most authors, the more one knows about them, the more this insight into their personality & background seems to enhance the reading of their work.Many of the case studies in An Anthropologist on Mars: Seven Paradoxical Tales appeared in The New Yorker magazine but even if read previously, they continue to be of interest at 2nd reading, at least for me because the tales illustrate the amazing complexity and the incredible diversity of the human mind & sensory systems, as well as the ability to adapt in the face of adversity. In some of the profiles in this & other books by Dr. Sachs, the disorders are organic, while in other cases, they are a result of an accident or illness. I think what transforms the case studies or ""paradoxical tales"" for the casual reader is the author's always-hopeful attitude & the warmth of his personal involvement, seemingly never confined to a doctor/patient role but rather serving as a friend/advocate & a fellow-explorer of human consciousness in its many manifestations. I had the good fortune to meet Oliver Sachs when he spoke at a university, later chatting with those on hand & autographing copies of this book. In person, Oliver resembles so very much the portrait of him by Robin Williams in the wonderful film adaptation of his book Awakenings, rather shy but yet warmly personal. Not long after this meeting, I also was able to meet Dr. Temple Grandin, the ""Anthropologist on Mars"" when she also spoke locally in support of her book Thinking in Pictures.My keen interest in books by Dr. Sachs very likely stems from the neurological tales not being full of clinical detail but rather always seeming to encapsulate the humanity of the individual behind the case studies. While they would hardly be considered ""beach books"", Sachs is a gifted writer, almost functioning as a translator & I would find his tales absorbing to read under almost any condition. To illustrate the extent of his reach, Sachs relates some of his findings to various syndromes that afflicted authors, artists & scientists such as Dostoyevsky, Lewis Carroll, Poe, Newton, Strindberg, Paganini, Proust & Van Gogh, among others, for example, citing studies that attribute Tourette's Syndrome to Samuel Johnson & Mozart and autism to Bartok & Einstein. Meanwhile, manic-depressive illness seems to have been the lot of Robert Burns, Blake, Byron, the Brontes, Baudelaire, Boswell, Berlioz & others, just to make reference to some of the creative ""B""s, as Sachs puts it. Temple Grandin's autism is extremely limiting in that she is unable to even comprehend ""normal"" emotional responses to events such as splendid sunsets or to feel a sense of physical kinship with others but this is somehow surmounted by her heightened empathy for animals, something that has aided her as a professor of Animal Science in designing a less threatening environment for cattle headed to slaughter and also to deal with her own needs by fabricating a squeeze machine, rather like a modified tanning bed to provide a sense of warmth & enveloping non-personal contact for herself. There is a color-blind painter, someone who as a result of an accident can only see the world in black & white but who continues to probe his creative depths by painting wonderful images without color, like filtering the world through an old black & white television screen. And a man afflicted with Tourette's Syndrome, is rather astonishingly able to overcome the facial tics & uncontrolled gesticulations, only when functioning as a brain surgeon or piloting his own small aircraft. At the end of the filmed version of Awakenings, when the dormant or comatose patients, the result of an encephalitis outbreak ages ago & who have been under treatment by Dr. Sachs, relapse after a brief awakening, he doesn't lose hope and almost immediately launches a new phase of his attempt to cure them or at least to ameliorate their condition. There is a similar feeling in considering the 7 ""paradoxical tales"" in this book, a sense not of unrealistic optimism but rather of endeavoring to expand the horizons of human understanding about those whose conditions Dr. Sachs has so memorably embraced.

The title got to me, I had absolutely no idea what it was about but I had to find out. I finally got to reading it after years and years. Awesome book, amazing and fascinating information about autism."
