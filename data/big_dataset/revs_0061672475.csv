0,0061672475,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1526851-will-byrnes,4,"Ms. Pepperberg began doing research on the cognitive capacities of a Gray parrot, Alex, in the 1970s, a time when animals were widely believed to be little more than bio-automatons, lacking not only intellectual capability, but emotions as well. Pepperberg endured years, decades of ridicule, scorn, resistance and a continuing challenge in attempting to find funding to persist with her work. This is her story of Alex, a remarkable animal, clearly possessed of great personality, intelligence, even a sense of humor. I know from personal experience that animals are much more than animated machines. I have wept at the loss of some of these, both screamed and laughed at their antics. Pepperberg has written a moving story not only about her challenges as a professional researcher, but about her relationship with Alex. This is a fast read, but it is filled with the joy of discovery, delight in the personality of this remarkable bird, and great sadness when Alex passes on. It sounds like a cliché, and probably is, but in reading this book, I really did laugh out loud and I really did cry. This is a moving read as well as an informative one.=============================EXTRA STUFFFebruary 2018 – NatGeo – Brainiacs - by Virginia Morell - The focus here is on brainpower, not personality, per se, but is remarkable is in showing that our avian friends are hardly featherweights when it comes to cranial capacity and relationships. Alex comes in for a look."
1,0061672475,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1228888-jessica,2,"So, here's what I expected: a touching memoir about the trials and tribulations -- and joys and moments of wonder -- of working closely with a remarkable creature.I've heard it said that children often have an easier time bonding with animals than adults. If I were going to theorize, I'd say that maybe it's because although animals may have an inner life that resembles that of humans -- Alex certainly seemed to -- it's not often as developed in animals. They're too busy surviving to spend much time navel-gazing. Perhaps in their understanding of self, they've developed to a state equivalent to that of a young child, and therefore, children relate very easily to them and vice versa.I do not mean to sound insulting to Dr. Pepperberg when I say this, as she's clearly a woman of outstanding intelligence and perseverance. But she also comes across as someone who never finished growing up, and unfortunately, that immaturity is highlighted in this memoir.There's actually not much space spent, in an already slight book, on her relationship with Alex. Instead, the main theme seems to be: ""No one in academia, including my husband, believed in my work with Alex. They were very mean to me. Alex showed them, though, and so did I!""Pepperberg spends a while talking about her childhood, indignantly telling us about a scarring experience from her childhood, wherein she was too painfully shy to thank a baker for a cookie she was offered, and handed it back when the baker teasingly asked for it, and her mother was annoyed with her.Honey, if that's the worst experience you can remember from your childhood...well, maybe you're better off not writing about that part of your life if you're looking for sympathy.Pepperberg also attributes the worst possible motivations to anyone who wasn't 100% behind her. At one point, she tells us about telling a department admin that she's getting married. The admin asks her when she'll be leaving the department.Now, this took place in (if I recall correctly) the 60s or 70s, so that would hardly be an uncommon question. Most women at that time *did* retire when they married, to focus on being a homemaker and, eventually, a mother. Pepperberg assumes the woman is bitter because she doesn't have an academic career, and is thinking Hurray! Now a man can take this woman's position, as is appropriate. She doesn't describe anything about the woman's behavior that would suggest such pettiness and resentment behind her common assumption, but clearly expects us to sympathize with her indignant reaction.Further, while I haven't read any of Pepperberg's academic work, if she writes there like she does here, I understand why she had a hard time being taken seriously. When young Alex doesn't cooperate one day, she writes in her journal: ""Alex being incredibly stupid today!""Who above the age of 10 thinks in those terms about an animal -- or even a young human -- that they're teaching? When it comes to animals, any good trainer knows that A) animals have moods too, and B) in general, if an animal is repeatedly misbehaving, it's usually the fault of the trainer, not the animal. It seems rather immature on Pepperberg's part to be thinking -- and journaling -- in terms of ""stupidity"" rather than a lack of cooperation.I feel bad for her, more than anything else. Bright kids often have trouble learning to socialize normally, and it seems like Pepperberg suffered from this and the resulting social anxiety and was never helped -- or forced -- to get past it and finish growing up. All in all, the memoir is frustratingly self-centered, Pepperberg comes across as fairly unlikable, and we don't get nearly enough of Alex. The prose is readable, but Pepperberg is obnoxious enough that I ended up skimming for Alex's name and reading those sections, while skipping past the rest."
2,0061672475,http://goodreads.com/user/show/220791-lena,4,"Irene Pepperberg was just finishing up a PhD in chemistry when a nature program on animal cognition caused her to abruptly change fields and begin the life-long study of the learning abilities of African Gray parrots. At the time she first purchased a 13-month old Gray from a Chicago pet store, prevailing behaviorist theory held that animals were strictly creatures of instinct, incapable of true language or higher order thinking. Pepperberg's work with her bird Alex, along with similar work being done with chimpanzees and dolphins, directly challenged these assumptions and helped change the way that we think about animal brains.There are several stories woven within Pepperberg's memoir about her thirty years with Alex. She discusses her training methodology and the various breakthroughs they had that demonstrated Alex's brain was clearly capable of doing all sorts of things science claimed he shouldn't be able to do. There is another thread that traces Pepperberg's struggle to gain funding and recognition for her work, her battles with academic politics and scientific dogma, and how her one pound ball of feathers helped to undermine centuries of human hubris regarding cognitive abilities we thought were unique to us. Finally, this is also an emotional tale of a scientist who fell in love with her primary subject despite all of her efforts to maintain objectivity. It's hard to say who was the real teacher in Pepperberg's learning experiment with Alex, but there is no question the world is a richer place for their work together."
3,0061672475,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1402421-leanne-ellis,4,"I loved it! I tried to read The Alex Studies years ago, but it was so heavy on the scientific detail and analysis that I lost interest. This is written for the non-scientist with such a lovely, human voice. As a long-time bird lover who is very aware of how intelligent birds can be, I still found my mouth literally dropping open in surprise at some of the intellectual feats Alex accomplished. (He could add! He could sound out words!) And I laughed out loud at some of the anecdotes she shares, particularly the ones showing how mischievous Alex could get when he became bored with a task.) My only dissatisfactions with the book were 1. the fact that he died so unexpectedly and at such a young age, a fact that the book couldn't help and 2. she never explained what the autopsy found, leaving me with a huge question of Why? What happened? as I closed the book."
4,0061672475,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2243098-mmars,3,"On October 25 2002, within two weeks of his possible re-election, Senator Paul Wellstone and his wife, Sheila, were killed in an airplane crash. Stunned, a public service was put together honoring him. Speakers from many walks of life spoke in his honor. Unsurprisingly (and Paul would likely have enjoyed it) the speeches became political. The media and opposite party villified this aspect of an overwhelmingly emotional event that spilled out into the streets. Disrturbingly, the scapegoat of all of this was his son. His son! Can you imagine? BOTH your parents have been suddenly been ripped away forever from your life. They were hugely influential in public life. Paul, gregarious, with an ear always open to anyone who would talk to him, and Sheila, mostly known for her dedication to the causes of battered women. Can you imagine? You are overwhelmed by sudden grief, as is the public and likely 99% of the people you are in daily contact with. You say things that under almost any other circumstance would have been uttered only to that one person who is there to give you an ear in the lowest point of your life, and then the opposing party (if you don't know which one it was, please do some gooogling) manipulators go whining to the media ""Unfair, unfair!"" and the media just eats it up. Your words are their toys. Grief! We are talking about grief here. One of the most powerful and unpredictable emotions that exist. It's been over eleven years since this happened and the shameful politically motivated actions of his opponent's party (If you don't know his opponent, gooogle smarmy, he just might pop up) still bring a surge of negative emotions to my surface. Why am I bringing this up? Because I do not want anyone to think I am being insensitive to the grief Irene Pepperberg expresses for the first chapter of this book. I can only say that I have grieved over the loss of pets in my life, and can verify that such grief is as real and overwhelming as grief over the loss of a human companion. I cannot say whether the publisher/editor or the author decided to begin the book with Pepperberg's and the public's grief over the loss of Alex, an African Gray parrot, but I found it unfortunate way to begin what was an otherwise fascinating book. I believe it was grief that directed this book. Otherwise, why start with an obituary from the the NY Times rather than an amusing and engaging anecdote, of which there are many? I was led to believe this book would be about Alex and his remarkable intellectual abilities. So when it started by focusing on the author's loss and childhood, I would likely have stopped reading if not for this being a book group choice. All in all the book could have been better. But Pepperberg is not a writer, she is a researcher who so happened to spend her entire life in the company of an animal who displayed human thought and speech beyond what anyone ever thought possible. This was published within a year of Alex's death. She was still in grief. And that's okay. Any animal lover will appreciate Alex and Irene's story. So, don't hesitate to read it. The substance is fascinating and it reads quickly. I'm just a discerning reader. Authors often revisit and rewrite topics that they know well. I would love to see Pepperberg do this now that time has passed."
5,0061672475,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1613564-sandra-dark,3,"I'm on p.40--and very surprised that the author is taking so long to get into her and Alex's story. These 40 pages could have been condensed into an Introduction.Okay, I finished this. And once Dr. Pepperberg got past talking about herself, Alex came to life. The degree of communication that he developed with human language was astounding--just one example of how little humans have credited the ability of other species to communicate among themselves, let along cross-species.Overall, the book was poorly structured. (The first 100 pages should have been condensed into a handful, and the final chapter, following Alex's untimely demise, went THUD. And I thought 30 years of research with Alex deserved more pages than she allowed.)Pepperberg seemed so self-focused. At the end, she describes the agony of taking Alex's remains for an autopsy--but then does not reveal the results of that procedure. So you don't get to know why Alex died prematurely."
6,0061672475,http://goodreads.com/user/show/50966750-da-al,5,Much enjoyed learning about the capacity of animals to learn and about their intrinsic unique personalities. Also appreciated the author's account of being a woman scientist having to fight gender prejudices and those against animals.
7,0061672475,http://goodreads.com/user/show/563794-amy,3,"I'm personally not a bird person, but I started listening to the audiobook version of this book mainly because it was available from my library, but also because a co-worker has a 2-year-old African grey parrot named Gracie. After hearing tales from him about his bird child that sound very similar to tales I tell of my 2-year-old human child, I thought this would be an interesting book to read. Not more than a couple of hours after I finished reading this book about a famous African Grey Parrot who died at age 30 did I hear the fresh news of a bird named Horace who died after being in a friend's family for 45 years. That phrase really struck me ... a bird that had ""been in the family for 45 years"". Having an animal is always a big responsibility, but I cannot imagine having a bird that would outlive me and have to be passed along within the family. Losing such a bird would be like losing a family member in many ways.A few weeks ago, we had to put our dog down. It was hard enough to do so with an animal that couldn't talk. We hoped she couldn't understand what we were saying. But if she could talk and we knew that she could understand the decisions that we were making in front of her, I don't think the decision-making process would have been the same. If she had been a bird that could comprehend what we were saying and could say, ""please don't put me to sleep,"" I think I would have been a complete basketcase for weeks rather than be able to get on with my life. It's sad but true that we as humans react differently to living beings based on their size, longevity, and ability to communicate with and understand us.The author tells us about her childhood and how she rarely socialized with anyone (other than her pet birds) until she started school. She grew up in a family that was not very demonstrative with their affection. That type of childhood is very foreign to me, so I'm glad that she started the book explaining this. I can't even imagine what type of social issues someone would have starting school if they'd really never reacted with anyone outside their family (and barely with anyone within her family). This background very much explains why she originally embarked on this project with the idea that she was going to approach her research project with Alex the bird from a strictly clinical point of view. She wasn't going to let herself become emotionally attached to him. However, the 30 years that she spent with him seem to have created a change within her because she did become emotionally attached to him. And she did come to the conclusion that she needed to study the intelligence of birds within a social rather than a clinical setting. I had a 2-fold reaction to this book:1. How horrible it must have been to be a bird subjected to scientific experimentation for 30 years. How tedious to keep answering the same questions over and over about the names of objects, their color, and their size. 2. How wonderful that someone discovered how complex animal brains can be. And how great for this bird that he had someone to keep him from being bored day in and day out (if he was going to have to live in captivity).I've also drawn some interesting conclusions as a result of reading it:1. Birds are more fascinating and intelligent than I originally thought.2. If a bird-sized brain can understand concepts like ""none"" and use phonics, then how much more intellectually advanced are the animals all around us who can't vocalize their thoughts?3. Most people shouldn't own birds because most people cannot provide them with the time and attention that they need to not become bored. 3. I never want to own a bird. I didn't have any desire to own one before, and now I really know that I don't ever want a bird (especially one that can talk). That said, since reading this, I've become more aware of the birds that frequent my yard. I noticed them before, but I didn't think of them in terms of personalities. Now I wonder how old they might be, what they're thinking, and what personalities they have. We have a new mockingbird in the yard that's been lately antagonizing the neighborhood porch kitty (that my 2-year-old named Cumin). Cumin's been dive-bombed on numerous occasions. And I have to wonder what's going through the mockingbird's head. With the mockingbird's ability for language-acquisition, it makes me think that his/her thought process must be a complex one indeed. One thing that my co-worker has said about his African grey parrot is that living with Gracie is like living with a little alien. Even though she speaks English, the thought processes she has seem to be very foreign to ours. However, being around a talking bird is beyond just being around someone who has a different culture. The author of this book made a similar statement in her conclusion. So I think that I'm going to from now on see birds as little aliens that we live among. Thus, the fabled ""little green alien"" we've been waiting for is as close as your nearest tree or pet store. "
8,0061672475,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7757273-lynn-g,4,"I had read an article about Alex the African Grey parrot some years ago, prior to his death. I was fascinated by Alex's ability to communicate with Irene Pepperberg, who purchased him at a Chicago-area pet store when she began her research at Purdue University in the 1970s.This book was both a personal tale of Alex's life and a non-technical look at the journey along the path of theories of communication and language and how animals and humans fit into the continuum. Alex had an irrepressible personality and a gift for learning. Time and again he defied the conventional wisdom about what a ""bird-brain"" had the capacity to do. Irene Pepperberg, Alex's owner and the scientist who conducted the research about Alex, also defied what were considered to be the norms of animal behavior research and ""boldly went where no one had gone before"". Pepperberg broke new ground with Alex. Many colleagues in animal behavior research openly mocked her methods and questioned her results. She was denied funding and grants repeatedly because of her unconventional approach to the study of animal behavior.Ultimately, Pepperberg demonstrates that her methods were rigorous and produced statistically and practically significant results. Alex didn't simply mimic words and sounds that he heard but that he understood concepts, attributes, phonemic awareness, and some basic mathematical concepts; similar to those of a 5-year-old child. Additionally, Alex spontaneously came up with his own words to describe objects; for example ""cork nuts"" for almonds.Alex became a well-known personality in his own right, appearing on PBS's Scientific American Frontiers; being featured in articles in mainstream media as well as scientific journals. While reading Alex & Me I became an avid fan of Alex and delighted in his over the top personality. There is no doubt that Alex was in-charge; of the lab, of the scientists studying him, and the students who assisted in the research. ""The most profound lesson that Alex taught us concerns the place of Homo sapiens in nature. The revolution in animal cognition of which Alex was an important part teaches us that humans are not unique, as we long believed. We are not superior to all other beings in nature. The idea of humans' separateness from the rest of nature is no longer tenable. Alex taught us that we are a part of nature, not apart from nature."" I would recommend Alex and Me to anyone who enjoys animals and is interested in the science of their behavior."
9,0061672475,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1198520-jennifer,4,"A lot has been said about Pepperberg and her research, but what touched me was that Pepperberg wanted so much to prove her scientific chops that she often forced herself to keep an emotional distance from her beloved parrot while he was alive. This book is in large part an outpouring of her love, which gives it great power. My daughter, who is studying animal science at Ohio State, made her boyfriend listen to her read the entire last chapter over the phone."
10,0061672475,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1396335-amy,4,"I read this book because I'm putting a parrot in my next novel. I confess that I skipped past the first few chapters about her early life--I was all SHOW ME THE PARROT. But soon enough, we got to the parrot, and that part was totally satisfying. I was totally fascinated to learn just how far a parrot's language skills and comprehension could go. It was one of those books that had me constantly nudging my husband and saying, ""Listen to this. You won't believe it."""
11,0061672475,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1085121-stephanie-extremely-stable-genius,5,"I listened to this on audio. I used to have a budgie (parakeet), And I have seen first hand how smart those little birds are. I recommend this book to any animal lover. Alex was amazing!!"
12,0061672475,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1237196-petra-x,4,"I've followed Dr. Pepperberg and her subject, Alex, for many years. This book was written after Alex's death and is much more about Dr. Pepperberg who isn't very interesting, than the fantastically deep and intelligent Alex. A disappointing book."
13,0061672475,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1019021-dolly,5,"I really enjoyed listening to this audiobook because of how fascinating Alex was and how much we can all learn from the animals in our lives. Not to be morbid, but I wondered what the results of the autopsy showed, and found the answer here"
14,0061672475,http://goodreads.com/user/show/307041-ginny-messina,5,"I saw Alex on TV many years ago and fell head-over-heels in love. He was so personable and smart and adorable! While I wasn’t wild about Irene Pepperberg’s writing style and found her to be not quite as likeable in the book as she is in television interviews, the story of how she taught Alex and helped to reveal the incredible intelligence of these birds was still wonderful. And it’s an important book for anyone who cares about animal protection and animal rights. As Dr Pepperberg notes: “…a vast world of animal cognition exists out there, not just in African Grey parrots, but in other creatures, too [...:] Clearly animals know more than we think, and think a great deal more than we know.” It’s hard to imagine that anyone could read this book and come away thinking that we have the right to use animals as we please. "
15,0061672475,http://goodreads.com/user/show/57126559-kelly-moore,5,"This book is all about Alex, an incredibly intelligent African Grey. Sadly, Alex is no longer with us, but what he has taught us will live on forever.I own an African Grey named Felix. I've wanted one ever since I was four years old. We had a friend of the family who had one. Their grey could have an actual conversation with you. On top of being a bird person, why not want one that could do that?! They are incredibly smart, creative, and loving birds. Irene Pepperberg studied the intelligence level of these birds for years. Alex is her outstanding student whom she focuses on in this book. I highly recommend this book to all of my fellow animal lovers!"
16,0061672475,http://goodreads.com/user/show/73029907-cav,5,"This was a super-interesting short read. It takes a while to get going, as she spends the first chapter reading letters of condolences she received after Alex died, and then goes into her early life and childhood in some detail.The book picks up steam, thankfully, when she moves on to talk about Alex, the African Grey parrot the book is written about. Irene Pepperberg was challenging much of the scientific orthodoxy in animal behavioural studies when she began testing Alex, and had a lot of trouble getting funding and traction for her research. As she describes it:
""My plans for training Alex differed from the accepted standards of the time. Under the prevailing psychological dogma known as behaviorism, animals were seen as automatons, with little or no capacity for cognition, or thought. Biology was little better, dominated by theories claiming that much of animal behavior was innately programmed. Experimental conditions for working with animals were very tightly prescribed. Animal subjects were actually supposed to be starved to 80 percent of their body weight so they would be eager for the food given for a “correct” response. They were also to be placed in a box so that the appropriate “stimuli” could be very tightly controlled and their responses precisely monitored. The technique was known as “operant conditioning.” This was, to me, completely crazy, not to put too fine a point on it. It was contrary to all my gut instincts and commonsense understanding of nature.""
Before reading ""Alex & Me"", my knowledge of parrots was minimum, so this book was a real eye-opener for me. Some of the things she describes Alex doing are incredible; his capacity for speech, he learned how to count (to a degree), and he was even assisting in training another parrot! Author Irene Pepperberg has had a difficult career; both in tackling the scientific orthodoxy and dominant narrative of ""behaviourism"", as well as trying to keep her research afloat and receiving grant funding.This book is very well-written, and I thoroughly enjoyed it. She drops a neat qoute near the end, tragically right before talking about Alex's death:
""As I stood quietly there for a few minutes, savoring the coffee’s rich aroma, a thought crossed my mind, as it did from time to time, something that my friend Jeannie once said: had I gotten a different Grey that day back in 1977, Alex might have spent his life, unknown and unheralded, in someone’s spare bedroom. I didn’t, of course, and here we were with a history of astonishing achievements behind us, and poised to journey to the next horizon and beyond in our work together.""
I would definitely recommend this book to anyone interested in animal intelligence, cognition and/or ethology. 5 stars."
17,0061672475,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1390765-diane,5,"Alex and Me, an avian memoir was such a joy to listen to. The reader was terrific. The story was poignant and funny at the same time.About the book - POSSIBLE SPOILERSPartly autobiographical, Irene Pepperberg's memoir reveals info about her own life, starting with her lonely, bleak childhood where her best friend was a dime-store parakeet called ""No Name.""The author was an overachiever. She was just 16 when she was accepted by (M.I.T.) Massachusetts Institute of Technology with her latest pet parakeet. After graduating, she earned her Ph.D. in chemistry at Harvard. But she found herself more compelled by the field of animal communication.She chose African Grey parrots for her research because of their intelligence and clear speech. In 1976, the baby bird she named Alex — an acronym for Avian Language Experiment — was chosen at random from a cage in a pet shop.When Alex died on September 6, 2007, it was a shock, because African Grey parrots generally live 50 to 60 years in captivity. His passing was devastating because Alex wasn't your normal, run-of-the-mill African Grey parrot; Alex was special. For the last 30 years, Alex had been the focus of research into the cognitive abilities of African Grey parrots. The goal was to see if Alex could ""think"", and he could!Although his brain was no bigger than a walnut, when Alex died, he could identify 50 different objects, had a vocabulary of about 150 words, recognized quantities up to six and distinguished between seven colors and five shapes. More importantly, he had a grasp of concepts. He could tell you which objects were bigger, smaller, the same or different and why.Alex would say, ""I'm sorry,"" if he sensed that a researcher was annoyed with him. When he would get tired of his work and the questions, he'd say, ""I wanna go back"" (to his cage).Alex and his owner developed a strong emotional relationship. When Alex died in September 2007, his last words to Pepperberg the day before were: ""You be good. I love you.""I LOVE LOVED this audio book. There was just one thing that I was disappointed about. When Alex died unexpectedly at the young age of 31, they mentioned that they had a necropsy performed to determine the cause of death. Unfortunately, there was no mention of the results, which to me left unfinished business for the reader. Even if they were unable to determine the cause of death, something should have been mentioned at the end about this. Despite that, if you are an animal lover, be sure to give this book a try. I doubt that you will be disappointed."
18,0061672475,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4449127-emily,4,"This book has been on my reading list for years, since I first read a couple of Temple Grandin’s books that mentioned Pepperberg’s work with Alex. What she and Alex accomplished together was fascinating, and it’s tragic he died a couple decades earlier than he should have. I enjoyed the specific anecdotes about Alex and the students who worked on their studies, and I would have welcomed more. It was interesting too, and disheartening, to read what a struggle Pepperberg had, despite breakthroughs and growing fame, staying funded and employed, to say nothing of her fight to be taken seriously in the larger scientific community. I recommend this to people who enjoy memoirs and are interested in animal intelligence. And don’t skip the NPR interview transcript at the end of the book, as well as a FAQ section—they wrapped things up nicely. "
19,0061672475,http://goodreads.com/user/show/38756055-rae,5,"Okay so I finished this book abnormally fast due to a combination of sleeplessness and the intense interest in the connection between bird and human. I am ashamed to admit that I emotionally impulse bought a green cheek conure back in December and boy oh boy, do I wish I would have been a responsible pet owner about it and done research prior to this purchase. But with striking similarities to 'Marley & Me', I have whole wholeheartedly fallen in love with my feathered friend. And this book just makes me want to run home from wherever I am to squeeze the bejeezus out of him. The information, the story, the heartwarming detail... Pepperberg does an absolutely splendid job telling her and Alex's love story. I HIGHLY RECOMMEND THIS BOOK FOR ANY BIRD OWNER."
20,0061672475,http://goodreads.com/user/show/9372160-ivy-moser,5,"LOVED THIS BOOK! I was a little intimidated at first, worried that it would be too academic, but it's very accessible and easy to read. And fascinating! Besides getting to know Alex, the personality-plus African grey parrot and star of the story, I loved reading about Dr. Pepperberg's musings on how research on animal behavior and language acquisition influences how we see ourselves as humans and our place in the hierarchy of nature.Dr. Pepperberg's overview of the human attitude of conquering/subduing/using nature reminded me of how we humans have lost touch with our connection to nature, and see it as resource for our use and abuse--and now our oceans are clogged with plastic and our atmosphere is heating up and our bodies are polluted with toxins and pseudo-food. Dr. Pepperberg's ideas about where this all started stem from thousands of years ago: From the book (page 215): ""Aristotle, in the fourth century B.C.E. constructed a view of the natural world that is, in its essence, still with us. He ordered all living and nonliving thins on a ladder of perceived importance based on the mind. Humans were at the top...On lower rungs were the lesser creatures and finally the plants...The Judeo-Christian tradition enthusiastically adopted Aristotle's blueprint, in which humans were given dominion over all living things and the earth. This description of nature came to be known as the Great Chain of Being. Humans were not only different from all other of God's creatures, but also distinctly superior...All other living things were for our exploitation.""I'm sure it's too simple to say this all goes back to Aristotle's ladder of hierarchy, but it did make me wonder--what would happen if we adopted a new view of nature? One that does not center on dominance and abuse, but us understanding how dependent we all are every link in the web, from whales to mites, and placing value on ALL living things?Another quote from page 222: “The most profound lesson that Alex taught us concerns the place of Homo sapiens in nature. The revolution in animal cognition of which Alex was an important part teaches us that humans are not unique...We are not superior to all other beings in nature. The idea of humans’ separateness from the rest of nature is no longer tenable. Ales taught us that we are a part of nature, not apart from nature. The “separateness” notion was a dangerous illusion that gave us permission to exploit every aspect of the natural world—animal, plant, mineral—without consequences. We are now facing those consequences: poverty, starvation, and climate change, for example."

The author grew up quite alone except for a bird to which she told her deepest secrets. Her father traveled a good deal and her mother was angry because she needed to stay home with a child. And, yes, as a child Irene Pepperberg recognized the anger was because of her.As she grew up she decided that science, chemistry in particular, would be her major. Graduating with a PhD she realized that she did not want to do research in chemistry but with birds. Reading everything she could find about the topic she decided that she could work with grey parrots and acquired one of her own which she named Alex. Finding funding and laboratory space was difficult because she had no track record in this area nor was it an accepted area of scientific research. But Pepperberg was determined and through years of grant writing, training and teaching Alex, and living often from hand to mouth she gradually gained prestige for her work.Alex was an unusual bird, probably a genius of his kind as he developed communication far beyond what anyone else had accomplished with a nonhuman species. He became a celebrity on the television screens and in newspapers. He learned numbers, colors, shapes and how to communicate in short phrases with his human handlers. The story is delightful and broked scientific ground as the public learned what is possible with a nonhuman species. I loved this read."

25,0061672475,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3503170-pseudonymous-d-elder,4,"____________________________________ Alex the Crackerer or Proof that Intelligence is for the Birds___________________________________We often use the word “parrot” disparagingly (as in “Little Timmy was obviously parroting the words of Charlie Sheen) to indicate that a speaker is mindlessly or mechanically repeating the words of another person without apparent understanding or thought. This book is about a parrot named Alex whose walnut-sized brain is helping to put an end to this particular slander of parrots, and to prove to mainstream scientists that some animals are more intellectually capable than science previously recognized. Alex was a feathered prodigy who, under the tutelage of scientist Irene Pepperberg and her students, learned to recognize shapes and colors, to count, to categorize materials by a variety of criteria, and even to recognize that words are made up of discrete phonemes.  Sometimes Alex showed cognitive abilities that were clearly not the direct result of instruction, such as when he proved that he could deliberately lie and, when punished for it, understand the error of his ways. This ability was first demonstrated when Alex became bored with an exercise that required him to count the number of objects that had certain characteristics from among several disparate objects on a tray. Alex had performed this task correctly hundreds of times, but on this particular day, Alex got fed up and started giving the wrong answer to a particular question. The correct answer was 2 but every time he was asked, Alex -- like a petulant four or five year old child -- would say 3 or 1 or 5 or 7 and studiously avoid the correct answer. As a result, Dr. Pepperberg decided Alex wasn’t in the mood to work that day, and put him in his cage in a room isolated from his human companions, a fate that the highly gregarious Alex hated. After a minute or so, Peppeberg and her students heard a plaintive cry from the Alex's room, “2 . . . 2 . .. come back . . . 2.The book is fascinating and well told. I highly recommend Alex and Me. I also recommend skipping the lengthy first chapter in which Pepperberg is working out her personal grief at Alex’s untimely death. It is painful, not of any real interest to the average reader, and not essential to understanding the rest of the book.Suggestion: Check out the videos of Alex the Parrot on Youtube. ”"
26,0061672475,http://goodreads.com/user/show/49219-beth,5,"A fantastic book about Dr Pepperberg and her parrot Alex. At the end i was afraid she was going to elevate animals above humans, she did not, but did a terrific job of defining our relationship with all of nature. I wish I could quote it here, but the book expired on my overdrive and we don't get enough data here to download it again( point for paper text--when it is overdue, it is still access able to you!) I love when my random choices of books coincide. I just ,started reading, really reading, but still digitally, Alan Alda's book ""If I Understood You,Would I Have This Look on my Face?"" Dr Pepper ( ;-) talks with great excitement about she and Alex being interviewed by Alan Alda and he writes about being asked by Scientific American to host Frontiers on PBS. Synchronicity, love it, loved the book!If you read this book and enjoy the Parrot info, try Dick King Smith's ""Harry's Mad"". It is a YA book but a wonderful story about a boy and his parrot. (by the author of Babe, the Gallant Pig among other fun animal tales.)"
27,0061672475,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3060391-zawn-v,2,"I wanted to love this book because I've read a lot of thirdhand information about Alex from other scientists. It seemed like it was high time to read commentary from the woman who actually knew and loved Alex. I hate to bash Dr. Pepperberg, because she's obviously an intelligent woman who has contributed much to science. But this book is ruined by its author.Much of the book is a screed about how much Pepperberg has suffered, how poorly understood she is, how difficult her childhood was. But none of her experiences strike me as particularly scarring or difficult; instead, her writing reads like the ramblings of an extremely privileged woman who is resentful that she did not immediately get what she wanted. Pepperberg quotes from her notes about Alex and her commentary is distinctly unscientific. Comments like, ""Alex is bitchy today!"" have no place in scientific research. She comes across as unstable, flying completely off the handle when Alex chews up a piece of paper. And there is little in the book about the actual research conducted or about Alex's capabilities. The book is also in dire need of an editor. Major events are completely left out. Pepperberg begins discussing her decision to move with her husband without ever previously discussing his existence, for example. She refers to him by name without so much as mentioning their relationship.All in all, a disappointment. And it only gets two stars because Alex--what little we see of him in the book-- is so damn charming. "
28,0061672475,http://goodreads.com/user/show/632247-chrissie,3,"Very good book about the intelligence of animals, but I preferred Wesley the Owl by Stacey O'Brien. Pepperberg is a true scientist. She is less inclined to loosen up and allow her emotions to take sway. And that is fine. To really convince the science world you have to do things that way, and look what she accomplished. Fabulous. Nevertheless, it was Alex's own unprompted speech which I found the most amazing, more so than the scientific experiments. I did not think the writing was as good either. I neither liked the first chapter nor the last, which gets very, very philosophical.I think my preference for O'Brien's book is based on the fact that I really didn't need convincing about the intelligence of animals other than humans. Also Pepperberg speaks a bit about her own youth, and I believe her character has been molded by the lack of emotion shown to her as a child. Gosh, another book that mentions the wonderful atmosphere at MIT lab. If I ever decided to go to school all over again - that is the place to go. If you can get in!"
29,0061672475,http://goodreads.com/user/show/21473623-veronyka-quarry,5,"I absolutely loved this book! Being an African Grey parrot mom, I learned so much about their intelligence. Alex was an amazingly smart bird. I like that he was so witty and had the classic attitude I see with my bird. When I speak of Alex to my friends they cannot believe some of the things he said and did. What a special bird! His death was tragic and I couldn't help but cry. I feel he knew his time had come. Alex had so much more to do on this Earth. It's such a shame he left so soon. Alex has touched my soul and even though I never knew about his story until recently I will never forget him.As for the author, Dr. Irene Pepperberg, I think she is a fantastic, patient research scientist. I do not think she was feeling sorry for herself when writing about her childhood. As for writing certain things in her journal I think she just simplified the day after long and tiresome training sessions. The book was written well. I would have liked to have had more Alex moments because his witty attitude made me laugh! I laughed and I cried. Well done Dr. Pepperberg. "

But I did enjoy it, read it basically in one sitting this morning before work--thankfully I was working late!

34,0061672475,http://goodreads.com/user/show/11749438-noreen,5,Fantastic. Takes a long time to disprove the common wisdom of the time. Dr Pepperberg proved that birds can learn by methods other than operant conditioning. 
35,0061672475,http://goodreads.com/user/show/285565-rebecca,2,"Alex and Me is a memoir about Alex, the famous parrot who could supposedly do all kinds of things that no one thought birds were capable of, including counting things and labeling things according to material, color, and size. I thought this book would have more information about the actual research, and I was disappointed that it didn't, because my gut reaction to hearing about Alex's cognitive feats is skepticism. Still, I thought that by reading more about Alex and how he was trained, I would become more convinced in the veracity of Dr. Pepperberg's claims. To be honest, though, this book had the opposite effect; I'm now even less convinced that Alex truly understood the labels he used. If you're unfamiliar with Alex, it'll be helpful to watch this short video showing one of his training sessions: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VZ2j1j.... I intentionally picked a session that wasn't selected for a news story or an Animal Planet special, because one of my points of contention about Alex is that the video clips you normally see of him are so edited that you don't see all the times he messed up and got things wrong. In Alex and Me, Dr. Pepperberg tries to justify Alex's errors by saying that he was often bored because the questions eventually got too easy for him. Sure, the much more likely explanation for why a parrot doesn't understand English is that it's just too easy for him. Right.Aside from my concerns about Dr. Pepperberg's methodology and transparency, I had a couple of issues with the way she chose to write the book and with her relationship with Alex. First of all, you don't have to read between the lines to be a little bit creeped out by the level of intimacy and affection she felt for a parrot. She seems to have trouble connecting to other people, as evidenced by her failed marriage. According to her, her husband just didn't understand or respect her work with Alex, but given how many times she ate dinner in her lab and spent weekends with her birds, I have to wonder if maybe the real reason for their divorce was that Dr. Pepperberg was more dedicated to Alex and her research than to her husband. She makes no allowance for the fact that it was possibly her own level of Captain Ahab-like obsession with Alex that drove a wedge through her marriage, and I found that to be really self-deluding. Something else that persistently annoyed me about this book was the way Dr. Pepperberg would make really strong, manipulative emotional appeals to the reader – for example, quoting sad letters people wrote when Alex died, giving us the sob story about her childhood and her special attachment to birds, and encouraging us to share her outrage at the stupid and vain scientists who didn't immediately and wholeheartedly embrace her innovative research and lavish her and Alex with praise and money. That would be bad enough as it is, but she made all of these emotional appeals without providing any evidence whatsoever. She was essentially asking her readers to trust all of her claims without seeing any proof, and then to get outraged with her when describing all the mean scientists who were demanding proof. I'm sure she's provided lots of evidence elsewhere, but not in this book. She readily admits that she has no psychology or linguistics training (her PhD is in chemistry), and yet we're supposed to believe that she knows what she's doing, despite reaching conclusions that go against the current wisdom in both psychology and linguistics. In fact, Dr. Pepperberg's whole approach to science and evidence was disconcerting. At one point she says, “Alex was teaching these skeptics about the extent of animal minds, but they were slow, reluctant learners.” In the context of the section of the book where that sentence appears, we are clearly meant to interpret the word skeptics as derogatory. The problem is, that word is a banner of pride for me. Why shouldn't the other scientists be skeptical? That's one of the defining characteristics of what it means to be a scientist! The burden of proof rests with the person making the claim. I'm not saying there aren't institutional biases against certain ideas and certain people within science (scientists are only human, after all), but Dr. Pepperberg seems a little quick to blame all her troubles at being accepted in the scientific community on the close-mindedness of her colleagues, when in reality I think she probably just didn't do a good enough job of producing or presenting the necessary evidence.It also bothered me that Dr. Pepperberg sneered at people who believe humans are superior to other animals, especially at the end of the book, when she got all eco and Native American and went on about the interconnectedness of all life. Sure, all life is connected and interdependent, but that doesn't mean you can't identify hierarchies for specific qualities. For example, dogs are superior to humans in terms of their sense of smell. To say that humans are superior to other animals in terms of language and cognition isn't the same thing as waving a “GO HUMANS, ANIMALS SUCK” sign – it's just a fact. You can still act respectfully and responsibly towards other creatures while admitting that humans are better users of language and better thinkers than any other animal that has yet to evolve. At one point she made the claim that “humans are not unique, as we long believed.” That statement just doesn't make sense. Of course we're unique – that's why we're grouped together as a species distinct from all other species. Every species is unique. That's what being part of a taxonomic group means – you and all the things like you are unique in nature; here's your very own category.Dr. Pepperberg mentions that scientists used to believe that humans were the only creatures to use tools, but Jane Goodall disproved that by showing that certain chimps make and use tools to get food. The difference (which Dr. Pepperberg fails to mention) is that chimps are still using the same primitive tools they've used for eons, and are unlikely to ever develop anything more sophisticated than what they have now. And, let's be honest, Goodall is using the term tool pretty loosely, since we're essentially talking about a stick that they use to poke things with. Humans have something called the ratchet effect (see Michael Tomasello's work if you're interested), which means that our inventions and innovations are cumulative over time, allowing one generation to build off of the previous generation's tools to make something better. No other animal has that. So if you're looking at superiority defined in terms of being able to build ever more sophisticated tools and artifacts, humans win, hands down. Dr. Pepperberg's hyper-PC attitude towards ecology and animal rights is overly self-conscious and flat-out inaccurate.She's also very adamant that her research disproves the claims of behaviorism, which holds that animals are automatons that respond to stimuli without really thinking or understanding what they're doing (which is exactly what some of the Alex experiments look like to me). The problem is, we don't actually know what – if anything – Alex is thinking during his training sessions. Animals can be trained to do some pretty amazing things with the promise of a tasty reward, but that doesn't prove that they understand “blueness” or “fiveness” the way humans do. I'm not saying behaviorism is right, I'm just saying that she didn't manage to successfully disprove behaviorism. We still have no way of seeing inside the black box of animals' brains, so I think it's wise to tread very carefully when making any claims about what they understand and know.I'm willing to cut Dr. Pepperberg some slack for using so many emotional appeals for something that I would normally expect an author to approach with more rigor, because she and her publishers clearly intended this to be a touchy-feely memoir rather than a scientific treatise. Still, I maintain that her attitude towards her research, at least as she presents it in this book, was entirely too subjective and biased. I mean, she chose Alex over her husband -- would she really be willing to admit it if her ostensible wunderkind of a bird turned out to be an ordinary animal that was just incredibly receptive to being trained?"
36,0061672475,http://goodreads.com/user/show/41821528-abhishek-naik,4,"For the longest time, ‘birdbrain’ has been used as a pejorative. Turns out, Grey parrots — non-primate, non-mammalian creature with brains the size of a shelled walnut — have cognitive and linguistic skills on par with those of large-brained mammalian chimps and 5-year old human toddlers.What could Alex do?* Label objects and colours* Had a functional use of ’no'* Could add, at least upto six with 85%+ accuracy* Understood the concept of zero, or none. * E.g., “What color five? None.” — this was Alex’s answer to which coloured quantity is five in number.* Understood that color and shape were categories and not simply labels by themselves and hence could answer ‘what color’ and ‘what shape'* Performed lexical elision: put two different words together to form a new word.  * E.g., called an apple ‘banerry’ — tastes like a banana + looks like a cherry* Understood what he was saying, i.e., seemed to have the ability to comprehend * If he said ‘want grape’ and you gave him a banana, he would spit it out and repeat the request. If any child did this, you would readily agree that they really wanted a grape and not a banana, right?* Would get bored and fool around — suggestive of sophisticated cognitive processes * When presented a silver object, he would say names of all the colours he knew except the correct color — statistically highly unlikely. * When asked how many objects when there two, he went 'One four one four' … when put back in his cage as a punishment … 'two, two, I’m sorry, come here!'* Was entitled and expected people to follow his orders.  * Would not pull a string up to get food, would order someone to get it for him. Other Greys who didn’t have as good a command of labels and requesting would pull up the string themselves.Dr Pepperberg points out that over time, defenders of the “humans are unique” doctrine have been moving the goalposts of what constitutes intelligent behaviour. Using tools, making tools, using language. And then, turns out a non-primate, non-mammal creature with a walnut-sized brain could learn elements of communication like large-brained mammals. Humans are a part of nature, not apart from nature. The 'separateness' is a dangerous illusion that led us to exploit every aspect of the natural — animals, plants, minerals — without consequences. We are not facing the consequences.The book is interleaved with details of the financial and psychological hardships Dr Pepperberg faced over the course of her career with Alex. Depending on how one looks at it, this adds a lot of depth to the book or becomes a distraction from what one wants from the book. I really enjoyed what I got out of this book."
37,0061672475,http://goodreads.com/user/show/504424-bup,5,"Dang what a great book. Pepperberg and Alex pretty much single-handedly showed the scientific world, who had previously seen birds as mindless automatons, that birds can be smart, and grey parrots in particular rival chimpanzees for verbal and math skills.Interestingly, I'm reading The Language Instinct: How the Mind Creates Language right now too, and while Pinker is making a great argument that humans do acquire language as an inborn process, I'm now noticing he's not addressing that other animals can't learn language. Which is kind of the point of the book, or, at least, a major theme of Pinker's career - that humans are unique in language ability. Maybe he thinks that demonstrating that humans pick it up instinctively is enough, implying that because other animals don't pick it up naturally they can't.Or maybe it gets to how you define language. If you define language as using verbal (or other) abstract labels to communicate, Alex could do it. If you define language as a very sophisticated grammar using those abstract labels, well, Alex had a pretty simple grammar. He knew that putting 'what' in front of a word with a rising intonation made something a question. And he knew the verb 'want.' Maybe he could have learned more. His early death is a tragedy."
38,0061672475,http://goodreads.com/user/show/72561929-randall-russell,5,"I really enjoyed this book, as it tells the remarkable story of a woman scientist who works with an African grey parrot for 30 years, and teaches him to speak, and in the process demonstrates that even with a brain the size of a walnut, the bird can reach a fairly high level of cognition. In addition, per her descriptions, the parrot also seems to exhibit a lot of ""personality,"" including dominating the other birds in the lab, and interrupting their training. I was really surprised by how much the bird was able to learn during those years, and I was also impressed with the difficulties that Dr. Pepperberf faced, largely because she was a woman scientist who was pursuing rather controversial research. When she started, animal cognition was regarded as unlikely at best, but now, some 40 years later, it is a much more accepted fact. So, if you want to have your perception of what it means to be a ""bird brain"" significantly altered, then I'd definitely recommend this book."
39,0061672475,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4839989-celia-barry,4,My dad had a parrot and it didn't like me. I was already an adult and didn't live with my parents but I felt sorry for the poor bird as I knew it would outlive my dad (it did) and that the bird's life was to be more of an interactive plant than a member of the household. I feel even worse about my dad's parrot now that I've read this wonderful book! Alex was an incredible being and Pepperberg did an outstanding job explaining about her relationship with Alex and the efforts she made to bridge the communication gap between them. Beautiful story.

I very much enjoyed the biographical bits of Pepperberg's youth, her education experience leading to a PhD in Chemistry, her struggles throughout her research and the descriptions of the variety of places where she did the work, and the descriptions of the training method and information found. The best parts were the little stories about Alex and her which went above and beyond the strict science. I loved this book."

Alex & Me is fine in the sense that it moves along quickly and seems to cover their history together but it was a bit on the sterile side and Dr. Pepperberg appears to have no ability to make what should be a funny story funny. At best her anecdotes are cute but they could have been much more.I don't recall whether I've seen them on television but I suspect that's the better way to appreciate their partnership.

Yet more proof (as if any more was needed) that other animals share many of the the traits that we consider uniquely human: language, problem solving, communication, etc. A good read."
52,0061672475,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1024357-jan,4,"This was a book we read recently in one of my book clubs. One of the things I love about being part of a book club, aside from getting together and having lively discussions about the things we loved or didn't love about a particular book, is that I get to read so many books that I probably never would have picked up on my own. Sometimes that's a good thing, and I'm so happy that someone suggested a certain book that I end up loving, like this book. Other times certain books let me know that the author is one I really don't connect with at all and will not seek out future works.Everyone in our book group enjoyed this story of Alex, the remarkable African Grey Parrot. We all agreed he was unusually intelligent, learning well over 100 words. The most amazing part was the cognitive ability he displayed, learning abstract concepts like same and different, smaller vs larger, and many different colors. I particularly loved his personality and how much he enjoyed bossing the the college interns around (who I called his minions). He could be quite naughty the way he would demand that they bring him all sorts of things, many of which he didn't even want as he was just messing with them, before he would consent to working with them. He had to do so many trials and repeat things over and over in order to make Dr. Pepperberg's research turn out acceptable findings that could be written up. I felt bad for Alex when this would happen as he was so smart, and all this repetition would cause him to be quite bored. Again he could then be quite naughty to make things interesting.I've always been a dog person. I've had cats also, but dogs have always been the animals that I related to on a heart level. After reading this book and coming to understand just how many human qualities Alex seemed to have, I could see how people could feel about a parrot in much the same way I've always felt about my dogs. I certainly could understand the special bond the author developed with this extraordinary bird. I ended up going on youtube to watch some of the videos of Alex and Dr. Pepperberg and connected with him even more after watching them. Seeing and hearing his goodnight routine that ended with ""I love you"" made me realize just how difficult it was to separate this tiny being from that of a human. When he died I was immensely sad, just like so many of his followers all over the world. I felt that we had lost a truly amazing and intelligent being that we could have learned so much more from. Dr. Pepperberg said, had she known all the future challenges she would incur, she might very well have abandoned her work early on and the world might not yet know what a misnomer the phrase ""bird brain"" is. Even though a bird's brain is so small, and shaped differently than a human's brain, it apparently has little to do with the ability to learn and reason. Dr. Pepperberg stated, ""Clearly, animals know more than we think, and think a great deal more than we know"". Alex surely was and is a testament to that."

Alex, an African Grey Parrot, and his owner, a Scientist; studied him throughout many years to prove Animal Intelligence. Funny things Alex did and said , stories of him acting out when his owner was trying to be serious, and stories of searching for funding and grants so his owner could continue her research are all included in this interesting story."

I've seen all the videos of signing chimps, and have visited the National Zoo and it's Think Tank. But I've never found birds particularly interesting and don't watch the news, so maybe I'd somehow missed all the 'thinking parrot' stories. I picked this up from the bargain books, and certainly consider it money and a day well spent.Pepperberg tries to break down animal behavior and psychology techniques for the layperson, and I think she does a good job. As someone with an undergrad pysch background, I wanted more details, but I understand what she's trying to do with this book.Some people have criticized her somewhat detached approach in her recollections of Alex in the middle of the book, but I can understand her need for reserve and distance. As a woman studying a field known for the 'Clever Hans' effect that she describes, there can't be any room for accusations of unprofessional attachment to these animals. I can appreciate what she describes of her fairly rigorous experiments considering the attention span of the birds, although I wasn't sure her excuses for their mistakes were always valid. The book was likeable and interesting, and the step by step explanations of the birds' cognition was well-done. Breaking down linguistics and developing cognition is difficult, and I think Pepperberg did well in her experiments and in her writing.It's not quite the heartwarming story I expect from most popular 'me and my animal' books, so don't pick it up expecting a Marley and Me. Much of the book is spent on the author's kvetching about how hard her life and academic career have been. Some sections leaned towards a thinly veiled plea for money and support of her foundation. But if she's truly scrambling for money to continue her (admittedly interesting) research, I won't begrudge her a book deal and a somewhat self-indulgent storytelling technique.If you're interested in birds, or language, or animal behavior, or pop psychology books, I'd highly recommend it. If you're looking for a quick and thought-provoking read and can look past some of the 'my life in academia is SO HARD' tendencies, pick it up. But I'm glad I paid $6 for the bargain version."
55,0061672475,http://goodreads.com/user/show/501971-jeff,3,"I read this almost on a lark (pun intended). I picked it up from a local lieberry weeks ago. It has been sitting around for my wife to read for her book club but she's busy with The Blind Assassin. I was about to read Julian Barnes's Flaubert's Parrot, so why not read both of these at the same time? Besides, i'm interested in science. I'm especially interested in language. I like animals (even though a high school friend's parrot scared the crap outa me). I decided to give it an honest go despite the seemingly sappy sentimental subtitle (can you say that, Alex!).Not a bad book, but i definitely wanted more of the science and methodology -- promised in Irene M. Pepperberg's The Alex Studies -- due to the lack of decent discussion (in my opinion) of the ""deep bond"" that was formed.In other words, i was disappointed that this book didn't strongly justify the scientific claim of the main title about ""a hidden world of animal intelligence"" and it failed (in my opinion) to deliver on the promise of the subtitled ""deep bond[ing:]"" between the author and Alex.Nevertheless, there was just enough promise kept on both levels to make it worth my while. And the subject matter is interesting and probably will be eye-opening for most folks. It's an incredibly simple little book whose page count is artificially inflated by lots of white space (margin, line spacing, etc). I recommend waiting for paperback or borrowing it from a lieberry."
56,0061672475,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1396160-kandice,3,"Let me start by saying I loved reading about Alex. From the title you would expect that most of the book would actually be  about Alex, but you would be wrong. Much of the book is about Irene and Irene's research, troubles, relationships, etc. I simply didn't care about Irene. I wanted more Alex!"
57,0061672475,http://goodreads.com/user/show/933226-kirsti,4,"""Pay attention. Pay attention. Come here. Wanna go back."" --Alex, an African grey parrot, during a nebulizer treatment at his vet's officeI always thought that Alex the parrot was one of those ""Clever Hans"" phenomena in which a trainer (or a scientist) accidentally supplies an animal with the right answer through nonverbal cues. Then I found out that Alex could look at a tray of objects and correctly answer the question ""What same?"" with ""Color"" and ""What different?"" with ""Shape."" Pepperberg does not go so far as to say that Alex uses language. She says he uses words as labels. Alex could count to six, add, and subtract, and he seemed to have some idea of the concept of zero (to him, ""none""). He understood that six was more than five. If he didn't know the name of something, he sometimes invented one (cake was ""yummy bread""). He displayed evidence of jealousy, telling other parrots ""That's wrong"" or ""Say better"" and sometimes--perhaps deliberately--giving them the wrong answers. He could use the phrase ""I'm sorry"" correctly, though it's unclear whether he could feel actual sorrow or merely used the words to defuse tension. He also knew ""Calm down,"" ""You be good,"" and ""I love you.""Previously, I had read about another scientist's successful and elegantly designed experiment in which ravens learned to use tools: http://www.guardian.co.uk/science/200... . Pepperberg admits that she was impressed with and a bit jealous of these results, and she tried to replicate them with African greys. It turns out that most greys can learn to use these tools quite easily. However, greys like Alex who have extensive training with verbal labels cannot learn this skill. Instead, they spend all their time heckling the trainers: ""Want nut. Want NUT! No, YOU get nut!"" I enjoyed Pepperberg's account of her career, which has been nontraditional and sometimes rocky."
58,0061672475,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6154997-liz,3,"I decided to give this book 3 stars instead of 2, because I was genuinely interested in the science behind it. However, both me and my husband Dave felt that at times, the imposition of some of the author's personal emotional coloring actually detracted from the unique subject matter. It's entirely plausible that her editors wanted a better shot at being in Oprah's Book Club or whatever, and so perhaps instructed her to put more of her own internal experience in there...also, Dave pointed out that Pepperberg has actually published other, more science-y works about the long-term study of animal cognition. But anyway, in spite of her protestations about not wanting her subjective experience to influence her understanding of Alex (the parrot), and her insistence that we as humans not project our own feelings/anthropomorphize animals' emotional experience, it still felt that at times, she couldn't help but to do so. I suppose this is understandable, given that she worked with Alex for 30 years, and never had/raised any human children. It just seemed a bit tedious at times, wading through her descriptions of the stress of relentless grant applications, her marriage breaking up, not being taken seriously as a scientist, etc. The whole, ""me and my parrot against the world!"" thing may be appealing to those who like the drama (my parents both already read and enjoyed the book, which is why they passed it to us), but Dave and I really just wanted to know about the parrot! Interestingly enough, there are bonus chapters at the end with q&a and an NPR interview with the author, in which I felt she expressed her objectivity better. But the long and short of it is, this is a sufficiently interesting subject that I was able to ignore the pathos of the whinier chapters, as well as being a light enough read that I read it cover-to-cover on the bus to and from Philadelphia (so, a total of 4 to 5 hours). There you have it."
59,0061672475,http://goodreads.com/user/show/16470475-ghostfishe,4,"This was a good book. No it isn't the warm and fuzzy story a lot of bird lovers would probably prefer, but it is important because of what it tells us about both Alex and Dr. Pepperberg. We learn that she grew up with birds, and loved birdwatching, both things I think that most non-scientist bird lovers could relate to. Alex was not merely an ""object of study"", but something of a colleague, a fact she mentions several times.I've seen folks complain in the past that (for instance) they should have stopped testing the second Alex got bored, but this book helps explain what I already knew... the scientific community won't accept a one-off as evidence; you need statistics to show that what you observed wasn't just random chance. Irene had a goal in mind--of proving that animals can think and reason, and aren't simply automatons--and she went about pursuing it in the one way the scientific community would accept. I'm sure the constant re-testing bored her sometimes, too.Irene did keep some emotional distance, but bear in mind she was trying to remain credible in a community where emotional attachment and empathy toward animals are still frowned upon. ""Science"" insists on objectivity; it does not welcome the kind of relationships people are free to experience with pets in their own homes. It seems evident enough that Dr. Pepeprberg did truly care for the birds, but still managed to appear largely objective for what we might call the ""greater good"". Given how much has been proven about animal intelligence, and the role she and Alex have played, I can't find much fault in that.Of course, the book also includes several stories about specific things Alex said or did, which are genuinely fun to read. Irene doesn't attempt to ""read into"" these behaviors much outside of a scientific standpoint, but that is as it should be; Alex's actions speak loudly enough for themselves."
