0,0307265633,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3144945-alex,4,"So my buddy Ryan introduced me and Jo to his new girlfriend this past weekend and she's a mathematician (who is clearly not very good at it, because Ryan with a girlfriend doesn't add up - ZING!), so I was like ""Do you think we're all avatars in a big futuristic game of The Sims?"" and her face just lit up, like ""I've been waiting for someone to ask me this all my life!"" She is adorable, and we geeked out about parallel universes for like half an hour while Ryan and Jo made big exaggerated sighing noises. ""Hey, just let us know when you want to talk about something that's not the nerdiest bullshit ever."" ""Okay, that will be never because we're best friends now."" I said that. Ryan's girlfriend probably thinks I'm just okay.And that's why this is a great book: because it's wicked fun to talk about all this shit. Whee, multiverse! says my avatar. You ever hear that theory that once computers get to the same complexity as human brains, they'll sortof automatically develop consciousness? Scientists think that because otherwise there's something we totally don't get about consciousness, and who needs that? Lame. So here's the thinking: if that's true, then we'll probably have it by around 2020. And once we have artificial intelligence, what are we going to do with it? Put it in video games, obviously. We know this because we are people, and that's the kind of shit people do. So we're going to have these virtual worlds, just like The Sims except the people in it will actually be aware, and we'll all play these virtual world games on our Playstations. And that means there'll be like thousands of virtual worlds with conscious inventions in them interacting with each other. And that means that only one of all the worlds featuring conscious beings is the real one; the rest are video games. And that means that odds are the world you're reading this in isn't the real one. Just statistically, it's more likely that you're a collection of sprites that some pimply teenager created near-arbitrary rules for.That's nuts, right? Crazy nuts! Batty! Among other things, it means that there's a God after all, because whatever pimply teenager is playing this particular game that I'm in can delete this game whenever he wants, or make an asteroid hit Brazil, or make Kate Middleton show her boobs. For most intents and purposes, that is God.Also, it raises this question: is Pimply God doing a good job? Is this particular world a good one? Or is he an asshole? If all the sim worlds were ranked from most pleasant to least, where would this one fall? If you set a bunch of AIs up in a fairly nice place, will they probably fight? Is there like an Aggression Slider so you can make us more or less likely to fight? What would this world be like if Pimply God was deep in the throes of puberty? Or is this it?Ryan's girlfriend thinks we are most likely virtual - seriously, serious people think this whole thing makes perfect sense - but I think I lost her with the puberty bit.This is the craziest and last theory in Hidden Reality. There are eight others, and they're not mutually exclusive. The least crazy theory is that space is infinite, and infinite is a lot, so somewhere beyond what we can ever see, given the speed of light, there will be a world just like ours, and infinite worlds just like ours, because infinite means everything, including a world where everything happens and will happen exactly like it has and will in this world you're in now with the sole exception that, instead of reading this review, you personally decided to make a sandwich. Infinite is a lot.Everything in Hidden Reality is theoretical, so there's no pressing reason for you to read this book. (Or any of the rest of the books, while we're on the subject. Pimply God read Shakespeare and was like ""Ha, that's cool - it rhymes and everything, sometimes! I mean, it's terrible compared to real-life literature, but not bad for artificial intelligence."") But whee, multiverse! Four stars, says my avatar, as Pimply God happens to narrow his focus on my apartment just to see what's going on near Boston and says ""That sim there just called me pimply! Here's a random asteroid, how ya like me n"
1,0307265633,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1713956-manny,4,"I've now read three books about the multiverse in rapid succession: the first two were Rees's 
Before The Beginning
 (1996) and Davies's 
The Goldilocks Enigma
 (2007). This one came out just a few months ago, so I'm hopefully up to date for the moment.Well: I'm starting to feel quite familiar with the arguments, but each book has an interestingly different slant. Rees concentrates on presenting the experimental evidence for the existence of other universes - basically, the physical constants of our own universe appear to be tuned exactly right for life to be possible, it's unlikely that this is just chance, so we're probably one of many universes - and explicitly avoids philosophical speculation. Davies recapitulates Rees's arguments, but then goes overboard on philosophy; whatever he says, it's clear that he very much wants there to be a spiritual dimension to the story. Greene is similar to Davies, but his obsession is with string theory. He's spent his life working on it, and he desperately wants it to be part of the final explanation. Despite Greene's exaggerated love for all things stringy, I liked this book and found it well worth reading. The author presents nine different theories which in one way or another involve multiple versions of the universe. Most of these I had already seen in Davies, but I found Greene's exposition clearer and more detailed. In particular, I thought his chapter on ""inflation"" was the best account I had read of this mysterious process, which got our universe started by exponentially blowing it up, in a minute fraction of a second, from the size of a proton to a macroscopic scale. People now seem to understand inflation moderately well, and there are mathematical models which can be checked against the detailed maps of the cosmic background radiation which have been constructed over the last 10 years. I also thought the chapter on the Many Worlds interpretation of quantum mechanics was excellent; I hadn't understood that it's just a historical accident that the Copenhagen interpretation is the mainstream one. As Greene points out, it's actually more conservative to think of quantum processes as continually splitting off new universes, each of which is equally ""real"". The Copenhagen interpretation, with its notion of the collapse of the wavefunction, is the one which involves hand-waving and mystical invocations of the privileged role of the ""observer"". If you just look at the underlying mathematics, the Schr√∂dinger equation, the Many Worlds interpretation is the straightforward way to translate the numbers into words.As already noted, Greene wants string theory to be in there, so there are chapters on ""brane-worlds"" (our universe is floating in a higher dimensional space), the ""Cosmic Landscape"" (there is a multitude of universes reflecting different flavors of string theory) and the Holographic Universe (we are the projection of a lower-dimensional process on a distant boundary surface). Like Davies, he also speculates about the possibility that our universe is a simulation running in some gigantic computer, or that we live in a ""Platonic Universe"", where mathematical theories exist simply by virtue of being consistent, and there is no other reality. All of these ideas were fun to read about, but I felt they were somewhat beside the point; I was surprised not to see him focussing on what, at least to me, seems like the obvious account. As he says, the Many Worlds interpretation of quantum mechanics is perfectly respectable, and inflation has accumulated a great deal of credibility as a theory of how the universe got started. Inflation starts at a scale where quantum processes are all-important. We can actually see the fossils of those quantum processes in the unevenness of the background radiation.Putting those two things together, we already have a multiverse theory that's mainstream to the point of being conservative. The quantum realities which split off during the very early history of the universe will be substantially different from each other. The question is whether they're going to be different enough, since we want them to differ with respect to things including settings of the physical constants. This part is still speculative. But you need it anyway in order to make most of the other theories work, and there seem to be moderately well-worked out accounts of how it could happen. I am sure people must be exploring in this direction. It sounds incredible when you write it down, but we appear to be on the edge of constructing a coherent scientific theory of Life, The Universe and Everything. I'm really curious to see what happens next."

Yes, I refuse to spend much time on multiverse hypotheses; I used to spend a lot of time looking at quantum field theory instead (and doing QFT, thinking about it, developing a feel for and making choices about what I think is important or not, and changing my mind endlessly, and becoming intimate with it as much as my abilities will let me, all of which takes more time than anyone has)."
3,0307265633,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4651295-jason-furman,5,"Brian Greene really is one of the best popular science writers. His books give you a real sense of being guided by someone who genuinely knows what they're talking about, who uses metaphors effectively, and who effectively weaves the traditional material in with the new points he is making. He also approaches science with curiosity untainted by dogmatism. He is very much open to speculation, but equally open to the speculation not panning out.This book is about different concepts of the Multiverse. Greene devotes a chapter to each of what he defines as the major types and then has one or two additional chapters on questions like whether these theories are testable and broader implications.The multiverse's he consider include the quilted multiverse (which is just our universe extending out infinitely, leaving the possibility of endless accidental repetition -- which follows from some cosmological theories that follow the big bang), the inflationary multiverse (a product of repeated episodes of inflationary expansion, which follows from the addition of inflation to the previous theories), three multiverses that come from different versions of string theory (brane, cyclic and landscape), a quantum multiverse (which is Everett's Many Worlds interpretation, and is more conceptual), a holographic multiverse (which comes from the study of black holes and string theory), and simulated and ultimate multiverses (the last two coming from computer simulations and a deeper mathematical world).In every case, Greene does a good job of describing the physical theories that lead, usually by accident, to the implication that there is a particular type of multiverse, discusses the scientific status of those theories, and addresses issues around testing them. In the end, Greene has some sympathy with Steven Weinberg's adage that the problem with physics is that we do not take our theories/equations seriously enough as a real description of the world. The example he cites is the Positron, which was a byproduct of Dirac's solution of a math problem that turned out to be real. Greene clearly leans towards the view that the same is true of the multiverse, but he doesn't do much to tip his hand about which one."
4,0307265633,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4086118-michael,5,"Outstanding update of the current status of modern physics and the projections of parallel universes from various advances. I would have loved to have Greene for a teacher in college. The tour is suitable for laymen with some understanding of physics, as he provides plenty of concrete examples to explain challenging concepts and gives an opportunity to skip more technical sections. For the more knowledgeable reader, a copious appendix is available, replete with the relevant math equations. Greene works his way through the history and logic behind eight different models of parallel universes and their status in terms of development and progress toward potential verifiability. The only one that I was really familiar with, from a college course on quantum physics 40 years ago, Everett‚Äôs 1956 Many-Worlds Hypothesis, is the only one that really bothers me, with its continual ‚Äúsplitting‚Äù off of parallel realities at every point where uncertain outcomes like the position of an object is resolved. Greene makes it clear how the interpretation is simpler and more elegant than Bohr‚Äôs interpretation. The latter calls for the probability wave of a particle to mysteriously collapses when it is detected or interacted with, effectively throwing out Schroedinger‚Äôs equations out whenever a ‚Äúmeasurement‚Äù is made and restricting their applicability only to very small objects. Despite Occam‚Äôs Razor favoring Everett‚Äôs hypothesis (the quantum mechanics equations apply deterministically at all times), the interpretation of possible alternative states as each being somehow ‚Äúreal‚Äù has always been too absurd to be true to me. It‚Äôs a relief then that there is still scientific resistance to the notion and demonstrations of problems with the theory. Greene notes: ‚ÄúI don't expect theoretical or experimental consensus to come in my lifetime concerning which version of reality-a single universe, a multiverse, something else entirely‚Äîquantum mechanics embodies.‚ÄùThe other theories are fascinating and do not call for my alternative choices to have an existence in parallel universes. It was great to get a perspective on the excitement and challenges with string theory and its promise for helping unify the gravitational force with the other forces already in the fold of quantum field theory. The discovery that our universe is undergoing an acceleration in its expansion, and the need for some kind of anti-gravity force (‚Äúdark energy‚Äù) was a shock to me, so the recent successes of the theory of empty space having an ‚Äúinflaton‚Äù field was satisfying to read about. Greene‚Äôs coverage of recent work on the meaning of entropy and information in physical systems was also a pleasure for me.For a sense of the content of this book, here is a thumbnail sketch of the seven other parallel universe theories covered, as laid out in Greene‚Äôs summary chapter: Quilted Multiverse: Conditions in an infinite universe necessarily repeat across space, yielding parallel worlds Inflationary Multiverse: Eternal cosmological inflation yields an enormous network of bubble universes, of which our universe would be one Brane Multiverse: In string/M-theory‚Äôs braneworld scenario, our universe exists on one three-dimensional ‚Äúbrane‚Äù, which floats in a higher-dimensional expanse potentially populated by other branes‚Äîother parallel universes Landscape Multiverse: By combining cosmology and string theory, the many different shapes for string theory‚Äôs extra dimensions give rise to many different bubble universes Holographic Multiverse: The holographic principle asserts that our universe is exactly mirrored by phenomena taking place on a distant boundary surface, a physically equivalent parallel universe Simulated Multiverse: Technological leaps suggest that simulated universes may one day be possible. Ultimate Multiverse: The principle of fecundity asserts that every possible universe is a real universe‚Ä¶These universes instantiate all possible mathematical equations.The summary chapter was also satisfying to me in attempting to address the following questions: Is the Copernican pattern fundamental? --Following the 500-year trend that ‚Äùthe more we understand, the less central we appear‚Äù, we now approach the perspective that ‚Äúour universe itself may not be central to any cosmic order‚Äù. Can scientific theories that invoke a multiverse be tested? --The worry is that ‚Äùby invoking a multiverse, we enter the domain of theories that can‚Äôt be tested‚Äù. He argues that well founded multiverse theories should be able to make predictions which are likely to be testable in our own universe, and hence falsifiable.  How does the multiverse affect the nature of scientific explanation? Traditional approaches for physics aims to use mathematical expressions of physical laws and a set of constants and initial conditions to project what measurable things will be like at a subsequent time. Multiverse theories usefully explore variability in these conditions and laws which must be accepted as a given in a single-universe theory. Should we believe mathematics? Based on past progress, mathematical theories have had a huge impact on guiding science toward hidden truth. Despite problems in testing the multiverse theories, pushing on them is likely to lead to progress."
5,0307265633,http://goodreads.com/user/show/38036772-annie,5,"Brian = bae. Definitely one of the more accessible cosmology writers of today. Any book discussing quantum field theory and string theory is going to require your undivided attention, of course, but it‚Äôs much more readable than many others, especially if you‚Äôre fond of analogies. Turns out, there‚Äôs lots of theories that give rise to the possibility of alternate realities:Theory 1, aka Quilted Multiverse: If the universe is infinite (it might not be, but if it is) then at some point in the distant, distant universe, there are worlds where there is a human named Annie just like me, typing on Goodreads, except she typed ‚ÄúGR‚Äù instead of ‚ÄúGoodreads.‚Äù And there‚Äôs another world with an Annie whose life is exactly like mine except she‚Äôs allergic to red wine (I would have to kill myself because there would be no point in living). In some, the worst things I‚Äôve ever imagined happening have happened. In others, my wildest dreams have been fulfilled. (Somewhere, there is an Annie who can write like Kafka, DH Lawrence, and Kundera combined). Theory 2 aka Swiss Cheese: If the universe is expanding (hint, it almost definitely is) then there would be places which expansion would create which would have to have lowered rates of expansion, and those are like holes in Swiss cheese. The number of cheese-holes, as the cosmos continues to expand, continues to increase, and each one of those is adorably termed a bubble universe, or pocket universe. Including our own. This also brings in the Quilted Multiverse idea: from inside a bubble universe, the bubble‚Äôs space is infinite, but from outside the bubble universe, it‚Äôs finite. What appears as endless time to an outsider appears as endless space, at each moment of time, to an insider. And if it‚Äôs infinite to an insider, then there have to be infinite worlds with infinite repetitions and variations, as in Theory 1. Theory 3 aka String Theory aka Bread Loaf aka Cyclic Multiverse: [Strictly speaking there are five types of string theory, no one: Type I, Type IIA, Type IIB, Heterotic-O, and Heterotic-E, which all sound like sexually transmitted diseases to me, and anyway they all get subsumed into the grander M-theory]. String theory (particles are vibrating loops of filaments, and the way it vibrates determines what particle it is/how it behaves) and corresponding M-theory predict that there are ten dimensions of space and the eleventh dimension of time. Seven more than the ones we‚Äôre aware of: length, width, height, and time. But maybe that‚Äôs not an issue, because the four dimensions we‚Äôre used to extend over massive (maybe infinite) distances, but maybe the other seven are curled up at the other end of the cosmos and we can‚Äôt find them and they don‚Äôt extend far enough to reach into our reality. For analogy Greene gives the example of a straw, normal sized, except it‚Äôs as tall as the Empire State building. It‚Äôs three-dimensional up close, but from the other side of the river, it would just look like a vertical line (two-dimensional). Here comes the multiverse idea: pretend the world has just two dimensions (it‚Äôs a flat plane) called a two-braneworld. Line up a couple of these flat planes (slices of bread) and you can add on other parallel universes, other braneworlds, as many as you like (‚Äújust add slices to the cosmic loaf‚Äù as Greene memorably says). Of course, we have three spatial dimensions, but looking at 2 dimensions makes it easier to wrap our 3D heads around. It‚Äôs also possible that different braneworlds would bounce into each other and restart the cosmological clock, so that, rather than one big bang, things are a gigantic bumper-car game and universes are constantly (though very slowly, from our perspectives) getting remade and unmade and remade. Theory 4 aka Landscape Multiverse: pretty much the idea that the cosmological constant (density of energy in space, creating certain gravitational values) might be necessary for life, and so what are the odds it happened to happen? Well, you‚Äôd need an infinite number of universes to make it likely that [at least] one of them just happened to have the exact necessary cosmological constant to make life happen.Theory 5 aka the Quantum Multiverse: all the possibilities of [our] reality are realized in another reality, another multiverse. All possible histories and all possible futures are real. One of them is the reality we live in; the (basically infinite) rest exist in some way. True reality is more like a tree than a line. Theory 6 aka Everything is a Hologram: The event horizon of a black hole (point of no return) is the surface of a black hole in some ways, and fluctuations in the surface of the event horizon contains all the information the black hole sucks in. Similarly, our 3D world may be a rendering of 2D-encoded information (on some cosmological event horizon-type-thing) which creates reality as we know it.Theory 7 aka Virtual Reality: we can create other universes virtually and, someday, could probably create reactions in the (potentially sentient) actors in those universes which could make it feel like reality, every bit as much as it does to us. If everything‚Äôs infinite (see theory 1) with infinite numbers of beings creating infinite numbers of virtual universes whose inhabitants can also create infinite numbers of infinite universes and so forth, doesn‚Äôt it seem like odds are good that we‚Äôre just one of those games? Could we even tell if we were in a simulation? Depends on your Simulator and if they want to reveal themselves (are you there, God? It's me, Annie). Other interesting things:Dark energy might be the answer to Einstein‚Äôs unproven cosmological constant (that he retracted after he suggested it because he couldn‚Äôt account for it). There‚Äôs some‚Ä¶ some shit out there, and we can‚Äôt see it, describe it, or know of its existence other than through a few methods of measurement. The mind-boggling idea that if the universe is infinite, and you shrunk infinity, everything would be closer together but the universe would still be infinite. Rationally I understand that you can‚Äôt reduce infinity (infinity divided by two is still infinity) but my brain doesn‚Äôt want this to be a thing. About 1 percent of the snow on a television that‚Äôs tuned to a non-working channel is due to reception of the big bang‚Äôs photons (aka background radiation). "

7,0307265633,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1394552-keith-akers,4,"This was a good book. For a popularization, this had some pretty heavy science in it. I'm a pretty smart guy and will have to re-read it to really have a better understanding. Greene really is a good writer, because even when you don't quite understand what he's talking about, he gives you enough of the broad overview so that you can go to the next section and feel that you haven't missed anything critical.The section on ""quilted multiverses"" was pretty straightforward and I can claim to have understood it. The next few parallel universes were a bit trickier, but I was with the program. When I got to multiple dimensions and the ""landscape multiverse"" with so many possible shapes to the extra dimensions that ""kazillions"" doesn't even begin to cover the number, this was something I wasn't quite so sure that I could explain to my wife. I'm not sure I want to challenge Brian Greene on any scientific question, but the one point I would have some questions about were the simulated multiverses (as in the movie ""The Matrix""). I think he may be shortchanging Goedel and Turing. I'm not convinced that a simulated multiverse sufficient to model all the creatures on our planet would not consume so much energy that it would be in effect less probable than an actual universe. My experience as a programmer is that the complexity of programs and the resources needed to design them go up exponentially with the size of the program. If that is the case, creating a universe might actually take less energy than modeling one. We would need to automate the process of computer design, but this essentially can't be done, and that's the point of Turing's thesis. There may be a practical upper limit on the size of simulated universes that we (or future super-intelligent beings in our universe) could ever design. This may be my confusion, but I'd like just a little more explanation here. So, this book is recommended, and I hope to come back to it. One final thing: though the book never utters a word about it, Brian Greene is a vegan. That anybody this smart is a vegan says something, I think, about where we should be headed as a species. "
8,0307265633,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2187043-mike-the-paladin,3,"The first book I had by Brian Greene was The Fabric of the Cosmos. I got it not long after it was releases and a friend asked me if he could borrow it not long after I received it in the mail, before I'd read it. I said yes.I didn't get the book back for several years, Dr. Greene had written more by then. Oh well.This book (as is Dr. Greene's wont) is an attempt to take highly technical and advanced ideas and make them understandable to ""us"", ""we"", ""the great unwashed"", ""the masses"". I suppose in all truthfulness it only succeeds to a point.I mean, I know I don't have the math to grasp the heart of what he's talking about and even I can see the imprecision. Still, he does take the difficult, sugar coats it and lays it out there. (I kept seeing that scene from Big Bang Theory where they have a cameo from Dr. Greene and Sheldon's reaction to him).If you're a physicist (theoretical or experimental I suspect) this book will probably be hopelessly imprecise and simple, if your like me, it's fairly interesting. Even though I know that what I'm getting is at best a broad outlined picture (where the multiverse is compared to a large Swiss Cheese with the bubbles pictured as the universes). The book is laid out largely in the format of here it is, here's what we think/know and here's why. It assumes that those reading it won't really be in a position to challenge it and tries to be as simple as possible.In short not a bad book and manages to lay things out in a relatively (get it ""relatively"") simple way when dealing with a difficult set of subjects (or subject if it's ""unified"" :) ). Enjoy. If it interests you I recommend it. "
9,0307265633,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2102504-r-l,3,"This is a pretty dense book. Some of the footnotes have footnotes! I'm sure it must be very difficult for an author of a popular science book to walk the line between, on the one hand, providing enough technical information to make the arguments cogent, and on the other, miring the reader in a bog of difficult concepts and facts. My hat's off to Dr. Greene for giving it a try on some of the most out-there ideas that can be imagined. Some very interesting ideas, but ultimately, for me this was all a little difficult to chew and swallow.My own theory [ unencumbered by fact or mathematics :) ] is that the universe is infinite in all directions. Our atoms and subatomic particles are someone--or something!--else's galaxies and universes, and likewise, that our galaxies are atoms and molecules to some other beings. And, boy, are those beings *big*!For some reason I also think that the hierarchy that I just described doesn't recurse infinitely in a fractal manner. Instead, it's all circular, so that if you start here and go up to galaxies or down to atoms (or down to gehanna or up to the throne!), or, for that matter, out to the edge of our universe, and (bringing it back to the topic of this book) to other universes in the multiverse, you would eventually end up here again. Weird.Not light reading, but recommended if you're interested in some of the current thinking in the fields of cosmology and physics."

Brian Greene you are the master at delivering exactly what I have naturally been pondering and lack the scientific mind to undertake. Thank heavens it wasn't another science book that I had to sit through the whole of physics from Einstein onward. Way to know your audience.

Yet again you deliver in your classically simply elegant style the various avenues mathematics has led us to opening up different scenarios for parallel universes in every flavor under high investigation. Giving comparisons for each approach and tackling them all in turn. Its such absolute brain candy. You are so damn brilliantly perfect for presenting this type of information. Bravo!

Some of the explanations--for example, the bubble universes--really made my head hurt. The explanation for why string theory requires ten space-time dimensions seems a bit glib to me. Some of the analogies--imagine a bunch of clones of Cartman from South Park standing atop mountain peaks--are just too silly to take seriously. The description of black holes and entropy is fascinating. Some parts of the book are rather philosophical--do mathematicians ""invent"" math or ""discover"" it? And, if you enjoy reading about extremely speculative hypotheses--like our universe is a computer simulation, much like ""The Matrix""--then this is the book for you."

Still, I feel like I understand more about how theories of multiverses originate, and where they might be going. Not the most fun read, and I was expecting less theoretical physics and more descriptions of possibilities, but it was OK."
13,0307265633,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3082950-tomislav,4,"The first half of this book is an expansion on some of the various multiverse concepts mentioned only briefly in Greene's earlier The Elegant Universe and The Fabric of the Cosmos (which overlap each other a little). I was an enthusiastic reader of those, and enjoyed this deeper look at what the scientific basis of those might be, in somewhat the same style. But for the second half of the book, I want to mention specific chapters, as I feel the value of the writing swings wildly.7. Science and the Multiverse. This chapter for me raised some troubling issues as to what is actually science and what is interesting philosophical speculation. He goes a bit further out on the limb of the anthropic principle than I am usually comfortable with. Greene reasons about infinities of universes in the a number of different types of multiverse, based on a sample size of 1. It could be we are typical, and the exclusion of so many possibilities is valid, or it could be we are atypical. I mean, it's cool, you know, but not so reasonable. The cover article of the April 2011 issue of Scientific American concerns related issues in inflationary cosmology. See ""Quantum Gaps in Big Bang Theory; Why our best explanation of how the universe evolved must be fixed or replaced"" by Paul J. Steinhardt, Princeton. 8. The Many Worlds of Quantum Measurement. This is possibly the best explanation of the uncertainty principle I have ever read. It gave me new insights into the Schrodinger equations, and addressed some concerns that have bothered me for years. This chapter alone justified reading the book.9. Black Holes and Holograms. I think I understand about information and the event horizon of black holes, but the holographic multiverse totally baffled me. Too many analogies and twists and turns in the explanation. I guess you have to do the math to get this one - or take it on faith, which I refuse to do.10. Universes, Computers, and Mathematical Reality. This chapter concerns epistomology and information theory. What's it doing in a physics book?Taken as a whole, the book was fascinating and worthwhile - but gets patchy in the second half. "
14,0307265633,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2028832-kathleen,4,"I always enjoy looking at scientific concepts through the lens of the fantastic or peculiar, so this exploration of parallel universes by popular physicist Brian Greene is perfect for me. Written in his usual clear, funny style, Greene naturally discusses string theory, relativity, number theory with respect to infinities, quantum theory, and numerous other scientific concepts. Instead of simply discussing these theories, however, we get to look at various proposals of multiple universes. From the familiar quantum multiverse suggested by the probability wave math of Schrodinger's equations and the idea--Greene refers to it as a ""quilted multiverse--that if the universe is infinite than it obviously repeats, to more obscure suggestions from string theory, the many kinds of parallel universes are distinct and interesting. Perhaps the most intriguing is the idea of the simulated multiverse; if one day computing power reaches the extent that we can play at building self aware, self contained universes the way I play at Spore and The Sims, then we will essentially create our own multiverses. The most enjoyable aspect of this study is Greene's particularity in explaining the scientific concepts--and eventual testability--of these universes. This book never feels like a pointless philosophical exercise, which keeps it fun. "
15,0307265633,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1608649-laurie,1,"I really am a huge fan of Brian Greene. I've read both ""The Elegant Universe"" and ""The Fabric of the Cosmos"" and find his writing simply astonishing. With complete sympathy for readers without mathematical acumen, he explains concepts like quantum physics, the theory of relativity, the four major forces including gravity with such precision, and wit, that I found myself gasping for breath as I felt like I was reaching groundbreaking depths of understanding of how the universe works on almost every page. Even if you are not interested in physics and the workings of reality, he has a way of presenting these ideas in such an entertaining and interesting way, you can't help but get caught up in his enthusiasm. He's so tuned in to the general reader that he even suggests skipping large parts of his book if you don't want the nitty-gritty details and just want the big-picture show. NOT SO with this book. It almost felt like a different writer. Even he did not seem as enchanted with the subject. Most of the book was really a lot of twisty, topsy-turvy conversation about the probability of multiple universes, including exact replicas of our own.His exlanations were vague and his writing was even boring. Big thumbs down and I am so disappointed! "
16,0307265633,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6967393-nicholas,3," I purchased this on the strength of Brian Greene's past works and find him to be consistent in his clarity of explanation.Although I had a few sticky moments with some elements of string theory and the explanation of the concept of infinity, on the whole it went well.I didn't get the same revelatory experience I got from ""Fabric of the Cosmos"",as most of the multiverse theories are extensions of areas he has covered previously and as the book is written with the assumption of little or no prior knowledge,it can be a little tedious having to go through same theories again.If you have any prior knowledge in this field then you will realise that all these ideas are at the present unverifiable,but at the end he posits the questions that must be answered to advance the possibility of validating any of them. On the plus side I'd say that the book is well structured and comprehensive without complexity (although the notes delve a little deeper).On the minus side there is little new if you are a reader of ""New Scientist"" or are an avid reader of popular science and I must admit I did find myself counting the pages a few times. "
17,0307265633,http://goodreads.com/user/show/29427016-zaid,5,"I am sold to Brian Greene after reading this one.I am fond of his simplicity for writing such a book.I was looking for such a book for quite sometime and when I learned about it I instantly decided to read it. It took me quite a time to read this book,to process it.It is a good book for the people who have little knowledge in this field.Want to broaden your knowledge on the topics like Multiverse,string theory? Read this book."
18,0307265633,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5555043-the-pirate-ghost-formerly-known-as-the-curmudgeon,3,"Needed more ""Schrodinger's Cat and less Matrix."" Okay, I liked the first 66% of the book. Greene takes the time to go over, and over..(and over).... (and over) some of the same mathmatical points. It could get monotonous but in the first half to 2/3rds of the book he managed to add a little bit more ""new stuff"" to each repitition. It did help me understand string theory and that there is at least mathamatical (theoretical?) support for multiple universes and the book did a good job of explaining that. I know I heard about Skip Drives from John Scalzi and support for variations of the same universe (widely used in sci-fi and other fiction for centuryies now) as well as warp drives and worm holes...hell he practiclaly beat the fun out of ""Black Holes."" Then he started a long repetitive explaination of simulated universes that had a more existential philosophical lean to it than the hard math and science in earlier chapters. At several points I wanted to role down my window and shout, ""Come on buddy, take the damned blue pill will you?"" To add to my consternation and confusion he ends the debate he was having (mostly with himself) with statements about how he doesn't really buy the simulated universe bunk? What, was he paid by the word? I don't want to go too deep into things, but when a guy like me is known for beating a dead horse thinks it's a little ""too much matter and not enough art"" then it might be worth taking some scissors to the manuscript. (Oh come on!...It's figurative... no horses, alive or dead, have ever been harmed by, or in the making of, one of my reviews... well Sea Buiscuit didn't like one, but that's a halucination of a different colour...) To quote Margo Hemingway's character in ""The Meaning of Life"" (Peter O'Toole) ""Why don't you start by thinking you don't exist and see where that gets you."" Bottom line, first half good but the math's complicated. It does a good job of explaining the relationship between string theory, Quantum Theory and the Theory of Relativity. Then, it's time to check the ship movments to ""Fantasy Island."" Worth reading if you are a functional mathamatical idiot who likes to read sci-fi (and maybe write one day) like me. It's not exactly a Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy...though it does help explain how Adams is not completely crazy. "
19,0307265633,http://goodreads.com/user/show/504424-bup,5,"This book wouldn't be great without his first two. Or maybe it would, but it would seem like a fantasy ride in some bologna-artist's woo-science book. It's basically a survey of the different multiverse ideas out there - all the different ways people have dreamed up multiple universes.Given the scientific gravitas Brian Greene is able to bring, though, one has to take these ideas seriously. At least, as seriously as one can. I'm not a physicist, but I have taken a statistics course or two, and the thinking about how we can test some ideas of multiple universes by looking at our own universe make absolutely no sense to me. Our universe is one data point. It gives you zero degrees of freedom. There is no hypothesis one could reject by theorizing, as Greene seems to do, that multiverses where a universe like ours would be more likely, and then turning around and looking at the data from our universe.Whether or not he's right about testability, though, even constructing hypotheses is a portion of science. Science is the process of developing and testing hypotheses. There's nothing wrong with developing hypotheses you have no idea how to test, and calling it a scientific step. OK, so we have no idea how to test, or if we can. Don't let that limit the process of developing hypotheses.Two more nitpicks (I gave this 5 stars, too - why am I only complaining? I guess I found the book so intriguing and engaging that I want to talk back to it):1) He never talked about the fact that many of these multiverse theories are not mutually exclusive - bubbles in the expansion of space and simulated multiverses could obviously coexist, as could many of the others.2) In the ultimate universe model, the universe with nothing in it obviously exists - inasmuch as it needs to. We have to accept that one, just like we have to accept the empty set in every set of subsets ever.Anyway, good book. I recommend ""The Elegant Universe"" and ""Fabric of the Cosmos"" before this, but I guess it would work on its own, too."
20,0307265633,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1947301-ericka-clouther,5,"This was a great follow-up to The Fabric of the Cosmos: Space, Time, and the Texture of Reality. It didn't repeat a lot of material from the first one, it explained the progression in physics since then. It was pretty mind-blowing. I did get a little stuck in some sections, but I decided that a perfect understanding of the topic wasn't strictly necessary for my purposes. I do think Greene protests too much that every aspect of physics isn't a *miracle.* I've never heard of so many miracles I believe in, even if, as Greene claims it's statistically expected when dealing with such large numbers. It is a miracle to find ""shoes in my size"" as Greene's analogy goes. "
21,0307265633,http://goodreads.com/user/show/296706-lee-rocky,2,"I think I may just be too dumb for books like this. There are parts I understand and that intrigue me, but then suddenly things get too complicated for me to wrap my head around. This is mostly, but not exclusively, true of the sections that delve deeply into math (though the author, thankfully, relegates a lot of the math to notes), but there are plenty of non-math sections that were equally incomprehensible to me. Some of the notes are useful for clarification, but others just muddy the waters more. The last two chapters, where he delves into simulation theories, and then concludes by more comprehensibly summarizes the entirety of the book were the most readable and enjoyable to me. I'm glad I read it but am not sure I learned as much as I should have."

25,0307265633,http://goodreads.com/user/show/20311760-santiago-ortiz,4,"This is a fascinating book that explains with great clarity no less than 9 versions of multiverses. Each of these are mind-expanding (or mind-folding, mind-bending, mind-exploding, mind-blowing, mind-wrinkling‚Ä¶ depending of the multiverse version). And, in many of the cases, the alternative to the existence of a multiverse is at least as anti-intuitive and/or unbelievable. So be reassured that reading this book will give you a sense that reality is much more than what our senses, or even our expanded senses (technology) can grasp. This book navigates the frontiers of science and it's honest about it, presenting the many ‚Äìand dramatically clashing‚Äìpoint of views (the multiscience).I missed three things in this book:- Any mention to quantum computation, specially when dealing with the Many-Worlds quantum interpretation. These two are eventually related by the fascinating fact that multiple computers (and people around them), from different universes, are working in parallel to get an operation done way faster to what can be done in a single universe. Multiverse collaboration.- Relations between different multiverses. It‚Äôs not discussed in the book wether the multiverse versions could co-exist, interfere with each other, or eventually, as my intuition says, two version could actually be two approaches for the same (the infinite Universe and the Many-world interpretation, for instance, could be the same since both contain the same information).- Borges is properly mentioned when dealing with two of the multiverse versions. He created prodigious analogies for the total multiverse and the many-worlds interpretation. But he‚Äôs forgotten in the infinite multiverse chapter, for which Borges do not created an analogy, but an exact description (perhaps by changing ‚Äútime‚Äù by ‚Äúspace‚Äù). So I'll quote him here:""The number of all the atoms that compose the world is immense but finite, and as such only capable of a finite (though also immense) number of permutations. In an infinite stretch of time, the number of possible permutations must be run through, and the universe has to repeat itself. Once again you will be born from a belly, once again your skeleton will grow, once again this same page will reach your identical hands, once again you will follow the course of all the hours of your life until that of your incredible death."", from The Doctryne of the Cycles, written in 1936."
26,0307265633,http://goodreads.com/user/show/15058212-shayla,4,"Really enjoyed this, especially since it introduced me to string theory which I always thought would be so much more complicated! But it turns out to be such a beautiful concept.Parallel universes will always be one of those things that interest people I think, and I'm glad that I can now sort of talk about them intelligently. My favorite theories are the simulation one, the cyclic multiverse, and quilted multiverse, with maybe brane worlds thrown in there. My only problems with this book were 1) I want to be an astrophysicist and what I've studied before definitely helped here, but some of the concepts just completely lost me in a couple places (namely the holographic universe), and 2) sometimes could not connect all the different tangents in a chapter back to the main idea.Other than that, great book and I recommend for anyone looking to learn more about parallel universes who has at least some prior knowledge of physics/astronomy."
27,0307265633,http://goodreads.com/user/show/11200007-douglas-cosby,4,"Great book on multi-verse ideas. Brian Greene is one of the best explainers of complicated physics topics alive today. He is even better in person, but this book does a good job laying out the different possible types of multi-verses. While a lot of the ideas represented in the book seem speculative, even fanciful, to me, that is what I thought when I first read Hawking's ""A Brief History Of Time"". In my opinion, the only current writer that can hold a candle to Greene is Sean Carroll. I can't wait for his next book."
28,0307265633,http://goodreads.com/user/show/17648164-umair-khan,4,"In The Hidden Reality, celebrated theoretical physicist Brian Greene explains the mind-boggling idea of a ‚ÄòMultiverse‚Äô (plural of universe). A professor of physics at Columbia University, Greene is well-known for his two earlier works on popular science, The Elegant Universe and The Fabric of the Cosmos which sought to explain, among other things, the very nature of space-time. But The Hidden Reality, in explicating the idea of multiple realities, shows the layperson something that has never before been presented by a popular physicist.The Big Bang Theory, which suggests the origin of the universe some 14 billion years ago gives rise to several other theories which require our universe not to be the only one. Most readers of popular science are familiar with the many worlds interpretation of quantum physics and M-theory‚Äôs ‚Äúbraneworld‚Äù. Multiverses, Greene writes in this book, are ‚Äúharder to avoid than they are to find‚Äù and he discusses nine theories in their support.From the plain old ‚ÄúQuilted Multiverse theory‚Äù that postulates that in this infinite universe, there is bound to be repetition of the order of things to the ‚ÄúInflation theory‚Äù that suggests that our universe began as a rapidly expanding bubble of empty space, Greene discusses the all. ‚ÄúString theory‚Äù gained popularity because it successfully unifies General Relativity and Quantum Theory and verification is expected from the experiments currently being run at the Large Hadron Collider. Greene also ponders over the possibility of a ‚ÄúSimulated Multiverse‚Äù, theorising that we may all be part of a simulation, like that in The Matrix. Extending this supposition further, the creators of our simulation might themselves be part of another simulation and the final wonderland is the ‚ÄúUltimate Multiverse‚Äù in which everything that can exist and is mathematically consistent actually exists ‚Äòsomewhere‚Äô.As a teenager I read scientists like Carl Sagan and Stephen Hawking on the queer nature of black holes, the philosophical dilemmas of time travel, and the creationist implications of the big bang theory. But compared to this, these problems seem mundanely simple. Some people call these theories scientific blasphemy, but in the words of George Bernard Shaw, ‚Äúall great truths begin as blasphemies‚Äù. The Hidden Reality both popularizes scientific ideas and shines a light on the path that will be explored by future physicists.These theories are challenging simplistic notions about science by ‚Äòenhancement‚Äô of mathematical and scientific standards. In order to resolve the deepest mysteries and the greatest dilemmas of modern science, modern scientists are willing to accept these bizarre-looking properties of the natural world. We have reached the point where we need to re-examine what is and is not science and how theories can be verified and accepted as scientific.Greene has selected an apt title for this book because nothing can be more hidden than a reality which is neither accessible physically nor conceivable mentally. The insightful and engaging narrative makes this complex tour of state-of-the art theoretical physics much more exhilarating and informative. Greene‚Äôsgreatest achievement is that even as you grapple with these allusive concepts, you start falling in love with these mysteries.Published in The Express Tribune, Sunday Magazine, May 1st, 2011http://tribune.com.pk/story/157862/th..."
29,0307265633,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1339246-gendou,4,"This is a pretty good read.Greene does digress into silly analogies and painfully remedial mathematical lessons from time to time.Nevertheless, the many flavors of conceivable ""multiverses"" are an interesting and quite modern topic.Greene acts like a used car salesman at times, using syrupy language to give speculation more than it's due.Worst of all is his ""giving equal time"" to the anthropic principle!Anthropic arguments are nothing more than an ""I give up"" approach to explaining the yet-to-be-explained.ANY FREE PARAMETER can be pointed at with an up-turned nose, and labeled a ""problem with the theory"".The free parameter can then easily, and without fail, be ""explained"" using an anthropic argument.Why does [insert any free parameter of any theory here] have the value that it does? Maybe we're just lucky!You've solved nothing. No possible unique prediction can be made by anthropic reasoning alone.Any unique prediction can be made WITHOUT anthropic reasoning. It's useless. Worse than useless. It's wrong!The description of the measurement problem was good.The description of the holographic principle was good.I was really surprised by one assertion: Copenhagen and Many Worlds have different predictions. Greene argues that in Many Worlds, the wave-function have multiple spikes, corresponding to different possible outcomes. He reasons that these ""spiked waves"" might interfere, causing an observable interference pattern, which would disagree with Copenhagen wave function collapse. He admits that decoherence makes this ""an extraordinarily formidable task"", but I'm not sure what he means by this! Is it formidable to do the calculations, or formidable to measure them? He states his clear belief that Copenhagen and Many Worlds are, in fact, distinct theories, but doesn't at ALL explain how he reached this conclusion. Every source I've ever read treats them as interpretations which make the SAME predictions. In this case, I certainly do NOT take his word for it, and neither should you, fellow reader...The end of the book devolves quickly into child-like nonsense philosophy like the ""ultimate multiverse"" where ""math is reality"" and every possible equation gets it's own universe... Honestly, I don't know why the publisher let Greene put this frivolity in an otherwise serious book."
30,0307265633,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7308179-jerry,4,"This book presents nine different theories supporting the idea of parallel universes. These are consistent with current physics theory and observational data. At this time there is not enough data to discern which one if any might in fact be a true representation of reality. One of the more interesting theories to me is the Quilted Multiverse.An infinite universe can be divided into a series of spherical patches each the size of the cosmic horizon. The cosmic horizon is the distance that light can have traveled since the beginning of the big bang thus is the farthest that can be seen from any given point. The universe has been expanding for 13.7 billion years. The cosmic horizon is now 41 billion light-years. No information has traveled between the patches so they are completely independent. If the universe is infinite, then there are an infinite number of patches. There is a limit to how many particles can fit into a patch of this limited size: about 10 to the 56th grams. This is the amount of mass that can fit into a black hole of this size. With an infinite universe there will be an infinite number of patches but each has a finite number of particles so there are a finite number of possible arrangements of the particles: 1 followed by 10 to the 122th zeros. This means that the arrangements must necessarily be repeated across patches. Therefore, there must be an infinite number of copies of our universe. And there would also be copies of a universe where you had something different for breakfast this morning, and a copy where you married a different person, and a copy with every other decision you and every other person made differently. Everything that could happen has happened in some universe of the quilted multiverse. But you could never travel to one of these other universes because the distances are too far for even light to travel."
31,0307265633,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5580648-the-abeyant,4,"This is my first post on Good Reads, so we'll see how this goes. My fianc√© has been on here for quite some time, and she insisted that I become part of the group, so here I am.The book was a very smooth read for me, being someone who is comfortable with mathematics and science. All of the concepts and theories put forth in this book were things I had encountered before (via Through The Wormhole, in particular), and I feel that it greatly helped me to visualize what was being discussed, having seen them before on TV.The whole idea of multiverses is just really out there, and when it seems that all the math is there (I trust Greene when he says so, I'm not knowledgeable enough to really follow it all myself, or to care) to support the idea, that's even more crazy.I take it all with a grain of salt, of course. Odds are, that even if there are other parallel worlds, or an infinite series of universes that harbor every possible reality ever, we'll never encounter them to any significant degree. It will likely always remain theoretical. It's all just really cool in principle. It gets overwhelming to think about the complexities of the ideas of infinity - it always has. Since I was young, I'd find myself lying awake in bed pondering the sheer concept of the infinite... and of nothing. I love it, but after a while, you lose interest, and you just want to focus on living. If there is a deeper meaning to life, or any grand answer, then maybe death will bring us one step closer. Spending too much mental energy on it isn't worthwhile.I'm also particularly fond of the idea of the entire world being a computer simulation. I don't believe it is one, but the fact that it could be is thought provoking enough. I've been encountering various themes like that recently."
32,0307265633,http://goodreads.com/user/show/110433-socraticgadfly,3,"If you want to see a weak theory oversold, read this book.Greene can be clear, easy to understand, and even near-eloquent in explaining all the different types of multiverses. (I'll admit, though, that the details of how a quantum tunneling multiverse could work aren't 100 percent clear still.)That said, there are some issues with the book.First, on the ""simulations multiverse"" chapter, Greene naively claims that ""sims"" inside a universe could always figure out, eventually, that they were sims. Why? This is absolutely not necessary philosophically, and Greene can't offer any scientific or engineering reason why a simulation multiverse couldn't evolve in ways that would prevent the sims from ever discovering their fate.Add in that the language in this chapter at times got a bit close to creationism without a creator, or, more bluntly, that Greene ran head-on into the origin of the universe philosophical argument from a first cause and didn't/doesn't even recognize it, and the book fell from the four stars it was at already down to three.Beyond the philosophy issues, Greene was definitely pushing the envelope on what is realistic in such a multiverse, or not.Second, the cheerleading. Even before this multiverse, it's clear that he *wants* some version of a multiverse to be true. That really started to come out starkly in the chapter on the many worlds multiverse. He explains what the main objections are to Everett's theory, but, IMO, he doesn't *answer* the objections.Third, the question of what science is, or should be. Greene calls himself a realist, but seems comfortable with ideas that not only can't be falsified now, but may never be falsifiable and will have no impact on us being called science. I'm not quite there. "

Sound fantastical?I stopped reading this book on page 87, and I'm going to have to put it in my Goodreads category of books-I-gave-up-reading. Here's why:Up to this point the author is starting with his conclusions, which is, in his term, that reality is a Quilted Multiverse. (This is the Many Worlds hypothesis.) In an infinite space, he writes, there are an infinite number of universes, and the particles that formed one (ours) are in every other one. In other words: you exist an infinite amount of times somewhere ""out there."" To this point in the text he's provided no proof of his claim, only his description that this is so. And I really appreciate his descriptions and explanations. Some really bring them to life; like his describing the multiverse bubbles as the air pockets in a block of Swiss cheese. Neat, but he presents it as a logical conclusion. It's anything but that. It's illogical. How is this science? Disappointed, I put the book down. I read several other reviews on Amazon and found one of three other 1-star reviews that provided confirmation of my suspicions. String theory is untestable, and so it is a metaphysical belief, not actual science. (I had no idea there was such a war going on within physics today; some googling led me to several Wikipedia pages of various authors, blogs, and articles; wow.)Such a shame, I was really looking forward to reading this book.

34,0307265633,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1508173-david,5,"Once again Brian Greene demonstrates that he is very talented writer. He exemplifies the sort of person that the modern world so desperately needs -- a first-class scientist who can also effectively communicate both the findings and the excitement of modern science.In this book, he introduces readers to several themes of modern physics and cosmology, all centering around the seemingly infinite universe about us -- the ""quilted multiverse"", the inflationary multiverse, string theory and the multiverse, the cosmological constant paradox, the landscape multiverse, the many-worlds formulation of quantum mechanics, the holographic multiverse, and, finally, recent thinking on the ""computable universe"" and physical reality.Greene accomplishes all of this without equations (although I wish he would use one or two here and there). Although the book superficially is readable by a layperson, nonetheless, it is probably not realistic to expect that a person completely without college+ level training in physics and astronomy would be able to completely follow his arguments.But it is an excellent read. Highly recommended."

Greene goes some way to explain how some of these ideas could make sense and perhaps be proved (to the extent that positing the existence of realms of reality -sorry- that are completely inaccesible to us could be done at all). One little point: he tries to put together arguments for and against each of these postulates (and of course, again, many look very reasonable but I haven't got the tools to judge) but he seems to put a bit more weight (and expound much more at length) in the arguments for than against. A good read nonetheless and one that offers breathtaking vistas and thoughts on what may be reality and the universe(s)."

I've got a real curiosity about holographic universes now that I've got a better image of them. I love the idea of a highly encoded piece of information undergoing a transform that then gets plastered upon the ceiling of the universe. Touching upon branes and seeing how they might possibly touch each other was also pretty cool. The writing in this book was quite good and nothing seemed out of place, not even the heavy speculation near the end. In fact, I really enjoyed that, too."

41,0307265633,http://goodreads.com/user/show/12807932-b-j-richardson,4,"I can sum this book up with one long sentence. Oh look, if you play around with these math equations enough and/or if you take these cosmological concepts to ridiculous extremes, it makes it look like there are multiple (or infinite) universes.Normally, I really like Brian Greene. I think he is one of the best out there at taking the cutting edge of quantum mechanics and making it accessible to dullards like me. Problem is, this time he has picked a topic I just can't get behind. Even if multiple universes exist, they are not accessible to us and they change nothing in our own universe. So... it isn't really science but rather just mind games. Here are the mind game theories he plays with in exploring the possibilities of multiverses:1) Quilted multiverse - Just imagine an infinitely large quilt. Eventually, some of the patterns are necessarily bound to repeat. In fact, if it truly is infinite, all patterns will repeat an infinite number of times. In the same way, the conditions in an infinite universe will repeat across space creating parallel worlds. There's another you out there. There's an infinite number of ""you"" out there.2) Inflationary multiverse - The universe is constantly expanding. Everything is. And new universes are popping up in the expanded space of older ones. Imagine it like a chunk of Swiss cheese that keeps getting bigger and bigger with new holes popping up when the existing ones get too far separated.3) Brane multiverse - This is the first of a series of theories (I use that term loosely) that come out of the math related to string theory. According to ST, there are at least 11 dimensions and our universe exists in 3 of them. Other universes might possibly exist in other dimensions.4) Cyclic multiverse - Imagine that two of the branes in the ""theory"" above inhabit at least one similar dimension. If these branes collide, they would (possibly, maybe) create a cataclysm similar to a big bang that would bring into creation other branes inhabiting other dimensions. 5) Landscape multiverse - The math nerds who are really into string theory have realized that there are an infinite number of multiple dimensional shapes that can be created when you play around enough with ST's equations. This version of the multiverse states that each of those shapes represents a real brane universe somewhere out there.6) Quantum Multiverse - This one is a scientific version of a theory that many of us are familiar with. Imagine Schrodinger's cat. I look in my box and he's dead. But another me in a parallel universe looks in his box and the cat is alive. I eat Chinese for dinner, he goes hungry. Quantum mechanics if loaded with probabilities rather than certainty. This theory states that each and every variable in those probabilities is realized in parallel universes. 7) Holographic multiverse - Our universe is mirrored by a reality taking place on a distant bounding surface. In other words, there is a physically equivalent ""holograph"" of everything in our universe... somewhere out there.8) Simulated Universe - The Matrix9) Ultimate universe - Any type of universe that can be imagined really does exist.I will let you decide for yourself how plausible any of these theories might be. For me, I don't mind exploring the ideas of some of them when they are played out in science fiction/fantasy. Its just... I was thinking this book would be a bit lighter on the fantasy and a little heaver on the science. Oh well, Brian Greene is still a great author. "
42,0307265633,http://goodreads.com/user/show/55180466-akhil-munjal,4,"This book is sitting at the very edge of what science understands and what is yet unknown in terms of multi universes and quantum laws. This is a great book if one wants to get lost in the nuances of string theory, multiverse and the latest thought experiments in physics which are trying to weave a unified theory building upon Einstein's theories. Being a layperson myself I have to admit alot in this book was beyond my comprehension but that maybe because I am a being living in 3 dimension instead of 4 or 5 dimensions. I would recommend this book to a reader curious about detailed theoretical explorations in the multiverse landscape especially if reader is looking for a audiobook as I can't think of any other book which explores these concepts in such detail in the audio medium.5 years from now, I would like to revisit this book with a notebook and pencil to make notes and cross reference ideas but for the moment I went through it just once and came out feeling more list then enlightened. For a layperson like me, I would recommend reading about the topics presented in this book in conjunction with wikipedia to put ideas into perspective.Edit - I loved Dr Greene's TV show and have watched it quite a few times on Netflix - but I had not made the correlation between the author of this book and the show host till now. A man of many talents indeed!"
43,0307265633,http://goodreads.com/user/show/29620323-karima,4,"As someone who has virtually no background in physics, math, or science in general, this book was a bit challenging (it seems like I started it in a previous century). Without a good foundation of previous knowledge, I found myself researching concepts, re-reading passages two or three times, and then going forward in an attempt to jolt myself into understanding.That said, Brian Greene does help simplify complex concepts with some nicely grounded imagery. I particularly like the explanation of the inflationary universe theory using Swiss cheese, or describing the braneworld scenario by likening us to fish in an aquarium.Greene also does a great job of presenting various theories and hypothesis, though the fact that some of these are incapable of being tested is a bit mind blowing to a layperson. I am definitely keeping this book as a reference for future research. "

His table at the end of the book boiling down all the theories is almost worth the price of the book itself. That said, his explanatory analogies are strained often to the point of absurdity (i.e. Finding actors for ""Harvey W. Einstein's"" new movie, ""Pulp Friction""; locating electrons in a 3D map of New York). It is almost as if Kaku beat him to all the good ones and he had to make do with what was left. Also, his reasoning and argumentation is equally strained, including the use of circular arguments and blind-faith fundamental assumptions.Not a bad read, but it had the potential to be much better."

"
56,0307265633,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1925269-paul-weimer,5,"Brian Greene is the foremost advocate for the power and strength of String Theory. While he himself might not be on the cutting edge of string theory research, his role as a popularizer and explainer of string theory makes him the one name the average person could name, if they could name anyone at all, involved with string theory. In the Hidden Reality, Brian Greene builds on his previous two books, The Elegant Universe, and The Fabric of the Cosmos, to continue the story of String Theory in a new context--the Multiverse. The Universe is big, nearly indescribably so. Far from the small sphere imagined by the ancients, the universe is so large that there are regions of space within our universe that have expanded so far away, so fast, that we can never, ever see them. And yet even given that, that may not be the full extent of all that is. Such heady concepts abound in the Hidden Reality, where Greene describes a series of scenarios where our universe, our reality, is only one of many. From the quantum mechanical to branes to us living in a computer simulation a la the Matrix, Greene illustrates a number of possibilities for parallel universes of various kinds--from places where duplicates of Earth exist, to places where the very laws of reality are stunningly different. String Theory, the contentious, complicated and convoluted mathematics that describe one dimensional strings as the fundamental building block of everything, are our tool and guidepost for exploring these possible multiverses. While The Hidden Reality is a popular science book, one should not mistake this book as easy or light reading for anyone outside of the fields of Physics. Greene could have made this book even more comprehensive, as he again and again subcontracts some of his more detailed explanations to his other two books for readers interested in the deeper details of a point he is making. Having read both of his books, I didn't find this off putting, but it felt like he was overly pimping his work a bit the nth time I came across this practice in the text.The other thing to understand before picking up this book is his evangelistic attitude toward String Theory. There are some other physics theories out there that attempt to unify and explain things in the same way that String Theory does. (e.g. Loop Quantum Gravity) but Greene is frankly dismissive of these other approaches. High level Physics readers who have problems with String Theory will definitely not like this book, since reading nearly all of it predicates an acceptance of String Theory.Should you read this book? If you have read, relatively understood and enjoyed Greene's previous two books, then, absolutely. Greene marries string theory and its latest developments and evolutions with a sheaf of ideas for multiverses. Greene may not be Stephen Hawking, but he does a good job at making this material as accessible to the hoi polloi as it is possible. If String Theory to you sounds like something that happens to your Ramen noodles, then this is not quite the place to start. I would try the Elegant Universe, and then, if you understood and enjoyed that, come back to The Hidden Reality, possibly by way of the Fabric of the Universe.If Greene is right, and one of these multiverse theories are correct, then there is an alternate you, right now, reading this review, possibly wondering if there are more of you somewhere else in the multiverse. Heady stuff."
57,0307265633,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2105908-nate-johnson,3,"While I suppose this was an overall solid book, it had the dynamics of watching the big-bang in reverse as interesting opening chapters with infinite possibility got sucked into a singularity of, well, density. It was difficult for me to tell if this was because the material itself is inherently conceptually incomprehensible - I'm sure it's mind-bogglingly difficult - but unlike Greene's other forays into rendering the obtuse transparent, I feel this time his skills were not up to the task. He also engaged in my least-favorite aspect of all pop-science writing, the speculative epilogue. Greene struggled with the last view versions of speculative physics-based multiverses, which was fine and entirely expected; frontiers wouldn't be frontiers were they not difficult. But his step into the realm of computer simulations of and, E-friggin'-gads, philosophical versions of multiverses, were disastrous. I applaud his effort to incorporate these into a total vision of the topic of multiverses, but given that those latter theories relied on complex bodies of information theory, theories of the mind-body problem (hard and ""soft"" versions), and some pretty hard-core metaphysics (which get scant mention), I think he may have been better off politely declaring these aspects beyond the purview of the book. As it stood, the book overstepped, and an otherwise sharp account ended up saying some rather silly things in its concluding paragraphs*. For a book that requires so much imagination and vision to grasp, not to mention write, I found it odd that Greene failed to imagine that perhaps our earthbound imaginations and all their assumptions that math is eternal, that logic coheres, could break down in the, ahem, astral planes. (* - I'll limit things to one example - after a long explanation of how the possibility of total multiverses and computer simulated universes effectively challenges our faith in the reality of anything we see, he then went on to hinge his belief in the likelihood of these scenarios in whether evidence for them existed within what he just alleged we have every reason to be skeptical of. I.e., he says something along the lines of ""I'm not going to worry about the possibility of simulated universes until I see one in this reality,"" which is just a blatant mischaracterization of the knowledge relationships of hierarchical metaphysics. We have no reason whatsoever to assume that metaphysical possibilities for generating this world are contingent on those metaphysical properties being replicated by physical ones in this world. That's kinda the entire point of having that prefix ""meta"" before ""physics."" Ya dig? Ditto for his comments on possibilities of math and computers, etc. Alright, I'll stop).So, in short - a great, fascinating look at how exactly how theoretical physics leads to reasonable speculation about multiverses. It's not the wackiness that typically gets portrayed. So the first, say, 200 pages of the book flew by and were of the same quality of The Elegant Universe. The remainder got slower and slower and slower until the book devoured itself and made for some pretty painful reading. I admire the task Greene undertakes, but if the later theories in this book are still this impenetrable, perhaps the book is premature. That said, I enjoyed this account that while there may be nothing new under the sun, there's some potentially crazy stuff happening above it."
58,0307265633,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4004160-john,5,"Wow. And also: holy crap. This is the book I wished the last Stephen Hawking book was going to be (but never could). Greene does an amazing job of explaining the mathematical approaches to physics, their validity, and how every one of them‚Äîwhen taken far enough down the path‚Äîleads to the appearance of multiple universes. Multiple universes. Think about that. Our solar system has 8 planets (sorry Pluto); our galaxy has hundreds of billions of stars in it, more or less like our sun. And there are hundreds of billions of galaxies out there. That's our universe‚Äîour knowable universe. But the observable horizon‚Äîthe section of ""what is"" that I described above‚Äîis just the tip of the iceberg. It's ostensibly even less than that. Less than a grain of sand on the beach. Math and probability dictate that there is bound to be other universe-sized chunks out there that we simply can never observe because they're too far away. Potentially an infinite number of them. If you get into this stuff, Greene's rundown of the different multiple universe scenarios‚Äîthe quilted multiverse, the inflation universe, the brane universe, etc‚Äîis very accessible. I really should have read his stuff before. Granted, I had to put it down and read another book halfway through, to cleanse my brain of all the astoundingly gigantic science he was dropping. But yes, damn good. Confession: a tiny little part of me‚Äîmy less better self‚Äîreads books like this and draws comparisons to more ""traditional"" worldviews. This part of myself gets angry when I think of people that desperately cling to and push Bronze Age ideas and prejudices‚Äîin the face of the beautiful, elegant genius science has painstakingly developed over centuries.

59,0307265633,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6007036-stephen-chen,4,"I enjoyed this book -- it was more difficult to understand than the Elegant Universe. Unlike the Elegant Universe, which spent a fair amount of time covering earlier developments in physics and quantum mechanics before getting to string theory, it moved more quickly into the actual new content, and honestly I enjoy reviewing those developments since I am not well grounded in them, so I missed that. But I did enjoy reading about the extent to which string theory has seen additional mathematical or experimental verification, how the theory has developed and the continuing challenges it faces. It also had a pretty interesting discussion on the anthropic principle, which I've read small articles on but still find very odd, and on the concept of wrestling whether speculation on the elements of the universe which by their definition are unobservable is really science. Its pretty interesting to think that we're getting to the boundaries of traditional conceptions of science as explaining why something acts or is the way it is due to fundamental rules about reality since we are asking ourselves why our fundamental rules of reality are the way they are and not some other way and the sort of mind-tripping explanations that science is coming up with to explain that (many of which are, in a nutshell, that the rules of the universe are simply the way they are because we happen to be in this universe and there are actually other universes where the fundamental rules are not the way they are here -- which itself raises questions as to whether that's a satisfying answer -- even if it were the right one). Also, Greene mentions learning from Robert Nozick at the end and postulates a universe theory based not on scientific theory but based off of his time learning from him -- which is interesting to see the intersection of philosophy and science -- things that I normally view as diverging several hundred years ago."
