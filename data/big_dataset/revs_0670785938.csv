0,0670785938,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3897817-morgan-blackledge,5,"The Body Keeps Score is my jam. It's better than that. It's like my slammajam. This is my fave book of the year so far, by a bunch. It's a rich treasure trove of information from the frontiers of trauma research, etiology, diagnosis and treatment. It's changing the way I do therapy and it's changing the way a interpret human behavior. And to think. I almost didn't read it.When I entered the mental health field I had intended to specialize in Somatic Experiencing (SE) trauma therapy. But I quickly rejected the model when I realized it was way outside the mainstream and lacked randomized control trials (RCT) that demonstrated its effectiveness compared to other ""first line"" treatments such as Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT) and Prolonged Exposure Therapy (PE). I saw the author Dr. Bessel Van Der Kolk lecture at the Evolution of Psychotherapy conference in 2013. He was awesome, and he really reinvigorated my interest in doing somatically oriented trauma work. But something about the experience as a whole left me feeling woozy.Perhaps my experience was negativity impacted by the mass, prolonged exposure to the unwashed throngs of other psychotherapists (never a good thing), some of whom were from the San Francisco Bay Area (a deadly combination).Don't get me wrong. There are lots of mental health professionals (even ones from the Bay Area) that are highly functional, sober, top notch folks. But there are also a bunch of kooky, crazy as fuck people in the field (Particularly in the Bay Area), and there were a bunch in the crowd, and I think I was feeling a bit (or perhaps a lot) of shame for my profession. A pathological shame that was clearly a sequallia of my own dark hippy shadow.I myself lived in the Bay Area for around a decade. I came to therapy from an unconventional ""hippyish"" background. I went to art school as an undergraduate. I have practiced yoga and meditation for over 30 years. Plus I have a couple of crappy tattoos. When I entered the field I was dreadfully afraid no one would take me seriously. So I somewhat consciously but mostly unconsciously tried to distance myself from my own freaky roots. I was probably still up in my head about all that when I was listening to Dr. Van Der Kolk. I was loving what he was saying, the parts I could understand any way (he speaks in a thick Dutch accent), but I also remember looking around the room and thinking ""I have to distinguish myself from these nutty hippies"". Perhaps it was at that point I unconsciously gripped up and rejected somatic trauma work (again) in favor of the more ""masculine"" ""serious"" ""evidence based"", behaviorally oriented, here and now stuff that I currently practice. Which, by the way, is Acceptance Comment Therapy (ACT). A mindfulness based variant of CBT which is incidentally a ""hippy as fuck"" therapeutic modality by many standards.Anyway.When I first saw that the book was released, I was like ""hey, that looks pretty good"" but then I had a flash back from the psychotherapy conference. It was an intrusive mental image of a patchouli smelling, chubby middle aged hippy chick in a mauve knit poncho sweater and dream catcher earrings saying ""your fifth level is emitting too much teal energy"" and I reflexively withdrew my enthusiasm for the whole somatically oriented trauma treatment program.Anyway. I did eventually get over myself (and my hippy phobia) and got the book and man is it good. It's extremely, extremely triple extremely good. It's like, organically, cosmically, spin your chakras at a dead show good.And despite Dr. Van Der Kolk's activist agenda, he's actually a pretty reputable (Harvard affiliated) scientist and clinician and widely regarded as one the the worlds foremost authorities on trauma and trauma sequelae (yes I used the term seguelae twice in the same review, actually three times if you count the time I just used sequallia in this parentheses, oops, better make that four). And, yes, Dr. Van Der Kolk also apparently does yoga and meditation and has probably smoked tons of weed and hung out at Eslen. But I am willing to forgive the man for that because I too have been guilty of similar behavior in my woolly headed, not so distant past. Before I became a therapist, I was on my own journey to recovery from addiction, trauma, depression, anxiety etc.BTW: when I hear other therapist start talking about their recovery, I cringe. Please forgive me if you're feeling cringy. But sometimes we all have to go there in order to communicate certain important points.Anyway.The foundation of my recovery was self-care. For me, self-care was (and still is) founded on basics such as: healthy sleep, exercise and nutrition. It also included good therapy and a little 12-step. But the rocket fuel of my recovery was yoga, loving kindness meditation and mindfulness meditation.Now, one of my primary intentions as a therapist is to assist my clients in developing self compassion and embodied mindfulness skills for utilization in their recovery.While the secular mindfulness revolution thing that has been happening over the past two decades has normalized mindfulness and provided ample scientific evidence for the clinical use value of mindfulness training e.g. Mindfulness Based Stress Reduction (MBSR).And mindfulness-based psychotherapeutic modalities such as Dialectical Behavioral Therapy (DBT) and Acceptance Commitment Therapy (ACT) have provided evidence-based mindfulness integrated psychotherapeutic frameworks.The evidence for somatically oriented (embodied) therapeutic modalities has lagged. Dr. Van Der Kolk's work is providing this evidence and is blazing the trail for mainstream acceptance of somatically oriented practices. Dr. Van Der Kolk's work is also foundational for changing the way the field conceptualizes and diagnoses trauma. Additionally Dr. Van Der Kolk is lending legitimacy to some cutting-edge and very exciting trauma treatments such as Neural Feedback and Eye Movement Desensitization and Reprocessing (EMDR). I, like millions of other people, have suffered from Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) symptoms. In early recovery I received lots of good therapy for trauma and I'm happy to report that I am no longer impaired by PTSD symptoms.Out of all of the therapy I received, anecdotally speaking, I have to say, some of the most effective was EMDR. I had phenomenal results from an equally phenomenally brief treatment time (two, one hour sessions). This is standard EMDR testimonial. People very commonly report that it works and it works fast.Again, as a nascent therapist in training, I had intended to train in EMDR. But EMDR is like the dirty redheaded stepchild of psychotherapy. Despite ample evidence of its efficacy, nobody can figure out why it works, so the model has been widely rejected by the mainstream mental health community. I sort of drank the Kool-Aid and jumped on the anti EMDR bandwagon. But after reading this book, I'm feeling very enthusiastic about treating trauma with EMDR.I could go on and on, but I'd rather just urge you to do yourself a big favor and read this book."
1,0670785938,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2018505-thomas,5,"A compassionate, intelligent, and transformative book about trauma. As an aspiring clinical psychologist and writer, I look up to Bessel van der Kolk a lot. In The Body Keeps the Score, he infuses empirical, innovative research with hands-on clinical experience to explain trauma in a clear, authentic way. I loved his emphasis on incorporating both biology and social relationships into our understanding of trauma, as awful events affect both the body as well as the actual life of a struggling individual. He clarifies many misconceptions by stressing how many victims of child abuse often go ignored when compared to war veterans, and he argues with much logic that we cannot just use drugs to treat Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) and other mental illnesses. We must treat the whole person.Dr. van der Kolk steers this book in a hopeful direction by discussing many treatment strategies for PTSD. He includes descriptions and research studies to support a gamut of methodologies, ranging from Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT) to Eye Movement Desensitization Therapy (EMDR) to Neurofeedback, and more. In particular I enjoyed reading about the Internal Family System approach (IFS), a mode of psychotherapy I had never heard of, which I found enlightening and holistic. Dr. van der Kolk emphasizes the importance of getting back in touch with our emotions and our bodies after trauma, and he gives many practical ways to do so, like talk therapy and yoga, just to name a few.Dr. van der Kolk's genuine heart elevates this book above others. His vulnerability with his own story models a message for all of us to live by: only by confronting and accepting the past can we learn to live in the present. He writes about the importance of de-stigmatizing PTSD and mental illness, and he relates the issue of trauma to several societal factors, like the prolific amount of gun violence in the United States and the lack of socioemotional education given to our kids. Dr. van der Kolk, with great humility and insight, details his admiration for each of his clients - because they have overcome such devastating hardship, and they have had the courage to share their stories with him, and in some cases, others as well.A stellar book I would recommend to anyone interested in trauma, mental health, or science in general. I noted so many well-written passages and cannot wait to reference this book in the future. I hope more people read The Body Keeps the Score - it would improve our society a lot."
2,0670785938,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2531665-charlene,2,"This book represents everything that is groundbreakingly wonderful and and pseudoscientifically horrendous about trauma research. Individuals who suffer trauma are in need of actual help. This book contains some of the best, latest, and most effective cures for trauma sufferers, which can steer patients toward the help they need. However, van der Kolk seems wholly unable to engage in critical thinking when it comes to various treatments. When attending courses in cognitive neuroscience and psychology at the University of Pennsylvania, my favorite professors were those who ripped apart each treatment to examine it for efficacy. The profs held out hope that cures were attainable but put them under the microscope to make damn sure the ""cure"" would not actually retraumatize and individual or make matters worse. In order to trust a mental health care provider, that provider should demonstrate not only a knowledge of the literature (as van der Kolk does as he repeatedly throws around his MD and Harvard alma marter to assure his reader of his credentials) but also an ability to sort out fact from fiction. van der Kolk seems entirely enamored with outdated findings (that have since been shown to be incorrect) and therapies that have failed to be backed up by empirical support. Most concerning, he seems completely in denial about how easily false memories form and the damage they can do. On a more positive note, he does a great job championing individuals who are often rejected by the field of psychiatry. Since false memories are real, and they have wreaked havoc on an already traumatized person's fragile life, many aspects that lead to remembering repressed memories have come under fire. This has served to invalidate the real and true experiences suffered by many people during their childhoods and beyond. Under particular scrutiny is dissociation, something that can be particularly difficult for survivors to deal with, is treated as if it doesn't exist. This is certainly a problem and I do not know how to find a middle ground between dissociation deniers and false memory/ personality creating therapists, but I would venture to say that van der Kolk's approach is not it. There has got to be a better way to validate the real, and sometimes repressed traumas while, at the same time, not creating new ones by promoting fictitious experiences that do not exist. Additionally, there is a lot of study involving a person's perception that never made it into this book. I understand that, again, it is difficult to take on the effects of perception while simultaneously trying to validate what really happened to people. But, perception can really affect mental health and subsequent behavior. Not only that, there is a very real phenomenon in which excused behavior can cause the trauma sufferer to continue to delve out trauma to others. While van der Kolk mildly touched on this at times, he did not do so in any in depth of concrete manner. This book could have been half as long and, if van der Kolk had stuck to only empirically sound findings and treatments, could have been a great book. Associating words with Harvard and MD doesn't make them true. It just makes people believe them more. Sometimes that is more harmful than helpful. Despite the foregoing criticisms, this book, with its many chapters on various treatments, might help trauma sufferers seek a treatment that seems right for them. "
3,0670785938,http://goodreads.com/user/show/31275565-kai,5,"I'm not a psychologist, psychiatrist, doctor, social worker or otherwise involved in treatment or research of mental conditions or disorders. What I am is a guy in his mid-twenties who experienced multiple instances of severe medical trauma as a child, in my case open-heart surgeries at the ages of three months, six years and eleven years. I've spent the majority of my life (read: all of it) doing my best to repress and resist the terror, anger and sadness I felt as a result of having gone through these procedures. And I was able to get by, mostly, though my life always seemed to be a highly fragile construct, where I worked tirelessly to maintain control. I lost control this year, or maybe part of myself decided it was time to let go of my controlling behaviors and coping mechanisms, which no longer serve to help me, but instead negatively affect the quality of my life. This was a very tough realization, and my default response was to beat up myself for behaving 'wrong' or otherwise being 'a failure' for the way I had been just trying to get by. That's why this book has been so important for me, because I now realize that the way I've been living isn't bad or wrong--I've been trying to survive, to get to a place where I can truly feel safe, validated and connected to others. But my body doesn't know how to let down, to let go. Much as Dr. van der Kolk points out throughout this book, I'm stuck in these moments of past horror, faced with autonomic imbalances that keep me on the defensive 24/7. And I don't know how to stop. This book has already proven to be a crucial resource, as it sheds light on much of what I've been struggling with my whole life, showing that there are people out there who really understand. Just as important, it shows me that there is help available. It took me over three months to read this book, because part of me hated that I could identify with so much of what the author describes when discussing the nature of trauma. Oftentimes it just made me profoundly sad. Some of the experiences shared within are also quite harrowing. Usually I couldn't get through a chapter without breaking down. But I kept coming back to it, because I knew it was within my power to help and educate myself. Thank you, Dr. van der Kolk, for helping me take this step towards healing myself, past and present. I hope to look back on this period one day and recognize how much reading this book helped me to start down the path to recovery, presence of mind and body, and fully engaging with life."
4,0670785938,http://goodreads.com/user/show/100867863-alok-vaid-menon,4,"As someone who suffers from chronic pain I’ve found it difficult to find resources about the connection between trauma + physical pain. This is because the mind-body connection are (I think intentionally) underdeveloped in Western medicine which so often rehearses the body outside of context. Van der Kolk shows how trauma can shape every aspect of our psychology + physiology: making us attracted to dangerous/painful situations, affecting our perception of time + space, dispossessing us of the ability to describe our discomfort, causing chronic muscle pain, headaches, + autoimmune disorders. We live in a world that constantly underemphasizes the emotional trauma even though the same parts of the brain are impacted by emotional pain as by physical violence. Heartbreak, betrayal, neglect, depression physically hurt. This continual undervaluation of emotional stress means that it accumulates, depletes significant energy + attacks our most vulnerable organs.Van der Kolk describes chronic pain as when your brain gets trapped in a pre-programmed escape route, stuck in perpetual fear. For him, the goal is about how to develop coping strategies for trauma that don’t retraumatize us: reintegration, not repression. Healing is possible when we commit to this reintegration. Talk therapy isn’t enough: we can’t just describe the problem, we have to experience “immobilization without fear.” As a doctor, his book has a clinical bent + outlines various strategies like EMDR + biofeedback which help break trauma cycles. I wish that there had been more discussion of people who have complex trauma where there is no “before” or “after” to the traumatic event. I’m thinking here about how racism + transphobia are continual forms of trauma that we can’t move out of. There was so much important info in the book, but I was kind of turned off by the clinical language where complex people became case studies and cultural rituals became Western mindfulness practices without appreciation for context. As a survivor of abuse this book can be difficult to get through, so serious content warning. "
5,0670785938,http://goodreads.com/user/show/175635-trevor,5,"This is a remarkable book. There are a lot of people I would recommend this book to, but it is about trauma and so the author discusses trauma and describes traumatic events – and the more I thought about who I might recommend it to, the less I felt able to. I’m not sure I really can ‘recommend’ you read this – but then, I might be more squeamish than other people are with books on these topics. And dear god, there are people out there who do the most awful things to one another. In one of Steven Pinker’s books I read years ago – either the Blank Slate or How the Mind Works – he says that father-daughter incest is incredibly rare, in fact, virtually unheard of – like most things he says, he said this with utter conviction and, like most things he seems to say outside of linguistics, he was completely and even dangerously wrong. Like I’ve said, a lot of this book makes for unbearable reading. That said, I would still encourage you to read it if you can bring yourself to. Now, I’m not saying that for the normal bullshit reason people say such things – you know, because it gives you an insight into the dark side of the human condition (if you want that, you could just turn on the news), or that it is so inspiring to see people overcome near infinite aversity (I guess it must be, but there are better ways to be inspired), but I would suggest reading it because I think our world is becoming an increasingly traumatic place. I’m certainly not saying that modern life is the same as being raped by your drunken father while you are still in primary school, but I do think that modern life presents us with a sense of powerlessness, of disassociation, of an overwhelming sense of loathing for what we are forced to do in our day-after-day jobs and that all this can be (no, actually, IS) a source of mental trauma to far too many of us. If the trauma discussed here often happens with a bang, I think the slow drip, drip, drip of horror of a lot of modern life can have much the same accumulative impact. Couple that with the abject precariousness with which we hold our jobs, even while they cripple our sense of self-worth, and really, you get one of those perfect storms people seem to like to talk about – you know, lots of bad things and all of them happening at the same time.I am a very strong believer in the power of narrative – we are not just ‘pattern making creatures’ but rather we are ‘story making creatures’. All the same, this isn’t always a good thing. The story Hitler told of German humiliation after WWI, of the power of world Jewry to cripple the German nation out of spite, of the Jewish link to Bolshevisms, and this and so much more, left us with a decade drowned in blood. My belief in the power of stories has always made me fond of the psychological ‘talking cure’ – well, fond for other people, if not so much for myself. I’ve always believed that if we can find ways to ‘rewrite’ our stories we gain power over our life. This book makes it clear that in cases of real and deep trauma this isn’t always possible, in fact, it is counter-productive at best.The author explains that when we experience deeply traumatic events our brains ‘cope’ by shutting down those parts of the brain that are not immediately necessary for us to come out the other end of the event alive. The part of the brain that gets shut down that is most interesting in relation to post-traumatic stress is the bit that locates the event in time. (That part of the brain has a name, I’m never interested enough to remember those names – the book gives you all those names and maybe even more). I guess the brain figures that all times are one time if you it isn’t clear you are going to live through an event. The problem is that this means that the event then isn’t really connected to any specific time – and so it can never be ‘over’ – it is ‘ever-present’. That is, any trigger that brings the event back to mind doesn’t just remind you of the event – it puts you back into the immediacy of the event. You don’t just ‘remember’ the event – you are back living it. And this is why talking cures don’t work so well with trauma – if memory is like groves implanted on our brain, reliving events in all of their immediacy over and over again, as if these events are constantly in the present, turns those groves into canyons. A lot of post-modern theory is interested in how our bodies embody who we are. A case in point is gender – what it means to become male and female is highly dependent on the culture you are brought up in. In pre-revolutionary China certain women had their feet bound since this was considered the height of feminine beauty – but you don’t need to physically bound parts of people’s bodies to embody social attitudes within them. The wearing of high heels comes to mind, of course, but I’m also thinking of the ‘man spread’ people complain about on trains – and yet, you never hear the same complaint about women. And why? Because women are taught to make themselves small throughout their lives in our culture and this eventually becomes so embodied within their identity as to be unnoticed by them or anyone else – well, unless they break the rule, take up more space than is allocated to them, and then everyone notices.A large part of the point of this book is to show how trauma marks our bodies in ways we may not notice as being related to the trauma and that these marks, these embodied scars, while designed to ‘protect’ us, can often have the effect of prolonging and accentuating the scars the trauma has left.As such, a lot of this book, at least the bits that consider at how to overcome trauma, look much less at what drugs you should take to make the symptoms disappear, but rather what can you do physically to control the effects of your trauma. The author practices EMDR – Eye Movement Desensitisation and Reprocessing – which, is something my daughter has been doing, and something I would have dismissed a few years ago as nonsense. As I said above, the point of much of trauma therapy is to convince your brain that the traumatic event is now in the past. It is pretty difficult to rewrite your story if the story seems to be happening right now and you are about to die. So, finding a way to think about that story and to also feel safe is pretty important. The author suggests that EMDR is one of the ways to achieve that – well, and patience too. He also has an entire chapter on yoga. He stresses the importance of becoming aware of one’s own body, and not just in the sense of noticing when you are hyperventilating or your heart is jumping out of your chest – although, these are good things to notice too – but also where memories feel like they are stored in your body. You know, where it is uncomfortable to be touched or, in yoga, which positions make you feel vulnerable and why that might be. He also talks about the power of writing – I really do believe in this, like I’ve said already, I believe in stories. I really think that most of us miss the point of writing, that it is a way for us to see what we think, quite literally, and that we do not use this power nearly often enough. But, again, this comes back to my belief in the power of narrative, and perhaps it is just me.Like I said at the beginning – it is hard to know if I can recommend this book, but it is fascinating stuff.And Benjamin Rogers – thanks for recommending this to me, I’m very grateful."
6,0670785938,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1302775-meredith-holley,3,"This book was super okay. I think the title should be changed to, ""PTSD for Treatment Professionals: An academic and anecdotal exploration of trauma treatments."" So, that was not what I signed up for. I'll say, if you have PTSD, probably don't read this book because it has these very graphic descriptions of patient trauma experiences. I think therapists are the target audience for this book, and it provides an interesting overview of the treatment modalities available for PTSD and the research about them.One thing I will say about all of the PTSD books I've read lately is that people HATE the DSM. I kind of get it, and I can see how it fucks everything up, especially with kids, but also I kind of think the rage should be turned more to the insurance industry than the DSM. Like the DSM seems more like a symptom of the overall problem where we are more into classifying people than helping them.My other takeaway is that Bessel A. van der Kolk is super badass. He is one of the early researchers on PTSD, and he describes working in the old mental hospitals and seeing people sprayed down with hoses to clean them. So, that's an example of the type of story he tells that made this book a slow read for me. I will say, I listen to people's trauma stories all day long, but the stories he told in this book were really heavy to me. I had to take a lot of breaks. In the chapter on EMDR, he talks about his EMDR training. He was in a group training class and was partnered with a person who did not want to talk about his trauma experience during the EMDR. (In EMDR, the way van der Kolk did it, you basically wave your fingers in front of someone's face as they re-experience a trauma memory, and the eye movements process the trauma memory into the regular stream of memory in the brain. It's super magic and also evidence-based.) Van der Kolk was mad that the person didn't want to talk and complained to the instructor. The instructor told him to question whether there was a voyeuristic element to why he became a therapist.So, that seemed like an insightful perspective, and I thought it made sense with this book. A lot of the stories he told had a voyeuristic element to them in my view. I don't really feel critical about that, but I did not enjoy that aspect of the book.I appreciated the overview of trauma treatments, though. So far, from everything I've read somatic experiencing and EMDR are the ones I'm most impressed with. "
7,0670785938,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2547702-gretchen-rubin,0,"In the space of two weeks, two people recommended this book to me. A fascinating look at the body and trauma, very wide-ranging."
8,0670785938,http://goodreads.com/user/show/22009196-antigone,4,"Dr. van der Kolk's study of trauma treatment is the most respected book lately published on the subject of post-traumatic stress disorder.Following in the footsteps of Babette Rothschild and Peter Levine, van der Kolk takes as his focus the physical aspects of psychological injury - suggesting that work with the body is the clearest and most effective approach to healing. He is not a fan of the pharmacological. Drugs, while useful in tamping down the flood of fearsome emotional response, do little more than re-establish a basic level of functioning. In his view, medications cannot be considered treatment as they do not lead to a resolution of the condition. Over thirty years of research and clinical practice have led him to alternative methods of care that have shown to produce real results in the lives of those too often relegated to prescriptive numbing and symptom management.After a bit of a muddled start (that will trigger the vulnerable reader), the doctor locates his footing and begins a guided tour through a series of body-based programs designed to address the fundamental conflict underlying PTSD. Those familiar with trauma are well aware of the sense of being caught in the maelstrom of a past catastrophe and unable to break free. The surreptitious assault of flashback, the tactile immediacy of phantom danger, and the brutal jolt into a fight/flight/freeze posture leaves the psyche in a constant state of high alert as energy levels drop to depletion. Dr. van der Kolk traces the body-brain connection and walks the injury through several alternative treatments - among them EMDR (eye movement desensitization and reprocessing), yoga, IFS (internal family systems therapy - which has nothing to do with families and everything to do with creating a whole of the many different internal parts of a person), psychomotor therapy, neurofeedback, and even theater work. These are the money chapters, and where a substantial amount of hope resides. Merely becoming familiar with the methods may, in fact, set some wheels to turn...and that is helpful.Dr. van der Kolk is not a writer, but then few in this field throw their skills in a literary direction. What is important to them is what will help you. This book holds that aim as its sole preoccupation. And all I have to say about that is...bravo."
9,0670785938,http://goodreads.com/user/show/597461-elyse-walters,5,"Audiobook.... read by the author: Dr. Bessel van der Kolk.Kolk is one of the world’s experts on trauma. He spent three decades working with survivors. This book is packed filled with science, research, experience, and human stories that are phenomenally informative and intense!!!!Kolk exposes how trauma physically affects changes in the brain and body causing anxiety, rage, depression, the inability to concentrate, problems remembering, flashbacks, trusting, and forming relationships. He examines trauma caused by childhood neglect, abandonment, sexual or domestic abuse, and war. ....We learn lessons from Vietnam veterans. ....We get a better understanding how the brain works. How PTSD plays out. ....He explains the body-mind connections: losing your body: losing yourself. ....He takes us into the minds of children, and adults - showing how trauma develops over time -turning into PTSD. We get a grand overview of the ‘historical development’ -academically & intimately - associated with understanding mental health science. I found this book literally fascinating, important, engaging, and helpful. We get a wide glimpse of how doctors have been educated. (with real life examples of doctor/patient connections), The stories were incredibly gripping and compelling.....integrating medical and psychological practices.... ....mixing traditional talk therapy, medications ( many different ones were explore of their effectiveness), new treatments, and alternative therapies such as mindfulness, meditation, breathing exercises, yoga, boxing, tai chi, walking, kick boxing, etc. were also explored. Towards the end of the book Dr. Kolk outlines healing paths to recovery - letting go of the past and rewiring the brain. How to choose a doctor - etc. I can’t express enough how informative and gripping/informative these real life stories exposes. And how sadly PTSD is passed on to our children. Dr. Kolk shared with us patients trauma....( he’s an amazing advocate for finding solutions) > real healingtreatments, beyond medications, ....and ongoing life healing. We see why it’s vital to get help!!! Old traumas get stuck in the brain - it takes gentle safe work to unlock them... in order to experience real joy in the present. I came away with a ‘deeper’ and ‘expanded’ understanding of the body/mind connection in relationship to trauma.I also came away with remarkable compassion/admiration - respect - and dignity for people who have dedicated their lives in the field of mental health... and for all those who suffer.This is an extremely comprehensive book exploring PTSD...(havoc on the brain and body).Highly recommended to educators, parents, and the rest of us!Paul & I both found this book exceptional!One of the most valuable Audiobooks I’ve ever bought! "
10,0670785938,http://goodreads.com/user/show/275400-laurie-neighbors,0,"Gave up. The author's description of his (psychiatric, traumatized) women patients as ""slender"" and ""gorgeous"" is so annoying. (ETA: Especially considering that he is writing in the same breath about rape and incest survivors.)"
11,0670785938,http://goodreads.com/user/show/24377699-cheese,5,"What fascinates me about trauma is what it does to you. It helps you survive whatever has tried to hurt you. It’s a survival instinct. When you experience trauma your brain protects you, it literally creates a new personality on top of the one you were born with and transforms you. It increases your senses, it makes you more intelligent, but it changes your brain chemistry and that's the big problem. If your chemistry changes then you're not going to benefit in normal everyday situations because your flight, fight and freeze part of your brain is now on over drive, your hypothalamus is now stuck in hyper drive and your prefrontal cortex becomes neglected and undeveloped and in a contradicting to making you more intelligent now makes you less able to learn by constantly injecting stress hormones into your blood stream.A lot is crammed into this book, over 30 years of research into trauma and I agree with the author, trauma is so important and so relevant in our society. Most people experience some form of trauma throughout their lives, but it seems the younger and more undeveloped you are the more profound the effect is later on in life. It literally passes down from generation to generation and we still don't discuss or treat trauma as a norm. If everyone was more knowledgeable about trauma and how it affects us then I think our medical advice and how we treat people would be far different from what it is today.I find it easy to notice when someone has experienced trauma. It affects their persona, but there are visual and acoustic clues as well. It helps to know if someone has trauma because you have to adapt to their reasoning and thinking which can often be off kilter.This book is brilliant for psychologists and people who want to learn more about themselves and trauma. It has a diverse knowledge or different applications which are proven to work. Obviously CBT is the most common, but two more I find very interesting and fascinating for trauma treatment is EMDR and Yoga. Both I think are brilliant and I was aware of before the book, but this book shows just what impact it has on masses. I genuinely feel like when it comes to psychology and nutritional sciences, the USA is years ahead of everyone else especially the UK. I really hope a lot of this work makes it over here sooner rather than later.Knowing more about trauma means we can help heal our society, prevent abuse and even enrich ourselves."

An absolute must read/listen for trauma survivors, professionals who work with them, as well as family members of those who have endured extreme adversity. One of the best books on this topic that I have come across. Warmly recommended."
14,0670785938,http://goodreads.com/user/show/20812512-patricia-ann,1,"Disappointing. I so looked forward to this book from Goodreads. I found it to be disconnected and disorganized, covering so many different aspects of trauma that it dealt with none of them well. The disjunctive aspect of placing Vietnam vet PTSD along with survivors of childhood abuse was confusing. Language used was at times that of a professor, at times that of a thesis, and at others of a non professional. van der Kolk's debate with DSM V was also unnecessary to the book. A great deal of footnotes were listed, however in many areas footnotes were necessary to support statements and were not there. Case studies, neuropsychology experiments on rats are not valid supporting evidence of corresponding brain function in humans nor of the ""curative "" aspects of EMDR. I find it difficult to recommend this book to any particular ""audience"" or reader "
15,0670785938,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1897513-laura-tremaine,5,"This is one of the most important books I’ve ever read. Don’t let the word “trauma” keep you away from this one, we’ve all had emotional and physical pain that has affected our bodies more than we realize, and I took so much from reading about how these things could manifest over time. "
16,0670785938,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1015287-molly,5,"I read this largely because of how frequently Mac McClelland cited van der Kolk in Irritable Hearts: A PTSD Love Story. It was both a fascinating and helpful read, as well as one of the most thorough explorations of trauma and its effects that I have come across. It's written for both practitioners and laypeople, and although some of the neuroimaging studies were difficult for me to understand, van der Kolk's explanations were thorough enough that I could still follow the gist of it. The end of the book is a little disheartening, in that readers discover the amazing effects of neurofeedback on trauma survivors with complex PTSD -- only to then find out that in the US, very little time or research has been devoted to studying neurofeedback because it's nowhere near as profitable as prescription drugs. (Where neurofeedback has received the most attention? In athletics, as a way to increase performance.) van der Kolk thoroughly examines and explains different modes of therapy and why certain therapies are more effective than others for different types of trauma survivors. The social and political aspects surrounding trauma are thoroughly discussed, as are the reasons that trauma cannot be considered in a cultural vacuum. This approach is something that I have found severely lacking in other books on trauma, and it makes van der Kolk's arguments all the more convincing. I'd recommend this book to anyone who has experienced trauma or is simply curious about the effects of trauma on the brain and body."
17,0670785938,http://goodreads.com/user/show/26047377-rachel,2,Nearly finished. Couldn’t deal with his voyeuristic description of specific traumatic events. It came across as self-inflating. It’s almost as though it gave him pleasure to share how others confided their traumas to him. Not a great book if you’re easily triggered by descriptions of sexual abuse (sometimes unnecessary graphic). 
18,0670785938,http://goodreads.com/user/show/29728594-deborah-halliday,5,"In The Body Keeps the Score, psychiatrist Bessel van der Kolk has demonstrated the rare ability to write a book that is appropriate for multiple audiences: the general public, undergraduate and graduate students, and current medical, social work, and counseling practitioners. Those unfamiliar with the causes and mechanisms of trauma and PTSD will learn what trauma is, how it originates, and how it affects the body, mind, and spirit. Those already familiar with trauma from the standpoint of psychology or medicine will have access to an overview of a variety new treatments that show promise and effectiveness in recovery from trauma. The first part of the book defines trauma and PTSD. We learn the history of the way trauma and PTSD have been viewed, understood, and diagnosed, and we learn the differences in impact and prognosis between acute and chronic trauma and between trauma originating in childhood vs. adulthood. Along the way we get introduced to attachment theory, brain anatomy and chemistry, and mirror neurons – all in a precise, scientific, yet readable and comprehensible language. The second part of the book goes into the way PTSD has been treated in the past as well as new and promising therapies currently in use. We get chapters, or sections of chapters, on EMDR, Yoga, dance, and body awareness, Internal Family Systems Therapy, neurofeedback, theater, and more. Dr. van der Kolk takes the journey with us, acting as a tour guide through exploration of each of these new therapies. He explains his own evolution through years of medical practice in how he views and treats trauma, learning both from his own experience with patients and from scientific evidence. He takes a courageous stand against some of today’s orthodoxy, including a strong rebuke of the DSM-V. Initially skeptic of some of the new therapies, he presents us with his own observations as well as data to help us judge each new idea for ourselves.There are two minor criticisms I have of this book. First, there is no reference section. The Notes section in the advance copy I received is fifty three pages long, but I personally like a nice, compact Reference section to go along with it. There was also no Index in the advance copy but the Table of Contents promises one, so that will likely be provided in the final version. My second criticism is that parts of Chapter 13 read more like a self-help book, with the author addressing the reader as “you” and suggesting breathing exercises, etc. The shift in tone might leave some readers wondering whether they’d wandered into a different book. This does not last long, however, and we soon enough get back to objective, informational reporting and teaching. One strong impression the reader will take away from this book is of the compassion and honesty of Dr. van der Kolk. He comes across as both a scientist and deeply caring human being who, through this book, has shared his wisdom both with sufferers of PTSD and with those who care for them. As our society becomes more fractured, fast-paced, and alienated, as we witness daily tragedy from around the globe on our smart phones or TV screens, an understanding of the human response to fear, loneliness, alienation, and loss might help us not only to mitigate, but to prevent at least some human suffering. This book provides a foundation. Note: I received an advance copy of this book through a Goodreads giveaway. "
19,0670785938,http://goodreads.com/user/show/14767901-martha-love,5,"This is such an informative book, from the desk of a long time practicing psychiatrist. In a very clear and often personal style, with both research cited of new psychological and medical discoveries as well as many accounts of his own professional cases and experiences, Bessel van der Kolk makes connections between obesity and the increasing use of antipsychotic medications. He makes an insightful and clear account of the problems and needs of working with people with Post Traumatic Stress Disorder and if this is an area of your study or practice, I highly recommend this book.Bessel van der Kolk encourages practitioners who explore non-drug treatments of mental health problems to continue forging onward, despite difficulties in funding in what is viewed in the medical model as ""alternative"" treatments and thus marginalized. He feels one day natural and non-drug treatments will become a focal point in medicine as we turn away from failed medications that instead of healing us only alienate us further from our inner sense of self.

20,0670785938,http://goodreads.com/user/show/35764158-j-s-lee,1,"As a survivor of sexual abuse and trauma, I found this book triggering and lacking the enlightenment I expected, given the reviews. I felt the author showed more compassion for the soldiers who raped and murdered than the rape victims, and the ways in which he discussed the two left me feeling the women weren't as well humanized. Speaking about this with another trauma survivor, she shared that the author was removed from his own trauma center for creating a hostile work environment for female employees. There are articles to confirm it. I rarely—if ever—don't finish a book, but I'm shelving this one. "
21,0670785938,http://goodreads.com/user/show/31366582-tory-warner,5,"I don't usually write reviews, but this book is special. I have a PTSD diagnosis and also work at a rape crisis center, so this was an incredibly meaningful and impactful read both personally and professionally. I feel validated in my own experiences and symptoms, and I am more mindful of my words and actions in crisis intervention situations. Dr. van der Kolk's compassionate and accessible language makes it easy to get through the rather heavy material. Easily one of the top two books I read in 2016. "
22,0670785938,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3932962-barbara-the-bibliophage,4,"I’ve had The Body Keeps the Score by Bessel van der Kolk, M.D. on my shelves (both analog and audio) for quite a few months. I suppose I put it off because trauma is such a heavy subject. However, I unexpectedly found the tone to be comfortable and almost conversational. Perhaps that’s the talent of audiobook narrator Sean Pratt and van der Kolk’s evident compassion.The reason I picked up this book at this time was because I recently finished Hunger by Roxane Gay. As Gay told her story of gang rape at 12, along with subsequent disordered eating behavior, I wanted to understand more about how trauma affects people. Choosing The Body Keeps the Score was a perfect follow up.Van der Kolk began his journey by working with Vietnam War veterans, and he references veterans repeatedly throughout the book. But he also tells the story of many other patients, individually and as research groups. It’s hard to hear the traumatic experiences, but each time van der Kolk infuses the telling with hope and positive change.I appreciated the personal stories from the author as well. You can see why he’s been driven to help people with post-traumatic stress disorder and it’s related disorders. Van der Kolk’s advocacy for the PTSD diagnosis, as well as Complex PTSD and Developmental Trauma Disorder is groundbreaking and important.The Body Keeps the Score covers how trauma affects our brains, how it changes children, and how traumatic memories can be hidden as well as revealed later. The science was clear and relatable, while also detailed and fascinating. I can imagine myself rereading part or all of this book in the future to revisit concepts.For me, the most interesting part of the book was the final third. This section covers a variety of treatment methods including therapeutic theater, yoga, and eye movement desensitization and reprocessing (EMDR). I found myself wishing for more information, and also feeling curious about exploring some methods I’ve not tried.As I said, this is a book to read and reread. I’ll use it as reference in the future, since I sometimes work with trauma survivors in my massage therapy practice. I highly recommend it to professionals and lay people."

There was so much information, it took me longer than normal to give it a thorough reading even though it is very easy to read. I just wanted to digest it and reread as I went along.This is an outstanding book! It talks about how trauma effects both mind and body and recovery cannot be complete through talk therapy if the memories that are trapped in the body are not addressed.ANYONE who deals with children or people in their work should read this book. It can help in understanding why people may act the way they do and how actions and events may cause trauma to an individual.My copy must have a million sticky notes to remind me of points that either are already useful in my job or that may help me in my work in the future.I cannot recommend this book highly enough. I think anyone reading it would gain either insight about themselves or another from it."
24,0670785938,http://goodreads.com/user/show/595355-bruce-stern,5,"An incredible and necessary contribution and resource for the general public and psychological and trauma-treatment professionals to the understanding of and treatment for psychological, physical and sexual trauma. (It's not only experienced by soldiers, victims of mass public violence—terrorist attacks, mass killings and shootings—or those affected by natural calamities.)Children, especially infants and toddlers, but also older children, adolescents, teens, and adults of all ages experience trauma every day, everywhere across America and around the world. Trauma is often—way too often—misunderstood, misdiagnosed, mistreated or ignored. The immensely faulty DSM—its latest incarnation the DSM-5, published in 2013—fails to adequately address trauma and its several symptoms. Yet, the DSM-5 is the 'go to bible' of the psychiatric community and health care insurers and providers. That's a mistake with immense implications, mostly sorrowful ones for trauma victims and their loved ones. The psychiatric community also irresponsibly mistreats trauma victims with medications, which are ineffective or harmful. Dr. Bessel van der Kolk, the director of the Trauma Center in Brookline, MA, writes engagingly, passionately, and clearly. This book is written for all of us and for professionals interested in trauma, including effective and various treatments for it. Until listening to Sean Pratt's superb narration of the audiobook, I disliked audiobooks. No longer. So, pick up a copy of the book, or listen to the audiobook, especially if you've suffered trauma or one or more traumatic and unresolved experiences in your life. Or, if you know someone who has experienced trauma, get the book for them. This book is hopeful, and far, far from a depressing read about a terrible scourge. "
25,0670785938,http://goodreads.com/user/show/56337479-h-a-leuschel,5,"This is an intelligent, well-written and comprehensive book about trauma. The author writes with insight and compassion and his insatiable thirst to give an up-to-date overview of all the current therapy or treatment options that can help free a person from the clutches of past trauma is apparent on every single page! 'The fundamental issue in resolving traumatic stress is to restore the proper balance between the rational and emotional brains' is at the heart of his quest because 'understanding why you feel a certain way, does not change how you feel'. The author also explains the important difference between ordinary memory and traumatic memory. The first is flexible and over time may change to fit the circumstances or a particular narrative, while the latter is 'frozen in time'. These traumatic memories are 'lonely, humiliating and alienating experiences' that unlike ordinary memories have not been integrated into a story. Van der Kolk suggests a panoply of treatments that may allow these events to be integrated into one's life without them causing the disruptions and pain that are the reason for the severe symptoms of PTSD for instance. I highly recommend this book to anyone who wishes not only to understand the intricacies of trauma but also learn about the many current solutions available to those seeking to live a better and healthier mental life thereafter."
26,0670785938,http://goodreads.com/user/show/31533793-sasha,5,"This book absolutely rocked my world! I started reading it shortly after beginning to process my own trauma and it has been super validating. It is very readable and accessible. I learned so much about trauma and how it impacts the brain and body. I think anyone can benefit from reading this book, whether or not you identify as a survivor of trauma. A lot of it is stuff I’ve been learning about in therapy for the last year and a half— honestly just basic emotional intelligence that most of us were never taught! There are a couple of things here and there that made me go “idk about that, Bessel.” And as with anything, especially a book written by a white man, it could have been more intersectional. However, overall I found him deeply empathetic and open-minded and with it. Cannot imagine doing the work he has been doing for decades! [Also, just googled van der Kolk and it looks like he was fired from the Trauma Center by the organization that oversaw it for mistreatment of employees which is deeply upsetting! I just went down an article rabbit hole and am very confused. I think the book is still very worth reading while also holding the hard truth that a pioneer in studying trauma may also have caused real harm. Still wrestling with this as I just learned of it!]"
27,0670785938,http://goodreads.com/user/show/11072418-liz,5,"Probably at some future point I will write an actual review about this comprehensive, marvelous look at trauma on all-aged, all-situation'd people, and if I had to snip my favorite quotes out I'd eventually just plagiarize the entire book, but: WOW. Dr. van der Kolk, in digestible terms, gives the reader a vocabulary to understand the psychic/physical roots of trauma on the brain and body. It justifies the various pain I experience on a normal basis; this book is a gift and a treasure. It reassures you that you're not alone, and that your experiences are a normal response to awful situations. God bless you, van der Kolk."
28,0670785938,http://goodreads.com/user/show/48920493-fenris,1,Some parts of this book were very triggering. I do not recommend it as a first choice for someone who has Complex PTSD. 
29,0670785938,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1032933-jenifer-jacobs,5,10 stars. Phenomenal book. This man is a brilliant researcher and a beautiful writer. His work will better so many lives. I learned many valuable tools for trauma treatment - and have a list of more training to pursue!!
30,0670785938,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2908629-ellie,5,"As the subtitle indicates, this book examines the relationships of the brain, the mind, and the body in both the effect of and healing from trauma. The author begins by relating his experiences with PTSD from war veterans and then expands his study to include the effects of various kinds of trauma, particularly for children on the biological functioning of the body and brain. He describes what trauma looks like--traumatic memory is often reenacted by the person and not integrated into the rest of their experiences or lives. Trauma changes brain function and the very adaptations that enable someone to survive a trauma can then circumscribe the rest of their lives, curtailing their ability to enjoy life, achieve goals, have satisfying relationships or fully experience the world.I was fascinated by the author's description of the biological as well as social and emotional effects of trauma. Many of the stories told are horrific. Only the latter part of the book, describing a variety of treatments/interventions shown to be effective in healing trauma made it bearable.A terrifying number of people, particularly children, experience significant trauma in their lives. Social factors increase the risks that a child will be seriously traumatized during their early years. The author advocates not only for interventions that heal but for actions that will prevent (or reduce the likelihood of) trauma and save the country enormous sums of money spent in coping with the effects of trauma--institutionalizations (hospitalizations as well as incarcerations), low income or dependence on social welfare, educational failure--by investing in such supports as quality day care, restoration of music and art programs (which enable students failing elsewhere or unable to invest themselves in schoolwork alternative areas in which to express themselves, bond with others, and experience success and pleasure), and incorporation of drama programs that with minimal funding can produce impressive results.The book is relatively easy to read, considering all the science included. I was moved (sometimes overwhelmed) by the stories and inspired by the many forms of treatment that have been created to address the issue.All the U.S. needs is the will to help. The question is, Do we have that will?"

One of the best on the topic of Developmental Trauma, and the impact of early stress on development, growth, relating, and health. van der Kolk does an outstanding job explaining in a very accessible way some super-complicated concepts and some super-tender concepts, too. Posttraumatic activation, the ongoing realities of traumatic aftermath, the lifelong (if untreated) suffering that stress loops can create. He also brings hope through the discussion and examples of how the body--though it keeps the score--can also move through the trauma toward healing. Fabulous!"

Not only was it validating for me, as a survivor, I found the neuroscience behind the behavior of survivors enlightening and helpful. I originally picked it up for help with my work with people who have chronic pain, but it did wonders for understanding coworkers and myself."
33,0670785938,http://goodreads.com/user/show/71792610-renee-godding,4,"3.5/5 stars Reading this book was quite the journey for me. It took me two months to finish it, mostly because I took large breaks between reading chapters. The reason I picked it up was twofold: part “personal interest”, part “professional interest” as a medical student who took an interest in trauma-psychiatry during my rotation. For that reason, I struggled if I had to approach this as a scientific textbook, or as a medical non-fiction for people who have experienced a traumatic event and are looking for information and possibly some help. My opinion is a little different, depending on the perspective I take. Bold disclaimer here, because this is important:  this is in no way meant to be a “professional” review as I’m not qualified to do so. These are simply my thoughts, written down more for my own benefit than as a quality-statement on this book, because I’m neither qualified nor capable of doing so. With that out of the way: my thoughts… As a medical non-fiction, I really liked this book. Van der Kolk writes with a beautiful amount of respect and understanding for the experience of trauma. His observations are insightful and compassionate without judgement, and (as far as you can judge this based on text alone) I think he’s a phenomenal therapist. As someone who has gone through traumatic experiences (both in childhood and adulthood), I recognized a lot in this book. I also learned a lot about myself and gained some insight that I think will help me on the long run, even some that I hadn’t yet gotten through other ways of self-reflection, coaching or even therapy. I tabbed and took notes on every chapter and I truly think that I’ve taken away some valuable lessons from this book. In many ways, it does what it says on the tin: it helps sufferers from PTSD and trauma to start their journey to explaining the unexplainable for themselves. For that alone, it deserves 5 stars. That being said: it is quite a heavy read and requires a bit of background knowledge on neurobiology to understand fully. I think that excludes a large portion of potential target audience that would benefit from reading this.As a scientific textbook, I’m less convinced, as I think it lacks some depth for that. I’d have loved a bit more critical evaluation of certain topics, such as the re-found memories. For such a highly debated topic, I think the portrayal was too one-dimensional and lacked some critical counterarguments. Found memories, neurofeedback and some of the other mentioned techniques are still debated in the medical community, as they are so difficult to prove one way or the other. In many ways, I feel van der Kolk presented his own experiences a little  too much  as proven facts. I personally haven’t decided my stance on many of these subjects, but this book didn’t provide the arguments to steer me either way. Overall, I’m very happy I read this book, and it was well worth the time and effort I had to put into it. I gained something from reading it (which doesn’t happen often with “self-help books” for me), which I’m thankful for. Because it floats in that neverland between scientific and aimed at the everyday-man, I can’t give it a full 5-stars though. It’s a bit too detailed and “academic” for latter, whilst lacking the depth for the former. I’d have preferred if it had taken either route, and gone all the way."
34,0670785938,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1072080-jerrie-redwritinghood,4,"This was a really interesting book on the topic of trauma and the effects it has on the mind and body. It’s also interesting that I read this on the heels of Bee Keeper of Aleppo, where the characters experience a number of traumas as refugees. The focus is mainly on PTSD in former military and in rape victims, and the consequences of child abuse on the developing mind. Very accessible and surprisingly compelling read. "
35,0670785938,http://goodreads.com/user/show/89733512-radia,5,"This book provides a nuanced, deeply researched and comprehensive view of trauma and how it manefests in the body. As a doctor and researcher, the author is well equpipt with anecdotes, history, and facts that showcase how trauma reorganizes the way the mind manages perceptions, not only changing ""how and what we think, but our capacity to think"" -- and our capacity to connect with others, ourselves, and our bodies. Reading this book was not easy. The author discusses both adult and childhood trauma in detail, perticularly childhood sexual assult. Reading this book also felt necessary. In a time of social change, where many are rethinking and reimagining broken institutions (i.e. the police, healthcare, the government etc.) we must be informed in the effects of trauma and how CRITICAL it is to have people who are informed in trauma in every line of socially driven work. There's so much I could say about this book but I will end with this : ""Our capacity to destroy one another is matched by our capacity to heal one another"" (38) Imagine what our world would look like if more people were informed in the manefestafions of trauma, and the shown ways of healing from it. This book lists those ways, concretely, in many forms - things I had never heard of before during my time in therapy or self-study. Imagine what our communities would look like if we took deeper care of children. If we put energy into community programs that encouraged not only awareness of the body (art, music, theater, dance) but also personal atonomy, instead of defunding these programs. Imagine if we treated adults in ways that were lasting, instead of placing Band-Aids on top of deep trauma. I highly recommend this book.PS: this book isn't perfect -- Kolk definitely could have done more in discussing the intersectional experiences of trauma as it relates to identity (actually, as far as I remember, he didn't discuss this at all). He also talks about certain forms of recovery and treatment that stem from non-western tradition without giving thorough credit or context. His work is a stepping stone in trauma studies, and I am looking forward to learning and reading more, particularly in places where his book lacked."
36,0670785938,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5734751-li-sian,5,"Incredible. Anyone even remotely interested in trauma / how the brain works / the consequences of poverty, violence, and war should read this. van der Kolk is a compassionate writer and practitioner, and he's honest about the limitations of psychiatry and neuroscience even as he takes us through the exciting advancements of the past couple decades. "
37,0670785938,http://goodreads.com/user/show/28103300-linda,5,"This book is an exceptional read, insightful and informative to novice as well as the professional. So many struggle with traumatic life events without the understanding and support of the people closet to them. This non support is not that their family, friends and community do not want to understand or help, but lack the education to do so. This book, in my opinion, would be a wonderful book to provide to a person struggling with PTSD(as they also struggle to understand and cope as well), their family, friends, community,and those who work with them clinically. I am glad to add to my professional library as a Licensed Clinical Social Worker and telling other professionals about it."
38,0670785938,http://goodreads.com/user/show/63944124-francesca-calarco,4,"If you or someone you know lives with trauma, if you want to understand the effects of trauma, or even have questions/confusion related to the complex nature of PTSD, then I HIGHLY recommend Dr. Bessel van der Kolk’s The Body Keeps the Score: Brain, Mind, and Body in the Healing of Trauma. Dr. van der Kolk’s work covers a wide range of trauma that can occur for people including the effects of childhood trauma, sexual assault, incest, veteran's war-time trauma, and so many other realities that can be shameful for survivors to discuss or even think about. Never comparing pain, he details how each of these forms of trauma, and resultant PTSD, for a multitude of patients he’s treated throughout the years impact different elements of their livelihoods—he makes good on explaining the book’s titular premise of how, “the body keeps the score.” Most notably, are the emotional and even physical effects that trauma can have on different individuals, and how these realities can differ from societal expectations. Trauma and PTSD are often depicted in the media as past tragedies that just need to be remembered and vocalized and BAM—you’re cured! That may work in a televised drama, but in reality, the past is ever present in the present. Vocalizing past victimization does not inherently result in catharsis—for many it can actually result in further isolation. “Talking about painful events does not necessarily establish community—often quite the contrary. Families or organizations may reject members who air their dirty laundry; friends and family can lose patience with people who get stuck in their grief or hurt. This is one reason why trauma victims often withdraw and their stories become rote narratives, edited into a form least likely to provoke rejection.” (246)I think this insight is why it’s so important not to push people to deal with their issues before they are ready, as well as in a setting where their stories can be safely received. There is nothing neat about trauma, and there is certainly no quick, magical fix. Even the ways in which people cope can further reinforce trauma. Dr. van der Kolk is especially good at detailing how this works in cases of childhood trauma:“Coping takes its toll. For many children it is safer to hate themselves than to risk their relationship with their caregivers by expressing anger or by running away. As a result, abused children are likely to grow up believing that they are fundamentally unlovable; that was the only way their young minds could explain why they were treated so badly. They survive by denying, ignoring, and splitting off large chunks of reality: They forget the abuse; they suppress their rage or despair; they numb their physical sensations. If you were abused as a child, you are likely to have a childlike heart living inside you that is frozen in time, still holding fast to this kind of self-loathing and denial.” (281) It’s rare for me to cry when reading works of non-fiction, but the very real stories and testimonies of Dr. van der Kolk’s patients are genuinely heartbreaking. Especially given how people carry this trauma in their bodies throughout their lives, never truly feeling safe. “Safety and terror are incompatible.” That said, this work is also incredibly hopeful. Dr. van der Kolk discusses different methods of treatment, and avenues to healing. Hope is ever present. Overall, this book is really great and definitely has my recommendation. "
39,0670785938,http://goodreads.com/user/show/20344407-ariana,5,"My first finished book of 2019 and it was incredible. I highly recommend reading the incredibly thorough review from my friend Thomas for a holistic picture of this book. Here, I'd like to briefly highlight my own main takeaways.As a psychology student trainee who will give therapy in the future, psychiatrist Dr. van Der Kolk's perspective and experience as a psychiatrist was intellectually nourishing. The complexity of ""treating"" trauma warrants interdisciplinary approaches and this book is worth reading just to see how this holistic treatment can be implemented with trauma. Though it now feels like common sense, it is still worth screaming from the mountaintops that body and mind are inextricably linked and solutions focused on restoring them both within the individual are necessities. Along this vein, I have long viewed the expressive arts (theater in particular) as an effective mechanism to address the lasting effects of trauma directly and indirectly. In this book there's a whole CHAPTER was dedicated to this practice, so I was over the moon reading it. I also echo his sentiments that it's possible and productive to engage with artistic expression and rigorous scientific methods in tandem. Other notable highlights are the way Dr. van Der Kolk describes developmental trauma, its impact, and the necessity of social connections at length. While every page or treatment discussed (e.g., EMDR) did not align with my own developing orientation to treatment, there is much merit in reading the entirety of this book.Highly this read for anyone interested in further understanding how trauma manifests, how its effects can be addressed, and most importantly, that individuals who have experienced significant harm have the agency to survive and thrive."
40,0670785938,http://goodreads.com/user/show/25966254-pernille,5,"Wow. I believe this is the best non-fiction book I have read in a while, maybe ever? If I could somehow inject the information in this book into every single brain in the world, I would. What a different society we could have!I had so many thoughts and lightbulb moments as I read this, and I have been able to use the messages from this book in my practice with patients countless times already in the month and a half it has taken me to read it. I think it's made me a much better practitioner, being able to look at defense mechanisms and interpersonal behaviour patterns for what they are: responses to trauma that were once the person's only way to survive and cope. I think it has made me more compassionate. That being said, the effects of trauma are so widespread that all of us should make efforts to be trauma-informed. Please could everyone read this?A quote that I will do well to remember in my work, in order to facilitate real and meaningful change for people:""What are these patients trying to cope with? What are their internal and external resources? How do they calm themselves down? Do they have caring relationships with their bodies, and what do they do to cultivate a physical sense of power, vitality and relaxation? Do they have dynamic interactions with other people? Who really knows them, loves them, and cares about them? Whom can they count on when they're scared, when their babies are ill, or when they are sick themselves? Are they members of a community, and do they play vital roles in the lives of the people around them? What specific skills do they need to focus, pay attention, and make choices? Do they have a sense of purpose? What are they good at? How can we help them feel in charge of their lives?"""
41,0670785938,http://goodreads.com/user/show/36632347-lisa,5,"I loved this book on so many levels. It's one of those books that will stay with me for the rest of my life. It's one of those books that I will want to read again. . . For one thing, there is so much valuable information that I will want to reference! I'm not going to want to lend this one out because I won't want to part with it. I've come to accept that when I lend out a book, I may never see it again. However, it's such a good book that I know in my heart that I will want to lend it out! So I'm just going to start looking for used copies to ""give"" to my clients, my friends, my neighbors, acquaintances, or anyone who has been affected by trauma, or anyone that cares for someone that has been affected by trauma, or anyone who lives in a society with those who are affected by trauma. In other words, EVERYONE!!!"
42,0670785938,http://goodreads.com/user/show/38455364-samu,5,"This took me two (incredibly long) months to read but I made it. Probably the single most important book I have ever read. Mind blowing in so many ways, so many things make so much more sense now. This book changed my perspective on so many things in life including my own mental health but also how I deal with work and especially the kids I see there every day. This book is easy enough to read even if you don't have a degree in psychology but still scientific and based on actual research which van der Kolk refers to continuously through every topic he introduces in his book as well as his long career working with trauma patients. Very easy to follow from one topic to the logical follow up and very well written. For anyone suffering from trauma or living with someone who is or working with people that are. (So is that all of us?) "
43,0670785938,http://goodreads.com/user/show/8152701-charles-finch,5,"What a special, thoughtful, educational, eye-opening, and open-minded book. I'm so glad I read it."

45,0670785938,http://goodreads.com/user/show/87820245-anna-xu,5,"V dense n lengthy but insightful read!I think this book does a lot to destigmatise trauma, at least that’s what it did for meTrauma manifests in so many different ways and it’s really interesting how compartmentalised ur self-identity can be when u r traumatised. Trying not to overstate the obvious but it was also amazing to see how individuals can recover from even the most debilitating conditions and events and become so self-actualised and/or at peace w their pasts. I say pasts specifically bc i feel like one of the most significant revelations i had frm this book was the idea that u need to let go of the past in order to fully experience life in the moment n recover ur self-agency n therefore reconnect w ur emotional vulnerability. I didn’t mean to read this like a self-help book but i think surely anyone who reads this can understand themselves a bit better by way of defence mechanisms/social demeanours/etcOn another note i think it’s pure evil the way the pharmaceutical industry has capitalised off trauma/mental health in general. Clearly there r more holistic psychiatric treatments: yoga, neurofeedback, theatre, emdr, pbsp, just to name a few. N clearly we need more studies in all these fields. ofc these r not the only ones, imo it’s still an emerging field tho van der kolk does a great job at introducing the studies n work that have already been done by prominent specialists, but i think they could come to represent an entirely new perspective on mental health treatment in general. I have a lot of hope in this regard, esp in seeing the surge in public mental health awareness in the past few years. The conversation abt mental health has gone thru momentous change and i’m sure it will only go upward from here :+)Another (final) note, i find it fascinating n very pertinent to our times that we are realising more n more that western ways of doing r simply not enough. There is so much potential for the growth of world knowledge abt specialisations such as mental health n its inextricable link to community that simply does not cooperate w western ideals of individualism nd scientific/materialist enquiry"
46,0670785938,http://goodreads.com/user/show/56839992-esther-espeland,5,"Wow this book fucked!! Was hard for me to read, and had to take it slow, but I feel so validated in my lived experience! Writing was super digestible, and all the medical sciency stuff was explained in an easy to follow way. Hearty recommendation to anyone with trauma, or for those who’s loved ones have trauma (so everyone!). I’m just like damb my entire life age 18-22 was just explained! "
47,0670785938,http://goodreads.com/user/show/11717318-brian,5,"Maybe if I had read this book a few years ago, it would have made a larger difference.The basic premise of The Body Keeps the Score is that trauma disconnects people from their bodies and healing from trauma requires reforging that connection. Disconnection can come in a variety of ways, from trying to push ""troublesome"" emotions away to having their sense of danger constantly on regardless of the environment around them to (over)reacting to any stimulus because it's treated as a threat. These changes all serve to further separate the sufferers from the people around them, which disconnects them further and prevents healing. Healing the trauma requires re-grounding people in their own bodies so they can feel their feelings, regardless of how frightening that is.There's a kind of cosmic unfairness evident in this central thesis. Someone experiences trauma and develops a series of coping strategies that help protect them from completely breaking under the strain, but in every other situation in life those strategies are maladaptive at best and actively harmful at worst. Traumatized people will lash out, react with anger to innocuous statements or actions, behave impulsively and sometimes cruelly, harm themselves, or otherwise engage in activities that distance themselves from others or from society as a whole. Because those behaviors are based in successful coping strategies they're extremely hard to change, and because they push the traumatized away from other people, it's hard for them to seek or receive help. Especially when their behavior hurts other people.All of this means that society is much more interested in making the signs of trauma go away than it is in actually fixing it. Fixing it is expensive and unpleasant. It requires making traumatized people feel safe and accepted, which requires a lot of patience and effort on the part of caregivers. It's time-consuming, and expensive, and can be heart-breaking and exhausting. So modern society usually doesn't bother, electing to treat the symptoms instead so the problem just goes away:The real reason [that soldiers fall silent] is that soldiers have discovered that no one is very interested in the bad news they have to report. What listener wants to be torn and shaken when he doesn't have to be? We have made unspeakable mean indescribable: it really means nasty.I lived for a long time with someone who had suffered childhood trauma, and I thought about that a lot while I read this book. They were sometimes exhausting, and their behavior was inexplicable to my mind, they passively went along with courses of action that obviously distressed them greatly, and they chose self-evidently harmful actions over ones that would have helped. But I didn't know how to react to all of that, and sometimes I made it worse through my own behavior. I also thought about the children separated from their families and put in concentration camps by the Trump administration, and the way a double-digit percentage of Americans not only don't care, they think this is the best possible policy. The latter half of the book is mostly about different treatment methodologies like EMDR or Internal Family Systems Therapy, most of which went over my head because I'm have no background in psychology and so no qualification to judge whether any of them are effective or not. Some other reviews take issue with van der Kolk's promotion of particular therapies, and they may well be right. I simply don't know.But I feel like everyone should read at least the first half. I recognized a lot of the behavior there in people I've known, and it really helped me understand why they behaved the way they did and why they continued behaving that way even when it was clearly hurting themselves and the people around them. Trauma replicates itself--traumatized people lash out in order to protect themselves, causing trauma to others, and if that trauma is serious enough the cycle repeats. Effectively recognizing that and finding a way to step in and stop the trauma is vital, especially since society at large has absolutely no interest in doing so and often makes things worse in an effort to avoid dealing with it. If there's one layman criticism I have, it's that van der Kolk seems too quick to accept the validity of memory, especially repressed memory. I know memory is flawed from my own experience, and I've dealt with people who accused me of things I never did or acted based on incidents that never happened. But at the same time, traumatic memory works different than normal memory and most people expect them to be the same, even beyond the way the average person assume memory is just a biological camera. I'm not sure what the healthy medium is between ""traumatized people sometimes repress painful memories"" and ""sometimes people remember things wrong and act sincerely based on false premises,"" but there has to be one. But those are minimal complaints, and the rest of the book is so good they didn't harm my enjoyment of it at all."
48,0670785938,http://goodreads.com/user/show/93631990-mila,3,"I thought this book was interesting (though sometimes repetitive) and was fascinated to learn about bodily manifestations of trauma. Though some things I am less convinced of (some of the methods seemed questionable/pseudoscientific/new agey), other methods seemed to be paths worth exploring. Hopefully trauma research will head in a positive direction.However, I have to give my political theorist's critique which is that sometimes, van der Kolk rightly notes the political connotations what he is talking about has (e.g. the school to prison pipeline). Other times, however, he doesn't. In discussing US soldiers in Vietnam and Iraq, the acknowledgment of a very political element here is left out. That is, it takes place within an imperialist american imaginary where Americans are always victims of a foreign enemy or territory, even when they are the ones perpetuating terror. Not that a medical book is *required* to do otherwise, but it's always disappointing to me when discussions of war-induced trauma centre the aggressors. Reminds me of that comedian who said ""Not only will America come to your country and kill all your people: but they will come back and make a movie about how killing your people made them feel sad."" Because lots of the praise for this book involves van der Kolk's ""sympathy"" and ""compassion"", I just felt like I had to nitpick that part. Medicine and cultural commentary surrounding it is never divorced from the political!"
49,0670785938,http://goodreads.com/user/show/28629042-daniel-teehan,4,"I actually had so many thoughts about this book that I completely cowered from writing a review, so h/t both to the friend who gave me this book and the one who called me out for not reviewing it! It's hard to describe everything going on in this book, because the argument is both far ranging and, er, totalizing. In the sense that van der Kolk powerfully posits the explanatory power of trauma in a wide range of mental illness and behavioral issues going far beyond how PTSD is thought of in the popular imagination. Of particular concern to him is developmental trauma - the way that not only abuse but also neglect and even improper attunement between mother and child have powerful downstream effects on cognitive and emotional maturation. At times, this book feels like a very introductory Psych 101 - giving basic accounts of fight/flight responses, summarizing foundational studies in neuroscience, and reviewing the literature on mind/body connections. Oddly, some of these moments increased my skepticism of the overall argument, because I thought his account of, say, the role of mirror neurons was incredibly reductive (they don't simply 'explain' empathy). Because I don't have an expert basis to evaluate other basic claims he makes throughout the book, it makes me very wary of fully buying into all of his conclusions, especially where he strays outside of experimental literature and makes more assertion-type claims about the wide-ranging functions of trauma. That being said, I actually do find one of his main arguments - a sort of polemic against the current state of mental health care and theories of treatment - quite persuasive. I think he makes a very strong argument about the outsize role that discrete DSM diagnoses have come to play, and substantiates his critique of medication-only approaches to trauma very well. It makes fundamental sense to me that more attention needs to be paid to the roots and causes of trauma in order to formulate effective treatments. I think the idea of de-emphasizing the chemical nature of mental illness by pointing to other aspects of neurophysiology - like electrical impulses - is also really interesting. However, this brings me to one of my main critiques of the book (and also the tendency in mental health that it is typical of), which is that it's pretty shocking to me that he can spend so much time talking about the way that family units and early formative social experiences shape our psychology without paying ANY attention to the ways that other social forces like institutional racism and poverty likewise have an effect on people's emotional lives. It seems to be a glaring omission to talk about trauma without talking about inter-generational trauma, or the effects that oppressive social conditions have on psychology. It's like he was able to make the leap from psychology's singular focus on the individual to a wider context, but that context only extended to the level of the nuclear family. Sure, it's not the atomizing individualism of capitalism, but he's also missing the next step of looking at broader social forces. The last thing I'll say is that I found his review of the experimental literature on trauma and it's causes to be much stronger than the latter third of the book or so where he surveys techniques. His discussion of EMDR, biofeedback, and theater were all conceptually interesting, but their one chapter a piece treatment seems much more cursory than the rigor brought to other parts of the book in a way that undercuts many of the (often very strong) claims he makes about their efficacy. Anyway, it may not come across but I was very impressed and immersed in this book, and it generated a lot of questions for me about my own relationship to mental health, my work, and my future. I would recommend, if only to have more folks (and more knowledgeable folks!) to talk about it with. "
50,0670785938,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5682211-jules,4,"A few months ago, I had a weird day. A friend had been asking me to join them for drinks for some time now, and we finally found ourselves at the same table. They wanted to tell me about a traumatic experience they had recently. As we slowly uncovered more and more of their experience, I realised that this wasn’t a “like, super traumatic thing that happened”, but an actual psychological trauma. I felt out of my depth, but realised my only role in this story was a listener, as a witness. So I listened. Even that was hard. My friend could only see their trauma, but as a witness, I was in a different position. I could see the horror of the trauma, but also the horrible consequences it had created in them.Afterwards, my friend was relieved they had gotten to tell their story. We hugged and I left to go to a small house party where I met a trauma psychologist. I asked him: “How do you help these people without getting traumatised yourself?”. He smiled somewhat wryly and said “I just get traumatised too. I don’t mind”. Later on, I learned that he was known for taking the trauma cases the other psychologists don’t want to take on. He was kind enough to lend me a book: The Body Keeps The Score.The next few days, I was haunted by the things my traumatised friend had told me. I kept seeing the scene they had described in front of me. Because I favour the intellectual solution to my problems, I started reading. TBKTS is a book for the public, and it gives a great overview of trauma psychology. I really enjoyed the historical overview and evolution and found the mechanics behind childhood trauma equal parts interesting and disturbing. It’s infuriating that children who get a bad start are basically fucked for the rest of their lives in so many psychological and physical ways.What I took away from the book is that- Bessel has a big agenda. He hates the DSM, and is a big activist to get recognition for Developmental Trauma disorder. He makes a convincing case- Trauma is devastating and trauma to a child is the most devastating of all- People will get looked at for their disorders, and their traumatic history will be obscured from view. I am also guilty of this on an informal level, thinking of my friends as “being” bipolar or anxious, and not keeping in mind the family and experiences they came from.- There’s many factors involved in figuring out if a horrible experience will lead to a trauma. Sometimes something bad happens to a child and they grow up fine. - Most of the book discusses very, very severe trauma and truly horrible things that have happened to people. Still, I also took away that small things (a dog bite, being in the city where a terrorist attack happened, a single case of domestic abuse, a robbery, ..) can also cause trauma, and that the mechanisms are very similar. - As a normal muggle, there are only two things you can do for a person with trauma-- listen to their story when they are ready to tell it-- be a normal, secure, loving person that acts in normal, secure, loving ways, provide loving and secure experiencesThe book goes onto explore a bunch of new trauma therapies that work by means of the mind-body connection, each in their own way. To me (a total noob), it sounds like a weird hotch-potch of therapies, like if Lifehacker wrote a trauma book: waving your finger in someone's face while they talk about trauma, doing yoga, acting in a play, biofeedback, and (my favourite) psychomotor therapy. But if they help people, it's all good. Would highly recommend for anyone with a casual interest in trauma and trauma therapy."
51,0670785938,http://goodreads.com/user/show/25582110-kate-savage,3,"This is a long and winding book through brains and bodies and their blocks.The author retains a non-dogmatic enthusiasm for alternative forms of trauma treatment. I loved his analysis of the limitations on talk therapy, and his exploration of the way trauma is held in the body -- and needs to be healed in the body, not just the intellect.Perhaps because of its beautiful title, I had expected this to be more lyrically written. Instead it's quite dry and straight-forward. Still: valuable information. But there are also occasional waverings from his scientific groundings that felt a little strange to me. He's so exuberant about every technique he discusses -- massage and yoga and EMDR and neurofeedback and theater, etc. etc. -- that I started to wonder if I was getting the full story. For some of the techniques, he can only give anecdotal support. He rarely mentions studies that show an inconclusive or negative result of experimental therapies. Once or twice he did that thing where people insist 'Well there's no research showing that this works, but that's because the only money for mental health research is in drugs.' As I moved through more and more of these, I started to feel like I couldn't trust the author to be completely straight-forward about possible limitations of alternative therapies. His priority is clearly to get people trying something new to heal trauma. It started to feel like he was pushing a manic hope that something will cure you, whether it's neurofeedback video games or Shakespeare.But trauma is real and important and powerful, and this book is a good place to start learning more about it."
52,0670785938,http://goodreads.com/user/show/15830919-izzy,2,"Not great. I picked up this book because it was recommended on Google under books on ""inner child treatment"" and ""EMDR"". It was a let down. I don't know why the author included so many anecdotes of his former patients. Did he think we were supposed to relate to these ""worst of the worst"" cases? They made me feel like a voyeur; like I was reading something I shouldn't be - I found them upsetting and ultimately unhelpful. It sounds like Dr. Kolk and his associates didn't know what to do either - the entire book reads like ""oh we just tinkered with this and saw if it worked"". If anything, how badly Dr. Kolk and his associates kept screwing up just led me to mistrust his word as a doctor even more. He described one instance where his doctors were treating a woman with severe depression, and at one point, she just stopped eating. Five orderlies would pin the woman down and force-feed her through a tube, Gitmo style, until Dr. Kook -- I mean Kolk, sorry-- realized that maybe that wasn't the best course of action for a woman suffering PTSD from .... *heavy sigh* gang r/pe. Ugh. I wanted to throw the book and scream, "" YEAH, YOU THINK?"" As a survivor myself, I can only imagine how long that poor woman suffered. Horrific. I couldn't read much past that episode. Even the ""healing"" chapters were spry and laden with anecdotes instead of actual, meaningful self-help trajectories. ""Yoga worked for a few people"" ""Drugs didn't work for these people"". Yeah yeah yeah. This is more ""wacky"" medical history book than self-help. Whereas Melodie Beattie's books on boundaries and trauma transformed my life, this book left me cold."
53,0670785938,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6970638-sheri,5,"I read some of van der Kolk's research for class and thought the book might be a nice overview of his thoughts. I really enjoyed it on a few different levels.van der Kolk has been working in this field for a long time and provides lots of clinical examples to fill out all of the research. The book is immensely read-able and also educational.Some of this stuff (attachment, trauma-disrupted development in general) I was familiar with already, but other stuff (specific brain areas, vagal nerve, neuroscientific developments) was really new to me. van der Kolk does a great job of explaining the details; I felt like I learned a lot and was never bogged down with the biological/scientific specifics.He also provides several suggestions in his epilogue. While these types of pleas for systemic change always feel a bit impossible to achieve, van der Kolk manages to give some specific ideas (most notably for educating and working with teachers) for how to enact some of these things. He also provides lots of evidence in the final section for new and exciting treatments (EMDR and neurofeedback most notably) that may not help people to really change their thought patterns. As a former sociologist and student social worker, I am always interested and excited to see cross-departmental suggestions. van der Kolk is a psychiatrist, but he embraces lots of different perspectives and frameworks in his work.Overall it is a great read: educational, informative, and compelling."
54,0670785938,http://goodreads.com/user/show/34269562-dawn-serra,5,"As a professional, this book blows the hinges off of how we view trauma and PTSD. Despite the common belief that talk therapy is the best way to treat PTSD, Bessel van der Kolk's work, backed by Harvard's Trauma Center, demonstrates a powerful new story in helping individuals with PTSD and trauma to heal the injury that is stored deep in the emotional brain, beyond the reach of words and speech.As a PTSD survivor, this book offered a deeply validating look at the science behind what I've always known to be true - that trauma is stored in the body, outside of my rational thoughts, and that healing needs to take place from many mediums, including touch, movement, and breath. Nearly every page had some bit of wisdom or some fact that backed the work I've been exploring on my own, and I now know without a shadow of a doubt that this is the work I am meant to be doing.I highly encourage professionals and individuals to read this book and consider the alternatives to the over-medicated, hide-the-symptoms approach that our medical community has come to rely on. The body keeps the score. A drug won't heal that."
55,0670785938,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2199404-andy,3,"This is like an introductory textbook, covering lots of sub-topics one chapter at a time except that it's meant to be a book for the general public. There's an unfortunate amount of ""inside baseball"" verbiage that should have been edited out. If one slogs through it, there are many good points. For example, for child abuse the most effective interventions are the preventive ones."

57,0670785938,http://goodreads.com/user/show/11820811-camelia-rose,5,"The first half of The Body Keeps the Score: Brain, Mind, and Body in the Healing of Trauma explains different types of traumas and their symptoms. Bessel van der Kolk does not only deal with patients with acute PTSD (i.e. combat veterans, survivors of violent crimes and natural disasters), but also those who experienced childhood abuse and adolescents from adverse upbringings. The second half talks about various treatments.This book is tough to read and tougher to writer a review. I had to close my eyes multiple times to detach myself from the stories described in the book. The author provides a lot of insights of how a trauma changes a patient's mental state and underneath brain circuitry. Trauma patients may also feel shame, guilt and the loss of self-worthy, suffer from mental conditions such as anxiety, depression, defiance and ADHD, obesity or compulsive self-harming. Different from normal memories, traumatic memories exist in fragments and reappear in flashbacks, i.e. isolated sensory inputs accompanied by strong negative emotions, not as a coherent story.Several things I've learned from the reading: 1. Talk therapy alone may not work for PTSD and childhood trauma patients. Revisiting a trauma may re-traumatize the patients if they are not ready. CBT (Cognitive Behavior Therapy), which works well for phobias (i.e. arachnophobia) with its aim to rationalize a patient's response and to de-sensitize the experience, may not work well for trauma patients because the patient's ""system"" may not be ""online"" enough to benefit from the therapy.2. Trauma sufferers may fall victims to gangs, extreme political parties and religious cults, which ""may provide solace, but rarely foster the mental flexibility needed to be full open to what life has to offer, and as such, can't librate their members from their traumas.""3. In a study of attachment patterns in over 2000 infants in normal middle class families, 62% were found to be secure, 15% avoidant, 9% anxious and 15% disorganized. The percentage of secure children is low in my opinion.4. ACE study5. Understanding why you feel a certain way does not change how you feel, but it can keep you from surrendering to intense reactions. Mindful meditation on body sensations helps. Specialized yoga helps. (The author is a fan of yoga.)6. EMDR, Internal Family Systems Therapy, Psychomotor Therapy, Neurofeedback Therapy, Theater Therapy.Only in the supplement chapter that the author mentioned LSD and MDMA study in treating trauma patients, and his view is conservative."
58,0670785938,http://goodreads.com/user/show/114319868-samyra-alexander,5,This book helped me better understand how trauma impacts the mind and body. I appreciate the author for providing research based therapies. I learned about IFS and have used it with success with my own clients.
59,0670785938,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3695758-suzanne,5,This was wonderful. Intriguing from start to finish. 
60,0670785938,http://goodreads.com/user/show/61510943-natalie,5,I think every single person can connect to something in this book. Wish this could be a universal read.
61,0670785938,http://goodreads.com/user/show/82212787-wagner-floriani,5,Phenomenal. Extremely insightful. I can no longer imagine practicing pastoral counseling without consulting the observations of this book.
62,0670785938,http://goodreads.com/user/show/13930279-eugene-pustoshkin,5,"This is a great book in many ways. Dr. Bessel van der Kolk offers an integrative biopsychosocial view of psychological trauma and its psychosomatic and neuroscientific correlates and manifestations. He explains the importance of the new developmental trauma disorder that he and his colleagues carefully studied and proved to exist. He highlights many social issues (such as abuse of psychiatry’s reliance on psychopharmacological substances which is based not on medical but on marketing logic). The book is a coherent narrative, a condensed synthetic exploration of Dr. van der Kolk’s own 30-years experience of working with trauma. His views are in one step before an Integral approach, while clearly understanding the interdependence of what in Ken Wilber’s Integral Psychology is called I-, We-, It-, and Its-quadrants (basically, individual consciousness & behavior, collective cultural fields and societal structures—the interior and exterior dimensions of individual and collective experiences). They will form an important basis for trauma work for any social worker, counselor, psychologist, or psychiatrist—or a layperson who increasingly becomes aware of trauma (one’s own and/or that of others). The limitation of his approach, which is totally understandable, is lack of showing extensive awareness of transpersonal aspects of trauma. As I said, he still has to make that step towards an all-quadrant Integral understanding (such as the one proposed by Wilber); recognition of structure-stages of adult development is yet to come. But these aspects are still highly non-conventional (post-postconventional) and require significant experiential grounding, while Dr. van der Kolk does his job perfectly in terms of being grounded in mainstream. It is only my hope that transpersonal and Integral approaches that significantly shed light on trauma and healing will be becoming more widespread and recognized in public in the forthcoming decades. Still, Dr. van der Kolk points the efficiency of mindfuilness meditation, yoga, various non-conventional systems such as EMDR and internal family systems work in addition to some more conventional methods (while showing significant limitations and lack of efficiency of many of those methods). The book is grounded in huge amount of sources, empirical studies, etc. and represents a really well-written work of art which provides enough of everything to transmit the profound wisdom of integrative trauma work."
63,0670785938,http://goodreads.com/user/show/51271722-wendy,3," This book is...okay. My problems with it: Way too long, van der Kolk is long-winded and draws attention to himself, his insights, his compassion, his associations with too much regularity. The book would be a third shorter without his ego included. Could be an academic text but not really. van der Kolk can't seem to make up his mind if he wants to provide us with the most up-to-date trauma research or a folksy case study journal. Made for tedious writing. He describes some rape and incest victims as ""gorgeous"". Gag me. Being a trauma victim does not excuse inflicting trauma on others. In the first PTSD case he describes (a Vietnam Vet whose unit was killed in a rice paddy), ""Tom"", he positions Tom as someone haunted by his friends' deaths. After the rice paddy incident, Tom goes out and kills a child, rapes a woman, you know war crimes, and what van der Kolk offers is, ""maybe the worst of Tom's symptoms was that he felt emotionally numb."" Well, no. That is not the worst of his symptoms. Well, maybe getting away with rape and murder is the worst of his symptoms. But van der Kolk continues to somehow excuse the traumatized by saying that they feel shame ""about the way they behaved during a traumatic episode, whether it is objectively warranted (as in the commission of atrocities) or not."" EXCUSE ME? The commission of atrocities is objectively warranted???? They feel shame? Enough shame to present yourself to an International War Crimes Tribunal? Guess not. Again, gag me.Having said all of that, it is, overall, a necessary and important subject highlighting how trauma alters us physiologically and that treatment has to include a re-mapping of the brain and body. That seems like a pretty straight-forward case to be made.Unfortunately, Bessel van der Kolk somehow seems to muddy the waters here. This book shows up as an over-wrought, an over-long, missed opportunity. "
64,0670785938,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7800917-marina-sonnenbarke,5,"«Discussions of PTSD still tend to focus on recently returned soldiers, victims of terrorist bombings, or survivors of terrible accidents. But trauma remains a much larger public health issue, arguably the greatest threat to our national well-being. Since 2001 far more Americans have died at the hands of their partners or other family members than in the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan. American women are twice as likely to suffer domestic violence as breast cancer.»I dare say this is much the same in Italy or Europe in general.It's certainly true that victims of terrorism, accidents and wars are trauma sufferers, but (child) abuse is often disregarded, or anyway considered much less in view of problems such as PTSD. Van der Kolk started working with Vietnam veterans and went on becoming one of the greatest American experts on trauma and PTSD, working not only with veterans but with the general population suffering from post-traumatic stress disorder, and with traumatized and abused children and adolescents.This book is incredibly good and written with a passion you can almost touch. I have to admit I had to skip a couple of pages, not more, because the experiences described were too much to handle and were making me feel sick. But I've read the whole book with extreme interest. I won't delve too much in my interest in the book, I'll just say it is a great one if you're looking for something on trauma, what it is, and how to treat it.I want to end with some words from the epilogue, which I feel are very true, and they are something I've always thought myself: «I can't begin to imagine how I would have coped with what many of my patients have endured, and I see their symptoms as part of their strength - the ways they learned to survive.»"
65,0670785938,http://goodreads.com/user/show/8311987-david,5,"Thank God it’s done. The most harrowing book I’ve ever read. I’ve read a few books on child abuse and trauma now, but this one takes the cake. It took two full months to read this book, because after each session, I was in the throes of a full blown panic attack. My Apple Watch, more than a few times, thought I had been exercising and closed all my ‘circles,’ thinking I had burned all my calories for the day, climbed several flights of stairs, and exercised vigorously, all while sitting and ‘calmly,’ reading a book in a coffee shop.Dr. Van Der Kolk, through this book, explained so much of my behaviour, and of how I was raised. It isn’t some genetic curse or imbalance of neurotransmitters that needs to be corrected by psychopharmacology (as was once believed when I first started in this rodeo nearly two decades ago.) It explains why so much of the seventeen years of therapy I have engaged in has been fruitless, and the concurrent 17 years of psychopharmacology has been hit-or-miss at best. It also explains the conspiracy of silence of why it was so intolerably hard to even admit the possibility that I MIGHT have been abused as a child until my third decade of life granted some insight. And most of all, the book demonstrated that there are scientifically supported methods to treat or at least mitigate the damage that has been done. That makes it worth the emotional and psychological toll it took to get through this book. "
66,0670785938,http://goodreads.com/user/show/992554-chad,5,"Though this book is clinical, psychological, and sociological, it’s also an implicitly theological book. And, if I were to use one phrase to describe it, that would be anti-Gnostic. If the ancient and modern Gnostics believe anything, it’s that the body doesn’t matter, doesn’t define us as humans, isn’t who we are but simply a burden we must bear. This book, by documenting the interconnectedness of mind and body, illustrating how trauma isn’t just a ‘’head thing’’ but an entire body experience, underscores how we as created beings are formed holistically by God—and should receive treatment that is holistic as well. Rather than feeding pills to people with PTSD, medicating the hell out of children, or otherwise focusing upon surface solutions to deep problems (which, over time, often only exacerbate those problems), this book advocates for a wide range of treatments involving not only the therapist and patient but many others. Pastors, teachers, counselors, parents: anyone whose vocation involves caring for others would profit from the insights of this book. "
67,0670785938,http://goodreads.com/user/show/18986352-debra-barrentine,5,"A great, in depth look at the current therapies available for trauma and PTSD patients. Kolk explores psychiatry's shortcomings (the prescription based/medical model) in treating PTSD in war veterans and survivors of childhood trauma and offers many valuable treatments for patients who do not respond well to medication. These treatments are also used in tandem with medications to provide better overall outcomes. There were many clinical vignettes woven through the presentation of research and Kolk explained the methods and application of each treatment well. In addition to clinicians and mental health workers, teachers might really benefit from reading this book. The two chapters of most value to teachers would be the ones on Yoga and Drama. The epilogue is also full of wonderful ideas for teachers that work with a highly traumatized population. "
68,0670785938,http://goodreads.com/user/show/50297885-joy-d,4,"Non-fiction about the history and latest research on trauma, and how to help those suffering from it, especially Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) or childhood trauma. The author is obviously passionate about his field, and in this book, he advocates going beyond traditional talk therapy or prescribing drugs to treat trauma victims. He outlines a variety of alternative treatments and cites research backing them up. The book is, at times, rather technical in nature, and probably will be more easily digested by those with an existing working knowledge of the scientific terminology in this field. Recommended to individuals interested in brain-related science, mind-body connections, or to practitioners dealing with trauma victims. Unfortunately, due to the inclusion of van der Kolk’s patients’ stories, this book would likely be triggering to those it is intended to help. "
69,0670785938,http://goodreads.com/user/show/46466326-sippy,4,"In some parts an excellent and insightful read. In other parts Van der Kolk could have done with a bit more editing and written 2 books, one for professionals, therapists and so on and one for people who are looking for their own personal answers. Nevertheless a worthwhile book. Happy to have read it.En voor de Nederlandse lezers heb ik een kort stukje geschreven dat je hier kan vinden: https://zinvollerleven.nl/the-body-ke..."
70,0670785938,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2681175-holiday,1,"This book was terrible. He uses bits of actual science, neuroscience, to manipulate the reader into believing his pseudoscience. He's faced a lot of criticism throughout his career. He was one of the proponents of the now debunked ""recovered memories"" theory which destroyed lives. His studies have very small sample sizes and he tends to reject what most evidence-based approaches to treatment recommend. I suspect he's harmed more people than he's helped."
71,0670785938,http://goodreads.com/user/show/21824223-genevieve,5,"Required reading for all thinking, caring people--MOST especially those who serve the public or lead in some way: teachers, social workers etc., as well as those affected at any time in their life by trauma. "
72,0670785938,http://goodreads.com/user/show/13337055-jennifer,4,"Very good, easy to read book on the mind/body connection and the impact of trauma on the whole body. Highly recommended. "
73,0670785938,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5213351-oumaima-bendjama,5,"What a compassionate piece of writing. Absolutely one of my favorites.  “Beneath the surface of the protective parts of trauma survivors there exists an undamaged essence, a Self that is confident, curious, and calm, a Self that has been sheltered from destruction by the various protectors that have emerged in their efforts to ensure survival. Once those protectors trust that it is safe to separate, the Self will spontaneously emerge, and the parts can be enlisted in the healing process”  This isn't a self-help book. its whole premise is that adults and children that went through trauma need proper medical and societal intervention. Its target audience therefor is psychiatrists working with trauma victims, researchers, teachers, social workers, and politicians. But I assume, it does give so much solace for trauma victims to know what is going on inside their brains and bodies. *All parts, except for Part five, include very graphic accounts of trauma that might be triggering for trauma survivors. The author Bessel A. van der Kolk, is a psychiatrist a researcher, and an educator, who spent his life working on Trauma, and who doesn't shy away from politics. He makes it very obvious that any kind of advance in trauma treatment needs some shift in national policies. This makes his fight against Trauma holistic in all the meaning of the word; he researchers trauma, he treats people with trauma, he educates teachers and social workers on how to deal with people who are traumatized, and he is an activist for the change of educational and health policies. It helps to know that he came to the USA from the Netherlands. Bessel was there when PTSD was first given its name in the DSM 3, and he has seen how transformative that act has been. He has spent years dealing with veterans who came back from war with a set of psychological struggles that got at least 3 to 4 different diagnosis, and the drugs that came with them. Given PTSD its name has helped drive research that showed us how the mind and the body reacts and adapts to traumatic events. Something we can see in ST scans, EEG waves, and the body's chemistry. Bessel argues after that that a patient can't be treated separately from his environment and that human connection is essential to recovery. The second part talks about more complex trauma, the trauma that affects children. He showed how neglect, violence, and incidences of molestations can hinder a child's natural development. Traumatized children feel unsafe inside their bodies, don't know who to regulate and express their emotions, and have a hard time concentrating that's why they are vulnerable to mental illness, drug, and alcohol abuse, and all sorts of behavior problems. So Bessel found it only logical that they get to be treated differently by medical professionals, and instead of receiving 3 different diagnoses such as depression, anxiety disorder, ADHD, and so on. He and his colleagues suggested ""Developmental trauma disorder"" to be integrated into the DSM. But all their attempts have failed, although all the scientific evidence supporting their case is there, for what Bessel describes as profit interest reasons. This is of course scary and shows how far-reaching internal policies in one country can affect humans around the world. because the DSM for those who don't know it, is The Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, it used not only in the USA but around the world to diagnose and treat mental illness. It is used here, in Algeria. It uses a symptomatic based diagnosis approach.Bessel after that talks about faulty memory and traumatic memory. The last part has been the most interesting read, it talks about treatment options for trauma survivors. He doesn't talk about pharmaceutical treatment, not because he doesn't use them but because he believes that psychiatrists have over-indulged these treatment options on the account of other more effective options. He talks about EMDR, IFS, self-leadership, language, yoga, neurofeedback, and theater. Honestly, I have been very skeptical of the effect of EMDR and neurofeedback but they have studies supporting them so I enjoyed having my opinion changed.   ""Discovering yourself in language is always an epiphany, even if finding the words to describe your inner reality can be an agonizing process"" Of course, my interest in such a book is deeply personal. I read it for myself and for my family. But along the way, I have realized the societal weights of this issue, and how much proper intervention is needed, be it on the level of therapy or national policies."
74,0670785938,http://goodreads.com/user/show/10560051-cynthia,5,"I hadn’t expected this to be a five star read prior to cracking it open. I wasn’t even sure if I’d like it or if I would find it remotely beneficial. But wow…This is an extraordinary book. I am inclined to say that everyone should read it. Even if trauma has not been a poignant part of your life, the likelihood that you know someone who has experienced some type of trauma is pretty high. And even if that isn’t true, you live in a world where trauma continues to shred minds and wreak havoc on bodies. There is no harm in understanding that world a little better.The book focuses largely on trauma in terms of PTSD. It is very thorough in its details of how trauma affects an individual, both physically and mentally. I have never felt so deeply understood by a book before.With that being said, I want to note some important things before you choose to check this book out for yourself: There are some explicit case histories detailed throughout the book. Even if you haven’t endured similarly in your own life, they are emotionally provocative and challenging to consume. On that same token, this book could be especially difficult for people with PTSD. It’s not a bad thing, per se. Trauma must be brought to the surface in order to be dealt with. This book will likely bring those things to the surface, indeed. I found myself thinking about a lot of painful memories and wrestling some powerfully negative emotions as I listened to the audiobook. I think it’s important to be aware of this ahead of time. I wasn’t. I, by no means, want to persuade you not to read it. I only want to make sure you are prepared. I found this book to be incredibly difficult and I took my time with it, as emotional breaks were required. I greatly appreciate Van Der Kolk’s thoughtfulness and humility. He noted his own mistakes and recognized that certain things don’t work with patients. He acknowledged the need for change in those situations.I also appreciated his exhaustive examination of both symptoms and treatments. There are many healing avenues explored throughout the book and while not all are practical for every person’s life, I found some I wish to explore more, in hopes of reaping similar benefits as the patients he wrote about in the book. Van Der Kolk did not focus on medication as treatment, which was another component I was grateful for. He didn’t dismiss potential benefits and did speak about certain drugs at length but he tends to see them more as a bandage on a wound that needs to be exposed and cleaned in order to heal. I wholeheartedly agree with this. He also acknowledged a number of issues within our society that contribute to a lack of proper trauma treatment and healing, which includes, but is not limited to: poverty, lack of proper social support for families, and assembly line psychiatry. Again, these were all things I already believed and seeing them backed within the book caused me to be even more impressed with the material presented within the text. Those topics are especially rare to see addressed by doctors. I am incredibly thankful that I crossed paths with this wonderful book. I rarely say anything I’ve read could be life-changing, but I do think this book has paved a path for me that will, indeed, change my life. "
75,0670785938,http://goodreads.com/user/show/933226-kirsti,5,"This is the first book I've ever read that made me think, ""I wish my dad were still alive so he could read this and we could discuss it together."" Fascinating and compassionate accounts of how trauma affects mind and body and which techniques actually address trauma rather than merely blunting symptoms with medications. (The author says he is not anti-medication and prescribes meds frequently for his own patients. He's just frustrated because meds rarely cure anything.) The stories of his various patients were especially moving.My one complaint is that he dismisses false memory syndrome. He is absolutely correct that many people who accused priests of molestation were ignored or called liars for decades, and of course that neglect and retraumatization is disgusting. I do believe that incompetent therapists can implant false memories, though. I remember the Satanic panic of the 1980s. I remember people insisting that their parents tortured them with metal hooks while they were still in utero. The pain and fear that those people experienced was real, and they deserved attention and treatment. There just wasn't any corroborating evidence. This whole dismissal takes up about 2% of the book, so overall my experience with it was positive, and I would recommend it to others."
76,0670785938,http://goodreads.com/user/show/31656031-winnie-wang,5,"this book was incredible and so necessary for myself to read. my biggest takeaways: 1. you may not realize how many of your habits and traits have stemmed from trauma but our minds and bodies remember so much and take it all in.2. your trauma responses helped you once but they are no longer adaptive. we can learn new methods of coping while also thanking our bodies for trying to respond to those stressors in the past.3. if trauma lives in the body, movement is essential for recovery. (this book made me want to take an intro improv class.)there are sections that are dense and read like a psychology and neuroscience textbook and imo they're okay to skim but they provide context and additional detail if you're into that kind of thing. also a heads up that there are some graphic descriptions of patients as case studies and deal with child abuse, sexual assault and violence.*this year I'm only reading books by women for recreation but I'm not counting this book as I can't afford therapy right now and it's for recovery not recreation"
77,0670785938,http://goodreads.com/user/show/37650802-kara,4,"A close examination of the relationship between trauma and the body, which has long been ignored in Western psychology. I believe this book was originally intended to be read by other psychologists, but it's accessible enough to be read by patients, especially those with a background in basic psychological concepts. Fair warning, the descriptions of patients' trauma can be very triggering, especially for survivors of sexual assault and combat veterans, so read with caution. I wish there had been a more critique analysis of some of the more experimental treatments, such as EMDR, in the later chapters of the book."

I got held up on Chapter 4 in wanting to better understand the neurobiology, but once I did, I finished the rest of the book in three days. such an informative guide, spanning time and history and disciplines, to bring to light a sampling of the broad experiences of those severely traumatized and applicable for all of us to live more fully in the present and more connected to all parts of Self. will definitely reference this in the future."
79,0670785938,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2048362-a-l-sowards,4,"I read this as a writer looking for insight into the consequences of trauma and typical ways to treat it. This book covered that, and more. I haven’t read a lot on this subject, and I enjoyed learning more about how the different parts of the brain work. Although I skimmed parts of the book, most of it held my attention completely. The author talks a lot about victims of childhood abuse and combat veterans. It was interesting to see the differences and similarities between those (and other) groups. Recommended for anyone involved in the mental health industry, anyone who works with children or veterans on a regular basis, or anyone seeking a better understanding of their fellow humans."

81,0670785938,http://goodreads.com/user/show/45642640-rose-elliott,5,"I found this book both insightful and helpful. I found it to be accessible as a layperson, but I have an educational background in psychology. I do think it's accessible for most people though. This is a book I want to come back to every year or so, maybe next time as a hardcopy instead of audiobook. I recommend this for anyone who wants to be more trauma informed."
82,0670785938,http://goodreads.com/user/show/83222535-viktor,3,"This was a disappointing read -- I wanted it to be good, and in many ways it was! Sections on the history of PTSD-as-a-diagnosis are great; van der Kolk was at the forefront of the effort to make PTSD a mainstream psychiatric diagnosis, and it's a fascinating story. He presents his traumatized patients' experiences in a remarkably vivid and empathetic way -- he has a great deal of experience and clearly has valuable insights about working with traumatized patients. He has extremely valid criticisms of how mainstream psychology approaches trauma as well.But this book's primary goal isn't to write a history or a guide to understanding how traumatized people present and feel. It's a treatise on his model of trauma and treatment plan. Here, in the most important place, van der Kolk falls short.His model sounds really, really good. To van der Kolk, the sequelae of traumatic experiences arise from incomplete processing/integration of traumatic memories and from a mind/body disconnect. Conventional therapies like CBT don't work in large part because they address superficial symptoms but fail to integrate the conscious experience with suppressed thoughts/emotions and unrecognized physical states.Instead of narrowly focused conventional psychotherapy and medication, van der Kolk argues, treatments that target the mind/body dissociation and allow clients to process the trauma while remaining in touch with their physical experience will lead to a more complete resolution of trauma symptoms. Severely traumatized clients can initially be reached with therapies that don't directly address the traumatic event: horseback riding, dancing, yoga, drama. Less severe cases can be treated with those as well as therapies that combine processing the trauma with physical movement: therapy groups play-acting scenes that rewrite the trauma, or eye movement desensitization/reprocessing therapy.It's an appealingly coherent model, and van der Kolk describes it so vividly that I wanted it to be true. But the evidence required to justify this book's claims does not exist. EMDR, for example, works as a PTSD treatment -- but nobody has been able to find any evidence that it works better than standard exposure therapy. It seems likely that EMDR works pretty much as well as standard exposure therapy because the controlled reexperiencing involved in EMDR is pretty much the same thing -- and exposure therapy works whether or not you're incorporating the guided eye movements. This is in conflict with van der Kolk's assertion that the effect of eye movement on mind-body integration is the active component of EMDR. Does he address this? Nope! In fact, he seems pretty much incapable of acknowledging any evidence that doesn't match his model. Mainstream psychiatry/psychology has not converted to his model of trauma and his favored therapies because... they like the biomedical model of mental illness too much, apparently, and not because there isn't good evidence for anything van der Kolk is saying. And he has really reasonable criticisms of the psychiatric establishment as a whole, but that doesn't make his model correct!There just aren't many places where his claims (at least those that aren't in line with the mainstream understanding of PTSD causation and treatment) are backed up by anything near the level of evidence that I would expect from a well-established researcher who is making unorthodox claims. From time to time he cites a small and indirect observational study, and says that the result ""could only mean"" that his model is accurate -- this is a striking lack of imagination for a scientist.This is the central issue, I think: van der Kolk may be a great clinician, but he's just not a good scientist. The parts of The Body Keeps the Score devoted to the history of the PTSD diagnosis and how acute and long-term trauma present are great, and it's an engaging read. A different book -- a more autobiographical analysis of his clinical practice and involvement with the creation of the PTSD diagnosis? -- could have been wonderful. Van der Kolk did not write that book. The book he did write includes a lot of very strong claims about the central role of mind/body disconnect in trauma, and about the power of the various alternative therapies he espouses, and he does not seem to care all that much about the evidence or lack thereof. Even if he'd presented his model of trauma with a bit more caution, as an interesting and internally consistent Grand Theory of Trauma that does not have a strong evidence base, I'd give it a lot more latitude.Don't go in with the expectation that van der Kolk will present a model of PTSD that is well-supported and likely to be accurate -- or that any evidence van der Kolk references comes from high-quality studies, is fairly represented, and holds up to replication; don't think that the conclusions van der Kolk draws from his research and observations meet any reasonable epistemic standard. Read The Body Keeps the Score as the book it could have been; take everything about the causes/mechanisms/treatments of trauma with a grain of salt, and it's a wonderful book."

It’s such a good balance of clinical studies, personal experiences, history, intervention techniques and a call for advocacy and change in the way traumatized individuals are dealt with. "
84,0670785938,http://goodreads.com/user/show/27519861-ai-miller,4,"This deserves all of the praise it gets--van der Kolk does a deft job of explaining various aspects of the neuroscience of trauma, and manages to use patient stories to demonstrate that science he's talking about. It also functions really interestingly as a kind of history of trauma treatment, with criticism of the DSM (especially the DSM 5) and the use of medication as a sole treatment of trauma, as well as the misdiagnosis of trauma or diagnoses that deliberately cover up trauma's impact and individualize it. I think if you've done any reading or been exposed to medical trauma theories, a lot of this won't be new to you necessarily (I did an intensive outpatient program before reading this that used this information heavily,) though the information about various kinds of therapies was useful, though how actually useful in being able to access that care might be more difficult. And I think a lot of people will find the chapter on recovered memories... a little messy (as is that whole debate.) But I think it's definitely empowering from a patient perspective, with a lot of information and potential avenues for seeking treatment as well as further, more-depth explanations for what he's able to do. I do recommend it to folks for sure. "

I read it from the perspective of a social worker, however right off the bat I think a general audience might find it a little too academic. Ultimately I could go on about things that I have questions about, or even have heard opposing opinions on, but at the end of the day I think that this is a book every counseling professional should read. Five stars for the breadth of information. "
