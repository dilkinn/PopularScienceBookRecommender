I can imagine that this would be considered transformative by those who aren't used to thinking about the mind as a society of competing agents, but those who come to the book already having ""seen the light"" might end up disappointed.There are some insights in here, but the real value of the text is more watching how Minsky works through a problem as complicated as the mind. For instance, he tells the reader that, when faced with a toughh problem, to create a rough sketch of the solution, and then iterate on that. Or another insight: dividing up a problem is such an effective problem solving technique because one can then apply full attention to solving a simpler problem.This ruthlessly reductive approach to understanding the mind is valuable just to observe. Still, the book is dated. Minsky rightly points out the issues with ""human reason as logic,"" but fails to connect them with probability and reasoning under uncertainty. This isn't his fault, of course, Judea Pearl's ""Probabilistic Reasoning in Intelligent Systems"" came out the same year as the text, so it would have been impossible for Minsky to include this. However, readers today have the benefit of 25 years of progress and access to authors that have assimilated the insights that progress has produced.One last nit: the book operates at a weird level of abstraction. On the one hand, it's more concrete than most discussions in the social sciences, but less formal than the hard sciences. It's not obvious that many of Minsky's idea could be formalized at all, and I worry about ambiguities slipping in. Explanations that assume themselves, circularity, that sort of stuff -- the usual trouble with language. "

Later, they often end up reinventing the same ideas.""I first read this book c. 1990. When I delved into it again c. 2001 I was amazed at how many of the ideas in there I was using, having forgotten they came from this book! Sloman was right. I give Minsky credit in my own Cognitive Productivity.The Society of Mind is a delightful read. It's creative. There's really no other book like it. This is not a book about empirical facts. Nor need one agree with all the scientific claims it makes. However, if you're new to cognitive science, the book will help you think like an AI researcher. If you're already into cognitive science, this book, like no other, will remind you of the importance, complexity and possibilities of the big picture.If you're a Ph.D. thesis supervisor, this book is a great gift to students or friends. I've given a copy myself that was well received.Aaron Sloman's web page: http://www.cs.bham.ac.uk/~axs/"

We now belong to a world where intelligence can be artificial and reality can be virtual. This book 'The Society of Mind' is one of its kind in which Marvin Minsky has unraveled the most unconventional methods that life employs to comprehend how memory is created, rather not a jump-rope between past and future.Sometimes in life we become mindful without being sensible or vice versa. But the journey of life is only meaningful when both intuition and instincts run simultaneously.Hence science brings the best logic in those aspects that usually we consider magic in lack of proof.Marvin Minsky's 'The Society of Mind' is a must read for those who prefer to create waves by creating ripples in water or against the flow rather not become dead fish to sail in the stream.Finally, we can never deny this truth that the mind can give meaning to any mystery around in life."

Initially, it was fascinating to think about the role symbolic computation & manipulation play in our mind, which is somewhat neglected in recent AI research. However, eventually I got tired of reading statements without much supporting evidence. Probably this is the nature of the psychological problems that convincing scientific evidences are hard to collect, but still, this book's exceptionally high statement/evidence ratio was unbearable for me."
4,0671657135,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1667021-may-ling,5,"Summary: Though light on citations, it's a great book to get a layout of how comp sci thinks the mind works. It's not true, but it certainly is important to see how it's being broken down as it's nearly impossible to get this same framework from other fields (psychology, neurology, linguistics, etc).Please also see my Vlog week of 3/1/2020 on Instagram: WhereIsMayLing. Thx!!-------p. 27/28 - This concept of parts and wholes is intriguing linguistically and also relevant to the concept of what we mean by false relationships. The fact that the concept of life does not make sense when chopped up. The associations may not be able to match the definition. Also, how do you roll up this concept from a logical perspective? There is no partial life, except in the mind.p. 40 - We don't just have a concept of a self, we have a concept of multiple selves. p. 67 ""We overestimate how much we actually communicate. Instead, despite those seemingly important differences, much of what we do is based on common knowledge and experience. So even though we scarcely speak at all about what happens in our lower-level mental processes, we can exploit their common heritage. Although we can't express what we mean, we can often cite various examples to indicate how to connect structures we're sure must already exist inside the listener's mind. In short, we can often indicate which sorts of thoughts to think, even though we can't express how they operate. ""Meaning"" itself is relative to size and scale: It makes sense to talk about a meaning only in a system large enough to have many meanings."" p. 71 - ""People use the word ""intelligence"" to emphasize swiftness and efficiency."" ""Intelligence"" is our name for whichever of those processes we don't yet understand."" People hate that definition b/c they think it ought to be something stationary. But it's really not. I love this philosophically.p. 78 - ""Whenever we talk about a 'goal' we mix a thousand meanings in one word. Goals are linked to allt he unknown agencies that are engaged whenever we try to change ourselves or th outside world. If 'goal' involves so many things, why tie them all to a single word?""p. 105 - ""We're imprisoned by our poverty of words because even though we have good ways to describe objects and actions, we lack methods for describing dispositions and processes. We can scarcely speak of what minds do except as though they were filled with things that one could see or touch. That's why we cling to terms like 'concepts' and 'ideas.""p. 114 - ""Long ago, psychologists like Freud and Piaget observed that children seem to recapitualte the history of astronomy: firs they imagine the world as centered around themselves -- and only later do they start to view themselves as moving within a stationary universe in which the body is justlike any other object."" ""... even in their adolescent years, children are still improving their abilities p. 135 - Abstract drawings of objects by children give you a sense for what the minimum requirements are for a representation of an object. Intriguing.p. 156 - They start to talk about how the brain has many different types of memory. (Memory agents)p. 157 - Memory rearrangements, Short & Long Term memory (layers of long term memory)He doesn't go into enough detail for my purposes as relates to memory, things like associative memory, etc.p. 163 - ""The question is not whether intelligent machines cannot have any emotions, but whether machines can be intelligent without emotions.""p. 183 - We accept emotional trauma as illness while thinking of intellectual incompetence as normal. p. 186 - Related to the fallacy of logic: ""There is nothing to prevent us from using logical language to describe illogical reasoning."" p 202 - The difficulty with weighting systems. It doesn't all make sense here, but he suggests the book Perceptions by Seymour Papert.p. 204 - He attempts to diagram language agency. I'm thinking on whether this jibes with theory outside of AI. p. 222 - His concept of Trans-frame schemes is interesting, but also problematic at the same time. It's an attempt to relate our thinking process to relational data. There are likely an infinite number of associations. So it's tough, but it's necessarily from a starting place perspective.The next sections are hard core language as relates to framework. Because he's building up from nothing this may seem very basic, but if you're trying to program this, it might be helpful.p. 277 - Exceptions to logic. I'm surprised he doesn't just pull from Godel here one exceptions to logic.p. 284 - ""We turn to quantities when we can't compare qualities of things."" This is the basis for KPIs but it also means that we may or may not be comparing correctly, a judgment that exists a bit independant.p. 299 - ""Every thought is to some degree a metaphor."""

So far, it's very readable and very smart. Unlike many scientists, he seems very conversant in how humanists think, and seems to have an understanding of the heuristics of human emotion (both rational and irrational) and their place in the order (and disorder) of consciousness. I was fascinated by how some of his ideas relate to human addictions, for instance; these are not comparisons Minksy overtly draws, but if you keep your mind open when you're reading this, you're able to extrapolate a lot on his ideas on how cognitive dissonance comes about, and how it might relate to things like addiction.I hope it continues to hold my interest as much as it has so far, and continues to have these inspiring effects...I already want to do something with Minsky in a piece of sci-fi I'm formulating..."
7,0671657135,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5183414-dave,5,"Regadless of it's 20-odd year age (it was first published in '86), this is an absolutely fascinating read on Minsky's (co-founder of MIT's AI lab & cognitive scientist extraordinaire) theory of mind. The book is written concisely and is incredibly well thought out in execution; despite the overwhelming complexity of the subject matter, it eases the reader gently into understanding rather than dumping it in their lap and exclaiming ""You want information? THERE'S YOUR INFORMATION."" This book is not a reference text, however. Ignoring for the most part neurological, neurochemical and neurophysiological facets of conciousness, it instead focuses on the philosophy and logic of possible factors from which thought arises.Highly recommended to anyone with an interest in the theories of intelligence, artifical intelligence or just crackingly good science reads.

8,0671657135,http://goodreads.com/user/show/35218012-anirud-thyagharajan,5,"A coherent read, that really clutches at the fabric between AI & Psychology; the author describes the mind as a collection of fundamental agents performing atomic tasks, interacting between themselves, and establishing hierarchies. Coming from Marvin Minsky, it feels both inspiring and serendipitous to know the roots of AI, from the pioneer of AI.This review has more AIs than a buzzword news article! "
9,0671657135,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6857911-ryan,5,"If intelligent machines exist someday, no doubt they will think of Marvin Minsky, a pioneer at MIT's Artificial Intelligence Lab, as one of their progenitors.This book reads as a collection of foundational ponderings from a luminary in the field, distilled to their instructive essence. Minsky assumes that a ""mind"" is not a single, efficient decision-making machine, but a collection of many such machines, which he calls agents. Each agent, on its own, is simple and specialized, but through a process of cooperation and competition with one another, the agents form a collective understanding of the world. This gives rise to an emergent intelligence guided by preprogrammed assumptions, but not constrained by them.Minsky writes with a disarming simplicity, using the whimsical but versatile example of a child playing with building blocks to illustrate his points. How does a child's brain manage the many parallel, interrelated tasks inherent in such play, from fine motor control, to hand-eye coordination, to physical intuition, to forming structural knowledge from experience, to remaining motivated amid competing desires, to deciding when to knock the block towers down? Each chapter is a self-contained one or two page essay, exploring a different facet of how a network of separate, co-evolved agents might implement decision-making, pattern-recognition, task delegation, memory, learning, and problem-solving.This is not a practical book to help you write AI software, to teach you about A*, Bayesian networks, or other relatively concrete techniques. It's a book to get you to think about what intelligence really is. But I think that any software developer with a genuine interest in the possibility of machine learning and machine thought will find both illuminating and stimulating. While Minsky's zenlike thoughts are focused more on abstract ideas than technical details, they offer valuable starting points for breaking the densely tangled problem of ""intelligence"" down into more manageable layers and processes.The essays that comprise each chapter build on each other in a somewhat linear order, but their shortness invites non-linear contemplation, which seems an appropriate way to explore the nature of thought. I think that some of Minsky's more advanced concepts amount to speculative castles in the air -- ideas that seem only loosely derived from neuroscience and might not pan out in real AI frameworks. Still, this 1988 book deals with questions so far ahead of the 2011 state of the art, that its value is less in the end product of its thought experiments, and more in the experiments themselves. This isn't a work about artificial intelligence, but about how to think about artificial intelligence, and it's a defining classic. As a software developer, I look forward to proceeding into the world he envisioned."
10,0671657135,http://goodreads.com/user/show/59510944-anima,5,"Highly recommended. Every topic is a great opportunity to delve into the material and spiritual world contained inside us. I very much enjoyed reading the book. The appendix is amazing- for anyone who wants to understand better how the brain works, there are few topics that beautifully and clearly explain the process. 28.7 Individual identities""Suppose I had once borrowed your boat and, secretly, replaced each board with a similar butdifferent one. Then, later, when I brought it back, did I return your boat to you? What kind ofquestion is that? It's really not about boats at all, but about what people mean by ""same."" For""same"" is never absolute but always a matter of degree. If I had merely changed one plank,we'd all agree that it's still you boat-but after all its parts are changed, we're not so sure of itsidentity. In any case, we do not doubt that the second boat will behave in much the same way-to the extent that all those substituted boards are suitably equivalent.What has this to do with brains? Well, now suppose that we could replace each of your braincells with a specially designed computer chip that performs the same functions, and thensuppose that we interconnect these devices just as your brain cells are connected. If we put itin the same environment, this new machine would reproduce the same processes as thosewithin your brain. Would that new machine be the same as you?....""Appendix4 BRAIN CONNECTIONSWhat possible sort of brain-machine could support a billion-agent society of mind? Thehuman brain contains so many agencies and connections that it resembles a great nation ofcities and towns, linked by vast networks of roads and highways. We are born with brain centersthat are specialized for every sense and muscle group, for moving every eye and limb; fordistinguishing the sounds of words, the features of faces, and all sorts of touches, tastes andsmells. We're born with protospecialists involved with hunger, laughter ,fear and anger, sleep,and sexual activity-and surely many other functions no one has discovered yet-each basedupon a somewhat different architecture and mode of operation. Thousands of different genesmust be involved in laying out these agencies and the nerve-bundles between them.....""who talks to whom"" within each mind-society.Now every population will include some variants among the genes that shape those highwaysin the brain, and this must influence their bearers' potential styles of thought. ..."""
11,0671657135,http://goodreads.com/user/show/57444748-g,4,"A classic book on the philosophy of mind. I think this outstanding book shall be understood as an update of Turing’s idea concerned with computing machinery and intelligence. That is, the human mind can be seen as an algorithm, as a complex set of propositional operations. The deep problem with this view is the same problem that all systematic views do have to solve: all the questions have to be answered using the same idea. Hence, some answers seem to be acceptable, other answers are clearly poor. In my opinion, this book by Minsky needs more elaboration on the issue of introspection. Minsky argues that introspection is a myth, that is, our mind might not have access to itself. Of course that such view is mistaken. Plenty of hard neuroscientific evidence has refuted Minsky’s concept of introspection. I rather think that the algorithms of introspection are not accessible -its mechanisms-, but fiction itself is a kind of access to many introspective registries. Maybe Minsky’s theory requires further distinctions. However, this book is beautiful and smart. Nowadays, artificial intelligence still belongs to industrial engineering and to hard sci-fi films and books. Nevertheless, its core ideas are still healthy and feasible. In my opinion, this book becomes even better when read together with other books. I recommend two authors, or two fields: one is Doug Hofstadter and the field of artificial intelligence, the other is André Breton and the general field of experimental literature. Gödel, Escher, Bach, a beautiful book by Hofstadter achieves a popular scientific access to the core idea of Alan Turing concerned with the human mind, that is, our mind can be mathematically explained. In my opinion, a subtle distinction proposed by Hofstadter saves the problem of introspection -please read GEB by Hofstadter-. Breton’s Surrealist Manifesto -at least in two versions- suggests that a trained surrealist artist can read its own mind like an open book. That’s obviously an exaggeration. However, it makes sense. Robert Desnos was the example mentioned by Breton, but maybe all the stream-of-consciousness literature can also be mentioned nowadays. I think that the same issue becomes clear in the OuLiPo project. Hence, I would also recommend the works by Raymond Queneau, Georges Perec, Italo Calvino, Harry Mathews, and François Le Lionnais, among many others, to understand why this ingenious book by Minsky needs further elaboration."

But by the time you're finished, it's obvious that you've just read a masterpiece which reveals an extraordinary career. It's remarkable that the book is now over 15 years old (an eternity in the fields it covers!) and it never once seems out of date. Minksy's parallel interests in psychology and language mirror my own. He's obviously a huge influence on another hero of mine, Steven Pinker."
13,0671657135,http://goodreads.com/user/show/14930854-rudradeep-mukherjee,5,"It took me around eight months to finish this book. Not because the book was boring, but because it essentially consists of speculations. The kind of speculations that forces one to think. Because of the book's age, some of things discussed are outdated but, the rest is surprisingly close to what researchers have found about human brain, intelligence and computation in general. It is worth reading once. It is worth reading - many times - over and over again."
14,0671657135,http://goodreads.com/user/show/25371127-rossdavidh,4,"Over 20 years ago, a guy named Marvin Minsky decided to write a book on how he thought the brain/mind worked. The result was this book. We still do not know everything about this topic of course, but we know more than we did then. So, how does it hold up?First off, who is this guy? He's an MIT researcher in artificial intelligence, including the parts where they study (and attempt to simulate) how neurons work. He's been in the field for about as long as anyone. He's endorsed on the back cover by Douglas Hofstadter, Martin Gardner, and Isaac Asimov. He's an egghead's egghead.He has a decent writing style. He supplements his text with sparse, curiously pleasing diagrams and simple pictures. He digs up enough relevant quotes (from Buddha to Aristotle to Rousseau to G.K.Chesterton) to get your attention no matter what corner you're coming from (or, if not, perhaps you should put this book down).His basic theory is in the title. Mind is what the brain does, and it's done by a society of agents, each with its own agenda. If you're looking for the central ""I"" that's at the base of it all, you will be disappointed and/or confused; this amalgamation of drives and pattern-matchers and networked idiot savants is all that we are.Minsky's vision of how mind happens is one that many would not find comforting, which probably explains why it remains unknown outside of its field and the narrow band of society that reads lots of popular science books. But, probably Minsky's greatest virtue as a writer is that he isn't tempted to try to boggle our minds unduly. His presentation is matter of fact, and his prose is informative, neither hiding nor trumpeting how different his findings and proposals are from the intuitions our minds have about themselves.And needless to say, neither the mind-body dichotomy nor the conventional idea of a 'soul' are much in evidence here. Ant colonies and electorates are, in his view, just as much indivisible things, with personality and intention, as we are.So, while you read this:- the vision centers are jumping around across the screen, preprocessing the letters and passing on only the condensed summary, never the raw data- the parts of your brain concerned with language are processing the letters and words- the emotional parts of your brain are deciding what they think about it, or maybe they're processing some other topic entirely- the analytical parts of your brain may, or may not, be forming an opinion about the idea of a book that says we are societies, not individuals...and these different parts of your brain may, or may not, send messages to each other, but they can also lie to each other, or give each other the silent treatment. Where is the 'I' that experiences it all? Everywhere and nowhere."
15,0671657135,http://goodreads.com/user/show/14946158-holly,3,"A 1980's book hypothesizing how the brain/mind works. Minsky defines the mind as ""what the brain does"". Do you perceive yourself to have one mind or do you have many?Single self: ""I think, I want, I feel. It's me, myself, who thinks my thoughts. It's not some nameless cloud or crowd of selfless parts.""Multiple self: ""One part of me wants this, another part of me wants that. I must get better control of myself."" (p40) Minsky argues we have a society of mind - competing agents within ourselves. The methods we use to manipulate ourselves are similar to the methods we use to manipulate others with similar success rates. He gives an example on his methods to persuade himself stay up late and work on a project when he's exhausted. An artificial intelligence may have to have an agent based mind as well. These parts of the book were thought provoking and interesting, but my eyes glazed over towards the middle despite the simple language and concepts. There is a lot of discussion on how we perceive a tower of building blocks as parts of a whole. An interesting digression was his speculation on why children find it easier to pick up foreign accents than adults. Adults lose the ability to make new sounds after puberty because their primary role goes from learner to teacher. If parents were able to communicate faster with children in the short term by imitating child sounds, they would do it for expedience and children wouldn't have incentive/opportunity to learn and a common, mature public language wouldn't develop."
16,0671657135,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1552336-tom,4,"Just got my review wiped out. Beautiful technology and my use of it ...Let's see what I can reconstruct.Brain dump from Minsky. Something he says in the postscript (and which was clear to me but might not be to all readers) should have been at the BEGINNING of the book:Since most of the statements in this book are speculations, it would have been too tedious to mention this on every page. Instead, I did the opposite---by taking out all words like ""possibly"" and deleting every reference to scientific evidence. Accordingly, this book be should read less as a text of scientific scholarship and more as an adventure story for the imagination. That said, these speculations came from someone with lots of hands-on experience in AI.I do agree with a lot and find it insightful. Lots of ideas to chew on. Currently in-vogue Bayesian techniques would help out here, though. Also, Minsky often goes too far in his philosophical ramifications among many other sweeping statements.The historical discussion is great throughout the book (and another reason not to skip the postscript). It shows well that modern research concerns in AI were already on folks' mind in the 1950s. The frequent literary quotations are also very nice.The flow, of course, is difficult in the book, and the odd vocabulary (all the ""nomes"" and such) is difficult for me to track. Most of these terms are not common in AI research, at least not in my reading."
17,0671657135,http://goodreads.com/user/show/210421-bart,4,"A very good account and an obviously influential one - as Minsky's ideas influenced the next 30 years of machine learning.The format is what's best; it skips round because the mind does. It also eschews reductionism because Minsky knew in 1970 what contemporary neurology doesn't: Naming and numbering a billion brain cells will get you barely one step (of a hundred) closer to understanding how the mind happens.Nature used very simple parts and trillions of iterations to arrive at the mammalian mind. Minsky understood that impenetrable algorithms are not the path to artificial intelligence, and neither is an intolerance for failure - a tangle of thresholds and compromises is how a thought happens, and computer programs and their programmers are not very good at such things.Subsequently, most of the advances in ""AI"" since Minsky's book have been made by marketing departments and screenplay writers."

23,0671657135,http://goodreads.com/user/show/28143032-yudhishtir,5,"How did we take that first step while walking ? How did we utter that first word which somebody could make sense of? How did we learn to make our fingers learn the art of clutching and grasping with different intensities? How did we learn to sense fire without needing to touch it ? How did we learn that there can only be one thing at one fixed point in place? How did we know to slow down our hand at just the right point of time to pick up a thing? How do we manage to get back to an interrupted thought with the same depth ?And many more ! These are questions we seldom ponder upon if not stimulated by some external agency. While browsing through courses on the MIT opencoursweare, I landed up on this course by Marvin Minsky. Within twenty minutes into this , the prof mentioned the book “The society of mind“ a couple of times and that was enough for me to drop the course and go hunting for the E-version of the book and ten minutes into reading it , I was sure this was a book that had to go into my physical collection. And all along this I couldn’t help but think who/what was the AGENT that made me do all of this ACTIONS. So without much adieu I would like to call upon the stage “The Mind” We are taught from our childhood to learn about the physical world around us. We witness and internalise the laws of the physical world and as we grow up we learn to navigate the contours of the emotional world and maybe we subconsciously pick upon the psychological features of our fellow beings too. It so rarely happens that we look inward into the mind of the self. The inherent biases it begins with , the lack of experience it ignores when making big decisions, its inability to focus on all dimensions with equal weightage and how could actually the best this machine could do. This book can prove as an effective Map for one wishes to begin doing that. Minsky compares the agents of mind to the institutions of the existing social world , with the ultimate motive of these institutions to create a stable and balanced existence devoid of absurd contradictions and non existent tussles.Physical structures are developed in a coherent mannerism as to allow the most effective transfer of the features of the reality into every being to create a normative framework (this arises out of the social need to conform) . But the frame work of mind is not so , mins is more malleable , it can adapt , remould and even renounce its ideals , beliefs and pre formed solutions with just a minute change in the stimuli. But is it possible to learn something which spells such large dimension of abstractness . Minsky believes this conundrum can be overcome by cross linking rational conglomeration of ideas where each theory or idea is in itself meaningless but the whole serves a purpose which sustains each of the part in good spirits and shouts out SYNERGY.This book affirmed some of my already existing narratives about the self and it enriched me with perspectives I lacked too. A must read if MIND fascinates you !"
24,0671657135,http://goodreads.com/user/show/18202178-claudio,4,"Quite as I expected, a weirdly assembled collection of brilliant (and a bit mind-fudging) essays at the crossroad of Cognitive Science, Psychology, Artificial Intelligence.I realized that my thoughts on this book are quite perfectly expressed by Minsky himself, in the postscript:This book assumes that any brain, machine, or other thing that has a mind must be composed of smaller things that cannot think at all. The structure of the book itself reflects this view: each page explores a theory or idea that exploits what other pages do. Some readers might prefer a more usual form of story plot. I tried to do that several times, but it never seemed to work; each way I tried to line things up left too many thoughts that would not fit. A mind is too complex to fit the mold of narratives that start out here and end up there; a human intellect depends upon the connections in a tangled web — which simply wouldn't work at all if it were neatly straightened out.I find it hard to say whether every single idea in this ""stunning collage of staccato images"" (as Douglas Hofstadter defined it) has withstood the test of time. Surely I wouldn't vouch for Minsky's lines of reasoning about grammar and language, for instance. On the other hand, most often the level of abstraction is such that you can't really object anything. With the very words of Minsky:To assemble the overview suggested in this book, I had to make literally hundreds of assumptions. [...] Since most of the statements in this book are speculations, it would have been too tedious to mention this on every page. Instead, I did the opposite — by taking out all words like 'possibly' and deleting every reference to scientific evidence. Accordingly, this book should be read less as a text of scientific scholarship and more as an adventure story for the imagination. Each idea should be seen not as a firm hypothesis about the mind, but as another implement to keep inside one's toolbox for making theories of the mind.To be perfectly honest, I am deeply convinced that the value of this book is not in the theories it explores as much as in the chance it gives us to follow Minsky's systematic way of reasoning, making arguments, and gaining insights.After all, we can only look ahead if we stand on the shoulders of giants.Thanks Marvin, we'll miss you."
25,0671657135,http://goodreads.com/user/show/49232224-reinier-tromp,4,"This book by Marvin Minksy gave me great insight on computational thinking and in thinking about how the mind could work. It is definitely not a page turner, but something you occasionaly pick up while drinking a cup of coffee when you read a few small essay's. The book is very philosophical and you have to be careful by not getting to much involved in symbolic thinking (that is, thinking in if/then statements). After all, AI nowadays leans heavy on influences from connectionism (thinking in networks). One of his main methods for problem solving is dividing a problem into small problems until you can solve the small problem and from there build it up until you get to the whole. I am sure that this is nothing new and someone can probably point at a dozen of Ancient thinkers who already did this. Above all everybody who is familiar with mathematics or programming will recognize this method, but it is interesting how to apply this on the bigger questions which is for example heavily used in system theory models. A computational approach on how the mind works is very promising with the great benefit that we can actually put our theories to the test by building and testing them. If you want to get an idea how a computational philosopher thinks about the human mind this book is very recommended. It sharpens your thinking, it gives you new ideas."
26,0671657135,http://goodreads.com/user/show/86150052-emilio-daffy,5,"The premise of this book has remained in my mind for decades, and it has altered how I see the world of people, the human mind. I've forgotten much of the detail of the book, so I imagine it may feel dated by now, but not the premise. It helps me understand how one personality can seem so complex, with behavior of one sort active at one time, and a behavior of another sort at another time. The flow of control within the mind is constantly in motion, yet internally we have the illusion of constancy. But I've kinda trained myself to be sensitive to how my own mind flows and can see how Minsky's idea seems to hold true. But try telling someone who hasn't been exposed to the idea, and they'll reject it as absurd. We're convinced that there is a single, continuous, monolithic ""self."" Nope, there isn't."
27,0671657135,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6084618-don-wentworth,3,"First of all, ""The Society of Mind"" probably deserves 5 stars and the reader 1 star because, frankly, I, the reader, failed the book. In in its own inimitable way, it, alas, broke my brain (or, in the language of the book itself, mangled my mind). It took sometime (and an excellent appendix and acknowledgements sections at the end which, IMHO, should have appeared at the beginning of the book) for me to finally begin to wrap my thoughts around what Minsky was trying to and, in fact, did accomplish and, by his own admission, what he didn't ... or hadn't yet.I'll leave it at that except to say, if you are a person with a background heavy in humanities and light in sci/tech, do yourself a favor and read the acknowledgements and appendix first.

28,0671657135,http://goodreads.com/user/show/86741921-caleb-foss,4,"This book is an excellent view into the formation of the ideas that developed into modern machine learning. Minsky, with the help of his MIT students, break the human brain into the smallest possible ""agents"" and provide explanations for how memories are formed and how language works, using a new vernacular. The entire book is a valuable insight into what it could take to make a machine that would work like a human brain. My only complaint, and it's a small one, is that the book does not delve more into the artificial side of intelligence, staying firmly in the lane of human cognition. The section of censors and humor alone is worth reading the book. Creating a common theory to show why we laugh at the absurd, along with taboo, is surprising and very compelling. Overall a dense but satisfying read"

Then we’ll be better able to decide what we like about them, and what we don’t—and bit by bit we’ll rebuild ourselves. I don’t think that most people will bother with this, because they like themselves just as they are. Perhaps they are not selfish enough, or imaginative, or ambitious. Myself, I don’t much like how people are now. We’re too shallow, slow, and ignorant. I hope that our future will lead us to ideas that we can use to improve ourselves.”"

40,0671657135,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2581042-jeremiah,0,"Great Quotes:- 7.10 GENIUS, on learning ow to learn:""I suspect that genius needs one thing more: in order to accumulate outstanding qualities, one needs unusually effective ways to learn. It's not enough to learn a lot; one also has to MANAGE what one learns. Those masters have, beneath the surface of their mastery, some special knacks of ""higher-order"" expertise, which help them organize and apply the thing they learn. It is those hidden tricks of mental management that produce the systems that create those works of genius. Why do certain people learn so many more and better skills? These all-important differences could begin with early accidents...But if the second child persists in seeking better ways to learn, they can lead to silent growth in which some better ways to learn may lead to better ways to learn HOW TO LEARN. Then later, we'll observe an awesome, qualitative change, with no apparent cause -- and give to it some empty name like talent, aptitude, or gift.Finally, an awful thought, perhaps what we call genius is rare because our evolution works without respect for individuals. Could any tribe or culture endure in which each individual discovered novel ways to think? If not, how sad, since the genes for genius might then lead not to nurturing, but frequent weeding-out.""- 9.1 WANTING AND LIKING""The surer you are that you like what you are doing, the more completely your other ambitions are being suppressed.""- 9.3 LEARNING FROM FAILURE""Naturally, we tend to prefer learning from success rather than from failure. However, I suspect that confining ourselves to ""positive"" learning experiences alone leads to relatively small improvements in what we can already do. Probably, there is no way to avoid at least a certain degree of discomfort when we make substantial changes in how we think""- 9.4 ENJOYING DISCOMFORT""But what if a situation gets completely out of our control-and offers no conceivableescape from suffering? Then all we can do is try to construct some inner plan for tolerating it. One trick is to try to change our momentary goal-as when we say, ""It's getting there that's all the fun."" Another wayislooking forwardto somebenefitto future Self:""I certainly shalllearnfrom fhis."" When that doesn't work, we can still resort to even more unselfish schemes:""Perhaps othersmay learn from my mistake."""""
41,0671657135,http://goodreads.com/user/show/8055854-dan,4,"Great book for the curious layman grasping at a chance to better understand how a mechanical brain can lead to a conscious mind; although, I have a sneaking suspicion that Minsky slips in a few italics here and there to empathize some of the deeper implications and complexities. I absolutely loved the layout of the text (he uses one-page chapters), and I love how he slowly builds his ideas from the ground up. Even with his ""basic"" examples, one can quickly see how complex the brain truly is (...which supports his idea that ""common sense"" can sometimes be much more complex than logical ""adult"" sense). I also love how his background automatically led him to tie in a lot of his concepts with artificial intelligence. It leaves one feeling... Can this stuff be duplicated? I have no real complaints, but I must admit that I got lost once in awhile, and a reread is a must! If you enjoy books on consciousness, thinking, AI, or even psychology, then I suggest grabbing a couple hours to read through this gem. One caution: Minsky wants the reader to come away with the idea that chemistry and neurology can ultimately lead to self-consciousness, but don't take this in any way to mean a diminishment of the value of consciousness. In fact, this is exactly one of his points! Unintelligent, automatic, and unconscious neurons, when merged into larger and larger societies can lead to consciousness, but understanding the building blocks of consciousness is not the same as explaining the experience of consciousness. Happy reading!"
42,0671657135,http://goodreads.com/user/show/16523736-slim-khezri,4,"This book reads as a collection of foundational pondering from a luminary in the field, distilled to their instructive essence. Minsky assumes that a ""mind"" is not a single, efficient decision-making machine, but a collection of many such machines, which he calls agents. Each agent, on its own, is simple and specialized, but through a process of cooperation and competition with one another, the agents form a collective understanding of the world. This gives rise to an emergent intelligence guided by preprogrammed assumptions, but not constrained by them.Minsky writes with a disarming simplicity, using the whimsical but versatile example of a child playing with building blocks to illustrate his points. How does a child's brain manage the many parallel, interrelated tasks inherent in such play, from fine motor control, to hand-eye coordination, to physical intuition, to forming structural knowledge from experience, to remaining motivated amid competing desires, to deciding when to knock the block towers down? Each chapter is a self-contained one or two page essay, exploring a different facet of how a network of separate, co-evolved agents might implement decision-making, pattern-recognition, task delegation, memory, learning, and problem-solving."
43,0671657135,http://goodreads.com/user/show/20378185-armineh-nouri,3,"Minsky's thesis on the cognitive machinery of the mind and its functional properties, brilliant as it may be in its insight, is nothing more than a series of increasingly detailed speculations. I approached the book with a certain optimism that I'd be presented with a series of arguments delimited by supporting behavioral or neurological studies, but the latter part held an unfortunately small share of the narrative. Furthermore, the author has based most of his ideas on a hierarchical characterization of agencies in the brain, which seems to indicate a top-down approach to analyzing the mind against which he himself repeatedly cautions the reader. Other shortcomings include the author's lack of regard for the non-linear or emergent properties of subconscious processes. For instance, apart from a passing remark in section 18.9 he never considers the role that duplication, distribution, and ""sharding"" plays in short and long-term memory and thus leaves experiments such as Lashley's unexplained.Overall, the book is an engaging read for someone looking for creatively stimulating material on the human mind, but as other reviewers have noted, someone who is looking for a less leisurely and more scientific anthology of research on the topic, might find other sources more useful. "
44,0671657135,http://goodreads.com/user/show/71595-robert,5,"Very thought provoking, it's either brilliant or nonsense.[UPDATE: May 18, 2020]I first bought this book in 2006 because it was famous and sounded interesting but I only really skimmed thought it and couldn't really understand it.This year I decided to read it again in more detail ... and I still don't really understand it!But that's OK, I don't feel bad about not completely understanding it because I think I get what he was trying to do.These are basically some really interesting guesses about how neurons might be able to produce the high level human behavior like that we know and love.So some observations:-This book was published in 1986. More 0 years later we aren't really that much closer to understanding how low level neuronal activity leads to ""thoughts"" or even how memory works.-I think Minsky does a great job of showing how difficult it is to explain things like language and consciousness from a reductionist point of view.-The chapter that stuck in my head was his explanation of jokes. It really sounds quite plausible!"

The best part about this book is it’s one page essay format. It seems to mimic how our brain works. It skips rounds because mind does too. By the time I finished, it was pretty obvious that I have read a masterpiece. It is astonishing that the book is 20+ year old, but not even one page seems out of place. Minsky’s deduction that our mind is not a single intelligent unit rather it is a collection of small agents each one of them very simple, binary and specialized but based on cooperation & competition they form its emergent intelligence which is guided by programmed binary deductions but not constrained by it. A must read for most people with any interest in what is fast becoming a growing set of fields such as artificial intelligence , neuro-networks and neurology."

Those masters have, beneath the surface of their mastery, some special knacks of ""higher-order"" expertise, which help them organize and apply the thing they learn. It is those hidden tricks of mental management that produce the systems that create those works of genius. Why do certain people learn so many more and better skills? These all-important differences could begin with early accidents...But if the second child persists in seeking better ways to learn, they can lead to silent growth in which some better ways to learn may lead to better ways to learn HOW TO LEARN. Then later, we'll observe an awesome, qualitative change, with no apparent cause -- and give to it some empty name like talent, aptitude, or gift.Finally, an awful thought, perhaps what we call genius is rare because our evolution works without respect for individuals.

71,0671657135,http://goodreads.com/user/show/8055854-dan,4,"Great book for the curious layman grasping at a chance to better understand how a mechanical brain can lead to a conscious mind; although, I have a sneaking suspicion that Minsky slips in a few italics here and there to empathize some of the deeper implications and complexities. I absolutely loved the layout of the text (he uses one-page chapters), and I love how he slowly builds his ideas from the ground up. Even with his ""basic"" examples, one can quickly see how complex the brain truly is (...which supports his idea that ""common sense"" can sometimes be much more complex than logical ""adult"" sense). I also love how his background automatically led him to tie in a lot of his concepts with artificial intelligence. It leaves one feeling... Can this stuff be duplicated? I have no real complaints, but I must admit that I got lost once in awhile, and a reread is a must! If you enjoy books on consciousness, thinking, AI, or even psychology, then I suggest grabbing a couple hours to read through this gem. One caution: Minsky wants the reader to come away with the idea that chemistry and neurology can ultimately lead to self-consciousness, but don't take this in any way to mean a diminishment of the value of consciousness. In fact, this is exactly one of his points! Unintelligent, automatic, and unconscious neurons, when merged into larger and larger societies can lead to consciousness, but understanding the building blocks of consciousness is not the same as explaining the experience of consciousness. Happy reading!"
72,0671657135,http://goodreads.com/user/show/16523736-slim-khezri,4,"This book reads as a collection of foundational pondering from a luminary in the field, distilled to their instructive essence. Minsky assumes that a ""mind"" is not a single, efficient decision-making machine, but a collection of many such machines, which he calls agents. Each agent, on its own, is simple and specialized, but through a process of cooperation and competition with one another, the agents form a collective understanding of the world. This gives rise to an emergent intelligence guided by preprogrammed assumptions, but not constrained by them.Minsky writes with a disarming simplicity, using the whimsical but versatile example of a child playing with building blocks to illustrate his points. How does a child's brain manage the many parallel, interrelated tasks inherent in such play, from fine motor control, to hand-eye coordination, to physical intuition, to forming structural knowledge from experience, to remaining motivated amid competing desires, to deciding when to knock the block towers down? Each chapter is a self-contained one or two page essay, exploring a different facet of how a network of separate, co-evolved agents might implement decision-making, pattern-recognition, task delegation, memory, learning, and problem-solving."
73,0671657135,http://goodreads.com/user/show/20378185-armineh-nouri,3,"Minsky's thesis on the cognitive machinery of the mind and its functional properties, brilliant as it may be in its insight, is nothing more than a series of increasingly detailed speculations. I approached the book with a certain optimism that I'd be presented with a series of arguments delimited by supporting behavioral or neurological studies, but the latter part held an unfortunately small share of the narrative. Furthermore, the author has based most of his ideas on a hierarchical characterization of agencies in the brain, which seems to indicate a top-down approach to analyzing the mind against which he himself repeatedly cautions the reader. Other shortcomings include the author's lack of regard for the non-linear or emergent properties of subconscious processes. For instance, apart from a passing remark in section 18.9 he never considers the role that duplication, distribution, and ""sharding"" plays in short and long-term memory and thus leaves experiments such as Lashley's unexplained.Overall, the book is an engaging read for someone looking for creatively stimulating material on the human mind, but as other reviewers have noted, someone who is looking for a less leisurely and more scientific anthology of research on the topic, might find other sources more useful.

74,0671657135,http://goodreads.com/user/show/71595-robert,5,"Very thought provoking, it's either brilliant or nonsense.[UPDATE: May 18, 2020]I first bought this book in 2006 because it was famous and sounded interesting but I only really skimmed thought it and couldn't really understand it.This year I decided to read it again in more detail ... and I still don't really understand it!But that's OK, I don't feel bad about not completely understanding it because I think I get what he was trying to do.These are basically some really interesting guesses about how neurons might be able to produce the high level human behavior like that we know and love.So some observations:-This book was published in 1986. More 0 years later we aren't really that much closer to understanding how low level neuronal activity leads to ""thoughts"" or even how memory works.-I think Minsky does a great job of showing how difficult it is to explain things like language and consciousness from a reductionist point of view.-The chapter that stuck in my head was his explanation of jokes.

The best part about this book is it’s one page essay format. It seems to mimic how our brain works. It skips rounds because mind does too. By the time I finished, it was pretty obvious that I have read a masterpiece. It is astonishing that the book is 20+ year old, but not even one page seems out of place. Minsky’s deduction that our mind is not a single intelligent unit rather it is a collection of small agents each one of them very simple, binary and specialized but based on cooperation & competition they form its emergent intelligence which is guided by programmed binary deductions but not constrained by it. A must read for most people with any interest in what is fast becoming a growing set of fields such as artificial intelligence , neuro-networks and neurology."

I also love how his background automatically led him to tie in a lot of his concepts with artificial intelligence. It leaves one feeling... Can this stuff be duplicated? I have no real complaints, but I must admit that I got lost once in awhile, and a reread is a must! If you enjoy books on consciousness, thinking, AI, or even psychology, then I suggest grabbing a couple hours to read through this gem. One caution: Minsky wants the reader to come away with the idea that chemistry and neurology can ultimately lead to self-consciousness, but don't take this in any way to mean a diminishment of the value of consciousness. In fact, this is exactly one of his points! Unintelligent, automatic, and unconscious neurons, when merged into larger and larger societies can lead to consciousness, but understanding the building blocks of consciousness is not the same as explaining the experience of consciousness.

Minsky assumes that a ""mind"" is not a single, efficient decision-making machine, but a collection of many such machines, which he calls agents. Each agent, on its own, is simple and specialized, but through a process of cooperation and competition with one another, the agents form a collective understanding of the world. This gives rise to an emergent intelligence guided by preprogrammed assumptions, but not constrained by them.Minsky writes with a disarming simplicity, using the whimsical but versatile example of a child playing with building blocks to illustrate his points. How does a child's brain manage the many parallel, interrelated tasks inherent in such play, from fine motor control, to hand-eye coordination, to physical intuition, to forming structural knowledge from experience, to remaining motivated amid competing desires, to deciding when to knock the block towers down? Each chapter is a self-contained one or two page essay, exploring a different facet of how a network of separate, co-evolved agents might implement decision-making, pattern-recognition, task delegation, memory, learning, and problem-solving."

I approached the book with a certain optimism that I'd be presented with a series of arguments delimited by supporting behavioral or neurological studies, but the latter part held an unfortunately small share of the narrative. Furthermore, the author has based most of his ideas on a hierarchical characterization of agencies in the brain, which seems to indicate a top-down approach to analyzing the mind against which he himself repeatedly cautions the reader. Other shortcomings include the author's lack of regard for the non-linear or emergent properties of subconscious processes. For instance, apart from a passing remark in section 18.9 he never considers the role that duplication, distribution, and ""sharding"" plays in short and long-term memory and thus leaves experiments such as Lashley's unexplained.Overall, the book is an engaging read for someone looking for creatively stimulating material on the human mind, but as other reviewers have noted, someone who is looking for a less leisurely and more scientific anthology of research on the topic, might find other sources more useful.

A well articulated theory of mind, how the mind is like a machine specifically in how it operates. The idea is that the mind is a society of agents each with unique jobs that combine to do everything we do. Marvin Minsky and his colleagues were more concerned with how people engage in common sense, which is the most difficult kind, largely because we engage in it so unconsciously. You don't think about all the processes that go into picking up a cup of coffee and drinking it, but they must exist. "

Minsky's style is crisp and enjoyable, so he helps you swim through the difficult stuff.

161,0671657135,http://goodreads.com/user/show/8055854-dan,4,"Great book for the curious layman grasping at a chance to better understand how a mechanical brain can lead to a conscious mind; although, I have a sneaking suspicion that Minsky slips in a few italics here and there to empathize some of the deeper implications and complexities. I absolutely loved the layout of the text (he uses one-page chapters), and I love how he slowly builds his ideas from the ground up. Even with his ""basic"" examples, one can quickly see how complex the brain truly is (...which supports his idea that ""common sense"" can sometimes be much more complex than logical ""adult"" sense). I also love how his background automatically led him to tie in a lot of his concepts with artificial intelligence. It leaves one feeling... Can this stuff be duplicated? I have no real complaints, but I must admit that I got lost once in awhile, and a reread is a must! If you enjoy books on consciousness, thinking, AI, or even psychology, then I suggest grabbing a couple hours to read through this gem. One caution: Minsky wants the reader to come away with the idea that chemistry and neurology can ultimately lead to self-consciousness, but don't take this in any way to mean a diminishment of the value of consciousness. In fact, this is exactly one of his points! Unintelligent, automatic, and unconscious neurons, when merged into larger and larger societies can lead to consciousness, but understanding the building blocks of consciousness is not the same as explaining the experience of consciousness. Happy reading!"
162,0671657135,http://goodreads.com/user/show/16523736-slim-khezri,4,"This book reads as a collection of foundational pondering from a luminary in the field, distilled to their instructive essence. Minsky assumes that a ""mind"" is not a single, efficient decision-making machine, but a collection of many such machines, which he calls agents. Each agent, on its own, is simple and specialized, but through a process of cooperation and competition with one another, the agents form a collective understanding of the world. This gives rise to an emergent intelligence guided by preprogrammed assumptions, but not constrained by them.Minsky writes with a disarming simplicity, using the whimsical but versatile example of a child playing with building blocks to illustrate his points. How does a child's brain manage the many parallel, interrelated tasks inherent in such play, from fine motor control, to hand-eye coordination, to physical intuition, to forming structural knowledge from experience, to remaining motivated amid competing desires, to deciding when to knock the block towers down? Each chapter is a self-contained one or two page essay, exploring a different facet of how a network of separate, co-evolved agents might implement decision-making, pattern-recognition, task delegation, memory, learning, and problem-solving."
163,0671657135,http://goodreads.com/user/show/20378185-armineh-nouri,3,"Minsky's thesis on the cognitive machinery of the mind and its functional properties, brilliant as it may be in its insight, is nothing more than a series of increasingly detailed speculations. I approached the book with a certain optimism that I'd be presented with a series of arguments delimited by supporting behavioral or neurological studies, but the latter part held an unfortunately small share of the narrative. Furthermore, the author has based most of his ideas on a hierarchical characterization of agencies in the brain, which seems to indicate a top-down approach to analyzing the mind against which he himself repeatedly cautions the reader. Other shortcomings include the author's lack of regard for the non-linear or emergent properties of subconscious processes. For instance, apart from a passing remark in section 18.9 he never considers the role that duplication, distribution, and ""sharding"" plays in short and long-term memory and thus leaves experiments such as Lashley's unexplained.Overall, the book is an engaging read for someone looking for creatively stimulating material on the human mind, but as other reviewers have noted, someone who is looking for a less leisurely and more scientific anthology of research on the topic, might find other sources more useful.

164,0671657135,http://goodreads.com/user/show/71595-robert,5,"Very thought provoking, it's either brilliant or nonsense.[UPDATE: May 18, 2020]I first bought this book in 2006 because it was famous and sounded interesting but I only really skimmed thought it and couldn't really understand it.This year I decided to read it again in more detail ... and I still don't really understand it!But that's OK, I don't feel bad about not completely understanding it because I think I get what he was trying to do.These are basically some really interesting guesses about how neurons might be able to produce the high level human behavior like that we know and love.So some observations:-This book was published in 1986. More 0 years later we aren't really that much closer to understanding how low level neuronal activity leads to ""thoughts"" or even how memory works.-I think Minsky does a great job of showing how difficult it is to explain things like language and consciousness from a reductionist point of view.-The chapter that stuck in my head was his explanation of jokes. It really sounds quite plausible!"

The best part about this book is it’s one page essay format. It seems to mimic how our brain works. It skips rounds because mind does too. By the time I finished, it was pretty obvious that I have read a masterpiece. It is astonishing that the book is 20+ year old, but not even one page seems out of place. Minsky’s deduction that our mind is not a single intelligent unit rather it is a collection of small agents each one of them very simple, binary and specialized but based on cooperation & competition they form its emergent intelligence which is guided by programmed binary deductions but not constrained by it. A must read for most people with any interest in what is fast becoming a growing set of fields such as artificial intelligence , neuro-networks and neurology."

I absolutely loved the layout of the text (he uses one-page chapters), and I love how he slowly builds his ideas from the ground up. Even with his ""basic"" examples, one can quickly see how complex the brain truly is (...which supports his idea that ""common sense"" can sometimes be much more complex than logical ""adult"" sense). I also love how his background automatically led him to tie in a lot of his concepts with artificial intelligence. It leaves one feeling... Can this stuff be duplicated? I have no real complaints, but I must admit that I got lost once in awhile, and a reread is a must! If you enjoy books on consciousness, thinking, AI, or even psychology, then I suggest grabbing a couple hours to read through this gem. One caution: Minsky wants the reader to come away with the idea that chemistry and neurology can ultimately lead to self-consciousness, but don't take this in any way to mean a diminishment of the value of consciousness. In fact, this is exactly one of his points! Unintelligent, automatic, and unconscious neurons, when merged into larger and larger societies can lead to consciousness, but understanding the building blocks of consciousness is not the same as explaining the experience of consciousness.

Minsky assumes that a ""mind"" is not a single, efficient decision-making machine, but a collection of many such machines, which he calls agents. Each agent, on its own, is simple and specialized, but through a process of cooperation and competition with one another, the agents form a collective understanding of the world. This gives rise to an emergent intelligence guided by preprogrammed assumptions, but not constrained by them.Minsky writes with a disarming simplicity, using the whimsical but versatile example of a child playing with building blocks to illustrate his points. How does a child's brain manage the many parallel, interrelated tasks inherent in such play, from fine motor control, to hand-eye coordination, to physical intuition, to forming structural knowledge from experience, to remaining motivated amid competing desires, to deciding when to knock the block towers down? Each chapter is a self-contained one or two page essay, exploring a different facet of how a network of separate, co-evolved agents might implement decision-making, pattern-recognition, task delegation, memory, learning, and problem-solving."

I approached the book with a certain optimism that I'd be presented with a series of arguments delimited by supporting behavioral or neurological studies, but the latter part held an unfortunately small share of the narrative. Furthermore, the author has based most of his ideas on a hierarchical characterization of agencies in the brain, which seems to indicate a top-down approach to analyzing the mind against which he himself repeatedly cautions the reader. Other shortcomings include the author's lack of regard for the non-linear or emergent properties of subconscious processes. For instance, apart from a passing remark in section 18.9 he never considers the role that duplication, distribution, and ""sharding"" plays in short and long-term memory and thus leaves experiments such as Lashley's unexplained.Overall, the book is an engaging read for someone looking for creatively stimulating material on the human mind, but as other reviewers have noted, someone who is looking for a less leisurely and more scientific anthology of research on the topic, might find other sources more useful.

It's not enough to learn a lot; one also has to MANAGE what one learns. Those masters have, beneath the surface of their mastery, some special knacks of ""higher-order"" expertise, which help them organize and apply the thing they learn. It is those hidden tricks of mental management that produce the systems that create those works of genius. Why do certain people learn so many more and better skills? These all-important differences could begin with early accidents...But if the second child persists in seeking better ways to learn, they can lead to silent growth in which some better ways to learn may lead to better ways to learn HOW TO LEARN. Then later, we'll observe an awesome, qualitative change, with no apparent cause -- and give to it some empty name like talent, aptitude, or gift.Finally, an awful thought, perhaps what we call genius is rare because our evolution works without respect for individuals. Could any tribe or culture endure in which each individual discovered novel ways to think? If not, how sad, since the genes for genius might then lead not to nurturing, but frequent weeding-out.""- 9.1 WANTING AND LIKING""The surer you are that you like what you are doing, the more completely your other ambitions are being suppressed.""- 9.3 LEARNING FROM FAILURE""Naturally, we tend to prefer learning from success rather than from failure.

I absolutely loved the layout of the text (he uses one-page chapters), and I love how he slowly builds his ideas from the ground up. Even with his ""basic"" examples, one can quickly see how complex the brain truly is (...which supports his idea that ""common sense"" can sometimes be much more complex than logical ""adult"" sense). I also love how his background automatically led him to tie in a lot of his concepts with artificial intelligence. It leaves one feeling... Can this stuff be duplicated? I have no real complaints, but I must admit that I got lost once in awhile, and a reread is a must! If you enjoy books on consciousness, thinking, AI, or even psychology, then I suggest grabbing a couple hours to read through this gem. One caution: Minsky wants the reader to come away with the idea that chemistry and neurology can ultimately lead to self-consciousness, but don't take this in any way to mean a diminishment of the value of consciousness. In fact, this is exactly one of his points! Unintelligent, automatic, and unconscious neurons, when merged into larger and larger societies can lead to consciousness, but understanding the building blocks of consciousness is not the same as explaining the experience of consciousness. Happy reading!"
252,0671657135,http://goodreads.com/user/show/16523736-slim-khezri,4,"This book reads as a collection of foundational pondering from a luminary in the field, distilled to their instructive essence. Minsky assumes that a ""mind"" is not a single, efficient decision-making machine, but a collection of many such machines, which he calls agents. Each agent, on its own, is simple and specialized, but through a process of cooperation and competition with one another, the agents form a collective understanding of the world. This gives rise to an emergent intelligence guided by preprogrammed assumptions, but not constrained by them.Minsky writes with a disarming simplicity, using the whimsical but versatile example of a child playing with building blocks to illustrate his points. How does a child's brain manage the many parallel, interrelated tasks inherent in such play, from fine motor control, to hand-eye coordination, to physical intuition, to forming structural knowledge from experience, to remaining motivated amid competing desires, to deciding when to knock the block towers down? Each chapter is a self-contained one or two page essay, exploring a different facet of how a network of separate, co-evolved agents might implement decision-making, pattern-recognition, task delegation, memory, learning, and problem-solving."
253,0671657135,http://goodreads.com/user/show/20378185-armineh-nouri,3,"Minsky's thesis on the cognitive machinery of the mind and its functional properties, brilliant as it may be in its insight, is nothing more than a series of increasingly detailed speculations. I approached the book with a certain optimism that I'd be presented with a series of arguments delimited by supporting behavioral or neurological studies, but the latter part held an unfortunately small share of the narrative. Furthermore, the author has based most of his ideas on a hierarchical characterization of agencies in the brain, which seems to indicate a top-down approach to analyzing the mind against which he himself repeatedly cautions the reader. Other shortcomings include the author's lack of regard for the non-linear or emergent properties of subconscious processes. For instance, apart from a passing remark in section 18.9 he never considers the role that duplication, distribution, and ""sharding"" plays in short and long-term memory and thus leaves experiments such as Lashley's unexplained.Overall, the book is an engaging read for someone looking for creatively stimulating material on the human mind, but as other reviewers have noted, someone who is looking for a less leisurely and more scientific anthology of research on the topic, might find other sources more useful.

254,0671657135,http://goodreads.com/user/show/71595-robert,5,"Very thought provoking, it's either brilliant or nonsense.[UPDATE: May 18, 2020]I first bought this book in 2006 because it was famous and sounded interesting but I only really skimmed thought it and couldn't really understand it.This year I decided to read it again in more detail ... and I still don't really understand it!But that's OK, I don't feel bad about not completely understanding it because I think I get what he was trying to do.These are basically some really interesting guesses about how neurons might be able to produce the high level human behavior like that we know and love.So some observations:-This book was published in 1986. More 0 years later we aren't really that much closer to understanding how low level neuronal activity leads to ""thoughts"" or even how memory works.-I think Minsky does a great job of showing how difficult it is to explain things like language and consciousness from a reductionist point of view.-The chapter that stuck in my head was his explanation of jokes. It really sounds quite plausible!"

The best part about this book is it’s one page essay format. It seems to mimic how our brain works. It skips rounds because mind does too. By the time I finished, it was pretty obvious that I have read a masterpiece. It is astonishing that the book is 20+ year old, but not even one page seems out of place. Minsky’s deduction that our mind is not a single intelligent unit rather it is a collection of small agents each one of them very simple, binary and specialized but based on cooperation & competition they form its emergent intelligence which is guided by programmed binary deductions but not constrained by it. A must read for most people with any interest in what is fast becoming a growing set of fields such as artificial intelligence , neuro-networks and neurology."

The book doesn't shy away from speculation, but the author always makes clear what is an idea and what science actually knows.Since the book is about building minds from the ground up, it covers ideas in computer science, psychology, language, child development, humor, spatial reasoning, religion, and much more.

Minsky himself call this a ""story for the imagination"" more than a work of science and quite a story it is! Fascinating, instructive, and eye-opening all at once. Written more than thirty years ago one will find things to quibble with (""no computer has yet been programmed to recognize a human face"") but it's the overall thesis that delights and enlightens.

Each agent, on its own, is simple and specialized, but through a process of cooperation and competition with one another, the agents form a collective understanding of the world. This gives rise to an emergent intelligence guided by preprogrammed assumptions, but not constrained by them.Minsky writes with a disarming simplicity, using the whimsical but versatile example of a child playing with building blocks to illustrate his points. How does a child's brain manage the many parallel, interrelated tasks inherent in such play, from fine motor control, to hand-eye coordination, to physical intuition, to forming structural knowledge from experience, to remaining motivated amid competing desires, to deciding when to knock the block towers down? Each chapter is a self-contained one or two page essay, exploring a different facet of how a network of separate, co-evolved agents might implement decision-making, pattern-recognition, task delegation, memory, learning, and problem-solving."
283,0671657135,http://goodreads.com/user/show/20378185-armineh-nouri,3,"Minsky's thesis on the cognitive machinery of the mind and its functional properties, brilliant as it may be in its insight, is nothing more than a series of increasingly detailed speculations. I approached the book with a certain optimism that I'd be presented with a series of arguments delimited by supporting behavioral or neurological studies, but the latter part held an unfortunately small share of the narrative. Furthermore, the author has based most of his ideas on a hierarchical characterization of agencies in the brain, which seems to indicate a top-down approach to analyzing the mind against which he himself repeatedly cautions the reader. Other shortcomings include the author's lack of regard for the non-linear or emergent properties of subconscious processes. For instance, apart from a passing remark in section 18.9 he never considers the role that duplication, distribution, and ""sharding"" plays in short and long-term memory and thus leaves experiments such as Lashley's unexplained.Overall, the book is an engaging read for someone looking for creatively stimulating material on the human mind, but as other reviewers have noted, someone who is looking for a less leisurely and more scientific anthology of research on the topic, might find other sources more useful.

More 0 years later we aren't really that much closer to understanding how low level neuronal activity leads to ""thoughts"" or even how memory works.-I think Minsky does a great job of showing how difficult it is to explain things like language and consciousness from a reductionist point of view.-The chapter that stuck in my head was his explanation of jokes. It really sounds quite plausible!"
285,0671657135,http://goodreads.com/user/show/68040822-abhishek-kumar,5,"A great and obviously influential account from father of AI Marvin Minsky, since these affected the next 30 years of work in Machine learning, AI and continues to do so even today. The best part about this book is it’s one page essay format. It seems to mimic how our brain works. It skips rounds because mind does too. By the time I finished, it was pretty obvious that I have read a masterpiece. It is astonishing that the book is 20+ year old, but not even one page seems out of place. Minsky’s deduction that our mind is not a single intelligent unit rather it is a collection of small agents each one of them very simple, binary and specialized but based on cooperation & competition they form its emergent intelligence which is guided by programmed binary deductions but not constrained by it. A must read for most people with any interest in what is fast becoming a growing set of fields such as artificial intelligence , neuro-networks and neurology."

287,0671657135,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1550470-matthew-kowalski,5,"This book was a joy, an all-around good book on the philosophy of the mind and psychology.The essays were play, and we would interact with it as to enjoy the book delightfully. Each page an essay, all of the essays building a chorus a thema.Though neuroscience and computation have spoken to his conversation, it would be certain that so many people are playing with the information that much good could come of it and it has.Though computers themselves have started to present humanity with problems it would have never imagined without them.Though I do not know if many have started to see their implications on things such as work or wealth.Though technology can address these problems as well, but we must always address the questions of our humanity."
288,0671657135,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4169563-gary-hoffman,5,"It's been years since I've come across a book so full of ideas and thought provoking topics. The author's writing is crystal clear as he builds a vocabulary and set of symbols to present ideas about how minds might work. The book doesn't shy away from speculation, but the author always makes clear what is an idea and what science actually knows.Since the book is about building minds from the ground up, it covers ideas in computer science, psychology, language, child development, humor, spatial reasoning, religion, and much more. On nearly every page I found something to mark in the margins, ideas I wanted to come back to later and ponder more deeply.This is a profound, idea-filled book, well worth multiple readings."
289,0671657135,http://goodreads.com/user/show/15515752-to-c,4,"What a marvelous look into our brains and our minds. While many of the concepts of this book have made it into our collective consciousness since it was written diving into it in full force illuminates them to much greater degree. Minsky himself call this a ""story for the imagination"" more than a work of science and quite a story it is! Fascinating, instructive, and eye-opening all at once. Written more than thirty years ago one will find things to quibble with (""no computer has yet been programmed to recognize a human face"") but it's the overall thesis that delights and enlightens. Having read it in bits and pieces over more than a year I need to put it back on my ""to be read"" shelf and take it all in at once."
290,0671657135,http://goodreads.com/user/show/30350-swartie,5,"Marvin Minsky is a co-founder of the AI LAB at MIT. His theory on intelligence and the mind is the closest to mine of any other author I have read. His theory is a bit disorganized and some parts are irrelevant, but I believe he captures in this book some of the core elements that are responsible for creating the end result of human thought. Highly recommended reading."
291,0671657135,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7964603-mensch,3,"This book has clearly influenced a (technological) generation past its publication. ""The Society of Mind"" almost seems like a manifesto due to it's restriction of one essay section per page. Minsky avoids using complex examples and uses very simple analogies to explain his theory of how the mind could work. The insistence on using only the most basic examples makes it hard to keep on reading sometimes though, but after shedding the incidental feeling of: ""Oh there is the Builder again"" the book is a rewarding read."
292,0671657135,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2742743-brian,4,"This book is deceptively difficult...brilliantly set up and each 1 page 'chapter' builds on itself - which is sorta how M Minski suggests the structure of the mind is arranged, so the structure of the book is no coincidence...excellent insight on how we know, learn and remember... how we make decisions and in general, how intelligence arises from unintelligent elements of our brains. Or to put it more succinctly, how a mind forms from brains....as Minski stated, a mind is simply what a brain does."
293,0671657135,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3142930-doug,5,"An amazing book I've been meaning to read for some time. A well articulated theory of mind, how the mind is like a machine specifically in how it operates. The idea is that the mind is a society of agents each with unique jobs that combine to do everything we do. Marvin Minsky and his colleagues were more concerned with how people engage in common sense, which is the most difficult kind, largely because we engage in it so unconsciously. You don't think about all the processes that go into picking up a cup of coffee and drinking it, but they must exist. "
294,0671657135,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1272349-neven,4,"A book like no other. 270 one-page essays carefully outlining Minsky's theory of the mind. These range in topic and complexity from casual anecdotes and folk reasoning to dense, neologism-laden academic work. Minsky's style is crisp and enjoyable, so he helps you swim through the difficult stuff. It all feels like a text whose aphoristic tone and broad scope will reward each return to it, saying more than it seems to say at first. "
295,0671657135,http://goodreads.com/user/show/17069628-m,3,"A well written general theoretical foundation for cognition as an outcome of multiple interacting agents. This is an important volume, particularly for laymen. It has been a while. I should re-read it. The AI field and particular researchers have since experienced the range of outlooks, from enthusiastic surety to ""this will never work"" and, as current sci-tech press indicates, back to renewed hope (at least with respect to systems that learn by interacting with their environments). "
296,0671657135,http://goodreads.com/user/show/19211735-alex-v,5,"Of my top 1o books ever. A very unique way of thinking, and the style in which it is written gives you time to let certain ideas stick in your mind. It also teaches you the first steps taken in the path of AI research. The way people were thinking and the approaches. It is almost written as a manual. Each couple of pages gives a new concept. The organisation in this way creates distinct components to ponder on, to efficiently digest."
297,0671657135,http://goodreads.com/user/show/59025013-dari,3,"Good book, of significant historical importance in the cognitive science but Minski's endeavors are based on introspection and not on experimental hard facts. It thus pales when compared to recent (2000+) books. It is admirable however how much of the current knowledge on cognition Minski got right."
298,0671657135,http://goodreads.com/user/show/10360474-owen,3,"This book contained many insightful ideas but I found it very slow going. Worth a read if you're already interested in how a conscious mind could be built out of smaller, nonconscious parts, and if you don't mind bearing with the author on long speculations using ill-defined vocabulary (I still can't tell you what a ""K-line"" actually is)."
299,0671657135,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1455178-cd,4,"A fundamental and watershed work. Minsky in this work introduced the general population beyond a narrow segment of academia to a new way of addressing the issues of thought and organic function. A must read for most people who have any interest in what is now a growing set of fields including neurobiology, the neural science, modern neurology, etc."
