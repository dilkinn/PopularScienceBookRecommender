 In the past few decades, medical science has rendered obsolete centuries of experience, tradition, and language about our mortality and created a new difficulty for mankind: how to die.
Being Mortal is completely irrelevant for any readers who do not have elderly relations, do not know anyone who is old or in failing health, and do not themselves expect to become old. Otherwise, this is must-read stuff. Life may be a journey, but all our roads, however long or short, whether express, local or HOV, whether traversed by foot, burro, bus, SUV, monster truck or Star Trek transporter, converge on the same destination, and the quality of those last few miles is something we should all be concerned about.
 Old age is not a battle. Old age is a massacre.
 Atul Gawande, as a doctor, has had considerable exposure to issues of death and dying, but when his father was diagnosed with brain cancer, Gawande was motivated to look into how end of life care was being handled across the board. Being Mortal is the distillation of what he learned. Atul Gawande - photo by Aubrey Calo – From Gawande’s siteWhat we have today is the medicalization of old age. It has not always been thus. Instead of embracing the circle of life, we have bent and twisted it until it looks like a Möbius strip. Facing the fact that we are all going to die is certainly not a fun notion, but neither is believing we can extend our so-called lives indefinitely. There really is such a thing as quality of life, and probably should be a thing called quality of death as well. 
… hope is not a plan, and in fact we find from our trials that we are literally inflicting therapies on people that shorten their lives and increase their suffering, out of an inability to come to good decisions. - Gawande - from the Frontline segmentPeople have priorities besides just living longer. The percentage of the population that is elderly is rising dramatically as boomers enter their (our) golden years. So how is the medical profession preparing to meet the booming demand for geriatric care? With the same gusto as a Republican legislature faced with a crumbling infrastructure. They are cutting back. I picture a cinematic bandit with a white coat under his bandolier, ""We doan need no steenking geriatricians."" The reality is not far from this.
 Although the elderly population is growing rapidly, the number of certified geriatricians the medical profession has put in practice has actually fallen in the United States by 25 percent between 1996 and 2010...Partly, this has to do with money--incomes in geriatrics and adult primary care are among the lowest in medicine. And partly, whether we admit it or not, a lot of doctors don’t like taking care of the elderly.
Gawande tracks the history of late-life care from the poorhouse to the hospital to the nursing home to the range of options currently available, providing information of the benefits and shortfalls of each. Assisted care comes in for a lot of attention. 
 policy planners assumed that establishing a pension system would end poorhouses, but the problem did not go away. In America, in the years following the passage of the Social Security Act of 1935, the number of elderly in poorhouses refused to drop. States moved to close them but found they could not. The reason old people wound up in poorhouses, it turned out, was not just that they didn’t have money to pay for a home. They were there because they’d become too frail, sick, feeble, senile, or broken down to take care of themselves anymore, and they had nowhere else to turn for help. Pensions provided a way of allowing the elderly to manage independently as long as possible in their retirement years. But pensions hadn’t provided a plan for that final, infirm stage of mortal life.
There comes a point at which one passes from being elderly to being frail and the range of options narrows. Gawande asks, “What does it mean to be good at taking care of people whose problems we cannot fix?” When does the need for safety leap past a person’s need for independence? There are various levels of care offered at different sorts of facilities. Some people can remain at home for a long time if they have a bit of help. Nursing homes are heavily medical, assisted care facilities more independence oriented. And there are plenty of variations on each. Gawande looks at several variations on assisted living facilities, noting the strengths and weaknesses. I found this extremely interesting. He also looks at some techniques that can make assisted living more tolerable, adding flora and fauna for residents to take care of for example, things like different sorts of physical layouts. One of these reminded me very much of my daughter’s erstwhile college dorm setup. Point being that there is a spectrum and beginning from understanding the patient/resident needs and desires in the context of physical and medical limitations can inform the choices to be made. All too often these decisions are made without considering the impact on or getting input from the person most affected.Being Mortal looks at trends in the impact of using all available means to keep people alive, and how that affects someone’s final days. When is the right time to stop treatment? How much is too much? When is the right time to die? It used to be that, when it was time, one’s final days were spent at home, with family. These days, they are likelier to be spent in an institution of some sort, and as likely as not, entail the patient being hooked up to sundry tubes, wires and flashing, beeping devices. It is important to identify exactly what it is that a person wants, or fears most, as a basis for decision-making. If your needs are minimal it speaks to one set of decisions. If your needs are more substantial, it speaks to another. One person said that as long as he could watch football and eat chocolate ice cream, life would be worth living. (There is no way he is a Jets fan) Others have a more extensive list of must-haves in order to make life worth living. It does lead one to consider what your list might include. For me, watching baseball would definitely figure in. Being able to read and write, to communicate would be necessary. What if you couldn't clean yourself? What if you could only have food through tubes? How much pain could you live with, and what measures would be acceptable to ameliorate it? What would keeping me alive cost? And how much is too much? All these questions figure into deciding the appropriate level of care. One fascinating section here had to do with hospice care, which need not take place in a hospice building. That was news to me. And it is a revelation how such care impacts patients. One of the significant points of the book is that planning is paramount. Have those difficult conversations. Talk about what you want for yourself, if your care is at issue, or what your parent/friend/spouse/relation wants well before one is in a crisis situation. It may be uncomfortable, but it is hugely important. In fact, this book is hugely important. Being Mortal offers not just a fascinating look at the history of late life care and living options, it not only offers a review of what is happening out there in the field of facilities for the frail and in the theories of how to approach late life care, it not only offers sage advice on planning for eventualities that we must all face sooner or later, it does all these things with humor and clarity, the bookish equivalent of an excellent bed-side manner. It is a fast read, too, useful if time is short. I would strongly suggest adding Gawande’s book to your bucket list, before…you know… it gets kicked. This is must-read stuff.

I just simply say:If you think you might get older as time goes by and/or think you might even die at some time (or have relatives or other loved ones to whom this might apply), I urge you to read this book. And if you happen to be over 50 (or care about someone over 50), read this book now.--You heard me. I said NOW!For more detailed evaluations and descriptions of this book, I recommend to read the following reviews:Will Byrnes's review: https://www.goodreads.com/review/show...Cheryl's review: https://www.goodreads.com/review/show...Michael's review: https://www.goodreads.com/review/show...Debbie ""DJ"" Wilson's review: https://www.goodreads.com/review/show...Rebecca Foster's review: https://www.goodreads.com/review/show...Elyse's review: https://www.goodreads.com/review/show...Laura Leaney's review: https://www.goodreads.com/review/show...Correen's review: https://www.goodreads.com/review/show...James Barker's review:https://www.goodreads.com/review/show...HBalikov's review:https://www.goodreads.com/review/show...Mary's review:https://www.goodreads.com/review/show..."
2,0805095152,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1826682-trish,5,"10/27/17 The most remarkable discussion of this book takes place between Atul Gawande and Kristin Tippett in the 10/26/17 podcast posted on the OnBeing website. In the discussion we learn that Gawande went to medicine through politics which may not surprise some of you. I had a radical insight as I listened: that doctors, by oath, are meant to provide life-giving care to rich and poor alike, without discrimination. Does that lead almost directly to the discussion about whether healthcare is a right? You would think doctors, in that case, would be liberal to a person. That they are not means there is a skew in the process somewhere--possibly in the numbers of doctors the AMA allows to be certified. ------------------------------""The only way death is not meaningless is to see yourself as part of something greater: a family, a community, a society. If you don’t, mortality is only a horror.""My great aunt lived to be 102 years old. She would often say, looking at the younger generations, ""It’s wonderful to get old."" Gawande touches on this in his memoir chronicling the death of his father and in his discussion of dying well. Older folks have more moments they classify as happy than do younger folks. Oldsters generally experience less anxiety, too, perhaps from having “seen it all before,” but perhaps also because they know bad times do pass. Usually.I still think my great aunt was being just a little facetious, since the rest of Gawande’s book tells us pretty explicitly that old age is not for wimps. In fact, as Elizabeth Gilbert suggested in her novel The Signature of All Things, we do better when we turn towards “the great changes that life brings” rather than turn our wills away. Gawande tells us how it is possible in some cases to choose less treatment rather than more when faced with life-threatening illness and experience a better quality of life in our final days. This is pretty grim stuff but Gawande is graceful, as graceful as he can be when the choices are so limited and so frankly horrible. When a loved one (or we ourselves) must make choices, it is wise, he counsels, to ask ourselves a few questions: What do we fear most? What do we want most to be able to do? What can/can’t we live without? What will we sacrifice so that we can accomplish what it is we want? Our choices may change as circumstances change, so one has to revisit occasionally, to make sure we (and our family and our doctors) are proceeding along the path we have chosen for ourselves.It is almost, but perhaps not quite, enough to make one wish for a sudden, early death. We all must go through it, so we’re not alone. It’s just that medical knowledge, technology, and skill can do only so much, and after that we still have to face the inevitable. Gawande gives lots of examples of patients and of people he has known who have these choices thrust upon them. On balance, he concludes, those who accept, rather than thoughtlessly fight, a terminal prognosis have a better death.This book is worth reading, maybe more so before you need it. Filling out the hospital’s required “health care directive” is actually difficult unless you have someone like this to explain what it actually means. No intervention may mean weeks instead of months; it may also mean calm instead of recovering from radical surgery. It may just be unbearably depressing. I get that.One interesting study Gawande talks about is one in which people who know their time horizons are short, or who experience life-threatening conditions (e.g., living in a war zone, 9/11, surviving a tsunami) change their view of what they want out of life, their ""hierarchy of needs"" as defined by Maslow. People with unlimited horizons put a high premium on growth and meeting people who are interesting and influential. Those with foreshortened horizons look to their closest friends and family for sustenance and comfort. War zones may not grant you friends or family, but certainly intense, highly-charged, and memorable relationships result from them. Little is expected, much is granted. And I guess that is key. There is more generosity to go around when one is in the final days and it may be best not to occlude that blessing with a confusion of treatments that do not mean a better life.Gawande addresses some of the most difficult questions we have to decide in a lifetime. It is not easy to read. But it helps, I think, to know what choices we can make when the time comes for someone we love or for ourselves.---------------------------------------------Months later.I have been thinking about the first quote I put at the beginning of my review since I read it. I wonder if that is not quite right. It is not mortality that is a horror if one is not part of a larger group. It is life itself."
3,0805095152,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1237196-petra-x,5,This is brilliant. I'm having a good run of 5* books at the moment. Atul Gawande refers several times to The Death of Ivan Ilych so now I have to read that. I like it how one book leads to another sometimes. 
4,0805095152,http://goodreads.com/user/show/597461-elyse-walters,5,"Update: $3.99 kindle download today. If you missed this book… And I can’t imagine that many people have missed reading it..... it’s an extraordinary book to read. I’ve been a fan of Atul Gawande since reading “Complications” with my local book club many years back --where 35 people showed up to 'express'. Our monthly Saturday's meetings are limited to 25 members of our 500+ Bay Area Book club --but members were didn't care --they were coming! After finding extra chairs --we sat down for one of the most emotionally-connected-book club discussion to date. There must already be at least 1,000 4 and 5 star reviews on Amazon --and it that does not speak for itself by now --then I don't know what does. Even though I bought this book the day it came out --I had other reading to do (still do) -- Then my husband had his accident --(which began feelings of a trial run for some gut-facing-facts-of-life). Plus, last year I was diagnosed with 'two' autoimmune diseases -- which I know damn well I struggle with it silently and privately while I also hippity-hop out into the world each day. Yet, I'm at peace --(come concerns;I'm not a total saint) --but life doesn't hurt as much as when I was a ""young-strong-lean-mean-muscle-fighting-the-world-machine"". Several reviews have been about readers personal connection with illness and death, written with dignity, courage and deeply felt. Others were about choices for treatments and nursing homes, and our healthcare system. One reviewer reminds us, ""EVERYONE WHO IS GOING TO DIE SHOULD READ THIS BOOK"". ALL REVIEWS I'VE READ HAVE BEEN FIRST RATE ....(written with feelings of passion)Since Atul Gawande always seems to have balance in his books --(life, love, and loss)--I want to share something positive written about aging. And , please, read other reviews --and I also can't stress strong enough.: Atul has written a searingly honest book. He lets us see the impact of serious illness, and death, while at the same time captures the resiliency of the human spirit. Research has found: ""Far from growing unhappier, people reported more positive emotions as they age. They become less prone to anxiety, depression, and anger. They experienced trials, to be sure, and more moments of poignancy--that is, of positive and negative emotion mixed together. But overall, they found living to be more emotionally satisfying and stable experience as time passed, even as old age narrowed the lives they led."" ""Being Mortal"" is beautifully written. Atul Gawande, teaches us something important about how to live with the time we have."
5,0805095152,http://goodreads.com/user/show/19300421-bionic-jean,5,"I read this book a fortnight ago, by my brother's bedside, at a time when both he and I knew he was dying. Any book one reads in such a situation has to be absorbing, perceptive and worth the read. This one was; it was both relevant and pertinent. I read it all.""We know less and less about our patients but more and more about science.""The author of Being Mortal: Medicine and What Matters in the End is Atul Gawande. He is an eminent American surgeon and author, who conducts research into public health issues. A careful and sensitive analyst, Atul Gawande is often included in lists of top global thinkers. He has delivered Reith Lectures, held the position of director of the World Health Organisation's effort to reduce surgical deaths, and been named a Fellow for his work in investigating and articulating modern surgical practices and medical ethics. His background is partly American, partly Indian, as his parents - both also doctors - followed the Hindu religion. The family were originally Marathi people from the Maharashtra region of India. As a child however, Atul Gawande lived in Athens, Ohio, and studied at Stanford University, then read PPE (Philosophy, Politics and Economics) at Balliol College Oxford, and then did a further degree and Masters degree at Harvard Medical school. Thus both his cultural and educational background provide a diversity of approaches and in-depth knowledge for deciding issues of medical ethics.Near the very start of the book, Gawande points out that our ideas about death, and the desirability of both aging and the dying experience to be somehow controllable under a medical regime, is a very recent Western phenomenon. In India and many other countries, for time immemorial, it has been accepted that an elderly person is valued and cared for by their family, for the whole of their life.""In the past surviving into old age was uncommon, and those who did survive served a special purpose as guardians of tradition, knowledge and history. They tended to maintain their status and authority as heads of the household until death. In many societies elders not only commanded respect and obedience but also led sacred rites and wielded political power."" This line of action is not therefore pursued with any sense of condescension, duty or even simple kindness by the young. Rather it is just the way things are; it is a tradition of respect. Conversely to the modern Western ideal, the elderly held supreme power until they died, sometimes preventing younger family members from achieving what they wished, and perhaps resulting in great frustration. But they were the wise elders, they held ultimate control. Gawande gives an example of his grandfather, who rode around his property on horseback every day even after he was a hundred years old, to check that everything was in order. A modern view would hold that this was a reckless and foolish activity for someone so frail. Yet this tiny man in fragile health had all his mental faculties intact, and ruled his family in the same way he always had. The difference in perceptions is startling, and also pertains to highly developed countries, ""Whereas today people often understate their age to census takers, studies of past censuses have revealed that they used to overstate it. The dignity of old age was something to which everyone aspired.""Atul Gawande gives many such examples from his own childhood and early experience, plus a recent overview of how different countries have begun to change their perceptions, not always with good results. Invariably, extending life through medicine is seen to be progress, and often implemented too quickly. Scholars have identified the three stages of medical development which countries go through, which parallel their economic development. In extreme poverty most deaths occur in the home, as people do not have access to any professional help. As a country's economy improves and incomes rise, people begin to turn to health care systems and as a result often die in hospitals. But in the third stage, when incomes rise to their highest levels, people have the ability to become interested in the quality of their lives, and ironically choose to die at home.Yet medical intervention and treatment so often gets stuck at the second stage. This may result in people's actual choices being impaired, and decisions made without the full knowledge or understanding by all involved. This theme is part of the main thrust of the book.The author also approaches this ethical conundrum from the other end. He examines what has happened in recent years in the USA in particular, and how the medical establishment has completely monopolised the business of dying, to the extent that earlier long-established ideas and principles common to all humans, are now never even considered. He bravely cites himself as a culprit, detailing how it took him quite a few years as a practising surgeon, to begin to question whether he had the right to ride roughshod over other approaches to the question, ""What matters in the end? How can we ensure that an individual really achieves what they want at the end of their life?"" Had he made the cardinal error of surgeons; that of being so committed to extending life, that he continued to carry out procedures that in actuality extended suffering, rather than enhancing life itself? Atul Gawande gives both examples from his medical experience, plus many examples where he has investigated and interviewed those involved. The text is heavy with anecdotes and stories which illustrate his points well, making extremely interesting and accessible reading. It is not always easy to read this sorry catalogue of clinical and domestic details, however, despite Gawande's flowing prose. So often the ""experts'"" best intentions are frustrated. So often people are provided with choices but not given the information which is most helpful. So often people do not yet know the questions which they should ask; those which would serve them best. The legal phrase, ""the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth"" springs to mind. Clinicians, and those assessing care for the elderly, may well answer the questions posed. But the answers, particularly those given by doctors, if not understood in their full context, often prove to be misleading and extremely damaging for the lifestyle of the person asking. It is important to distinguish between ""person"", and ""patient"" here. Not everything can, or should, be ""fixed"" and made well. ""We make it possible for them to make it home - weaker and more impaired, though. They never return to their previous baseline.""We are human, not immortal. Dying is a natural, inevitable consequent of living. This sometimes tends to be forgotten. For example, sometimes a person in their desire to be healthy, do not properly understand that a certain operation may be extremely difficult and painful, and that at best it can only provide temporary relief; that they can never achieve the previous physical state which they desire. ""the people who opt for these treatments aren't thinking a few added months. They're thinking years. They're thinking at least they're getting that lottery ticket's chance that their disease might not even be a problem any more."" ""Ninety-nine per cent understand they're dying, but one hundred per cent hope they're not ... They still want to beat their disease.""Some people may live longer without an operation. If they are offered careful specialist help to make it the sort of life they would enjoy, they might possibly then choose this option. Even if an operation can extend their life, the quality of life afterwards may not be fully explored, before a decision to commit to the operation is made. In other cases the individuals are not elderly, but merely people who have serious enough conditions to be judged as close to the end of their life. Or perhaps the people are elderly, but not suffering especially from any serious condition, but just ""gradually falling apart"", as one doctor says. Atul Gawande describes one resident of a care home, who displays a common feeling the elderly have,""she didn't really want anyone to take care of her; she just wanted to live a life of her own. And those cheerful border guards had taken her keys and her passport. With her home went her control ... How did we wind up in a world where the only choices for the old seem to be either going down with the volcano or yielding all control over our lives?""He carefully catalogues the development of various types of care homes and hospices, pointing out in which way they are successful, and how they can also be more akin to prisons. He observes,""The sociologist Erving Goffman noted the likeness between prisons and nursing homes half a century ago in his book ""Asylums""""And in the current case study mentioned,""All privacy and control were gone. She was put in hospital clothes most of the time. She woke when they told her, bathed and dressed when they told her, ate when they told her. She lived with whomever they said she had to.""Such instances are often a result of legal rules; a standardised demand to meet prescribed standards of hygiene and safety. These are designed to protect the people in such care homes, but in fact only increase their institutionalisation, their feeling that they are living,""A life designed to be safe but empty of anything they care about.""People denied individuality will either give in apathetically, or resist in any way they can, thereby risking appearing ridiculous to those in charge,""Nursing home staff like, and approve of, residents who are ""fighters"" and show ""dignity and self-esteem"" - until these traits interfere with the staff's priorities for them. Then they are ""feisty"" ... non-cooperation - refusing the scheduled activities or medications. It's a favourite word for the aged."" The author also examines instances where elderly relatives live with their children, which often seems to be seen as a gold standard of care. Yet even when this has been a mutually agreed wish on both sides, he shows that all too frequently it has not really worked out for any individuals involved. Atul Gawande does not shy away from difficult issues. He briefly enters the debate about assisted dying (also termed ""assisted suicide"" or ""death with dignity"") which is legal in countries such as the Netherlands, Belgium and Switzerland, and certain states in the US such as Oregon, Washington and Vermont. But by far the main part of this second half is concerned with the various ways of assisting people to have the old age they would themselves choose, whether in their own adapted home with help, or by moving to a wider community such as an assisted living facility, or""something of an intermediate station between independent living and life in a nursing home."" He points out that it is a long road,""there are costs to averting our eyes from the realities. We put off dealing with the adaptations that we need to make as a society. And we blind ourselves to the opportunities that exist to change the individual experience of aging for the better,""And he charts all the progress made since the 1980's when Keren Brown Wilson, who initially had the concept, first built her home for the aged in Oregon, where they could live with freedom and autonomy, however limited they became by their physical deterioration.""The key word in her mind was ""home"". Home is the one place where your own priorities hold sway.""""People can't stop the aging of their bodies, but there are ways to make it more manageable and to avert at least some of the worst effects.""The psychologist Laura Carstensen studied the emotional experiences of a large number of people from a variety of backgrounds and ages over many years. She called her resulting hypothesis the ""socioemotional selectivity theory"". In essence this derives from the interesting conclusion that how we choose to spend our time depends on how much time we perceive ourselves to have.""When life's fragility is primed, people's goals and motives in their everyday lives shift completely. It's perspective, not age, that matters most.""Once this has been taken on board, it becomes clear that nobody can accurately prescribe for another, which activities they will choose to follow in extreme old age. Too often assumptions are made about what ""old people"" will like, and in each individual case, this may not be anywhere near the truth.In addition there is the temptation to over-protect,""Many of the things we want for those we care about are things that we would adamantly oppose for ourselves because they would infringe upon our sense of self.""My favourite anecdote from this book is that of Bill Thomas. He was a working class boy who had surprised everybody by going to Harvard Medical school. He worked as a doctor, but was also committed to a self-sustaining lifestyle, growing his own food and using solar and wind power on his homestead. He eventually accepted a position as head of a nursing home because he believed it would give him more time to develop this side of his life, rather than continuing as an Accident and Emergency hospital doctor. Yet he quickly identified the mistaken thinking behind any nursing home's regime, describing ""Three Plagues"" of nursing home existence - boredom, loneliness and helplessness. His solution, which succeeded beyond anyone's expectations, seems both ludicrous and frivolous in the extreme. He introduced two dogs, four cats and a hundred parakeets into the home; not gradually but all at once, in a chaotic mix where residents and staff alike had to think on their feet. It is extraordinary that he ever managed to get the plans approved by the various authorities! And it is even more startling that the idea was such a phenomenal success. He said to the author that,""Habit and expectations had made institutional routines and safety greater priorities than living a good life and had prevented the nursing home from successfully bringing in even one dog to live with the residents."" Atul Gawande's description of the episode is a delight from start to finish, pointing up the human components throughout, the stupefaction, the clueless, bumbling incompetence, the lack of experience - but ultimately the teamwork, laughter and joy in life which resulted from this simple ploy where someone just thought outside the box for a moment.""the effect on residents soon became impossible to ignore: the residents began to wake up and come to life ... The lights turned back on in people's eyes."" There is a fundamental need in humans for a reason to live. In the early 1970's two psychologists, Judith Rodin and Ellen Langer did a study on the difference in a nursing home between residents who were given a plant to care for, and those who were not. The difference was marked. Even such a small responsibility as caring for a plant had a measurable difference in quality of life, with residents becoming more active and alert and living longer.""the lesson seems almost Zen: you live longer only when you stop trying to live longer.""Gawande concludes,""Medicine's focus is narrow. Medical professionals concentrate on repair of health, not sustenance of the soul.""He identifies the three types of doctor. Isolating these types I could immediately assign doctors and surgeons of my own experience to the relevant category.The first is a ""paternalistic"" approach, where the doctor is a medical authority who is trying to ensure that the patient has the treatment which the doctor believes is the best for them. This is a traditional approach, and there are still quite a few doctors around who act this way.The second is almost its opposite; Atul Gawande terms it an ""informative"" approach. The doctor tells the patient the facts and figures. The rest is up to the patient to decide. This is quite a common approach nowadays.The third approach is arguably by far the best. In this the patient would have all the relevant information, but also much-needed guidance. This is termed an ""interpretative"" doctor-patient relationship, or ""shared decision-making"". The key is to determine what is important to the patient. A good question for a doctor to ask would therefore be, ""What is important to you? What are you most worried about?"" When this is made explicit, the way forward to which facts and figures would be most helpful, and thus the way to proceed, may be a lot clearer. I can personally remember instances where I have been happiest with medical matters, both for myself and for my loved ones, and in each case I would say that the professionals involved were using this ""interpretative"" technique.Much of this book is relevant, whatever country you are living in, although many of the examples given of hospices are those in the US. There is ground-breaking work being done in this area, particularly regarding assisted living and ways of assessing what people want and need at the end of their life. It has to be said though, that as I was reading the book, I was heartily glad that I live in the UK, a country with - at the moment - a superlative health service. I have to now qualify this statement, as many professionals involved make it abundantly clear that the service is crumbling. Paramedics, nurses and doctors, have all relayed statistics to me recently which mean that on paper, with the current cutbacks, things just should not work. Yet because of individuals' compassion, dedication to the job, hard work and determination, they do, at the moment. Things are on a knife-edge.I was relieved that my brother was not a statistic in a book such as this. That we - with assistance from the professionals - had been able to give him the ending to his life which, although it had come too early, was the one he desired. He was able to spend some time in a hospice, a good one too, and from there be sent home to his wonderful sea view, and continue to have dedicated hospice care at home. I was relieved that although he could take no food, and ultimately refused tube feed, the way he decided the end of his life was totally under his control. At every stage he had the choice. He was given oxygen, hydration and painkillers when required to relieve suffering. All his care was extremely kind and respectful, and he died a dignified death. According to everything I read in this book, we got it right. My brother, after successful treatment for a virulent cancer, had been actively involved on the board of the Royal Marsden - a famous London Cancer Hospital. He had also been on the committee of the Royal College of Surgeons, before his final illness. And when he saw me reading Being Mortal: Medicine and What Matters in the End, knowing of the author's work, and at the tail end of his life with only days to live, he smilingly approved. Atul Gawande is a caring, compassionate, respectful and intelligent person. Long may he continue his reflections, research, investigations - and continue writing these important books. ""Courage is strength in the face of knowledge of what is to be feared or hoped. Wisdom is prudent strength.""""All we ask is to be allowed to remain the writers of our own story. That story is ever changing. Over the course of our lives, we may encounter unimaginable difficulties. Our concerns and desires may shift. But whatever happens, we want to retain the freedom to shape our lives in ways consistent with our character and loyalties.""""I hope to face the end calmly and in my own way."""
6,0805095152,http://goodreads.com/user/show/30181442-yun,4,"Being Mortal tackles the all too uncomfortable subject of mortality, and what it means to live and die well in life's last moments. In our modern world of medicine and technology, hospitals and doctors can always do more, but is more surgery or therapy always the right step at the end of life when positive outcomes are unlikely and severe side effects are guaranteed?For me, the most eye-opening and useful parts of the book are those comparing the different types of care that someone can receive as they reach end of life, including palliative care, assisted living, nursing home, and hospice. I also appreciate that the book looks at this emotionally-distressing time from the perspective of both the person coming to the end of their life, as well as from that of their loved ones. Often, our impulse is to do everything we can to prolong life, but this book makes a strong case for quality now over quantity later, so that purpose and meaning can be preserved for as long as possible.The book did feel over-simplified though. For example, the people in here with access to all the choices were either old enough to qualify for Medicare, young with good insurance, or lucky enough to find an affordable plan that provided quality care. But in the real world, that often isn't the case. Another example is that the dying person, as well as their loved ones, were reasonable people who are self-aware and communicated openly. But when dealing with relatives, that often isn't the case.While this book is a great kicking off point for starting discussions and forming a plan, it certainly doesn't provide any concrete answers or even can act as a guide. Dying is a personal thing, fraught with perilous decisions and messy emotions, just like living is. What works for one person doesn't necessarily work for another. For such a difficult subject, I felt myself swept along in Dr. Gawande's eloquent writing and compassionate storytelling. I go away having learned a lot, but also feeling a little disappointed (unfair, I know) that this book did not provide me with more concrete answers to life's difficult questions."
7,0805095152,http://goodreads.com/user/show/8665845-debbie,4,"If you’re not afraid of dying, you’re either lucky or lying.Meanwhile, this book gave me the heebee-jeebees! Did I really need to know that as I age my aorta will get crunchy and my shrinking brain will rattle around in my skull? Or did I need to know (and perhaps forever visualize) the disgusting details of the downhill spiral of my teeth and feet, and what I’ll have to show for them? Don't worry, the author does not dwell on these things, but I do! And, oh, how I hope I'm not one of the 40% (!) who is toothless by the time I'm 85, if, of course, I live that long. And do I even want to live that long after reading this depressing book???! Johnny Depp says he wants to be on a morphine drip and just drool and nod. I’m with him. So actually, this book did help me figure out how I want to go out, if I get the choice.I guess going into this, I thought it would be a how-to book, how to not be scared of dying. Instead, I got a terrifying view of the horrors of nursing homes, terminal illness, aging, and deathbeds, and a blow-by-blow account of my bodily deterioration and decay. It is not a pretty picture. It is worse than my over-active imagination can even conjure up. Informative? Yes, in spades. And this doctor can write! Clear, captivating prose. I learned so much about how doctors and other caregivers think of and handle the elderly and terminal patients. It talked about how people cling to hope even if their case is hopeless, and how doctors are often unable to tell it to them straight. And about how doctors, despite their knowledge about the facts, often hold out hope for a miracle too. Other good stuff:-Liked the many stories of people thriving in assisted living places. The people were real, their stories fascinating in a quiet way. -The author is compassionate and has a conversational tone—very undoctor-like. -Liked learning about what hospice does exactly and about how much they can help out. -Liked that a provider had the bright idea to bring in other living things—plants, dogs, and kids—to assisted living places and loved hearing about how the residents responded so well.Stuff I didn’t like:-Too much history about assisted living, and too many pioneers mentioned by name. I get it that the author wants to give them credit, but we readers won’t remember a single one. Maybe some of this info would have better in an Acknowledgment section?-The author claims that people get more mellow with age. What? Then why are so many old people on anti-depressants and anti-anxiety meds?Stuff I wanted: -Wanted it to be more psychological.-Wanted more discussion about the fear of death, and a mention of how religion plays a part. -Wanted talk about the cost of medical care. Does insurance always pay for chemo, for example? Do families go bankrupt? How much do finances affect the decision of whether to continue with treatment?-Wanted a secret formula for shooing away the fear of death and dying. Funny, I was way more comfortable reading about young people with terminal illnesses than about old people about to die. I can handle reading about suffering that can’t happen to me; I’m calmly empathetic. But tell me about someone my age (65) or older who has just been diagnosed as terminal, and I squirm and twitch out of sight. Just give me the clicker and let me watch Louis C.K., will you? All fears and gripes aside, I know this is an important book, and it’s an amazing one. The doctor is talking about the elephant in the room, which is cathartic, depressing, and anxiety-producing all at once—you might want to have your valium handy. I do think this book will be scary to read if you're in your 60s or older. That is, unless you’re lucky or lying."
8,0805095152,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4086118-michael,5,"A clear, uplifting, and eloquent education on the deficiencies of the medical establishment in end-of-life care and promising progress toward improvements. This Boston surgeon has already authored accessible books on the human art behind the science of medicine with his “Complications” and “Better”. He is a master at using stories of his cases to address disparities between our expectations and the reality of medical practice and drawing on diverse research to advocate for needed changes. Here he delves into the tragedy of so many people at the end of their life dying in the depersonalized, institutional conditions of hospitals and nursing homes.In in his own training he was taught to see death as the enemy to fight at every step with everything in the arsenal of medicine and didn’t conceive any role for doctors in facilitating help with the dying process. He does remember a seminar in which they read Tolstoy’s “The Death of Ivan Ilyich”, which highlighted the benefits the character gained from simple, humane interactions with his servant. But that lesson was soon forgotten. Only when some of his surgical interventions came to a bad end of complications and a miserable death in the ICU did he come to consider changing how he approached his cases. For one man with cancer invading the spinal cord, he successfully removed enough to delay the onset of paralysis, but he never recovered from the procedure. Such failures led the good doctor to rethink is ingrained approaches:The chances that he would return to anything like the life he had even a few weeks earlier were zero. But admitting this and helping him cope with it seemed beyond us. We offered no acknowledgment or comfort or guidance. We just had another treatment he could undergo. Maybe something good would result. …We pay doctors give chemotherapy and to do surgery but not to take the time required to sort out when to do so is unwise. This certainly is a factor. But the issue isn’t merely a matter of financing. It arises from a still unresolved argument about what the function of medicine really is …The simple view is that medicine exists to fight death and disease, and that is, of course, its most basic task. Death is the enemy. But the enemy has superior forces. Eventually, it wins. And in a war you cannot win, you don’t want a general who fights to the point of total annihilation. You don’t want Custer. You want Robert E. Lee, someone who knows how to fight for territory that can be won and how to surrender it when it can’t, someone who understands that the damage is greatest if all you do is battle to the bitter end.In a set of brief chapters, Gawande adroitly covers innovations in making nursing homes more humane, the advent of assisted living solutions, and growth in palliative care and hospice services. Simple approaches like allowing nursing home residents have pets or opportunities to socialize with kids in a nearby afterschool program had surprisingly powerful benefits. The power of assisted living programs to preserve privacy and autonomy while fostering socialization and sense of community is illustrated with exemplary stories. From a low point of just 17% of people dying at home in the 80’s, by 2010 fully 40% were being supported at the end through hospice care, of which half involved a home location. Studies revealed that patients who stopped chemo sooner and entered hospice sooner had less suffering at the end and lived up to 25% longer. The outcome had Zen aspect in that “you live longer only when you stop trying to live longer”. Just family communication about end of life care decisions by palliative care providers had a huge impact on reducing costly ER and ICU utilization.The lesson the Gawande learned and began applying to his patients (and the situation of his own father) was to take the time to find out what gives the person a sense of meaning and purpose in life and to explore the trade-offs they are willing to make to best fulfill those goals relative to the risks of procedures aimed at giving them a longer life. But the challenge remains in every case to guide his patients on when to stop the pursuit of treatment in favor concentrating on living the best they can with what they have left. The case of a hero of mine, biologist Stephen Jay Gould, facing a fatal lung disease, mesothelioma, is telling. In an essay “The Median Isn’t the Message” he notes how variation around the median survival of 8 months included a long tail of minority cases with longer survival, a situation luck placed him with (he lived 20 years more before succumbing to an associated lung cancer):”Of course I agree with the preacher of Ecclesiates that there is a time to love and a time to die—and when my skein runs out I hope to face the end calmly and in my own way. For most situations, however, I prefer the more martial view that death is the ultimate enemy—and I find nothing reproachable in those who rage mightily against the dying of the light.”What’s wrong with looking for it? Nothing, it seems to me, unless it means we have failed to prepare for the outcome that’s vastly more probable. The trouble is that we’ve built our medical system and culture around the long tail. We’ve created a multitrillion-dollar edifice for dispensing the medical equivalent of lottery tickets—and with only the rudiments of a system to prepare patients for the near certainty those tickets will not win. Hope is not a plan, but hope is our plan.After exploring the insights of social scientists such as Goffman, Maslow, and Dworkin, he arrives at some important concepts that providers and families of the seriously ill should keep foremost in mind:Whatever the limits and travails we face, we want to retain the autonomy—the freedom—to be the authors of our lives. This is the very marrow of being human.…This is why the betrayals of body and mind that threaten to erase our character and memory remain among our most awful tortures. The battle of being mortal is the battle to maintain the integrity of one’s life—to avoid becoming so diminished or dissipated or subjugated that who you are becomes disconnected from who you were or who you want to be. Sickness and old age make the struggle hard enough. The professionals and institutions we turn to should not make it worse. But we have at last entered an era in which an increasing number of them believe their job is not to confine people’s choices, in the name of safety, but expand them, in the name of living a worthwhile life.…Most often, these days, medicine seems to supply neither Custers nor Lees. We are increasingly the generals who march the soldiers onward, saying all the while, “You let me know when you want to stop.”People die only once. They have no experience to draw on. They need doctors and nurses who are willing to have the hard discussions and say what they have seen, who will help people prepare for what is to come—and escape a warehoused oblivion that few really want."
9,0805095152,http://goodreads.com/user/show/12620745-debbie-dj,5,"This is probably the most important book on mortality I've ever read. It is packed full of information and written in easily comprehendible language, in fact, very personal language. There is so much information here I had a hard time reviewing as I want to share it all! Promise, I won't, but will try to stay with just a few important highlights.First, this book looks at nursing homes and the rise and fall of assisted living. You may think, what? We have assisted living. But, for a short time after people no longer simply died at home, assisted living, through the hard fought battles of one woman in particular was available to all patients. Now the primary goal of safety has once again given us nursing homes. Assisted living is mostly for those with the money to afford it. This need for safety has left many to languish at places no different than former asylums. This so called ""life"" is devoid of any purpose to live, and actually increases death rates.This book then goes into the medical profession. The focus here is on repair, how to fix, what medications will work, when is surgery necessary. The only problem is that the medical profession has no idea how to talk to people, and is even discouraged from doing so. Most doctors have not had a single course in geriatrics. What to do with an old person? Amazing that we have no sense of our own mortality. Now 25% of Medicare spending is for 5% in their final year of life, with very little benefit. A great quote was ""We imagine that we can wait until doctors tell us there is nothing more they can do, but rarely is there nothing more that doctors can do."" So this instance of survival at all costs has left many to die in a hospital with tubes everywhere, fading in and out of awareness. This of course leaves no chance for good-byes, even ""I'm sorry"" or ""I love you."" What it really comes down to is a few important questions. I loved the ones provided in this book. ""The biggest questions to ask are, what are your biggest fears or concerns? What goals are most important to you and what trade-offs are you willing to make, or not make?"" Another topic was hospice. I assumed hospice is only for the final end of life, but it is not. Hospice is available at any time, and the focus is on a person's wants and needs. Many get better after a stay, and leave, some even return to work!Incredible book. Atul Gawande is a physician who I believe has written a most timely and important book. He provides an inside look at medicine, a historical perspective on dying, the most recent surveys on cost and care options and so much more. He comes from his own experiences and clearly his research has changed his own outlook on mortality. A must read. Highly recommended!"
10,0805095152,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5177572-genevieve,4,"* Originally reviewed on the Night Owls Press blog here. *I was first introduced to Atul Gawande's writing in his ""Annals of Medicine"" column for The New Yorker magazine. He wrote a thrilling piece about a woman with an itch—an itch so strong, so persistent, it was beyond belief. It stumped all of her doctors. Medications didn't work. MRIs and nerve tests revealed nothing conclusive. One night, the woman woke up to fluid dripping down her face. As if in some B-horror movie, Gawande eventually reveals that she had scratched through bone, through her very own skull, into her brain. Delving into neuroscience and how our brains work and the nature of perception, Gawande wrote a piece as compelling as a forensic thriller. It wasn't just a dry reporting of medical cases and scientific findings. Gawande quoted lines from Dante's Inferno. It read like a story. Atul Gawande's Being Mortal Medicine and What Matters in the End is less an out-and-out thriller and more a personal meditation on modern medicine and how it has treated illness, aging, and dying. Being Mortal pulls back the veil on the institutions that treat the terminally ill and aging. It is a clear-eyed exploration of the sad business of dying and our bodies falling apart, taking us on a tour of gerontology, nursing homes, intensive care units, assisted-living facilities, and multigenerational homes. It is also a calm critique on medicine. He writes: ""Medical professionals concentrate on repair of health, not sustenance of the soul. ... It's been an experiment in social engineering, putting our fates in the hands of people valued more for their technical prowess than for their understanding of human needs."" Gawande's message: The experiment has failed. Twenty-first century medicine can do miraculous things. But in dealing with end-of-life issues, modern medicine has been dismal.Quality of life has been the most overlooked metric in medical treatments. The measure of success for doctors is prolonging life, even if those extra days, weeks, months are miserable and and full of pain. But according to Gawande it's not the fault of doctors or patients. It's an entire culture we've built up: how we think of and treat the elderly, how everyone expects doctors to do everything it takes, to offer and try every medical procedure possible to slow down the inevitable. And there is a lot to fear, too—not just in the inevitable—but in the choices we're given. Gawande doesn't shy away from how this topic hits close to home. His wife's grandmother and his own father are two people who are discussed intimately throughout the book. He weaves the stories about their health and decline with the stories of other patients and colleagues.When describing how his own father struggled with the decision on whether to pursue more radiation therapy for a tumor growing in his spine, Gawande dwells on the tough decisions that needed to be made. His father had already undergone surgery to treat it, but things had taken a turn for the worse. Should he pursue more aggressive chemo, knowing the debilitating side effects that would happen? It is a question that faces many families when they sit in the doctor's office and have to weigh the tradeoffs. Having choices doesn't necessarily make it easier.At the heart of the book is a searching exploration of what the basic purpose of medicine really is. What should we be paying doctors to do? Gawande writes: ""Death is the enemy. But the enemy has superior forces. Eventually, it wins. And in a war that you cannot win, you don't want a general [a doctor] who fights to the point of total annihilation."" Fight to the bitter end… sadly, that's what most people try to do.More and more, as the population in the U.S. gets older and as we live longer, we need more doctors and nurses like Gawande who will broach discussion and say what they have seen, to tell people how death in a hospital really is, how aging really is, and prepare us for what's to come. So what needs to be done? Gawande suggests several things, and the message is clear: We need more of our institutions and medical practitioners to believe that we shouldn't limit people's choices in the name of safety but expand them, in the name of living a worthwhile life. We see this in the later chapters when we meet more enlightened practitioners and how they take a more patient-centric approach rather than a paternalistic one. There is a wonderful anecdote that involves a colorful menagerie and an idealistic country doctor.While Gawande is critical and often frames his exploration of medicine in big socioeconomic and cultural terms, his arguments don't take sides. He doesn't write to bully or polarize; instead, he takes a deliberate, sometimes plodding ""middle road."" I sometimes wished he would be more scathing of some of the atrocious experiences he hears about and even witnesses. He doesn't loudly condemn bad decisions that were made in prescribing care or stripping away an elderly person's autonomy. Instead, what he is good at is to acknowledge uncertainty and ambiguity. All of us have underestimated the human element in medicine in some way. An intense, thought-provoking read that made me more mindful about life—and the march toward the inevitable.[Disclaimer: I received an ARC of this book from the publisher for an honest and candid review.

 “We’ve been wrong about what our job is in medicine. We think our job is to ensure health and survival. But really it is larger than that. It is to enable well-being.”

 ★ During one of my latest classes, the instructor divided us into groups and gave us controversial topics to discuss. My group discussed Euthanasia and although this book does not discuss that. It focuses on some of the subjects that we approached that day such as the end of life and what our job as doctors is.★ The book is very accessible to both workers in the medical field and to the general population and that is a great thing! Being Human (Smart title by the way) means that there is an end point somewhere in the future and that both of the two teams have specific roles when it comes to that.★ The author uses real life examples and scientific studies and even shares his father story with readers all over the world which is a very brave thing to do! There are things that I may have not thought about previously and this book was eye-opening to those. Some patients think that their doctors have to take choices for them while in fact it is a shared process. Also we have to know our limitations as doctors and when to stop!★ There are books that I read and forget and there are books that stays with me for a long time and shapes the way I behave and function and this is one of them! I think everyone should read this book although it can be hard and heavy but it is a fact that we can’t deny and to discuss it while we are fully functioning is better than to do it in the last hours! I recommend this for all my fellow mortal readers. 

“Our ultimate goal, after all, is not a good death but a good life to the very end.”

12,0805095152,http://goodreads.com/user/show/27709782-jen,5,"Simply put: This is a book about dying. But, on one's own terms. Gawande boldy argues that the medical world has got it wrong when it comes to the treatment of the dying. The objective of medicine should not be to ensure health and survival; rather it should be about the quality of life and what it means to die with dignity, a sense of purpose, and most importantly, control over one's life. It's about being able to write the final chapter the way you want to and to enable well-being in the sense one wishes to be alive. It's considering hospice vs emergency room care. What an unpleasant topic, but WHOA, what a relevant one! Through a series of interviews with seniors and the terminally ill, he asks them what means the most to them; what are they willing to sacrifice and what they won't, in order to extend their life a little longer. He examines how the dying were treated historically to the cultural, traditional institutionalized view we have now. Written humanely by an emergency physician who in my opinion, has got it so right. I can only hope to have a physician as intuitive and caring as he, as I shape my ending chapter. 5* read."
13,0805095152,http://goodreads.com/user/show/155663-david,5,"This excellent book is about how medicine treats patients as their lives come to an end. Today, Western medicine is all about keeping the patient alive, no matter the cost. The problem is that all too often, treatments at the end of life have limited value; they have little potential to prolong substantially, and even if they do, the quality of life is degraded significantly. Gawande, a practicing surgeon argues that the waning days of our lives ""... are spent in institutions--nursing homes and intensive care units--where regimented, anonymous routines cut us off from all the things that matter to us in life.""As the end draws near, some doctors go into an ""informational mode"". They give their patients a list of possible treatments, potential outcomes and side effects. It is really a mountain of information and very difficult for a suffering patient--or a family--to process and make a useful decision. Gawande describes a better approach. He writes about how some doctors will talk to their patients about their goals; realistic goals, given their illnesses. They take one or two hours to understand what is important to their patients, and then bring to the forefront a treatment option that will get them closest to their goals. The most important thing for every human is ""... to retain the autonomy--the freedom--to be authors of our lives. This is the very marrow of being human."" Terminally ill patients who had discussions with their doctor about end-of-life preferences were far more likely to die at peace, and to spare their family anguish.Gawande writes at length about assisted living and nursing homes. Too often, these institutions seem to believe that their primary job is safety. But, fortunately, an increasing number of these institutions ""... believe their job is not to confine people's choices, in the name of safety, but to expand them, in the name of living a worthwhile life.""So often, terminally ill cancer patients who had intensive interventions had a much worse quality of life in their last week, compared to those who did not have interventions. Moreover, six months later, their caregivers were three times more likely to suffer major depressions! So, Gawande describes the recent institution of hospice care. ""The difference between standard medical care and hospice is not the difference between treating and doing nothing .... The difference was in the priorities. In ordinary medicine, the goal is to extend life. We'll sacrifice the quality of ... existence now--by performning surgery, providing chemotherapy, putting you in intensive care--for the chance of gaining time later. Hospice deploys nurses, doctors, chaplains and social workers to help people with a fatal illness have the fullest possible lives right now ... they focus of objectives like freedom from pain and discomfort, or maintaining mental awareness for as long as feasible, or getting out with family once in a while."" Studies show that patients who choose to supplement regular oncology treatments with palliative care stopped chemotherapy sooner, entered hospice care sooner, had less suffering--and lived 25% longer!On average, doctors overestimate the time remaining for terminally ill patients by 30%. In addition, 40% of oncologists offer treatments they believe will not work! They worry about being too pessimistic, not about being too optimistic. Gawande describes experimental programs that give patients and their families a false hope. But these experimental treatments often have debilitating side effects with very little chance of working.Gawande writes that our medical system and culture is built around the ""long tail"" of an improbable long life after a cancer diagnosis. The multi-trillion dollar medical system is the equivalent of lottery tickets. The problem is the system does not ""... prepare patients for the near certainty that those tickets will not win.""Gawande adds wonderful personal touches throughout the book. Through a number of anecdotal histories, he traces the end-of-life treatments and outcomes. He even details the final months, weeks and days of his father's life. He shows clearly how much better it is for terminally ill patients to communicate with their doctor, to let their doctor understand their goals, get the right type of advice, and to understand when it is best to ""let go""."
14,0805095152,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7383561-holly,5,"Depressing, but necessary to consider and talk about. What's the one unfortunate thing everyone on this planet has in common right now? We will all eventually die one day. So knowing that eventuality, why do we not plan for and discuss how we want to spend our final years/months/weeks/days? If we are fortunate enough to go the way of a steady decline via old age, how can we maintain our enjoyment of life as we become less able to meet our own needs independently without burdening our loved ones? If faced with a terminal prognosis, how do you weigh interventions that can possibly extend quantity of life versus those that can extend quality of life? These questions and more are covered in this book, with sobering real life examples, some of which come from the author's own family. I found this book to be informative and hopefully useful at some point in the very distant future. A must read for everyone, though perhaps delay doing so if there has been a recent death in your life, as this would probably be harder to read emotionally."
15,0805095152,http://goodreads.com/user/show/279256-diane,4,"It took me months to find the courage to read this. I know it is silly to be scared of a book, but the topic of mortality is so depressing that I dreaded reading it. I had even checked out the book from the library several times, read a page or two, and then promptly returned it, thinking I would try again at some undetermined date, when I was a more evolved human being and better able to cope with illness and death and dying. (Future-Diane is very assertive and poised, apparently.) But this book continued to niggle at me. I felt obligated to read it because I suspected it could help me cope with aging relatives. And yet I resisted, weeks turning into months.The solution was found in an audiobook. I've discovered that listening to audiobooks on my daily commute is an excellent way to get into works I might otherwise not have the patience or fortitude to read.You can imagine my relief when this book turned out not to be scary at all. In fact, it was a bit bland. It begins well enough: ""I learned about a lot of things in medical school, but mortality wasn't one of them.""Modern scientific capability has profoundly altered the course of human life. People live longer and better than at any other time in history. But scientific advances have turned the process of aging and dying into medical experiences, matters to be managed by health care professionals. And we in the medical world have proved alarmingly unprepared for it.Gawande explains that historically, the elderly lived with extended families and died at home. This was the way it worked for hundreds of years. But the more a country industrializes, the more change occurs. Now the common practice in America is for the elderly to be moved into nursing homes or assisted-living places. Some still live with families, but eventually, it becomes a medical issue. Increasingly large numbers of us get to live out a full life span and die of old age. Old age is not a diagnosis. There is always some final proximate cause that gets written down on the death certificate — respiratory failure, cardiac arrest. But in truth no single disease leads to the end; the culprit is just the accumulated crumbling of one's bodily systems while medicine carries out its maintenance measures and patch jobs. We reduce the blood pressure here, beat back the osteoporosis there, control this disease, track that one, replace a failed joint, valve, piston, watch the central processing unit gradually give out. The curve of life becomes a long, slow fade.Gawande discusses the history of assisted-living places and nursing homes, and mentions research that shows ways to improve the quality of life for patients, such as giving them responsibility (taking care of a pet or plant, for example) and making sure there is enough social activity in the building. He also shares numerous stories of patients and how they coped with illness or end-of-life practices. This is where my interest started to wane -- there were just too many cases, and the book felt padded. I wondered if the whole book could have been edited down into a New Yorker-type magazine article, which would have been more efficient and effective.My favorite section was when Gawande shared the story of his father's illness, and how that was handled. His father was a respected surgeon, and when he was diagnosed with brain cancer, some profound decisions had to be made. Gawande is a good writer and is skilled at explaining medical terms and processes to the layperson. Here he also shared his personal feelings, and it was quite moving.Another good section was the advice Gawande gives on talking with patients about what their priorities are. For example, one man who was facing a serious surgery told his wife that what mattered to him was being able to watch football and eat chocolate ice cream. As long as he could still do that, he wanted the doctors to do everything they could to save his life. In another example, Gawande's father said it was still important for him to be able to visit with people, and he was scared of becoming paralyzed. Talking with someone about what they value most in life can assist with making better medical choices.I would recommend Being Mortal to those interested in reading more about end-of-life decisions. And don't be scared -- this book doesn't bite.My rating: 3.5 stars rounded up to 4Favorite Story[Gawande's father wanted his body cremated and his ashes spread in the Ganges River, which is sacred to Hindus, so a few months after his death the family traveled to Varanasi]""As the oldest male in the family, I was called upon to assist with the rituals required for my father to achieve moksha -- liberation from the endless earthly cycle of death and rebirth to ascent to nirvana. The pandit twisted a ring of twine onto the fourth finger of my right hand. He had me hold the palm-size brass urn that contained my father's ashes and sprinkle into it herbal medicines, flowers, and morsels of food: a betel nut, rice, currants, rock crystal sugar, tumeric. He then had the other members of the family do the same. We burned incense and wafted the smoke over the ashes. The pandit reached over the bow with a small cup and had me drink three tiny spoons of Ganga water. Then he told me to throw the urn's dusty contents over my right shoulder into the river, followed by the urn itself and its cap. 'Don't look,' he admonished me in English, and I didn't.""It's hard to raise a good Hindu in small-town Ohio, no matter how much my parents tried. I was not much of a believer in the idea of gods controlling people's fates and did not suppose that anything we were doing was going to offer my father a special place in any afterworld. The Ganges might have been sacred to one of the world's largest religions, but to me, the doctor, it was more notable as one of the world's most polluted rivers, thanks in part to all the incompletely cremated bodies that had been thrown into it. Knowing that I'd have to take those little sips of river water, I had looked up the bacterial counts on a Web site beforehand and premedicated myself with the appropriate antibiotics. (Even so, I developed a Giardia infection, having forgotten to consider the possibility of parasites.)""Yet I was still intensely moved and grateful to have gotten to do my part. For one, my father had wanted it, and my mother and sister did, too. Moreover, although I didn't feel my dad was anywhere in that cup and a half of gray, powdery ash, I felt that we'd connected him to something far bigger than ourselves, in this place where people had been performing these rituals for so long."""
16,0805095152,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4159922-diane-s,5,"A very eye opening book on aging, what happens as we age, and where do we go, when we can no longer take care of ourselves. This book asks some very interesting questions, makes one really think about the importance of making these decisions while one is still able. What is important to us, what are we willing to give up, are some of those questions.The writing is clear, and concise, the information extensive but not at all confusing. The people whose life's are presented are treated as real people, not just case studies. One person is very close to the author and we see all the decision making that goes into his final acceptance. Sad, yes sometimes, but we are all going to age, no matter where we live and this book covers so much. I consider it a must read, a gaining of intelligence and a new way of looking at many things. Wonderful book."
17,0805095152,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1166663-carol,0,"Highly recommended.Being Mortal: Medicine and What Matters in the EndThe final words in this title What Matters in the End could as easily be a statement as a question and sets the theme for this exploration of living and dying. Mortal we are and yet its hard to embrace this concept especially when we are closer to our end than at its beginning. It may be true that we do not know when we’re going to die but frankly some of us know it will be sooner than later. We plan for so many things in our lives yet leave this most needed planning, that of the way we wish to die, what matters in the end, left unspoken, left undone. Atul Gawande is to be commended for sharing stories of his patients and family as they seek the answers to the questions of life’s final moments. As a doctor he felt he was treating the illness but not the person, often afraid to say there is nothing more I can do for you. By changing the way he saw his role he came to the understanding that medications and operations may not be the best course of treatment but that he could continue in other ways to help his patients. He learned that it is important to talk to with his patients, ask questions, and most of all to listen. The patient first but also the family needs to be heard. Gawande learned to ask these four questions of those in his care:What is your understanding of the situation and its potential outcomes?What are your fears and what are your hopes?What trade-offs are you willing to make and not willing to make?What is the course of action that best serves this understanding?Ask yourself these. Can you answer them honestly? Do you think they might change as your situation does?I can only hope if I were ill that someone would ask me the first two questions. The third and fourth are harder to answer. One patient of Gawande’s answered that if he could eat chocolate ice cream and watch football he would be happy. These were his trade-offs that sound simple and yet even these two small things might be more complicated than one would think. Being Mortal it is not an easy book to read but there is hope and even laughter in its pages. There is also optimism in our approach to assisted living choices, hospice care and our living with our elderly. Besides giving me some food for thought regarding my own priorities Being Mortal will open new discussion with my husband regarding his, and ease the road to discussion of our plan with our children. Surprisingly reading Being Mortal provided a better understanding and an easing of the guilt associated with seeing my parents through their ending days. This knowledge hopefully will lead to discussion with my family of what matters to me and should make their lives easier. As I age one paramount consideration is where the next home may be and just what I am seeking in this experience. This could change quickly and I need to keep up with what’s available. I was very interested in the pioneering independent or assisted living models Dr. Gawande mentions. If you’ve ever been part of choosing one of these you will know how important this decision is and how often choices are limited. Reading about what Bill Thomas was able to achieve in a nursing home (THe Eden Alternative) in New Berlin, NY in 1991 was so uplifting. There is a whole chapter dedicated to this. Picture plants, children, dogs, cats, and 100 parakeets all living in harmony with the residents here. Might not work everywhere but what a concept. I want a place where I can live, not vegetate. One major point I took from this was that we often visit these facilities thinking we are choosing for our loved ones without really considering their needs. We look at the convenience for us. I don’t think we mean to do this but it has given me a heads-up awareness. There are many excellent reviews of Being Mortal on GoodReads and of course, elsewhere. The reading of these has prompted further contemplation and has pointed out things I might have missed. For this I thank the readers who share so much here.  "
18,0805095152,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3536004-jenna,4,"Not many of us relish the idea of growing old, our bodies slowly breaking down, becoming weaker and weaker. Losing your teeth and your eye sight dimming. Having aches and pains and trouble getting out of bed. Your memory and thought processes declining, becoming less and less clear. There is not much fun in this and yet far fewer of us would prefer the alternative -- to not age, to die young. Depressing but important and informative, Being Mortal: Medicine and What Matters in the End is about the aging process and our mortality. Dr. Atul Gawande discusses what happens as we age and how we in the West treat the elderly. He argues that quality of life should be the medical profession's aim. When there is no cure for a person, why use every possible treatment to prolong a person's life at the expense of the quality of the time they have left? He calls for a change in how we handle old age and the end of life in order to cause less suffering, even if it means the person will have a few months fewer to live. Doctors, not wanting to admit defeat, will often recommend procedures and surgeries that will cause no small amount of suffering. The patients and their families, thinking there is some hope after all, often agree to these treatments. Instead, we should aim to lessen suffering, and to allow people to die with as much dignity as possible. This book really opened my eyes to what it's like to be in a nursing home. For most patients, they are basically a prison. Unfortunately, many people become unable to stay at home alone or to take care of all their own basic needs and end up in one. Dr. Gawande discusses alternative homes and hospice, which are much more compassionate and that let the elderly feel more comfortable. I could have done with fewer human interest stories and more facts, as he talks about many individuals and relates their stories. There was quite a bit of repetition because of this and so I think maybe 3 or 4 people's stories would have been sufficient. I loved all the facts, depressing as they are. Unless we die young, we are all going to one day become old. Our bodies and brains will deteriorate, weakening and worsening until we finally succumb to death. Not much fun about that. However, thinking about these things ahead of time, we can prepare for the time when we no longer can take care of ourselves. We also can become more compassionate towards those who are already elderly. We can change how we treat them, becoming more compassionate in the process.This is an important book for all of us to read, but don't expect to feel an overabundance of joy whilst doing so."
19,0805095152,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3236194-caroline,5,"***NO SPOILERS***The average lifespan of human beings today is around age 80, which means Being Mortal is an essential read for everyone. Cancer is the second leading cause of death in the U.S., and that also makes Being Mortal an essential read for everyone. Even if someone isn’t  affected by the infirmities of old age or by cancer, at some point she’ll likely know at least one person who is. Whatever the case, everyone dies eventually, and everyone should be properly prepared to possibly make some tough decisions. Gawande argues that medical technology has serious limitations in its ability to improve, in many instances worsening instead. He builds the book around these uncomfortable facts of life.Something that makes Being Mortal outstanding is how feeling it is. In rich and loving detail, Gawande shares the stories of various elderly people (in the first half) and those dying from cancer (second half). It’s a very gradual unspooling, as he starts with interesting background information right through to their older years. His notebooks must have been overflowing with notes. These portrayals are intensely emotional and what make Being Mortal a page-turner. Here are real people whose major health dilemmas I felt keenly. It’s the furthest thing from abstract and dry, and when some of these people die, I felt the impact. I’m glad for it. Prior to reading Being Mortal, I lacked an emotional link to these issues, especially to cancer. Being Mortal changed that for me significantly. These true stories are Gawande’s jumping-off point to argue for a sea change in elder care and also end-of-life care for the terminally ill. Somehow, Gawande makes the topic of assisted living and nursing homes fascinating. Being Mortal isn’t just Gawande’s (professional) opinion, though. He devotes ample space to influential people in the fields of geriatrics, oncology, and hospice, in addition to citing relevant statistics and the latest research to support his perceptive and compelling arguments. He convinced me. Being Mortal is also well written and strategically organized. I had no hesitation sliding this onto my “important nonfiction” shelf after finishing and also don’t hesitate to recommend Being Mortal to all. This is another unexpected treasure of a nonfiction book that reads just like the most gripping fiction I’ve read. The grim subject didn’t matter to me; I picked up Being Mortal with such joy each time I had some free minutes to read. This isn’t a bland “nonfiction book about medicine.” It’s a book about everyday people and the ultimate humbling experience: a reckoning with their physical failings. I feel confident that anyone who appreciates a moving story with the most memorable characters will love Being Mortal. I’ll only say that I think timing in reading this is important, given the weighty topic. Although those caring for someone with cancer or in need of elder care will find Being Mortal extremely helpful, the book may compound any distress. For those not in this situation, I urge them to read Being Mortal as soon as possible. "
20,0805095152,http://goodreads.com/user/show/22600410-cathrine,5,"Remember the scene in The Matrix when Laurence Fishburne asks Keanu Reeves whether he wants to swallow the red pill or the blue pill? In his very excellent book Dr. Gawande uses that analogy to discuss the manner in which a physician attempts to discuss treatment options with a patient facing a life threatening/ending illness. As he points out, neither choice is really what the patient needs to hear, especially an aged one. So what about a third option? This book is his attempt to open up the uncomfortable dialog about the end of life processes most of us will have to face and why that needs to change. It is not a long or too medically technical read. It is not boring. It is written with compassion and expertise and everyone needs to read it before it becomes necessary to start the dialog with our parents, friends, or ourselves. “Our reluctance to honestly examine the experience of aging and dying has increased the harm we inflict on people and denied them the basic comfort they most need. Lacking a coherent view of how people might live successfully all the way to their very end, we have allowed our fates to be controlled by the imperatives of medicine, technology, and strangers.""Do yourself a great service and read it soon. You will not regret it, no you won’t. It is only a first step in a journey to learning how we might be in control of our own fate. As he writes:“One has to decide whether one’s fears or one’s hopes are what should matter most…that the chance to shape one’s story is essential to sustaining meaning in life...that we have the opportunity to refashion our institutions, our culture, and our conversations in ways that transform the possibilities for the last chapters of everyone’s lives."""
21,0805095152,http://goodreads.com/user/show/15736557-lynne-king,5," I learned a lot of things in medical school, but mortality wasn’t one of them. Although I was given a dry, leathery corpse to dissect in my first term, that was solely a way to learn about human anatomy. Our textbooks had almost nothing on aging or frailty or dying. How the process unfolds, how people experience the end of their lives, and how it affects those around them seemed beside the point. The way we saw it, and the way our professors saw it, the purpose of medical schooling was to teach how to save lives not how to tend to their demise.What a brilliant introduction to this remarkable book.Fourteen months ago I would never have contemplated reading a book such as this one. I love reading medical documents and anything to do with the pharmaceutical industry but when it comes to “being mortal” and what is going to happen in the end, I’ve never really believed there is a God but possibly another sort of being. I’ve always been spiritual, however, as I love going into churches, lighting candles for loved ones, listening to sacred music, Gregorian chants, etc. Death was nevertheless a subject that I really didn’t want to think about.My belief was we are human mayflies - literally here today and gone tomorrow. We have a short time on this earth, sometimes longer and then that is it. We are born, procreate, if possible and then we die. We must nevertheless make the most of every day that we live on this planet and I’m certainly glad that I’m here.But when you see a loved one slowly slide into death, who had never been ill in his life, and then get every conceivable thing wrong with him, the scenario changes: constant doctors’/consultants’ appointments, cocktails of never ending and changing medications, X-rays, operations… It does tend to make one cynical but strangely enough it made me determined to read Atul Gawande’s book. And I’m delighted that I did.As a practising surgeon, the author has shown compassion to his patients and tried to be honest with them in their final days and offered solutions. When I asked the consultant at the hospital how much longer my husband was likely to have, as he was obviously in severe pain due to his illness, well he made no comment. I always want to hear the truth. If he were a dog, I continued (I actually was like a dog with a bone because this consultant was a very busy man), he would be put to sleep.He looked me straight in the eye and his response, which came as a soft caress, was “Ah but Madame King. He is a human-being….Let us go and see your husband now.”I applaud Mr Gawande for his excellently written book and the research that he made is phenomenal. It’s an absolute joy to read. I love to see honesty in an individual even if it brings pain to the person on the receiving end. He also introduced us to some amazing individuals who want to ensure that terminally ill or aging individuals have choice in their final days.An enlightening book and yet sobering…"
22,0805095152,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3409532-april-does-feral-sometimes,5,"Many people avoid the subject of what should be done when the elders in their family become too frail or sick or demented to live by themselves or if a family member, whether old or young, is told they have a fatal disease such as cancer. When such news happens, and it will happen, the fraught, sometimes guilty, sometimes extremely distressed, yelling and arguing which follows the diagnosis can produce wrong incompetent rushed decisions that can lead to lifelong regrets and self-recriminations which will hurt everyone involved forever.Before those emotional conversations occur, I strongly recommend reading 'Being Mortal'. It may literally save you decades of horrific guilt-ridden recollections about how things worked out for a loved one who died. I think I need to emphasize the book does NOT use an approach of standardized lists or a how-to or for-dummies short descriptive set of procedures which should be followed. Instead, Dr. Atul Gawande writes beautifully and sensitively, without sentimentality, of his own observations about his patients and of his personal experience when his father died. This is a grownup man writing about real situations. The case histories he has included may cover every question the reader may have, but while he demonstrates what people should be prepared for, he makes it clear every person has to decide how to proceed for themselves. His primary conclusion is that the person who is dying not only ought to be allowed to provide the family with guidance, even if indirectly, the family should try to accommodate as much as possible what those wishes are, even if the dying one cannot speak rationally, even if such accommodations shorten one’s life. This is, in my opinion, the right procedure to take. There is no question that a certain amount of personal toughness and a giving up of irrational hopes is required by everyone involved. The one who is dying needs to be cleaned and fed despite whatever wishes they may have, but if the family insists on a surgical procedure (for example, cutting out a cancer, or a third round of chemo and radiation) which provides no benefit of lengthening life expectancy, this is plainly insane and it cries out for some sort of counseling. Unfortunately, patients often cannot depend on their doctors to speak plainly, since as Dr. Gawande makes clear, doctors do not get much training, if any, on telling patients they have a disease which is killing them or that they have aged out of possible medical solutions.One part of the issue is often the person involved will not discuss what should happen if they are dying or they ask for what is impossible to accommodate. These will not be easy conversations. However, there comes a point when talking it through cannot be avoided. This book definitely helps in what can be a confusing and distressing time. It offers many ways to open the discussion and what sort of things should be discussed. That in itself makes the book an essential read.However, Death is not as terrible as living ‘independently’ for your last five years. Independence is hellish for many of my neighbors, but there is nothing on earth which will convince them they should have elderly care. I see many visits by adult children who vainly try to convince their parents they need assistance. What I see most often is service calls to cable companies, plumbers, electricians, neighbors, police and family members for help with household electronics and fixtures which inexplicably cannot be made to perform by the older person. I live in a park of trailer homes which are primarily sold to those who are of age 65+. When we moved here, I actually was too young - I did not meet the age set as minimum (my husband met the qualifications). The cul-de-sac we moved into had mostly empty houses. We didn't know it at the time, but there had been kind of a 'die-off'. It seems most of the former owners were in their 60's when they had bought these trailers - like us - and all had aged to their 80's together. At that point, they all began to 'fail'. Now, I am seeing it happen again before my eyes, since I am one of the youngest owners and most of the people who bought in when we did are now turning 80.The number one issue I have been seeing is the complete denial that aging problems are multiplying beyond one's personal capabilities. It is not so much they do not have access to care, it is more that they refuse care. In my state, there are almost no remedies to legally force an elderly person to accept care if they are able to prove under a quick brief test (conversation, mostly) they can answer questions logically. This problem of a lack of acceptance of personal frailty is covered by Dr. Gawande in “Being Mortal’ too. Based on the people in my senior park, I’d say it is the predominant problem that younger family members will face when trying to discuss their elder’s growing difficulties in living alone. This issue alone should put this book on everyone’s ‘must read’ stack.I walk every day so I have met everybody in my neighborhood. I take fewer than four medications a day (a criteria for impairment) so, based on that, I’d have to conclude that I am among the healthiest here. Most of these folks have trouble walking now for differing reasons (most of them were walking when I moved here ten years ago) and all of them take many many medications. I have watched them deteriorate from walking strong initially, standing straight on firm legs, to now being bent over and walking with unsteady steps, tottering in a very scary manner, obviously needing walkers. The interiors of houses inevitably become dirtier and dirtier from a lack of cleaning and a growing number of various types of spills and falls and accidents. Seniors lose their abilities to taste, smell, hear, walk, and see. Many cannot hear the birds chirp, or the wind in the trees. I have caught some of my elderly neighbors eating spoiled food. Some have required me to pull them out of chairs from which only a year ago they were able to push themselves up. Bathing is impossible now for most without aids, especially shower chairs. The regular toilet seats are being replaced by puffy, inches-thick seats from which my feet almost dangle above the floor (I now try to avoid using their bathrooms). Others have become incapable of typing or operating a computer mouse because of deteriorating spacial processing and/or weakening, shaking hands. I saw that a neighbor no longer possessed strength to hold a book in her hands.Many are clearly developing various degrees of dementia. They all are finding the ability to follow instructions harder, so the continuous updates of technology, especially cell phones and cable TV, are requiring a growing reliance on service calls. A few of my neighbors are requesting my husband to visit three or more times a week to fix whatever they have messed up on their remotes, having punched so many wrong buttons the programming on their remotes no longer works. There were only four people besides myself who were able to use computers ten years ago; of those, one is now completely unable to make sense of the monitor screen or Windows operating system any longer. At least once a month a firetruck and ambulance pulls up somewhere in my park. I have seen several of my nearby neighbors have a firetruck and ambulance pull up to their houses near me, needing medics to put them back on their feet after falls that neither they or their spouses could get up from. I saw one of my neighbors having CPR performed on him. I saw one of my neighbors set herself on fire trying to cook on her stove, shakily picking up a pot while dipping her sleeve into another hot burner. I saw two people burn their hands taking objects from an oven, on two separate occasions, because they each forgot that stuff baked in an oven is hot. Four of my neighbors have died or been moved to Hospice. At first, I was as startled by all of this as a deer in headlights. It didn’t seem possible this stuff was happening all around me to people I knew.Old people often fight off all advice and families by tooth and nail, yet the price of leaving them in their own homes could be a shortened life or a serious injury. People dying of a deadly disease may insist on operation after operation, experimental procedure after procedure trying to find a cure. On whose authority should adult care be decided - the elderly or dying adults? The families? The state? Who makes the call enough is enough? Frankly, I'm now beyond being amazed at how much 'autonomy and independence' society continues to allow the elderly infirm and demented if they refuse to recognize their infirmities. My state is now going to what they call 'Silver Alerts' when old people have disappeared for a few days from their house and someone has noticed. That seems to be the extent of care that my state can provide if someone past 65 refuses help. What is frightening me is that no one can ‘make’ people stop trying to live as if they were physically as adept as they were ten years ago if they clearly can no longer live unaided, but they are refusing to accept their deficiencies or weaknesses are causing life-threatening incidents. There have been several emergency calls to police caused by various serious, bone-breaking falls, faints and cuts, as I mentioned earlier, but I have learned there is no mechanism in place to force compliance with medical care if the adult has no wish for professional care. Families only have the power of speech and intimidation, unless they resort to legal mechanisms which can take months, when they can be used at all.I used to think, well, these elderly folks are adults and have rights to live as they please, and Dr. Gawande also argues this viewpoint to some degree. But after having seen the urine and poop everywhere in bathrooms bedrooms and living rooms, not cleaned until a younger person happens to visit whenever, or seeing mostly blind (cataracts, retina issues) adults eat rotten food they can't taste or smell, or seeing adults catch themselves on fire or burn their hands on stoves and ovens because they forgot that things are hot, or my closest friend here, who died this year, walking about on sharp stones barefoot in a bathrobe, when she had always dressed up, or people who repeat the same story in EVERY conversation and visit from neighbors, or my neighbor who fell in the bathroom and lay there for 4 hours calling for her husband, who couldn't hear her because he is almost completely deaf, so when he finally missed her, it took him another 20 minutes to walk 15 feet to the bathroom because he has dizzy issues and must use a walker that he is too weak to use well, after struggling out of his chair, and after finding her calling 911 because it needed three young men to lift her despite her small frame....etc etc etc., I don’t know anymore what the answers are. Yet, many elder-care institutions are nothing but prison cells, and the costs to insurance companies, families, personal savings and taxpayers are ruinous. I have learned, for example, that a drug-addicted alcoholic 68-year-old woman, bent over now, needing a walker, who broke her hip last year, could hold off the police, fire dept. medics, social service workers and her family for two weeks while she lay in her own filth immobile on her couch! She could answer questions coherently. It wasn't until in a moment of uncertainty she agreed to go to the hospital she finally was taken to have her hip operated on. However, she screamed about having changed her mind all the way to the ambulance! She created so much attitude while in the hospital and so much resistance, that when she checked herself out, called a cab, and moved back into her trailer, people did not try very hard to talk her out of it. We neighbors cleaned her house, but we have no power whatsoever to help her, primarily because she quickly accuses everyone of stealing and abuse. She picks up temporary home helpers by picking them up from grocery store parking lots, and they scare the rest of us. She had a lawsuit against a grocery store because she fell, but she created such misery for her lawyer from dementia-induced conversations, he dropped her case. She takes a cab to a casino regularly, and falls asleep at the slot machines. The employees don't touch her or wake her. She has stayed the night with her head propped up on a machine. (Sometimes she calls my husband to drive her home, which is how we know.) She has two dogs. They poop all over the inside of her house. Occasionally, someone will scoop it up, when they visit, when she asks someone to do it.This is the worst case so far where I live, but not the only terrible one I see occurring to lesser degrees all around me.Dr. Gawande makes a good case that the reason elderly people resist being placed in nursing homes is that many institutions for the aged and infirm are too regimented and rule-bound, and rely heavily on stupefying drugs, more for the benefit of warehousing adults than actually caring for elderly people. He argues for providing care which takes the adult individual’s previous life into consideration, making allowances for their desires as much as what is necessary to keeping them alive. Being kept alive is a horror if all pleasure from being alive is erased. Elderly people, including those with dementia, should be allowed those things which make life worth living - pleasant surroundings, reasonable privacy, pets, personal furniture, plants, etc. If they wish to sleep all day and watch TV all night, it should be permitted. A regimented activity-filled day without any input from the resident is one of the causes behind a lot of the elderly fighting off any efforts to get them out of their increasingly dangerous personal homes.I'm 100% behind assisted suicide, by the way. It should be obvious to you, gentle reader, that Aging does not mean a quick romantic death, like that often imagined of a healthy adult dropping dead or dying in their sleep after a vigorous happy day, but instead is a protracted, often painful, ugly, ignominious and slow-wasting process. The best health care can't give an aging person back their abilities to walk, hold a book, or clean their own bodies. The person often is aware of their smelly decrepitude, mental losses and physical incapacity, and is ashamed. Here in my state, there has to be two doctors to sign off on giving drugs to die and there must be an estimation of six months to live. After seeing how old age robs the person of good health, I am alternatively terrified and depressed. I have been seeing typical clues among my neighbors of oncoming death - such as not understanding what is on the TV, but staring at it 24/7, falling on the floor but being content to not call for help despite hours passing, eating spoiled food because the person no longer can judge on any level the condition of their groceries, continual body-waste accidents in one's chair several times a week without asking for help, missing meds even while they insist they took them, trying to walk around inappropriately dressed or attempting to drive, but instead ending up sitting in the car trying to move levers or get the key in the slot, etc. Reading is a lost art to these folks! I suspect almost no elderly person who had a house will ever completely agree that they needed to be in an assisted living or nursing home. I suspect an older family member who has been installed in an institution will never fully accept that they no longer are competent. I think those of you who are anticipating such a struggle with their own elderly family members (or someone young who has been told they have a life-threatening disease) should definitely read this book. ‘Being Mortal’ will help readers be firmer and more knowing what to expect in that conversation, and be more knowledgeable in what to look for while shopping for a place of elderly care, or for medical care for someone who actually cannot be helped by another operation or new drug despite what the doctor offers.We treat pet animals better, I think, generally. In America, our ethics are a bit all over the map on this, mine too. This book not only sheds some light on the problems, it also offers some methodology to help cut through the misery and confusion. Ultimately, resources and family input, along with the involved adult must be consulted and information synthesized. No one will be entirely happy with the result, in my opinion. But until the Fountain of Youth is discovered, we are all going to have to accept compromises and the despair of no happy endings, sometimes, of the person we are trying to help. Something which helps me is reciting, “where you have no power, there is no responsibility.” I think it is VERY helpful in deciding what you can actually do about terrible situations."

Given the opportunity and financial freedom, both parents and children saw separation as a form of freedom. Whenever the elderly have had the financial means, they have chosen what social scientists have called ""intimacy at a distance"". Early in the 20th century 60% of those over 65 lived with one of their children.In 1975 below 15% of those over 65 live with one of their children.This pattern is worldwide. Just 10% of Europeans over 80 live with their children. The same shift is happening in countries where parents traditionally live with their children, like Asia, China, Japan and Korea.The veneration of our elders may be gone, but it's not because it has been replaced by the veneration of youth. Rather it has been replaced by the veneration of the independent self. But, sooner or later, that independence becomes impossibleThe Process of Ageing (Not for the faint hearted!)*By the age of 50, half the average person's hair will be grey.*Even without cataracts, the amount of light reaching the retina of a healthy 60 year old is one third that reaching the retina of a 20 year old.*Our enamel wears away from our teeth and the gums tend to pull away, making them unstable and elongating their appearance. By 60, people in industrialized countries have lost on average a third of their teeth. After 85, almost 40% of people have no teeth at all.*In the course of a normal lifetime the muscles of the jaw lose about 40%of their mass and the bones of the mandible lose about 20%, becoming porous and weak. The ability to chew declines.*But the rest of our body hardens. Blood vessels, joints, the muscle and valves of the heart, and even the lungs pick up substantial deposits of calcium and turn stiff. When you reach inside an elderly patient during surgery, the aorta and other major vessels can feel crunchy under your fingers. As we age, it's as if the calcium seeps out of our skeletons and into our tissues.* To maintain the same volume of blood flow through our narrowed and stiffened blood vessels, the heart has to generate increased pressure. As a result, more than half of us develop hypertension by the age of 65. The heart become thicker-walled from having to pump against the pressure, and less able to respond to the demands of exertion. People become short of breath more quickly.* As the heart muscle thickens, muscle elsewhere thins. By age 80, one has lost between a quarter and a half of one's muscle weight.*The hand has 29 joints, each of which is prone to destruction from osteoarthritis.*The hand also has 48 named nerve branches. Deterioration of the cutaneous mechanoreceptors in the pads of the fingers produces loss of sensitivity to touch. Loss of motor neurons produces loss of dexterity. Hand writing degrades. Hand speed and vibration sense decline. Using a standard mobile phone becomes difficult.*Our functional lung capacity decreases.*Our bowels slow down.*Our glands stop functioning.*Even our brains shrink. At the age of 30 the brain is a three-pound organ that barely fits inside the skull; by our 70s, grey matter loss leaves almost an inch of spare room. The earliest portions to shrink are generally the frontal lobes, which govern judgement and planning, and the hippocampus, where memory is organized. As a consequence, memory and the ability to gather and weigh multiple ideas - to multitask - peaks in midlife and then gradually declines. By age 85, working memory and judgement are sufficiently impaired that 40% of us have textbook dementia.LifespanWe only inherit 3% of how long we will live. Even genetically identical twins have widely variable lifespans - the typical gap is more than 15 years.The number of elderly people is increasingOur elderly population is growing, though few societies have come to grips with the new demography. We also have fewer children than ever before - yet we give virtually no thought to how we will live out our later years alone.Medical aid for the elderlyThe number of geriatricians in the medical profession has actually dropped by 25% between 1996 and 2010. It is much more difficult to take care of elderly patients - often they have fifteen chief complaints instead of one, and often they are very very unglamerous complaints to attend to.Specialist geriatric medicine gets far too little money allocated to it, in spite of the fact it makes a big difference in people's lives.All over the world, the supply of geriatric psychiatrists, doctors, nurses and social workers are in short supply.Driving and the elderlyThe risk of a fatal car crash is three times higher with someone over 85 than it is for a teenage driver.Old age and loss (or why the elderly need our kindness.)Old ages is a continuous series of losses - losing your hearing, your memory, your best friends, your way of life.Nursing HomesVery few nursing homes give the elderly the quality of life they deserve. They are institutions which take away any feeling of ""home"" Often they are heavily regiment, where clients have to fit in with their routines. There are exceptions to these, but it takes a lot of research to find them.Terminal illness and remaining lifeA study led by sociologist Nicholas Christakis asked doctors of almost 500 terminally ill patients how long they thought their patients would survive...and then followed up the patients. 63% of the doctors over-estimated their patients survival times. Just 17% under-estimated it. The average estimate was 530% too high. The better the doctors knew their patients the more likely they were to err. But.....most doctors are reluctant to give a specific prognosis of life expectancy.Honesty is the best policyResearch has shown that people who had proper and realistic discussions with their doctor about their end-of-life preferences were far more likely to die at peace and in control of their situation. They also spared their families a lot of anguish. How we die in the 21st century. Too much medical interventionThe closing phase of modern life is often a mounting series of medical crises from which medicine can offer only a brief and temporary rescue. This could be called ODTAA Syndrome - or One Damn Thing After Another. It does not have a totally predictable path. The pauses between crises can vary...but after a certain point the direction of travel becomes clear.The pressure remains all in one direction, towards doing more, because the only mistake physicians seem to fear is doing too little. Most have no appreciation that equally terrible mistakes are possible in the other direction - that doing too much could be no less devastating to a person's life. (hide spoiler)] "

Gawande calls for a change in the way that medical professionals treat patients approaching their ends. He recommends that instead of focusing on survival, practitioners should work to improve quality of life and enable well-being. Gawande shares personal stories of his patients' and his own relatives' experiences, the realities of old age which involve broken hips and dementia, overwhelmed families and expensive geriatric care, and loneliness and loss of independence. In the beginning of the book he explores different models of senior living, including concepts such as poorhouses, multi-generational households and nursing homes. Gawande explores personal stories as well as accounts from geriatric doctors such as Keren Brown Wilson, an originator of the assisted living concept. He ruminates on stories of people dealing with age-related frailty, serious illness and death, and his own confrontation with mortality. ...تاریخ نخستین خوانش: روز پنجم ماه آگوست سال 2019 میلادیعنوان: آدمیزاد رفتنی است: بیماری‌های سخت، زندگی بهتر یا زندگی بیشتر؟؛ نویسنده: اتول گاواندی؛ مترجم: آزیتا راثی، نازنین سرکارات‌پور؛ تهران: نشر همان‏‫، 1397؛ در 230 ص؛ شابک: 9786226203012؛ عنوان دیگر: بیماری‌های سخت، زندگی بهتر یا زندگی بیشتر؟ موضوع: سالمندان - از نویسندگان ایالات متحده آمریکا - سده 21 م‮‬عنوان: مرگ با تشریفات پزشکی: آنچه پزشکی درباره مردن نمی‌داند؛ نویسنده: آتول گاواندی؛ مترجم: حامد قدیری؛ ویراستار: مرضیه اکبرپور؛ تهران: ترجمان علوم انسانی‏‫، 1398؛ در 368 ص؛ شابک: 9786008091523؛‬روزهای واپسین عمرِ سالمندان و بیماران لاعلاج اغلب در آسایشگاه‌ها و بخش مراقبت‌های ویژهٔ بیمارستان‌ها می‌گذرد. پزشکان در این اوضاع درمان‌هایی را پیش می‌برند که مغزهایمان را گیج و منگ می‌کنند و شیرهٔ بدن‌هایمان را می‌کشند تا مگر شانس نصفه‌ و نیمه‌ ای برای زنده‌ ماندن به ما بدهند؛ و در آخر افسوس می‌خوریم که همان اتفاقی افتاد که نباید. پزشکی مدرن به چیزی جز درمان فکر نمی‌کند، اما مرگ درمان ندارد. آتول گاواندی، جراح و نویسندهٔ آمریکایی، در پی این است تا ریشهٔ ناتوانی پزشکی مدرن در مواجهه با مرگ را بیابد و راه‌هایی را به بیماران و پزشکان پیشنهاد دهد که چگونه نگاهی تازه به وظیفهٔ پزشکی داشته باشند و روزهای واپسین را بگذرانند. ا. شربیانی"
25,0805095152,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5875398-rebecca,5,"An essential guide to decision-making about end-of-life care, but also a more philosophical treatment of the question of what makes life worth living. When should we extend life, and when should we concentrate more on the quality of our remaining days than their quantity? Most of the book weighs the plight of the elderly (it’s not just grim nursing homes out there), but there are also plenty of illustrative cases about the terminally ill. The “Letting Go” chapter is among the best; it grew out of this New Yorker article, which proved extremely helpful for my sister when she was arranging hospice care for her late husband.Along with The Emperor of All Maladies, this is a book everyone should read. Surgeon Atul Gawande, like Siddhartha Mukherjee, brings a physician’s technical knowledge to his writing, but also a very personal touch: his father, grandfather, and grandmother-in-law are among his subjects. This book is truly a gift. I plan to pass it to my mother; she’s only 67, but it’s never too early to start on that ‘hard conversation’ about one’s wishes for the end of life.Favorite passage: “The simple view is that medicine exists to fight death and disease, and that is, of course, its most basic task. Death is the enemy. But the enemy has superior forces. Eventually, it wins. And in a war that you cannot win, you don’t want a general who fights to the point of total annihilation. You don’t want Custer. You want Robert E. Lee, someone who knows how to fight for territory that can be won and how to surrender it when it can’t, someone who understands that the damage is greatest if all you do is battle to the bitter end.”"
26,0805095152,http://goodreads.com/user/show/695116-jim,5,"This is very well read, amazingly relevant, & accessible. It's filled with real world examples as well as a few statistics. It is a must-read for everyone young (teens up) or old because we don't think about our end days properly or even ask the right questions. Worse, we don't understand what others are thinking or what their goals are.- Doctors fix. If they can't fix, they often still try to do something. That's why they became doctors & have encyclopedic amounts of knowledge. Medicine has come so far that it's hard for them to admit it can't do everything.- Family want a fix & safety for the terminally ill no matter the cost, which they don't really understand.- The aging & terminally ill want...what? They often don't really know & their goals probably will change as age &/or their disease progresses. These goals should be paramount, but are often lost or ignored, overridden by the others goals & because the conversations are just too painful.Death is a certainty. When (how long until) & what quality of life (goals, expectations) are the questions. Unfortunately, very few ask the questions properly & keep everyone on track. Increasingly medicine that is supposed to help us has become a sadistic master, an end in itself. Dignity & quality of life are pushed aside for mere quantity.I can't recommend this book highly enough. I'll babble on more below, but this really says it all. The rest are just details I want to remember & you might find interesting.-----------------------Gawande is a surgeon. His parents are/were both doctors. He sees incurable patients often & his father died of cancer in his spine, so he's well qualified to write this book. He explains well how age can baffle doctors since not only can't they fix it, but attempts to do so can destroy the quality of life that is left. The amount of training devoted to geriatrics has never been great & is DROPPING! Given the burgeoning number of old folks, that's crazy, but it doesn't pay well & is difficult.He starts out with some interesting history. Gawande's ties to India provide a great contrast in how old age is handled. He was born in the US, but his father immigrated in the 1960's & most of his extended family still lives in India. His grandfather lived in his village as the patriarch until he was 110, supported by his family having outlived 3 wives.Briefly & simplistically, prior to the 20th century, living to old age was relatively rare & the family (especially daughters) generally took care of the few that made it or else they wound up in a poor house. As the 20th century progressed, more old lived, but less kids were born to each family, more daughters worked, families scattered, & so there are more old with less people available to take care of them.At about the same time (mid 20th C.), hospitals became places of healing rather than home. The old wound up in them to get fixed, but they weren't fixable. They just needed custodial care. They stacked up, so 'nursing' homes evolved about 1960. This is institutional living & more than many needed, but without family to support them, they couldn't live alone, so this was their only other option.In 1983, Keren Brown started the first assisted living home in Portland, OR. More help & less institution, so a far better quality of life. A door that can be locked, personal (not group) schedules, & the ability to NOT be safe. Safety is a metric that is easily measured & sued over, thus over-used. Quality of life is not so easily measured & too often takes a back seat. Perhaps a beer or a sundae aren't really good for a person, but are a nice treat. Even little kids often have more freedom than some old folks.I'm shocked that this is such a new problem. My ignorance of the issue amazes me & there's really no excuse. I worked for a company that specialized in senior living (independent through nursing homes) for over 8 years. My cousin is a geriatric nurse. On top of that, I've had quite a few relatives die of old age. My uncle spent a decade at one of the best geriatric facilities where he went from an independent living apartment to a single room in assisted living which became the nursing home when the amount of care changed & where he eventually died. The community remained the same throughout. As the physically closest relative, tech support, & handyman, I saw him pretty often & never properly understood his dislike of the place. Now I think I do.Preparing to deal with aging, the related frailties & limitations, is something we need to do now. We've done a lot (wills, health proxies, retirement income) but I wish I had read this at least 20 years ago because that's only part of the problem.Gawande points out that we don't think about this enough, at least not in the right way. It's not just about living, but living a quality life. We're going to die, but no one in my family wants to linger in an institution. To our horror, my maternal grandmother did. In her mid 80's, she had a series of mini-strokes & spent the next 2 years dying. It was awful. Just a few months before, she'd shot a nice buck at her camp up in Maine. Her only concession to age was to have her grandsons carry it in. She even dressed it out herself.After a life of independence, the idea of sleeping, eating, & playing on a group schedule is horrifying. It gives me a new appreciation of Harry Truman (Mt. St. Helens)http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harry_Ra...Quality at the end of life is a conversation we too often avoid & don't really understand. Doctors, those we rely on, aren't the best at judging this. Their priority is to fix & they don't like telling people they can't. A third round of chemo might help, but is far more likely just to ruin what little time is left & may very well shorten it. Still, it's easier for them to do something rather than admit they can do nothing.Kids want safety & perceived comfort for their aged relatives, but the person wants to LIVE. That can mean making bad choices, danger, &/or less length of life & that's fine to a point. The lack of independence can kill just as surely as physical illness, but sometimes their expectations aren't reasonable. Gawande doesn't cover this well & it's a glaring omission. There probably are no good answers, but it was a tremendous source of pain & frustration for my family.Losing his driver's license killed my father-in-law (FIL), but he couldn't be allowed to drive any more. We'd tried to get him to stop for over a year, but had no support from anyone else in the family. Then he had 3 bad wrecks in as many months. After each, we tried to take his keys, called the police & social services, but got no help & we hurt his feeling horribly. If my wife hadn't been his darling daughter, we certainly would have alienated him completely. Yet when he hit 4 parked cars & a pedestrian (hospitalized, but lived) in a grocery store parking lot, the police & his sons wanted to know why he was still driving. They blamed us - vehemently. I didn't hit a cop that day only because his partner grabbed me first.After a few months of steadily worsening depression, my FIL drove himself to the hospital (The sneaky bastard had a key stashed.) & died of a massive heart attack a few hours later without telling anyone anything. His wife of 50+ years had an idea, but only called us when he didn't return home after several hours, so we had to scramble to find him. He left no updated will, his bills were a mess, & his checkbook hadn't been properly balanced in months since the last time my wife had forced the issue with him. Once again, everyone else was suddenly concerned & horrified; wondering how things had gotten to such a state completely forgetting all our attempts. The frustration we felt was immense. My FIL's failure to admit to or live with his increasing frailties was our failure as well. I see now that we didn't make enough effort to finding alternatives to engage my FIL in life, but he was a private man who isolated himself to hide his problems. Don't let this happen to you & yours. As hard as the choices & conversations are, not having them sucks a lot worse. We barely speak to either of my brother-in-laws any more.Sometimes making the right choices is tough, even with the most rational people. Gawande's father had cancer. Between his parents & himself they had over 120 years of medical experience & even they were confused by the options at times & had different goals. He has learned that he can't be paternalistic nor just a fount of information for his patients. He must get the patient to tell him what they fear & want in several ways so he can figure out their priorities. Only then can he properly give them some choices along with probable & possible outcomes & use these to guide his surgeries.Hospice care is misunderstood. It's not just about heavy drugs until death, but about managing & making the most out of the last months or even years of life. Gawande quotes several studies that have found that it extends life both in quantity & quality even though it is only palliative care - not a fix. Remember, there often is no fix. This is especially hard for people to believe when the patient is young. His example of a young woman who is diagnosed with cancer just before giving birth is very instructive & heart wrenching.He also looks at what might broadly be described as suicide. This ranges from voluntary decisions not to take nourishment, refusing mechanical help (even to turning off pacemakers) to lethal prescriptions. While this is currently legal only in 3 states (Oregon, Washington, & Vermont) it is important to note that a person can't do this on the spur of the moment. They need to convince 2 doctors over a period of time that they are terminal & really want this. He points out the thin line we walk in such situations without judging.There is an interview with the author at the end of this edition of the audio book. It didn't add anything, so can be skipped, IMO. All in all, this is a must read. Every adult should read this & even teens could & should if there is a terminal illness in the family. I can't recommend it highly enough."
27,0805095152,http://goodreads.com/user/show/100867863-alok-vaid-menon,3,"In our anesthetic world sometimes melodrama can be a way to access what we feel. When grandpa died, I wept in the shower, I took long walks engulfed by the wind. One night I lay on the kitchen floor for hours. On those tiles I learned that there is no other side of grief — loss, it just perforates us. You begin to recognize the primordial poetry of an open mouth: absence and presence in one. Growing up every time we drove by the nursing home my grandma would say a prayer. I never understood “never” like that look: her terror, her sympathy. After surrendering to it, my grief became gratitude. How lucky was I to be there? -- to witness the shaky elegance of his unbecoming? How fortunate was I to be the confidant he told about his desire to go? In his book, Gawande exposes how modern medicine has erased traditions around morality that help us understand how there are some forms of living which can be more painful than dying. With the imposition of the nuclear family over more extensive community, elder care work is outsourced to sterile and isolating institutions. Gawande questions Western medicine’s salvific function -- its imperative on maintaining life -- without interrogating what quality of life, and what the patient wants in the first place. Doctors are trained in the technicalities of aging — accumulation of lipofuscin, DNA mutation — but not the affects of it. He encourages us to imagine another form of medicine: one in which we ask people what gives their lives meaning? It’s the distinction between living and existing. Health just can’t be about the body, it has to consider the psyche. Ultimately, I was able to accept my grandpa’s death because I knew that prolonging his life would mean incalculable suffering: the inability to speak, write, read, all very things that he loved. Read this not for comfort, but for conviction. His book is less dynamic to read as it is to apply and propel conversations that have been put off. Occasionally his provocations outrun his prose and his compassion gets lost with so many case studies. But it’s important in the way confronting inconvenient things are: it’s less about the beauty, and more about the lesson."
28,0805095152,http://goodreads.com/user/show/23743588-erika,5,"This is a brilliant, fascinating, and extremely important book. I wish I had read it before my mother died because I would have asked her more probing questions about her priorities in the last couple of months of her life. Yet while Being Mortal made me regret the conversations I didn't have with my mom, I also came away feeling optimistic about the possibility for much-needed change in the way we think about age and dying in our culture. Gawande is an influential author, journalist, researcher, surgeon, teacher and policy analyst, but here, he's turned his prodigious talent and intellect toward writing about ""what matters in the end."" I'm thankful that he put this amazing book into the world.  "
29,0805095152,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1809697-darlene,5,"Not long ago, I read a book entitled The Cost of Hope: A Memoir. This book was written by 'Wall Street Journal' reporter, Amanda Bennett about her family's very personal struggle with navigating the health care system during her husband, Terence Foley's battle with Kidney cancer. In the end, Mr. Foley succumbed to this disease and Ms. Bennett's book took an honest look at the lengths her family went to and the cost they incurred to battle this disease.. all of the treatments, surgeries, procedures and clinical trials, asking herself it it was all worth it. She came to the conclusion that she was comfortable with actions they had taken. The book had me wondering.. is our health care system perhaps approaching disease and end of life situations in the way that makes the most sense? Then I discovered this book, Being Mortal: Medicine and What Matters in the End (and I would recommend that people read this book as a companion to 'The Cost of Hope'!). This book seems to be unique to me in that it is written by a physician… Dr. Atul Gawande. It isn't that doctors do not write books; but I have never seen a book quite like this one written by a physician.Dr. Gawande focuses more specifically on aging and dying. He begins by talking about his experience in medical school. He states,""Our textbooks had almost nothing on aging or frailty or dying…. how the process unfolds, how people experience the end of their lives and how it affects those around them seemed beside the point. The way we saw it, the purpose of medical school was to teach how to save lives, not how to tend to their demise."" Dr. Gawande, upon leaving medical school, discovered just how unprepared he and his fellow physicians were when they encountered patients who were facing the end of their lives. These physicians had no idea how to help their patients. In this very informative book, Dr. Gawande discusses the evolution that medicine and public health has undergone over the years. He compares the way in which we approach aging and death in the United States , looking at how these life stages were dealt with just 50 or so years ago. It seems that aging and dying were life events which occurred more within the context of the family structure. Extended family proved to be crucial in the outcome faced by aging persons. Although family members are still important,an elderly person's greatest chance in avoiding a nursing home placement is dependent upon how many children they have, and in particular, whether they have a daughter.. as daughters are more likely to take the care of an ailing/aging relative upon themselves. Without family, the elderly are left with a ""controlled and supervised institutional existence, a medically designed answer to unfixable problems, a life designed to be safe but empty of anything they care about."" And THAT fact seems to be the greatest problem with our society's institutionalization of aging and dying. Dr. Gawande has written a very readable book… it isn't aimed at only health care professionals; although it seems to me that all health care professionals would benefit from reading the book. This book isn't written as simply a recitation of facts and statistics. Dr. Gawande illustrates his opinions through case studies… cases he has consulted on and cases he is familiar with through other professional affiliations. He also experiences no reticence in discussing his very own personal experiences… the aging and terminal illness of his father and the discussions they needed to have to provide an outcome which his father could be comfortable with. Dr. Gawande seems to be a proponent of palliative and hospice care. He presents numerous cases of people who have experienced successful outcomes through the use of palliative and hospice care. And speaking personally,my family has also made use of hospice care and it provided great relief and comfort and I highly recommend it! Of curse, you may be thinking at this point that I'm crazy to be talking about 'successful outcomes'… after all, what I'm referring to is death. I'm sure many people don't wish to think about simply alleviating suffering and providing an environment of comfort. Most people wish only to consider a CURE.. to somehow make it a possibility to continue life as it were before the illness, no matter how improbable or impossible that goal may be. So again, this is another HUGE problem pointed out by Dr. Gawande. In our culture, we don't EVER want to talk of death and dying. We don't want to acknowledge that we all will one day die. There is an obsession with living longer but no one wants to acknowledge the aging process that goes hand-in-hand with living longer. Dr. Gawande proposes that we begin to think about and become comfortable enough to engage in conversations with loved ones about aging and what means most to us; and what the of life we would like to live… taking into account all limitations and restrictions which aging implies.What Dr. Gawande implies in this book is that change is needed at a societal level and in how physicians and health care professionals are trained. The change he advocates for is an attitudinal shift in the way we look at aging, the failing of the bodily systems and in the end… death. We are all going to die.. no exceptions. Dr. Gawande wish is that we will become a society which accepts this inevitability and that we help our members by treating them with understanding and compassion and the desire to alleviate unnecessary suffering. As he so eloquently writes,..""If to be human is to be limited, then the role of caring professions and institutions ought to be aiding people… Sometimes we can offer a cure, sometimes only a salve, sometimes not even that. But whatever we can offer…. are justified only if they serve the larger aims of a person's life. when we forget that, the suffering we inflict can be barbaric. When we remember it, the good we do can be breathtaking.""I recommend this book to everyone!"
30,0805095152,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2231715-lewis-weinstein,5,"This book is not pleasant to read. It is challenging, emotional, difficult ... and a spectacular journey along a path we will all follow. As we face the inevitable, Gawande gives us a framework within which to consider the options we may have, the choices we might want to make, and the medical and/or other assistance we may or may not desire. His thoughtful discussion of the people he has accompanied through their dying days, including his father, provides much to stimulate our own thoughts. The central theme is that these decisions should be, to the maximum possible extent, the patient's, with family and medical input, and not the other way around. In Gawande's experience that process, difficult and uncertain as it may be, yields the best results for all those involved."
31,0805095152,http://goodreads.com/user/show/10770371-dan,5,"Being Mortal by Atul GawandeGawande, as a surgeon, steps us through the reality of life’s waning moments. There is a heavy focus on cancer and old age and decisions around hospice care. Not easy subject matter but very useful information. I didn’t get choked up until the end of the book when the author takes us through the last few months of his father’s life as he battled cancer. The US is different from nearly all other countries in the world in how we deal with the elderly. As Americans we don’t live with aging parents and by extension a significant percentage of the elderly are put into retirement homes when they can no longer maintain independence. Gawande points out that our bodies are like machines and quite literally wear out. Most end of life situations spend a great deal of time on pain management and medications and often in the waning days, an inability to digest food.Some interesting facts. “By the age of sixty, people in an industrialized country like the United States have lost, on average, a third of their teeth. After eighty-five, almost 40 percent have no teeth at all.”Philip Roth said “Old age is not a battle. Old age is a massacre.”Gawande also discusses Do Not Resuscitate directives. There is part of a chapter where he recalls interning at a Boston area hospital. On one night he forgets that a patient had signed a DNR. When the patient goes into cardiac arrest, it sets in motion the CPR team to come revive the patient. When Gawande realizes his mistake and tries to call it off he is pushed aside. When the revival effort fails he is tongue lashed by the CPR team. The author feels very strongly about the value of hospice care. Almost everyone, if given the choice, would choose to die at home versus the hospital but the latter situation is still the norm. Sometimes because others have to make the medical decisions when the elderly become incapacitated. 4.5 stars. The writing here is easy to follow and the stories are quite compelling. There is also a lot of practical advice. The book was published in 2014. Highly recommended."
32,0805095152,http://goodreads.com/user/show/8079403-max,5,"This is an important book, whether you are approaching old age or family or friends you care about are. It set my mind spinning thinking how I would deal with the situations Gawande describes. Coming face to face with one’s decline and death is at least depressing and can be terrifying. Gawande points out that the medical profession and most of our institutions are not designed to deal with the human problem. He identifies a number of changes that could be made at a policy level that would improve things. But the fundamental problem is knowing ourselves and communicating our wishes or helping loved ones to reflect and do the same. Gawande points to helpful experiences with hospice care, but we must first make that decision. My notes follow.Gawande explains how growing old has changed and how we in developed countries have adjusted or failed to adjust to it. As the twentieth century wore on medicine made great advances and people’s life spans increased significantly. At the beginning of the century people would stay relatively healthy as they aged until they met a devastating disease, say the flu or cancer or heart disease. These would usually kill people rather quickly and they would die in their homes near friends and family. Now modern medicine fixes most of these problems, at least temporarily, so as people age their health ratchets down step by step. Eventually many of us will be unable to care for ourselves while the doctors keep us alive. There are in home services available and assisted living facilities for those who can afford them. But for the average person without significant savings this is a serious financial as well as personal dilemma and too often ends with a person’s final days spent in an impersonal nursing home.Both medical care for the elderly and institutional care suffer from the same problem – task orientation rather than people orientation. Doctors are trained to fix your issue and keep you alive, not evaluate the impact on your overall quality of life. Similarly institutions for the elderly are designed to meet set goals: To keep you safe, ensure you get your medications, get you fed, keep you clean, etc. The staff is rated on these things and focus on them, but they create an environment their residents typically hate. And of course many institutions don’t meet even basic standards. So the modern way of growing old often means becoming disabled enough to have to leave your home with little choice but to share a room with a stranger in an institutional environment. Gawande paints a grim picture of our future, but he also points to people trying to change things. These people are focused more on care than treatment. The woman who pioneered assisted living was looking for an alternative to the nursing home, not a stepping stone as it too often is. Others have tried to change the focus of nursing homes to enrich the lives of the residents through measures that allow more autonomy to the residents and less regimentation. The design of nursing homes can make them seem more like real homes and less like institutions. The more residents can participate, have choices, have outside interests, the better they will feel and do. Efficiency and safety have to be balanced against their effect on the patient’s quality of life. Throughout life we take reasonable chances to get more out of living. Why should that stop when time becomes short, when it is most precious?Gawande discusses terminal illness and the inevitable decision of whether to stop treatment. Doctors tend not to be helpful. They give choices of your treatment options. That is their job. But today there is hospice and palliative care. When is this a reasonable choice? The decision is personal. Doctors and family can’t really make it which is why drawing out the feelings of the patient is so important. From Gawande’s examples there is clearly a point in which treatment does more harm than good. We all want to die with some dignity and as little pain as possible. We all would rather die in a bed where we can say goodbye to friends and family rather than on a respirator in an ICU. But it is difficult to give up hope that the next procedure might work or buy us significant time. The decision is a tradeoff to achieve some quality of life at the end. Gawande talks about his own father’s case. His father, also a doctor, had terminal cancer and was facing paralysis. It took what Gawande calls the hard conversation to make the decision to accept hospice and the inevitable. In a testimony to the notion that the most sophisticated doctor may not be the best choice to initiate this conversation, Gawande’s father’s feelings were skillfully drawn out by a small town nurse practitioner from the local hospice. She was interested in him, his problems as he saw them, not in the disease and its treatment."

But this remarkable book by Atul Gawande points out that it is an ill-thought battle and, dare I say it, an ill-fought one.For the last three years of my wonderful mother’s life I was her carer. Coping with the advanced stages of multiple sclerosis she was mostly restricted to her bed (which was in fact a hospital bed delivered to our family home along with all the other paraphernalia of sickness), permanently catheterised, unable to walk or do anything for herself. Mom also had severe dementia and often mistook me for my recently-deceased Dad. As an immersive carer I managed a team of women who assisted me in the day with my mother’s personal care. The rest of the time I sat with her, or fed her, or tried to unblock her catheter (while going out of my mind), or sang with her. Naturally, the last activity was the most enjoyable. Despite her dementia, Mom had a seemingly inexhaustible trove of perfectly-remembered lyrics in her head. We sang Doris Day songs, the Bellamy Brothers, the Beautiful South, the Beatles, Tori Amos, the Hollies, Cyndi Lauper, the Mama and Papas, Simon and Garfunkel, ABBA, songs from musicals. Even new songs she had only heard once we tackled together. Somehow she remembered these lyrics too.But 16 months before Mom passed away she developed septicaemia and was rushed into hospital. Her organs were shutting down, her pulse was weak and fading fast. We were told her quality of life was so bad, her disability so extreme, that the hospital was to offer no treatment- it would be kinder to let her go.We didn’t. I won’t go into the whys and wherefores of that decision but at least one of my sisters- who had driven in terror the 150 miles from where she lived- thought that letting go would be an idea we should not entertain and I wavered, full of love for this extraordinary woman who had been the life and soul of any party when I was growing up, rock and rolling on the dance floor, full of fast wit and laughter that was infectious in its affirmation of life. The doctor in charge asked me for one piece of evidence that suggested my mother had any quality of life at all. We sing every day- we sing together all the time, I said. So he treated her and somehow, over 7 long and painful weeks, she became well enough to be sent back home and into my care.But what did this ‘well enough’ mean? Mom was no longer capable of swallowing so had had a peg inserted into her stomach. I was trained in the art of its upkeep- everyday the wound needed to be cleaned and the peg rotated 360 degrees (otherwise it would fuse to her skin). Any strength Mom had had in her arms had gone. To all intents and purposes she was incapable of moving anything but her head (a fraction), her eyes and mouth. But by and large Mom slept, in a virtual coma that meant our daily songs felt like a golden time remembered and grieved from the perspective of a new time of horrors. Three days after returning home and in a fever caused by kidney stones that were trying to be passed (another tier of Hell) Mom whispered to me, “I have had enough.”But of course it didn’t end there. Mom stayed in a limbo of pain and half-consciousness for well over another year. She would emit blood-curdling screams when being cleaned, when being moved, but she did not sing. Fed a noxious mixture through a machine, one of the few joys she had had left (sucking on a piece of chocolate or enjoying slow mouthfuls of a home-cooked dinner) had gone. It struck me sitting beside her that we had consigned her to an exit that was barbarous and devoid of love. All I could do was ensure she was as comfortable as possible and that, on the occasions she was awake, she could see that I was there, smiling at her and telling her I loved her more than the world.When the end time came we were told on three separate occasions that today was the day. But a little woman of 5’2”, ranked a Zero by hospital doctors when her ability was assessed, she defied every professional speculation and breathed on another day, then another, then another. When she died in November 2012, a few weeks shy of her 68th birthday, I have truly never seen such peace on a face.In the last year of her life Mom had been well enough on a handful of occasions to wake and smile at me and sing with me. One of these occasions I captured on video. We sit together, smiling, singing ‘Zip A Dee Doo Dah,’ (my oh my what a wonderful day) and she tells me she loves me. An exquisite moment that I am glad I captured. But was it really worth the 16 months of Hell she went through?Atul Gawande’s book is all about acceptance of our mortality. But it is about much more than that. Modern medicine has it wrong, he says. It is about preserving life at all costs- battle for a year through procedure after procedure rather than enjoy your remaining months of life at the best possible quality. Yes, it turns out the emergency room where my mother ended up in 2011 made the right call and we did not. But, by and large, if you have a life-limiting prognosis with a disease such as cancer you will be offered all sorts of treatments to extend that life at the detriment of its quality.But this is also a book about the way the elderly are treated in the industry of care homes and sheltered housing. With all meaning to life removed, with all responsibility removed, people become shells of their former selves, depressed and longing for the death that the (questionable) care they are receiving is preventing. Visionary projects from the 1970s- with more pets in care homes, with pairs of birds in every room for residents to have a vested interest in looking after, with children of staff visiting, filling the emptiness with the joy of activity, of noise- show that it is possible for care homes to be places of life rather than death. But it takes more effort to achieve this, more resources. More determination to give the elderly a life worth enjoying. And so, of course, such ideas largely fall by the wayside, because in a capitalist world the elderly are a drain on life, on resources... which is frankly sickening.I cannot stress enough how important this book is. It was, at times, a painful read for me, and that will be the case for anyone who has lost someone in a medicalised nightmare of end-time. But you owe it to yourself to understand what best befits you when your time comes. You owe it to yourself to choose your own ending. This book arms you with the knowledge to make the right decision, however painful that is.As for my mother.. after 3 touch and go trips to the hospital in the last year of her life I spoke to my sisters and told them it all came down to what we felt Mom would prefer- to die at home or have more and more (hopeless) treatment at hospital, where it was inevitable that one day she would happen to die. We agreed that just as my father had passed away at home, surrounded by people who loved him, our mother deserved the same. It was the best decision we made. She passed on in her home of 40 years held by those she loved and surrounded by their voices. She died in peace."
34,0805095152,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6468566-jennifer,2,"2.5 stars. Gawande has about three major points in this book, all of which were made in a news magazine article he wrote for the Atlantic: 1, We should have tough conversations with those in our lives about their vision for their end-of-life; 2, Doctors should also have these conversations with their patients; and 3, If we have these conversations, we can shift medicine and end-of-life care away from a stave-off-death model and towards a model that promotes humanity, autonomy, and dignity for the dying (and thus no longer need institutional nursing homes). I do not disagree, but the book itself is heavy on anecdotes and light on actual research or policy analysis.My major stylistic critique is that Gawande buries his three points in pages of anecdotes about patients and memories of his own father's decline and death. I'm not being unsympathetic to the suffering of these colorful characters (and Gawande's own personal suffering), but I found the anecdotes long-winded, distracting, and ultimately boring. Gawande intended them to have emotional impact for the reader, but for me, the stories smacked of filling pages for the pure commercial gain of selling a book. My major substantive critique is that Gawande spends too little time on policy, instead championing the heroism of individual doctors, caregivers, and entrepreneurs-- as if the system can be saved by some brave individuals. He is far too sanguine about the difficulty of changing institutions at the macro-level. Yes, Gawande mentions that these alternative living arrangements and alternative therapeutic approaches save money in the long run, but most of the initiatives Gawande covers were developed by private entrepreneurs, not governments (though some government funds may have been made available in the form of grants). Dramatic policy change would be needed to scale and fund these initiatives at the state or federal level, and I do not see the current vested interests in the healthcare lobby supporting these changes (nor does Gawande provide a path for fighting for policy change, besides mentioning the cost-effectiveness argument). The one scale-able initiative that Gawande discusses, Hospice, already exists-- but Gawande ignores that Hospice's ranks are often filled with low-skilled, under-paid, and over-worked caregivers who are hardly in the position to give the attentive, individualized care that Gawande received for his father. Gawande is also too sanguine about the role of socioeconomic class, which is perhaps why his friends and his patients receive such excellent care. He is wrapped in a bubble of privilege -- access to the top surgeons and the most committed nurses. True, some of the alternative homes that Gawande mentions do take Medicaid, but these homes are so few that they have waitlists that are hundreds of names long. The type of ""better death"" that Gawande argues for so eloquently is available only to the wealthiest or the most educated (those empowered to fight the system and search for better options). Without a serious treatment of the nexus between healthcare policy, quality of life, and socioeconomic status, this book seems to me squarely in the realm of theory, not practice. "
35,0805095152,http://goodreads.com/user/show/929238-hbalikov,5,"This is an excellent book. It is also the most important book that I have read in the past year.Dr. Gawande is that rare physician who can write well and write well for the layman. There is nothing glamorous about growing old. There is nothing glamorous in taking care of those who are growing old. As to the former, Gawande, makes it clear as he describes the way our bodies decline and breakdown over time. As to the later, it helps to explain both why very few doctors are attracted to gerontology and why those who aren't are not particularly adept at dealing with those who are at or near the end of their lives. This book is about ""what matters in the end,"" but it is also about Gawande's journey as a physician and surgeon. ""I never expected that among the most meaningful experiences I'd have as a doctor --- and, really, as a human being --- would come from helping others deal with what medicine cannot do as well as what it can.""Atul Gawande is meticulous in describing how we wear down and wear out. ""There is, he told me, 'no single, common cellular mechanism to the aging process.'....The process is gradual and unrelenting."" And, how many of us believe that we can put that aside for the present. ""People naturally prefer to avoid the subject of their decrepitude."" Yet, it colors many things that we do and many decisions that we have to make. In his own learning process, Gawande shares his experiences, and his encounters with doctors, other care givers and physicians. ""The job of any doctor, Bludau later told me, is to support quality of life, by which he meant two things: as much freedom from the ravages of disease as possible and the retention of enough function for active engagement in the world. Most doctors treat disease and figure that the rest will take care of itself.""He exposes a lot of the ""nursing home approach"" as insensitive with facilities that may come to resemble an asylum (in the worst sense). He explores the question, ""what makes life worth living when we are old and frail and unable to care for ourselves,"" is its many facets. There are: basic needs for survival; need for love and belonging; desire for growth (""the opportunity to attain personal goals, to master knowledge and skills, and to recognized and rewarded for our achievements); and, perhaps, ""self-fulfillment through pursuit or moral ideals and creativity for their own sake."" He points out that ""our driving motivations in life, instead of remaining constant, change hugely over time...""I learned a lot about how we often treat those who cannot care entirely for themselves and how attitudes and venues are changing. When doctors are just about ""tinkering"" with the seriously ill, a lot is ignored. Particularly, that those people ""have priorities (perhaps poorly expressed or not discussed) besides prolonging their lives. Surveys find that their top concerns include avoiding suffering, strengthening relationships with family and friends, being mentally alert, not being a burden to others, and achieving a sense that their life is complete.""I wish I had had this book to read before I found myself with friends and family members who were seriously ill or dying. Gawande describes how both amateur and professional caregivers can be sensitive to these issues. And, how they can give the ill and dying the opportunity to reflect on their own desires. One of those, for many, is that they would rather spend their remaining days at home instead of in an institution. There is a very illuminating section on hospice and how this should be explored far earlier than it currently is. Not necessarily invoking hospice care earlier, but being aware of what if can offer and, if desired, getting it going in time to make a difference with quality of life.""(Though), no one ever really has control. Physics and biology and accident ultimately have their way in our lives. But the point is that we are not helpless either. Courage is the strength to recognize BOTH realities. We have room to act, to shape our stories, though as time goes on it is within narrower and narrower confines. A few conclusions become clear when we understand this: that our most cruel failure in how we treat the sick and the aged is the failure to recognize that they have priorities beyond merely being safe and living longer; that the chance to shape one's story is essential to sustaining meaning in life; that we have the opportunity to refashion our institutions, our culture, and our conversations in ways that transform the possibilities for the last chapters of everyone's lives."""
36,0805095152,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1067741-susan,5,"If you have aging/elderly parents whose care you might someday be involved in, or expect to care for someone with a terminal condition, you cannot afford to miss this book. In his effortlessly lucid prose, Gawande comes to terms with the medical establishment's failure in providing end-of-life care. Too often, doctors work to fix what's broken in the service of extending life, without considering how quality of life is compromised, inflicting even more suffering as a result. He extols the value of hospice and palliative care, whose aim is not to give up on patients, but to provide as many good days as possible in the inevitable slide to death. He advocates asking difficult questions with patients and loved ones to determine what can bring meaning and value to them, even in the harsh narrowing of life's possibilities brought on by failing bodies and minds. He does not exempt himself from this critique -- instead he offers personal stories, iike those of his father and his daughter's piano teacher, to show how he came to understand the necessity of these important discussions and the possibilities they offer. It's moving, and timely, and despite the less-than-cheerful subject matter, never a burden to read (a testament to his writerly skill). I can't recommend this book highly enough to anyone who will face these issues -- and we all most likely will, in some form."
37,0805095152,http://goodreads.com/user/show/47188780-kathleen,5,"•	This is an important book for all who have elderly parents that are struggling with end-of-life health issues. Dr. Gawande personalizes the key issues through individual case histories, but he backs up his arguments with solid statistics. First, our society does not have enough gerontologists to serve our aging population, and our medical schools are cutting back on training new ones. More importantly, medical doctors tend to want to solve medical problems. And often, that results in them not recognizing, or even asking, what is important to their patient’s quality of life. The elderly want to live in ‘a home’, not an institution. They want to feel in control of their lives as much as possible. Safety is less of a concern to them than independence. Privacy is important too. They tend to want their own space, with furniture from their own home. They want to be able to turn on the television when and at what volume they want. These needs are not compatible with institutional long-term care facilities. So, new options are being explored—particularly in the United States. Highly recommend."

“A few conclusions become clear when we understand this: that our most cruel failure in how we treat the sick and the aged is the failure to recognize that they have priorities beyond merely being safe and living longer; that the chance to shape one’s story is essential to sustaining meaning in life; that we have the opportunity to refashion our institutions, our culture, and our conversations in ways that transform the possibilities for the last chapters of everyone’s lives.”

 This right here is the theme of Atul Gawande's Being Mortal: Medicine and What Matters in the End. This incredible piece of medical/science nonfiction starts out by introducing historical and cultural norms for caring for our elders and how this has significantly shifted in many societies. Mr. Gawande does not pass judgement but presents the observations and facts so we the reader may have an objective view which starts a journey of perspective. And when we view the world from another perspective, self-examination takes place, thus change. I absolutely loved this book. Many books I have been reading lately have been all about timing it seems. Last year, I watched both my grandfathers die (within 3 days of each other) and this year I am really beginning to take note of my parents and in-law's escalating aging. I guess chronic diseases, strokes, and fickle organs will do that to you. Like many self-centered Americans, I have been looking at the process in terms of what it means for me. How will my life change as they become more and more dependent on me? This book. This book! My perspective and priorities are forever altered. It is about me, after all I am living my life, but it is also about them. They want to be the author of their own life just as much as I do and if I'm lucky, they will live long enough to require assistance with that. They didn't ask for these complications and they fear the loss of independence far more than I could ever begin to imagine. The true terror: that no one will care.Mr. Gawande stresses that end of life conversations are crucial and surprisingly liberating, not only as a son or daughter but as a medical provider. There is a sense of control even in the midst of very uncontrollable circumstances. Questions need to be asked and once answers are decided upon, fear and anxiety of all parties involved can relax a bit. Your wishes will be respected in terms of what a quality life means to you. In a world of nursing homes that might as well be classified as prisons, knowing that someone listens and cares about what you want (despite the options and risks) is priceless. Mr. Gawande draws from his personal experience with his father in this respect and I found these parts to be incredibly raw and emotional. I strongly recommend this book. But if you don't read it, please remember these questions for your loved ones: 

“Whenever serious sickness or injury strikes and your body or mind breaks down, the vital questions are the same: What is your understanding of the situation and its potential outcomes? What are your fears and what are your hopes? What are the trade-offs you are willing to make and not willing to make? And what is the course of action that best serves this understanding?”

 Ask questions, advocate as needed, and enjoy this short life with the people you love ♥My favorite quote:""This is what it means to have autonomy -- you may not control life's circumstances, but getting to be the author of your life means getting to control what you do with them.”"
39,0805095152,http://goodreads.com/user/show/83445-lisa-vegan,5,"This book is excellent. It’s accessible and always interesting. It’s one of those books that probably everybody should read. I’m thinking every physician should read it upon graduating from medical school or during their residency. I think that it’s an important book.I do disagree with him at times, though overall think what he says is spot on.The parts where I disagree are in two major areas: The main one is his reluctance about supporting widespread assisted suicide because he says in those places, palliative hospice care isn’t as advanced an offering. However, even with hospice, I’ve witnessed horrible suffering, unbearable suffering, and it seems rare that people have none of that in their last days and weeks. I think both assisted suicide and competent hospice should always be options. I think not all hospices care works very well at all, though I know that some does. The other place I disagree is his contention that genetics isn’t as crucial to longevity as I think it is, especially in those families where so many live to over 100 and, I know by knowing them, that they often do not take at all good care of themselves, living in a way where others without their genes would die at much younger ages and with more infirmities before their deaths. The gist of what he says about quality of life when aged or with a terminal illness I agree with wholeheartedly though. A lot of what he says about that and examples he gives, makes the book fun to read. I really appreciated the several very personal stories, including his father’s story. So, not only do I not want to live until end stage cancer or ALS, etc. which I’ve always known, but I have no desire to get so old or sick that I can’t take care of myself – with my situation I wouldn’t end up at one of the good places and even those wouldn’t be great for me. These are issues I’ve thought about since about age 12, and I will do anything I can to avoid physical pain, nausea, shortness of breath, and other forms of suffering. Great book for getting readers to think about what they want when they’re elderly or have a life threatening illness, and also for having conversations about their wishes, and encouraging others in their lives to also share their wishes.The best thing about the book, and I wish 100% of medical people would get on board, is the weighing of what is worth it and not worth it to patients, and facing what medicine can’t do as well as what it can do. Not lying! Not evading! Not giving false hope! Allowing patients to take the lead with their own lives! Advocating that conversations should be had with the ill/elderly and doctors shouldn’t assume they know what should be done without knowing the patients’ goals and wishes for themselves. Early in the book, a death mentioned sounded exactly like my mother in 1964-1965 – I have to read that book! Books leading to other books…I'm still laughing about the 100 loose birds!!!"
40,0805095152,http://goodreads.com/user/show/632247-chrissie,3,"Before reading: I am reading this not because I want to but because I feel I ought to. Is it going to make me feel all horrible? I can accept this if it constructively explains what you can do to ""improve"" the end of life. In conclusion: I am glad I read the book, but it wasn’t particularly fun. There are many examples given of particular people, their illnesses and the difficulties they had, one being the author’s father. I didn’t understand all the medical terms used. Examples are given to illustrate the author’s conclusions on how medical care of the aging should be altered. The author, who is himself a surgeon, shows new, better alternatives and how they came to be. He does this by naming pioneers of better nursing homes, assisted care units and hospice development. For a person in the medical field I think this book is essential because it shows how medical changes need to be and can be implemented…., but I am not employed in the medical field and the historical developments, although interesting, were a bit extraneous for me. From my point of view, these sections could have been shortened, even if they do show the direction the author is supporting. One can ask, “Who is this book for?”In my family we have had several deaths in the past years. So the weaknesses coupled to end of life medical care, nursing homes and hospices were not new to me. I didn’t have to be told; I was not surprised in the least. What I wanted from this book were guidelines showing me how I could improve my husband’s and my own end of life. Did the book do this? Well, it made me face my own situation and what lay ahead. As a result of reading this book I will be looking into what alternatives are available here in Sweden when we are no longer able to manage alone. My husband and I have discussed exactly how we see the future. It has made clear to us that we value independence and that we want to stay where we are as long as possible – even if such living may be less safe than living near a hospital. We plan on looking in to Assisted Care Facilities that offer a gradual increase of care as needs increase. Do they have queues? Are they expensive? Where are they located? The essential point is that you have to know what you are looking for and that will be different for each family. So, yes, I am glad I read the book. It made me evaluate what is important to me – nature and independence and a dog and pretty landscape. The book pushed me to do this.  Another issue the book pushes you to evaluate is how long you want to extend the years of your life even if that time is filled with pain and discomfort. This too is a personal decision. The book guides you in what sort of questions you should ask your doctor, but of course some questions are specific to the illness one is coping with. Some conclusions are drawn that may be true for many, but not for my husband and I. Generally, most seem to want more contact with family as they age. This has its difficult sides too, and the book mentions this only briefly. I think more attention could have been devoted to this topic. While funeral wishes are important to discuss at life’s end, I found it unnecessary that the author discussed the details of his father’s funeral in this book.Practically nothing is said about how the elderly no longer want to travel. I may add that if you want to travel do it when you are young and fit. I am thankful to have traveled earlier in my life. The book is primarily concerned with American facilities, and practically nothing is said about costs. The audiobook is narrated by Robert Petkoff. It is read at a good speed. When good nursing facilities were being discussed he tended to sound SO enthused, SO exuberant. Really, I found this a bit childish. It doesn’t distort the text, but exaggerates how wonderful it all is. I could have done without this. The book has made me more appreciative of what I have. It has pushed my husband and me to evaluate which qualities of life we deem most important. With a clearer understanding of our preferences we can more easily deal with what lies ahead."
41,0805095152,http://goodreads.com/user/show/730754-ken,4,"Anyone who is planning on dying some day should read this book. It can be jumpy at times, but overall, Gawande's a straight shooting, no-nonsense writer who gives the straight dope on nursing homes, assisted living, hospice, and the heart-rending decisions we are all forced into at our end-of-days. As many of his accounts deal with cancer cases, it's a bit of a downer, but it's medicine to be taken and there's no better way to illustrate his point than through real-life examples, including his own father, who developed a fatal tumor in his spinal cord. God save us all from ends like this, but sorry, we all don't get to die suddenly and peacefully in our sleep.Among topics Gawande tackles: the dearth of geriatricians in this country. So ironic. So American. But the money is not there for doctors dedicated to our fastest growing demographic. Oh. And the preventative-style approach, the in-the-moment treatments needed to keep the elderly happy? Often not paid for by insurance companies, either.He also gets into nursing home/assisted living situations, focusing on the story of an upstate NY facility where a maverick doctor/director decided to introduce parakeets and live plants in every room as well as two cats and two dogs who had the run of the place. The nurses were thrown by this -- one refused to pick up a doggy mistake on the floor because that wasn't what she got a nursing license for -- but eventually everyone saw the seismic shift this simple yet dramatic change had on the previously-listless residents. The ""inmates"" (what they felt like, previously) started to perk up, tell people about the personalities of their parakeets, take a hand in caring for both plants and birds. Meanwhile, they became entranced with the wandering dogs and cats. Those patients who were ambulatory surprised the nurses by stepping up and volunteering to walk the dogs. The director had kids visit, too, providing training to middle schoolers on how to talk even with people with Alzheimer's. The young people's two or three visits a week became events to look forward to for the elderly residents, who, between pets and children, suddenly discovered purpose and felt more like human beings, more like they used to when they were living alone.There are other variations here, too, like assisted living purposely designed in pods of smaller units, created to look more like homes and less like institutions. Chief among the changes? Allowing people some privacy -- their own rooms. Giving them more leeway on what to do, when to eat. The schedules work around the people vs. vice versa.But the bulk of the book focuses on decisions and consequences. There are no definitive moves to make once a fatal disease begins its course, but Gawande shows that it's spinning a bit out of control in too many cases. The money being spent to prolong lives, often to make those lives so much more miserable just because people refuse to accept the oldest fact of life -- death -- is truly a scary thing. Modern medicine may be many things, but it is no match for Death, who remains undefeated. Still, there is a measure of victory to be had. For many people, that may mean a shorter but higher quality amount of time with family and friends. And, paradoxically, Gawande points to studies showing that many people who choose hospice care actually live longer than those who take the harsh and risky treatment road. They have less pain. They are happier. Together, these effects lead to slightly longer days with those they love. So, if you think hospice is a white flag, think again. It's not as simple as all that. Nor is this book. It's food for thought. Not that it will get any easier for you, the reader, when such choices visit you or your loved ones (and they will), but at least you'll have a better sense of balance and perspective. Can we ask for any more than that?"
42,0805095152,http://goodreads.com/user/show/275498-jim,5,"This is a brilliantly written book, and I was super-impressed with the genius of the good Dr Gawande right up to the point where he drank water out of the Ganges...I wouldn't do that at gunpoint! But while I might question the doc's wisdom in choice of beverages, I have to say he wrote a darn fine book.All of the occupants of this globe have a single thing in common...we will all die. Hopefully, we enjoy a long life and peaceful old age before our expiry date and, thanks to modern medicine and the care of good physicians, this is getting to be the reality for more people. This presents us with another problem: caring for a growing population of oldsters who require care as they ease their way into the hereafter. Families are getting smaller, so the progeny that would have cared for ailing seniors in the past are absent, or already employed. Expensive medical treatments are being employed to attempt to extend the lives of oldsters who would have slipped away without treatment, but at what cost? Frequently the result of this practice is that the medical treatment gives the patient an agonized existence suffering from side effects.Dr Gawande believes that, in most cases, if given a choice between having some quality time with loved ones or a possibly longer painful and befuddled existence under medical care, most people will choose the quality time even though it may be shorter. And here's another point to consider: Gawande has determined that 63% of doctors overestimate the amount of time a patient has to live, and that the better the doctor knows the patient, the more likely he/she will be to overestimate the patient's remaining time.Of interest to me was the fact that he basically confirmed an old homily my Granny used to toss out from time to time: ""A son is a son 'til he gets him a wife, but a daughter's a daughter for all of her life"". Here's what Dr Gawande had to say about the matter (from P. 79):  ""your chances of avoiding the nursing home are directly related to the number of children you have, and, according to what little research has been done, having at least one daughter seems to be crucial to the amount of help you will receive.""Naturally, one cannot always expect that sons and daughters will be able to care for them. Dr Gawande is firmly on the side of those who consult a palliative care specialist (From P.177):  ""The result; those who saw a palliative care specialist stopped chemotherapy sooner, entered hospice far earlier, experienced less suffering at the end of their lives - and they lived 25 percent longer. In other words, our decision making in medicine has failed so spectacularly that we have reached the point of actually inflicting harm on patients rather than confronting the subject of mortality.""This could have been a boring book...it wasn't. Dr Gawande has the gift of imparting information without making you feel like you are being tutored. A very interesting read, particularly for those of us who are around the last curve and racing toward the finish line."

44,0805095152,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5550397-britany,4,"Atul Gawande illustrates life as you age and how families must cope with aging parents.I appreciated learning about a topic that I knew little about previously. The difficulty of what to do with the aging population is an interesting and highly debatable (if not slightly depressing) topic. Gawande shares real life client stories, including his own family. This made this book relatable, who hasn't watched an elder age and eventually pass away. The best story was the one with the home that brought in dogs, cats, birds and plants. I just loved reading about the after effects of bringing life and small responsibilities in for the elderly residents. Innovating for this demographic brought hope to this challenging time in our history and while the topic is dark, this perspective shone a tiny light of hope for the future.Would highly recommend."
45,0805095152,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6041973-josh,4,"As I sit here at work, basically doing nothing but typing this review and speaking to my fiancé on Microsoft Lync, I am drinking a cup of coffee and wondering about my mortality.  Yes, I admit, I usually think of it more than once a day, sometimes twice a day, but never 4.5 times a day because that’s actually impossible.When reading Gawande’s ‘Being Mortal’, I found myself not questioning my own life, but many others; he exposed a sense of compassion in this misanthropic heart and how the geriatric community are treated in their final days.  His views on how doctors tend to be either vague or as he puts it, ‘Mr. Informative’, (saying too much about the disease and focusing more on it than the actual patient and their well-being) is a unique perspective from a doctor that actually cares for his patients.  Now, I’m not saying that doctors, as a whole do not, but the way it seems (from my knowledgeable perspective), they go in and out of doors seeing people like paying consumers instead of human beings and making it more of a business than actually trying to treat a person, much less about their well-being.The majority of the book takes us through first-hand accounts from the author; a multitude of case studies, that state interesting statistics about subjects such as: how people in their 50’s-90’s are leaning more towards living independently; how people with a terminal illness find themselves to want to die, rather than live out their days because of the guilt on how embarrassing and burdensome they may be to loved ones; how palliative care has helped many people in having a better life at home rather than being stuck with needles and prolonging their inevitable death in a place they hate to be (somewhat contradictory, yet for good reason, many that go through palliative care or hospice tend to live slightly longer than if they were laid up inside a hospital due to the quality of care towards the patient and not the disease); and how it takes courage to let go when no other option is available.His insight on these subjects is based on a close, personal relationship.  He saw how his own father dealt with terminal cancer for many years, but also used the methods of care listed above and it ended up being the right call; his father lived a lot longer than if he would’ve had extremely intrusive surgery and only had mild suffering, but always in a conscious state knowing what was being done to him, enjoying things before his final breath.Overall, I found much of the information helpful on drawing my own opinions on the matter and opened my eyes to other aspects.Many may find this book depressing because it deals with a subject that we cannot control ultimately, but with understanding and acceptance, we can manage the best we can."
46,0805095152,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7392004-quo,5,"I suspect that what makes some teachers revered is not just a mastery of the subject they mean to impart but that they also have retained an elemental sense of being a learner as well. One of the facets that impressed me most about Atul Gawande's Being Mortal: Medicine & What Matters in the End is that the author conveys the importance of the essential dialogue between doctor & patient by asking himself how he would like to be treated if he were the patient and not the medical specialist. To suggest that this is an important book is almost to diminish it, for Dr. Gawande involves the reader not just in reviewing a series of case studies & other background detail on how each of us attempts to deal with our own mortality but also causes something very personal to take place, the rare sensation of being spoken to directly in a meaningful, compassionate manner. For, as people become aware of the finitude of their life, they do not ask for much. They do not seek riches, they do not seek more power. They ask only to be permitted, insofar as possible, to keep shaping the story of their life in the world--to make choices & to sustain connections to others according to their own priorities.I found Being Mortal a treasure in many gradually unfolding ways. For example, little gerontological training occurs as a component part of medical school, so much so that many doctors feel they are often unable to offer treatment as much as the lure of hope. Dr. Gawande comments thatThere is almost always a long trail of possibility, however slim. However, we have built a multi-trillion dollar edifice for dispensing the medical equivalent of lottery tickets, while having only a rudimentary system to prepare patients for the near certainty that those tickets will not win. Hope is not a plan.Thus, 63% of M.D.'s overestimate survival time, not wanting to trample a patient's hopes, while only 17% underestimate survival time. Interestingly, if a doctor knows a patient well, he or she is more likely to be overly optimistic, ""even to the point of engaging in fantasy about experimental drugs to cure a patient or to extend life in an unrealistic way."" There are many humorous anecdotes which serve to relieve, at least in part, the difficult task of considering one's own mortality in this book, one being Philip Roth's comment that ""Old age is not a battle, it's a massacre."" And the late Harvard scientist & gifted writer, Prof. Steven Jay Gould, wistfully observed that ""the medium isn't always the message"", preferring the more realistic view of death as the ultimate enemy and finding nothing reproachable about those who ""rage against the dying of the light"", borrowing words from Dylan Thomas. Gould lived an additional 20 years after his original diagnosis. Another funny inclusion occurs when General Custer is compared with General Robert E. Lee, with the latter knowing when the battle could not be won.Included among the meaningful case studies is the story of Karen Brown Wilson on the west coast who develops a model for extended care or assisted living as an alternative to conventional nursing homes, though her new paradigm is quickly absorbed into a corporate structure & radically changed. Also, Dr. Bill Thomas in upstate New York, a restless Harvard Med School grad decides to attempt a new model for nursing homes, concluding that ""what was missing was life itself."" He introduces pets aplenty, including dogs, cats, birds and also inserts plants in each room to help confront the 3 plagues of nursing home existence: boredom, loneliness & helplessness. And, in so doing, he alters the relationship of patient to nursing home. Lastly, Dr. Atul Gawande's own father, also a surgeon & born in India, deals with his own mortality and when afflicted with cancer, he attempts to reinvent his life in a meaningful way during his remaining days by performing community service as a Rotarian and extending his ministry to a school he founded in his native India. Ultimately, Atul Gawande concludes that our ultimate goal should not be a good death but a good life till the very end and that assisted living is far more difficult than assisted death. In spite of the notion that every life ends in an execution, so to speak, there are countless uplifting vignettes of people dealing with their own mortality in a positive manner & with great courage in Dr. Gawande's wonderful book, Being Mortal and also in a one hour television episode of ""Frontline"", available via the Internet."

“Death is the enemy. But the enemy has superior forces. Eventually, it wins. And in a war that you cannot win, you don’t want a general who fights to the point of total annihilation. You don’t want Custer. You want Robert E. Lee, someone who knows how to fight for territory that can be won and how to surrender it when it can’t, someone who understands that the damage is greatest if all you do is battle to the bitter end.”

 “We’ve been wrong about what our job is in medicine. We think our job is to ensure health and survival. But really it is larger than that. It is to enable well-being.” 
This is not an easy simple-read. It is a brain-storming perspective-changing book.In all our modern medical learning and practice we aim at making life last ""longer"", but we should make it feel ""better""We try to elongate the lives of the elder, or the ""life"" of their bodies/corpses. Using unjustified mechanical ventilation, Inotropic support, unjustified high-risk operations and the result is an end-of-life ""lived"" in hospitals.
 “A few conclusions become clear when we understand this: that our most cruel failure in how we treat the sick and the aged is the failure to recognize that they have priorities beyond merely being safe and living longer; that the chance to shape one’s story is essential to sustaining meaning in life; that we have the opportunity to refashion our institutions, our culture, and our conversations in ways that transform the possibilities for the last chapters of everyone’s lives.” 

 “I learned about a lot of things in medical school, but mortality wasn’t one of them. Although I was given a dry, leathery corpse to dissect in my first term, that was solely a way to learn about human anatomy. Our textbooks had almost nothing on aging or frailty or dying. How the process unfolds, how people experience the end of their lives, and how it affects those around them seemed beside the point. The way we saw it, and the way our professors saw it, the purpose of medical schooling was to teach how to save lives, not how to tend to their demise.” 
This book is about how can we make life worth-living when we are too frail, too fragile, vulnerable and dependent.Our societies confronts these circumstances by avoiding talking about them, we all deny death, deny talking about it until it is too late.We designed nurseries to control the elder, their safety and their privacy and to make their lives impervious to change . . And the result is a life supposed to be safe, but empty of everything they care about.
 “It is not death that the very old tell me they fear. It is what happens short of death—losing their hearing, their memory, their best friends, their way of life. As Felix put it to me, “Old age is a continuous series of losses.” Philip Roth put it more bitterly in his novel Everyman: “Old age is not a battle. Old age is a massacre.” 
in this book you learn how to listen to them, to acknowledge their fears and how to feel their hopes. You will learn that death is inevitable, that you should respect death, you should respect aging, you should talk about it, and above all you should truly ""live"" to the very end of your life.
 “The problem with medicine and the institutions it has spawned for the care of the sick and the old is not that they have had an incorrect view of what makes life significant. The problem is that they have had almost no view at all. Medicine’s focus is narrow. Medical professionals concentrate on repair of health, not sustenance of the soul. Yet—and this is the painful paradox—we have decided that they should be the ones who largely define how we live in our waning days.” 

 “Sometimes we can offer a cure, sometimes only a salve, sometimes not even that. But whatever we can offer, our interventions, and the risks and sacrifices they entail, are justified only if they serve the larger aims of a person’s life. When we forget that, the suffering we inflict can be barbaric. When we remember it the good we do can be breathtaking.” 

 “Our ultimate goal, after all, is not a good death but a good life to the very end.” 

 “Death, of course, is not a failure. Death is normal. Death may be the enemy, but it is also the natural order of things.”

Should we want them to? At what cost – not to society or to our wallets, but at what cost to our humanity and dignity? Atul Gawunde, a surgeon in Boston Massachusetts, explores the ways in which medicine (and specifically American medicine and American society) helps and hinders the aged, the infirm, and the dying. If you know anyone who will someday die … stop reading this review and read this book.As he did in his previous books, Gawunde gives clear information and asks probing questions. He does not necessarily try to give us THE answer, but he does propose some alternatives, ultimately leaving the final answer up to each and every one of us. Having helped both my parents face their mortal ends, I can tell you that my family members and I – brothers, sister-in-law, and husband – have had many discussions about these issues over the past several years. Some of the physicians we encountered were open to such frank discussion, but not all were. There are difficult issues, heart-wrenching dilemmas, and anxiety-producing situations. But they do not get less difficult, less anxiety-producing, or less heart-wrenching when we ignore them. Oliver Sacks wrote the following blurb: “We have come to medicalize aging, frailty, and death, treating them as if they were just one more clinical problem to overcome. However it is not only medicine that is needed in one’s declining years but life – a life with meaning, a life as rich and full as possible under the circumstances. Being Mortal is not only wise and deeply moving, it is an essential and insightful book for our times…” WHY are you still reading this review? Read the book … NOW! Think carefully about what you want, and then talk about it – to your family, your friends, your doctors. Encourage them to read the book, too. Robert Petkoff does a superb job reading the audio book. There is a bonus interview with the author at the end of the audio version. "
49,0805095152,http://goodreads.com/user/show/24882791-india-m-clamp,4,"“Is empathy and kindness standard in geriatric medicine?” Why did Dr. Gawande find it disconcerting how old/frail patients are being treated? Why are parents cared for---as if they were made of gold---better in India?Truly an arduous journey on a path laden with geriatric patients and a transformation from independence to its’ opposite. This imposing trudge into considerations, care and realities of mortality and “how hope is an elixir.” Most elegantly summarized. Gawande writes: “Being Mortal is about the struggle to cope with the strength of our biology. We think our job is to insure health and survival but it is to enable well-being.” This communicates the goal for all engaging in the practice of medicine. This book is not for shy, sensitive or frail as it's an honest and blatantly truthful aperçu of what is/was observed by Dr. Gawande in geriatric medicine today. Educational and somber. Must read for all physicians. Buy and keep Kleenex on stand-by."
50,0805095152,http://goodreads.com/user/show/10312986-lyn-elliott,5,"We all want to live independent lives but as we age we are likely to lose at least some elements of that independence. This is easy to acknowledge, not so easy to come to terms with and certainly not easy to prepare for.Gawande's book is essential reading for anyone who is ageing themselves, or for anyone caring for somebody who is ill or frail enough to be approaching a state of dependency. Reading this has helped me to be aware of the questions I need to ask myself and those I care about. You can't ever assume you know what someone else really wants to do with their lives as they become dependent, or as they near death.How can you live well till the end, avoiding medically institutionalised interactions, treatments and living space? I wish I had read this before my parents became frail and certainly well before their last illnesses. This was an unusual book club choice, but then it's a great group of women. Not a wimp amongst us. "
51,0805095152,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2375838-cheryl,5,"There is a long phase in the first parts of our lives where, if we are lucky enough to have avoided critical disease or injury, we are blithely unaware of the effects of aging and of the inevitability of death. It seems so far ahead in the future as to be imaginary. Like imagining what a trillion dollars is like. You know that is a real thing, but still…it seems impossible to know what it really is. The other day I said to my teenage daughter, “Just imagine, in only forty years from now you will be standing in the kitchen with your partner and asking the same questions I’m asking now, like “When can we retire and go do what we really want?” “ She snorted. “Forty years? That’s ages from now!” And I’m saying, “no, forty years isn’t long at all! You will be planning your retirement!”She doesn’t really believe it.I sort of wish I had that back again. Those days of childhood, adolescence, young adulthood, where we never gave a thought to retirement, to aging, to death. Later on in life, we end up sometimes dwelling too much on those things, as if to make up for our inattention earlier. Nowadays, I sometimes feel hyper-aware of the universality of disease, the effects of aging, and shuffling off the mortal coil. It is unavoidable - I stare at it through the microscope daily as a pathologist. I often wonder which of those diseases that we hand out like playing cards will be the one dealt to me. “There’s no escaping the tragedy of life., which is that we are all aging from the day we are born… This experiment of making mortality a medical experience is just decades old. And the evidence is it is failing.”“Our reluctance to honestly examine the experience of aging and dying has increased the harm we inflict on people and denied them the basic comforts they most need.”The chapters of the book follow the course of our lives, and are richly illustrated with examples from Gawande’s own family and from his medical practice. Their stories are woven through the book, providing compelling and touching portraits. They are us. We are independent beings who are increasingly living longer and living independently longer.But ‘Things Fall Apart.’ “The culprit is just the accumulated crumbling of one’s bodily systems while medicine carries out its maintenance measures and patch jobs""“Human beings fail the way all complex systems fail: randomly and gradually…as the defects in a complex system increase, the time comes when just one more defect is enough to impair the whole, resulting in the condition known as frailty. It happens to power plants, cars, and large organizations. And it happens to us: eventually, one too many joints are damaged, one too many arteries calcify. There are no more backups. We wear down until we can’t wear down anymore.”So gradually, as the losses accumulate, we become Dependent. We need increasing amounts of Assistance, often in the form of retirement or nursing homes. These tend to provide an institutionalized life — that is not a good life, it’s just as good as can be got in the circumstances. But that robs us of our autonomy and our ability to make choices and to shape the story of our life in the world. “Whatever the limits and travails we face, we want to retain the autonomy—the freedom—to be the authors of our lives. This is the very marrow of being human” New models of care are evolving though, so people like 94 year old Lou are “…still able to live in a way that made him feel that he still had a place in this world.” I found this chapter particularly encouraging. The chapters on Letting Go and Hard Conversations are thoughtful, valuable discussions not only for clinical physicians, nurses and other members of the health care team, but also for anyone — patient, family, friend — who has reached that place where the end of life is in sight. “Technological society has forgotten what scholars call the “dying role” and its importance to people as life approaches its end. People want to share memories, pass on wisdoms and keepsakes, settle relationships, establish their legacies, make peace with God, and ensure that those who are left behind will be okay. They want to end their stories on their own terms.”Finally, Courage. “At least two kinds of courage are required in aging and sickness. The first is the courage to confront the reality of mortality—the courage to seek out the truth of what is to be feared and what is to be hoped.” We need the courage to act on the truth we find. One has to decide whether one’s fears or one’s hopes are what should matter most.This was a profoundly enriching book. It should be required reading for all health care professionals who work with seriously ill patients, and for those who work with the aged, and for those who run our health care systems, and for those who have aging/ill parents/relatives, and for those who are embarking on those final passages, and in some ways especially for those who haven’t yet reached those phases, so that they will be better prepared. It is intelligent, rational, touching, and warmly profound. It is a classic. "
52,0805095152,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4146473-connie,5," I read this a while ago, and it is a book that comes up quite often in conversation, and one that I highly recommend. For medical students, Dr's, nurses, anyone who works in medicine, anyone with aging parents and quite frankly anyone who is aging. Pretty much everyone I know. When talking about it I realized that though I remember it well and recommend it I had never written a review. So here you go. One of the first chapters tells the story of the author when he was shadowing a family practitioner. An elderly woman came in with her main complaint of heart issues. She also commented on poor balance and the Dr noted weight loss. The young writer was confused when the Dr. asked her if she ate alone. More confusion when the physician commented on her pretty manicure, which the patient proudly said she did herself. When the doctor asked her to remove her shoes, the young student was even more perplexed. Came to be that the older physician realized she could not trim her toenails, and they were hurting in her shoes, causing her to change her gait...and at a risk for losing her balance and falling. Another concern was her weight loss, as she did not eat well due to eating alone. She was much frailer and he worried a fall may result in a broken hip or worse. He recommended a podiatrist and that her family try to eat several meals with her throughout the week. He told the young student that he could give medicine for the heart....but a fall with a break would cause much distress and change in her quality of life. This is the basis of this book. Physicians need to learn to look at the whole person, not just the complaint. So often we see a ""specialist"" whose focus is on what they specialize in, and they miss the other signs. Believe me, I have seen this happen. Yet I have also seen those who look at the big picture and those folks are the ones I would want to care for me. We are often so busy trying to live longer. Yet sometimes, or often it is the ""quality"" not the ""quantity"" of our lives that matter. This author delves into this issue with first hand knowledge of patients he has treated as well as his own family members. He admits how hard it is to step back and not always have to ""fix"" everything, but learn to listen to what is important to his patient. We can all learn this lesson. How do we picture the end of our lives? What do we really need to do to achieve that?  This is a book that makes you think about aging, aging in place and aging well. It makes you think about maintaining dignity. I know I thought of this often with family members who were facing the end of life, and I often had to stop and listen to what it was that was important to them, not to me. I only hope that someone allows me that same choice."
53,0805095152,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7958239-elizabeth-theiss,5,"When is it time to stop fighting disease and death, and work instead on the best quality of life possible? Gawande has given us a wise and thoughtful discussion of how to approach the question, one I found helpful and convincing.As always Gawande uses stories to demonstrate the problems attendant to the medicalization of death. Doctors are trained to treat death as the enemy, not death as the inevitable. In an effort to forestall the inevitable, doctors' use every available tool from invasive surgeries to brutal successive chemo therapies that leave patients, that is, people, lingering in pain. As in The Checklist Manifesto, Gawande's solution is simple, a short set of questions that doctors should ask patients nearing the end of their lives. The conversation centers around what is most important to the person; what immediate goals are central; and what trade-offs between length of life and quality of life a person is willing to make. Gawande's ideas about nursing homes as places to avoid are spot on as well. His description of these ""homes"" driven by staff's needs for cookie cutter treatment of residents From assembly line pill dispensing to early morning shower times are downright depressing. We just sprang my husband from a month in a nursing home and it was exactly as described. But alternatives do exist, some better than others. The key seems to be finding a place that allows individual autonomy and provides support for quality of life. The one element ignored here is the cost of this kind of support; it is out of the reach of most people who need it and not supported by Medicare, despite the fact that it is less expensive than a traditional nursing home. My father was fortunate to live out the last two years of his life in a truly wonderful care center with a home-like environment, a small number of house mates, and home cooked meals each night. Gawande made me think we should just tear down the old ones and start over.I have spent a good deal of time thinking about these questions and problems as I helped my father through Alzheimer's and my spouse through 23 years of Parkinson's disease. Gawande has it exactly right and I'm hoping Being Mortal is a best seller so doctors and everyone else benefits from his perspective on what a good life and a good death means."
54,0805095152,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1608124-dana-stabenow,5,"I give this book five stars not because I loved it but because it is what I would call a necessary read, and I mean necessary for everyone, young, old, medical professional and laity alike. It's about That Conversation, what Gawande calls in one chapter ""Hard Conversations."" The subject is how we want to live out the end of our life.Gawande is a surgeon and one of the best parts of this book is that he is learning how to have this conversation himself. He's learning how to do it as a medical professional with his patients, and he's not shy about telling us where and how he has screwed up. He is also learning how to do it as a son to his father, also a surgeon, who has been diagnosed with a rare spinal tumor.The difficulty, he writes, is that in the last fifty years we have learned how to prolong life.As recently as 1945, most deaths occurred in the home. By the 1980s, just 17 percent did...Across not just the United States but also the entire industrialized world, the experience of advanced aging and death has shifted to hospitals and nursing homes...You don't have to spend much time with the elderly or those with terminal illness to see how often medicine fails the people it is supposed to help...Our reluctance to honestly examine the experience of aging and dying has increased the harm we inflict on people and denied them the basic comforts they most need.Later he writes You'd think people would have rebelled. You'd think we would have burned the nursing homes to the ground.But we haven't, and new discoveries and better medical practice mean that citizens of industrialized nations are living longer, healthier lives. ""A life,"" Gawande writes, ""designed to be safe but empty of anything they care about."" The trick now is to make sure our aging populations are not just safe, or even--heresy! sacrilege!--not safe at all, but living a life that achieves quality of life, not just quantity. The good news is, things are changing. (He doesn't say so but you know it has everything to do with the Boomers, a generation now making decisions for their parents, and who will soon be making those decisions--or not--for themselves.) Keren Brown Wilson built the first assisted living facility in Oregon in 1980, and when that concept became bastardized people like Dr. Tom Wilson revolutionized an assisted living facility with two dogs, four cats, 100 parakeets and child care for employees that brought children back into the lives of the inmates (using that word deliberately, as Gawande does himself). Researchers studied the effects of this program over two years, comparing a variety of measures for Chase's residents with those of residents at another nursing home nearby. Their study found that the number of prescriptions required per resident fell to half that of the control nursing home. Psychotropic drugs for agitation, like Haldol, decreased in particular. The total drug costs fell to just 38 percent of the comparison facility. Deaths fell 15 percent.From inmates locked away from life, warehoused until they died, Dr. Wilson's patients became once again members of a community. And as Gawande goes on to say, this experiment and others like it are beginning all across the nation.There is also Hospice, which organization Gawande's father chooses to help him through the end of his life with palliative care. For Hospice, it's all about making the end of each individual story as valuable to them as is physically possible for them. It's impossible to say enough good things about Hospice and Gawande doesn't stint them here. (Full disclosure: I already support Hospice and this book is making me double that support this year.) I know it sounds a little macabre, but this is the one book you really should read. Make a teenager read it and they will understand that much more about what Grandma is going through. Make a Millennial read it and he'll understand in spades how important that retirement plan is and how they should start one now. Make your doctor read it and she'll see how important first asking those essential questions is, ""What do you want? What is most important to you?"" instead of automatically reaching for the scalpel or the drugs. ""Death,"" writes Gawandeis normal. Death may be the enemy, but it is also the natural order of things. I knew these truths abstractly, but I didn't know them concretely--that they could be truths not just for everyone but also for this person right in front of me, for this person I was responsible for.Me, either. Now I feel like I do. Read this book, and recommend it to everyone you know. It is very frank, very well written, and actually? Kind of hopeful.****See also on Vox, ""2015 is the year America started having a sane conversation about death,"" http://www.vox.com/2015/12/16/1011744...."
55,0805095152,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3897817-morgan-blackledge,5,"This is a heart wrenchingly moving and important book. It speaks directly to our cultures strained and distant relationship to aging, the elderly, death and dying. Rarely if ever have I heard a medical clinician speak with such vulnerability and humility about the limits of modern medicine.French cultural theorist and urbanist Paul Virilio observed, with every invention or technical advance, an equally powerful disaster is co-created, for example, when we invented the locomotive, we simultaneously invented the train wreck.In a sense, Being Mortal is Dr. Atul Gawande's analogous observation about the incredible benefits of advanced medicine and the unprecedented opportunities for prolonged suffering and denial it affords us. I'm so grateful to be alive in this time, and science and technology have everything to do with that. Ordinary people have never had as much freedom to pursue knowledge or self expression as we currently enjoy.Advanced medicine is central to the high standard of living we currently have. It prolongs our lives and reduces suffering in many ways that we completely take for granted. But in a real sense, our faith in technology and medical advances has lulled us to sleep on some of life's most important and philosophical, psychological, and spiritual issues. Those of impermanence, suffering, loss and mortality.Our culture does a phenomenal job of keeping death and suffering out of plain sight. This affords the individuals facing these challenges the privacy and professional care that most people chose if given the option.This represents a real advance. But the equally powerful disaster that accompanies this advance is not trivial. The fact that most of us now live the majority of our lives insulated from the reality of death and dying means that we are quite likely to be utterly naive and under developed in this important existential domain.Frankly speaking, these are difficult and unsightly truths most of us would rather defer encountering. In the short term we enjoy the bliss that ignorance affords, but in the long term we suffer the numerous negative consequences that accompany the unexamined life.This book is attempting to address this issue by presenting us with a sober but empathetic and even optimistic view of the end of the road. Highly recommended, five stars."

58,0805095152,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4342402-tl,5,"See Caroline's review here:https://www.goodreads.com/review/show... (her review convinced me to pick this up)----She says it all beautifully so I will add my thoughts here (this'll be fairly short mostly cause my head hurts right now).This book brings up topics most of us don't think about when we are young. It seems too far away to contemplate so we put it out of our minds. Sure, we may talk about it time to time with our loved ones but how many of give it serious thought until something happens, let alone what questions to ask?The subject matter is a bit weighty in here but never felt dry or boring. There's feeling and passion  here. Gawande transports you into what he is talking about, like you are sitting with him at his kitchen table. The personal stories and histories he shares throughout the book were in turns touching and very informative. Of the former, a few had me tearing up and wanting to hug them all. The latter fascinated me, as I didn't know how those things all came about (one of those ""it has always been around"" that you just don't explore further) .I agreed with him on alot of the things he said and it got me thinking about my wishes on the future as well. Hopefully this will help with the hard conversation in the future (even though we wish we could live forever).This is an important book that should be on the bookshelves of everyone, in my humble opinion. Highly recommended.(Excuse any errors, typing on my phone)Narrator: Five starsBonus interview with the author was a nice touch."
59,0805095152,http://goodreads.com/user/show/28602001-emma,5,"An incredible book, but one that has the potential to cause considerable distress.‘Being Mortal’ is a book that addresses the experience of dying in modern society and questions whether we are getting it right. Chapters 1-5 focus primarily on mortality and the diverse nature of the end of life care provided for the elderly. Chapters 6-8 deal more specifically with how those with serious or terminal illnesses, and their families, cope with the process of dying. In these later chapters, the stories related by Gawande are frequently those in which the suffering and death of individuals is caused by cancer, including that of his own father. Though dying is an event that eventually comes to us all, it is a subject that is inherently difficult to address. In talking about our mortality, each person must confront not only the idea of their own death, but that of those who matter to them. It is entirely understandable that people choose to avoid discussing it. Yet Gawande’s book shows why it is important for everybody to stop putting aside the conversation about dying; that, in fact, refusing to tackle death until it is right upon you can lead to much greater pain and suffering. It is at this point when medical intervention takes over, often at the expense of compassion. Medical professionals would do well to read this book as part of their training and development, if only to understand how important honest communication can be to patient outcomes. They are only human, and as such, may feel as awkward about such matters as the rest of us, but they have a duty to provide accurate/truthful information about an individual’s illnesses/conditions so that they can have realistic expectations. Gawande argues that instead of defaulting to the most aggressive form of medical intervention, it is more important to talk to the individual about their goals, what is most important to them, what they can and can’t live with, what their fears and concerns are, what trade offs they are willing to make. Through discussion, a better path can be found for those who may be in pain or who are coming to the end of their life. Such conversations are necessarily incredibly difficult but Gawande highlights the benefits of having a plan put together by the individual, their family, and the medical professionals in collaboration; it is this honest dialogue that will allow an individual to manage their illness and the end of their life in a way that suits their needs. Gawande’s argument is empowering, it promotes the active role of the individual as the centre of their care and what happens to them. Within each chapter, Gawande often addresses what has happened in the past, what is happening now (including in different parts of the world), how people are trying to change things, and what the focus for the future should be. This plan means that the book is not depressing; it highlights the failures but injects positivity by showing ways in which things are being improved, or can/should be improved. At no point does Gawande fall into pessimism, he believes that while the majority of systems and institutions may not be meeting the needs of individuals right now, there is a chance that more of them will do so in the future. The book is his way of showing the difference between what is, and what should be, including examples of people and places that are getting it right. Importantly, Gawande is not prescriptive. He does not say ‘this is THE way to do things’, instead he shows how different solutions are being implemented. The variety of solutions reflect the multitude of differing ways people want and need to approach their ill health, old age, and death.       ‘Being Mortal’ is incredibly difficult to review. Given that I agree with Gawande, it would be easy to say that everyone should read this book. Yet in saying that, it feels like I am telling people that they need to deal with the idea of their death as soon as possible and, if they are currently unwell, that they should open a dialogue with their doctor to plan how they want it to proceed. It sounds more challenging when phrased this way, and is it not truly understandable that someone may not want to deal with the idea of their death by calmly talking through the steps? At the same time, I fundamentally believe Gawande’s argument that honest communication is the way forward for those who are living with terminal illness. Perhaps this is because I would rather make my own decisions while I can, and not leave them for others, who may have to guess what I might want in emergency situations if I hadn’t made my thoughts clear. The role of friends and family as support network seems intrinsically opposed to making these hard choices, the love and hope with which these decisions are made might not be compatible with the path I would want. Neither, perhaps, would the medical intervention. In modern society, people have become a medical problem to be solved, they must be ‘made safe’, increasingly separated from the rest of society and even from themselves, thereby removing any chance at individuality or choice. The problem is exacerbated by the disconnection between what medicine can do and what it should do. Gawande treats the grave and emotive subject matter with respect and conviction. At the end of someone’s life, or as they cope with ill health, he wants people to be able to have choices, to focus on what’s important to the , and to be supported in those goals by everyone around them. This is what I will hope for. "
60,0805095152,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2231715-lewis-weinstein,5,"This book is not pleasant to read. It is challenging, emotional, difficult ... and a spectacular journey along a path we will all follow. As we face the inevitable, Gawande gives us a framework within which to consider the options we may have, the choices we might want to make, and the medical and/or other assistance we may or may not desire. His thoughtful discussion of the people he has accompanied through their dying days, including his father, provides much to stimulate our own thoughts. The central theme is that these decisions should be, to the maximum possible extent, the patient's, with family and medical input, and not the other way around. In Gawande's experience that process, difficult and uncertain as it may be, yields the best results for all those involved."
61,0805095152,http://goodreads.com/user/show/10770371-dan,5,"Being Mortal by Atul GawandeGawande, as a surgeon, steps us through the reality of life’s waning moments. There is a heavy focus on cancer and old age and decisions around hospice care. Not easy subject matter but very useful information. I didn’t get choked up until the end of the book when the author takes us through the last few months of his father’s life as he battled cancer. The US is different from nearly all other countries in the world in how we deal with the elderly. As Americans we don’t live with aging parents and by extension a significant percentage of the elderly are put into retirement homes when they can no longer maintain independence. Gawande points out that our bodies are like machines and quite literally wear out. Most end of life situations spend a great deal of time on pain management and medications and often in the waning days, an inability to digest food.Some interesting facts. “By the age of sixty, people in an industrialized country like the United States have lost, on average, a third of their teeth. After eighty-five, almost 40 percent have no teeth at all.”Philip Roth said “Old age is not a battle. Old age is a massacre.”Gawande also discusses Do Not Resuscitate directives. There is part of a chapter where he recalls interning at a Boston area hospital. On one night he forgets that a patient had signed a DNR. When the patient goes into cardiac arrest, it sets in motion the CPR team to come revive the patient. When Gawande realizes his mistake and tries to call it off he is pushed aside. When the revival effort fails he is tongue lashed by the CPR team. The author feels very strongly about the value of hospice care. Almost everyone, if given the choice, would choose to die at home versus the hospital but the latter situation is still the norm. Sometimes because others have to make the medical decisions when the elderly become incapacitated. 4.5 stars. The writing here is easy to follow and the stories are quite compelling. There is also a lot of practical advice. The book was published in 2014. Highly recommended."
62,0805095152,http://goodreads.com/user/show/8079403-max,5,"This is an important book, whether you are approaching old age or family or friends you care about are. It set my mind spinning thinking how I would deal with the situations Gawande describes. Coming face to face with one’s decline and death is at least depressing and can be terrifying. Gawande points out that the medical profession and most of our institutions are not designed to deal with the human problem. He identifies a number of changes that could be made at a policy level that would improve things. But the fundamental problem is knowing ourselves and communicating our wishes or helping loved ones to reflect and do the same. Gawande points to helpful experiences with hospice care, but we must first make that decision. My notes follow.Gawande explains how growing old has changed and how we in developed countries have adjusted or failed to adjust to it. As the twentieth century wore on medicine made great advances and people’s life spans increased significantly. At the beginning of the century people would stay relatively healthy as they aged until they met a devastating disease, say the flu or cancer or heart disease. These would usually kill people rather quickly and they would die in their homes near friends and family. Now modern medicine fixes most of these problems, at least temporarily, so as people age their health ratchets down step by step. Eventually many of us will be unable to care for ourselves while the doctors keep us alive. There are in home services available and assisted living facilities for those who can afford them. But for the average person without significant savings this is a serious financial as well as personal dilemma and too often ends with a person’s final days spent in an impersonal nursing home.Both medical care for the elderly and institutional care suffer from the same problem – task orientation rather than people orientation. Doctors are trained to fix your issue and keep you alive, not evaluate the impact on your overall quality of life. Similarly institutions for the elderly are designed to meet set goals: To keep you safe, ensure you get your medications, get you fed, keep you clean, etc. The staff is rated on these things and focus on them, but they create an environment their residents typically hate. And of course many institutions don’t meet even basic standards. So the modern way of growing old often means becoming disabled enough to have to leave your home with little choice but to share a room with a stranger in an institutional environment. Gawande paints a grim picture of our future, but he also points to people trying to change things. These people are focused more on care than treatment. The woman who pioneered assisted living was looking for an alternative to the nursing home, not a stepping stone as it too often is. Others have tried to change the focus of nursing homes to enrich the lives of the residents through measures that allow more autonomy to the residents and less regimentation. The design of nursing homes can make them seem more like real homes and less like institutions. The more residents can participate, have choices, have outside interests, the better they will feel and do. Efficiency and safety have to be balanced against their effect on the patient’s quality of life. Throughout life we take reasonable chances to get more out of living. Why should that stop when time becomes short, when it is most precious?Gawande discusses terminal illness and the inevitable decision of whether to stop treatment. Doctors tend not to be helpful. They give choices of your treatment options. That is their job. But today there is hospice and palliative care. When is this a reasonable choice? The decision is personal. Doctors and family can’t really make it which is why drawing out the feelings of the patient is so important. From Gawande’s examples there is clearly a point in which treatment does more harm than good. We all want to die with some dignity and as little pain as possible. We all would rather die in a bed where we can say goodbye to friends and family rather than on a respirator in an ICU. But it is difficult to give up hope that the next procedure might work or buy us significant time. The decision is a tradeoff to achieve some quality of life at the end. Gawande talks about his own father’s case. His father, also a doctor, had terminal cancer and was facing paralysis. It took what Gawande calls the hard conversation to make the decision to accept hospice and the inevitable. In a testimony to the notion that the most sophisticated doctor may not be the best choice to initiate this conversation, Gawande’s father’s feelings were skillfully drawn out by a small town nurse practitioner from the local hospice. She was interested in him, his problems as he saw them, not in the disease and its treatment."
63,0805095152,http://goodreads.com/user/show/9049915-james-barker,5,"It is commonly phrased that we battle illness. But this remarkable book by Atul Gawande points out that it is an ill-thought battle and, dare I say it, an ill-fought one.For the last three years of my wonderful mother’s life I was her carer. Coping with the advanced stages of multiple sclerosis she was mostly restricted to her bed (which was in fact a hospital bed delivered to our family home along with all the other paraphernalia of sickness), permanently catheterised, unable to walk or do anything for herself. Mom also had severe dementia and often mistook me for my recently-deceased Dad. As an immersive carer I managed a team of women who assisted me in the day with my mother’s personal care. The rest of the time I sat with her, or fed her, or tried to unblock her catheter (while going out of my mind), or sang with her. Naturally, the last activity was the most enjoyable. Despite her dementia, Mom had a seemingly inexhaustible trove of perfectly-remembered lyrics in her head. We sang Doris Day songs, the Bellamy Brothers, the Beautiful South, the Beatles, Tori Amos, the Hollies, Cyndi Lauper, the Mama and Papas, Simon and Garfunkel, ABBA, songs from musicals. Even new songs she had only heard once we tackled together. Somehow she remembered these lyrics too.But 16 months before Mom passed away she developed septicaemia and was rushed into hospital. Her organs were shutting down, her pulse was weak and fading fast. We were told her quality of life was so bad, her disability so extreme, that the hospital was to offer no treatment- it would be kinder to let her go.We didn’t. I won’t go into the whys and wherefores of that decision but at least one of my sisters- who had driven in terror the 150 miles from where she lived- thought that letting go would be an idea we should not entertain and I wavered, full of love for this extraordinary woman who had been the life and soul of any party when I was growing up, rock and rolling on the dance floor, full of fast wit and laughter that was infectious in its affirmation of life. The doctor in charge asked me for one piece of evidence that suggested my mother had any quality of life at all. We sing every day- we sing together all the time, I said. So he treated her and somehow, over 7 long and painful weeks, she became well enough to be sent back home and into my care.But what did this ‘well enough’ mean? Mom was no longer capable of swallowing so had had a peg inserted into her stomach. I was trained in the art of its upkeep- everyday the wound needed to be cleaned and the peg rotated 360 degrees (otherwise it would fuse to her skin). Any strength Mom had had in her arms had gone. To all intents and purposes she was incapable of moving anything but her head (a fraction), her eyes and mouth. But by and large Mom slept, in a virtual coma that meant our daily songs felt like a golden time remembered and grieved from the perspective of a new time of horrors. Three days after returning home and in a fever caused by kidney stones that were trying to be passed (another tier of Hell) Mom whispered to me, “I have had enough.”But of course it didn’t end there. Mom stayed in a limbo of pain and half-consciousness for well over another year. She would emit blood-curdling screams when being cleaned, when being moved, but she did not sing. Fed a noxious mixture through a machine, one of the few joys she had had left (sucking on a piece of chocolate or enjoying slow mouthfuls of a home-cooked dinner) had gone. It struck me sitting beside her that we had consigned her to an exit that was barbarous and devoid of love. All I could do was ensure she was as comfortable as possible and that, on the occasions she was awake, she could see that I was there, smiling at her and telling her I loved her more than the world.When the end time came we were told on three separate occasions that today was the day. But a little woman of 5’2”, ranked a Zero by hospital doctors when her ability was assessed, she defied every professional speculation and breathed on another day, then another, then another. When she died in November 2012, a few weeks shy of her 68th birthday, I have truly never seen such peace on a face.In the last year of her life Mom had been well enough on a handful of occasions to wake and smile at me and sing with me. One of these occasions I captured on video. We sit together, smiling, singing ‘Zip A Dee Doo Dah,’ (my oh my what a wonderful day) and she tells me she loves me. An exquisite moment that I am glad I captured. But was it really worth the 16 months of Hell she went through?Atul Gawande’s book is all about acceptance of our mortality. But it is about much more than that. Modern medicine has it wrong, he says. It is about preserving life at all costs- battle for a year through procedure after procedure rather than enjoy your remaining months of life at the best possible quality. Yes, it turns out the emergency room where my mother ended up in 2011 made the right call and we did not. But, by and large, if you have a life-limiting prognosis with a disease such as cancer you will be offered all sorts of treatments to extend that life at the detriment of its quality.But this is also a book about the way the elderly are treated in the industry of care homes and sheltered housing. With all meaning to life removed, with all responsibility removed, people become shells of their former selves, depressed and longing for the death that the (questionable) care they are receiving is preventing. Visionary projects from the 1970s- with more pets in care homes, with pairs of birds in every room for residents to have a vested interest in looking after, with children of staff visiting, filling the emptiness with the joy of activity, of noise- show that it is possible for care homes to be places of life rather than death. But it takes more effort to achieve this, more resources. More determination to give the elderly a life worth enjoying. And so, of course, such ideas largely fall by the wayside, because in a capitalist world the elderly are a drain on life, on resources... which is frankly sickening.I cannot stress enough how important this book is. It was, at times, a painful read for me, and that will be the case for anyone who has lost someone in a medicalised nightmare of end-time. But you owe it to yourself to understand what best befits you when your time comes. You owe it to yourself to choose your own ending. This book arms you with the knowledge to make the right decision, however painful that is.As for my mother.. after 3 touch and go trips to the hospital in the last year of her life I spoke to my sisters and told them it all came down to what we felt Mom would prefer- to die at home or have more and more (hopeless) treatment at hospital, where it was inevitable that one day she would happen to die. We agreed that just as my father had passed away at home, surrounded by people who loved him, our mother deserved the same. It was the best decision we made. She passed on in her home of 40 years held by those she loved and surrounded by their voices. She died in peace."
64,0805095152,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6468566-jennifer,2,"2.5 stars. Gawande has about three major points in this book, all of which were made in a news magazine article he wrote for the Atlantic: 1, We should have tough conversations with those in our lives about their vision for their end-of-life; 2, Doctors should also have these conversations with their patients; and 3, If we have these conversations, we can shift medicine and end-of-life care away from a stave-off-death model and towards a model that promotes humanity, autonomy, and dignity for the dying (and thus no longer need institutional nursing homes). I do not disagree, but the book itself is heavy on anecdotes and light on actual research or policy analysis.My major stylistic critique is that Gawande buries his three points in pages of anecdotes about patients and memories of his own father's decline and death. I'm not being unsympathetic to the suffering of these colorful characters (and Gawande's own personal suffering), but I found the anecdotes long-winded, distracting, and ultimately boring. Gawande intended them to have emotional impact for the reader, but for me, the stories smacked of filling pages for the pure commercial gain of selling a book. My major substantive critique is that Gawande spends too little time on policy, instead championing the heroism of individual doctors, caregivers, and entrepreneurs-- as if the system can be saved by some brave individuals. He is far too sanguine about the difficulty of changing institutions at the macro-level. Yes, Gawande mentions that these alternative living arrangements and alternative therapeutic approaches save money in the long run, but most of the initiatives Gawande covers were developed by private entrepreneurs, not governments (though some government funds may have been made available in the form of grants). Dramatic policy change would be needed to scale and fund these initiatives at the state or federal level, and I do not see the current vested interests in the healthcare lobby supporting these changes (nor does Gawande provide a path for fighting for policy change, besides mentioning the cost-effectiveness argument). The one scale-able initiative that Gawande discusses, Hospice, already exists-- but Gawande ignores that Hospice's ranks are often filled with low-skilled, under-paid, and over-worked caregivers who are hardly in the position to give the attentive, individualized care that Gawande received for his father. Gawande is also too sanguine about the role of socioeconomic class, which is perhaps why his friends and his patients receive such excellent care. He is wrapped in a bubble of privilege -- access to the top surgeons and the most committed nurses. True, some of the alternative homes that Gawande mentions do take Medicaid, but these homes are so few that they have waitlists that are hundreds of names long. The type of ""better death"" that Gawande argues for so eloquently is available only to the wealthiest or the most educated (those empowered to fight the system and search for better options). Without a serious treatment of the nexus between healthcare policy, quality of life, and socioeconomic status, this book seems to me squarely in the realm of theory, not practice. "
65,0805095152,http://goodreads.com/user/show/929238-hbalikov,5,"This is an excellent book. It is also the most important book that I have read in the past year.Dr. Gawande is that rare physician who can write well and write well for the layman. There is nothing glamorous about growing old. There is nothing glamorous in taking care of those who are growing old. As to the former, Gawande, makes it clear as he describes the way our bodies decline and breakdown over time. As to the later, it helps to explain both why very few doctors are attracted to gerontology and why those who aren't are not particularly adept at dealing with those who are at or near the end of their lives. This book is about ""what matters in the end,"" but it is also about Gawande's journey as a physician and surgeon. ""I never expected that among the most meaningful experiences I'd have as a doctor --- and, really, as a human being --- would come from helping others deal with what medicine cannot do as well as what it can.""Atul Gawande is meticulous in describing how we wear down and wear out. ""There is, he told me, 'no single, common cellular mechanism to the aging process.'....The process is gradual and unrelenting."" And, how many of us believe that we can put that aside for the present. ""People naturally prefer to avoid the subject of their decrepitude."" Yet, it colors many things that we do and many decisions that we have to make. In his own learning process, Gawande shares his experiences, and his encounters with doctors, other care givers and physicians. ""The job of any doctor, Bludau later told me, is to support quality of life, by which he meant two things: as much freedom from the ravages of disease as possible and the retention of enough function for active engagement in the world. Most doctors treat disease and figure that the rest will take care of itself.""He exposes a lot of the ""nursing home approach"" as insensitive with facilities that may come to resemble an asylum (in the worst sense). He explores the question, ""what makes life worth living when we are old and frail and unable to care for ourselves,"" is its many facets. There are: basic needs for survival; need for love and belonging; desire for growth (""the opportunity to attain personal goals, to master knowledge and skills, and to recognized and rewarded for our achievements); and, perhaps, ""self-fulfillment through pursuit or moral ideals and creativity for their own sake."" He points out that ""our driving motivations in life, instead of remaining constant, change hugely over time...""I learned a lot about how we often treat those who cannot care entirely for themselves and how attitudes and venues are changing. When doctors are just about ""tinkering"" with the seriously ill, a lot is ignored. Particularly, that those people ""have priorities (perhaps poorly expressed or not discussed) besides prolonging their lives. Surveys find that their top concerns include avoiding suffering, strengthening relationships with family and friends, being mentally alert, not being a burden to others, and achieving a sense that their life is complete.""I wish I had had this book to read before I found myself with friends and family members who were seriously ill or dying. Gawande describes how both amateur and professional caregivers can be sensitive to these issues. And, how they can give the ill and dying the opportunity to reflect on their own desires. One of those, for many, is that they would rather spend their remaining days at home instead of in an institution. There is a very illuminating section on hospice and how this should be explored far earlier than it currently is. Not necessarily invoking hospice care earlier, but being aware of what if can offer and, if desired, getting it going in time to make a difference with quality of life.""(Though), no one ever really has control. Physics and biology and accident ultimately have their way in our lives. But the point is that we are not helpless either. Courage is the strength to recognize BOTH realities. We have room to act, to shape our stories, though as time goes on it is within narrower and narrower confines. A few conclusions become clear when we understand this: that our most cruel failure in how we treat the sick and the aged is the failure to recognize that they have priorities beyond merely being safe and living longer; that the chance to shape one's story is essential to sustaining meaning in life; that we have the opportunity to refashion our institutions, our culture, and our conversations in ways that transform the possibilities for the last chapters of everyone's lives."""
66,0805095152,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1067741-susan,5,"If you have aging/elderly parents whose care you might someday be involved in, or expect to care for someone with a terminal condition, you cannot afford to miss this book. In his effortlessly lucid prose, Gawande comes to terms with the medical establishment's failure in providing end-of-life care. Too often, doctors work to fix what's broken in the service of extending life, without considering how quality of life is compromised, inflicting even more suffering as a result. He extols the value of hospice and palliative care, whose aim is not to give up on patients, but to provide as many good days as possible in the inevitable slide to death. He advocates asking difficult questions with patients and loved ones to determine what can bring meaning and value to them, even in the harsh narrowing of life's possibilities brought on by failing bodies and minds. He does not exempt himself from this critique -- instead he offers personal stories, iike those of his father and his daughter's piano teacher, to show how he came to understand the necessity of these important discussions and the possibilities they offer. It's moving, and timely, and despite the less-than-cheerful subject matter, never a burden to read (a testament to his writerly skill). I can't recommend this book highly enough to anyone who will face these issues -- and we all most likely will, in some form."
67,0805095152,http://goodreads.com/user/show/47188780-kathleen,5,"•	This is an important book for all who have elderly parents that are struggling with end-of-life health issues. Dr. Gawande personalizes the key issues through individual case histories, but he backs up his arguments with solid statistics. First, our society does not have enough gerontologists to serve our aging population, and our medical schools are cutting back on training new ones. More importantly, medical doctors tend to want to solve medical problems. And often, that results in them not recognizing, or even asking, what is important to their patient’s quality of life. The elderly want to live in ‘a home’, not an institution. They want to feel in control of their lives as much as possible. Safety is less of a concern to them than independence. Privacy is important too. They tend to want their own space, with furniture from their own home. They want to be able to turn on the television when and at what volume they want. These needs are not compatible with institutional long-term care facilities. So, new options are being explored—particularly in the United States. Highly recommend."

“A few conclusions become clear when we understand this: that our most cruel failure in how we treat the sick and the aged is the failure to recognize that they have priorities beyond merely being safe and living longer; that the chance to shape one’s story is essential to sustaining meaning in life; that we have the opportunity to refashion our institutions, our culture, and our conversations in ways that transform the possibilities for the last chapters of everyone’s lives.”

 This right here is the theme of Atul Gawande's Being Mortal: Medicine and What Matters in the End. This incredible piece of medical/science nonfiction starts out by introducing historical and cultural norms for caring for our elders and how this has significantly shifted in many societies. Mr. Gawande does not pass judgement but presents the observations and facts so we the reader may have an objective view which starts a journey of perspective. And when we view the world from another perspective, self-examination takes place, thus change. I absolutely loved this book. Many books I have been reading lately have been all about timing it seems. Last year, I watched both my grandfathers die (within 3 days of each other) and this year I am really beginning to take note of my parents and in-law's escalating aging. I guess chronic diseases, strokes, and fickle organs will do that to you. Like many self-centered Americans, I have been looking at the process in terms of what it means for me. How will my life change as they become more and more dependent on me? This book. This book! My perspective and priorities are forever altered. It is about me, after all I am living my life, but it is also about them. They want to be the author of their own life just as much as I do and if I'm lucky, they will live long enough to require assistance with that. They didn't ask for these complications and they fear the loss of independence far more than I could ever begin to imagine. The true terror: that no one will care.Mr. Gawande stresses that end of life conversations are crucial and surprisingly liberating, not only as a son or daughter but as a medical provider. There is a sense of control even in the midst of very uncontrollable circumstances. Questions need to be asked and once answers are decided upon, fear and anxiety of all parties involved can relax a bit. Your wishes will be respected in terms of what a quality life means to you. In a world of nursing homes that might as well be classified as prisons, knowing that someone listens and cares about what you want (despite the options and risks) is priceless. Mr. Gawande draws from his personal experience with his father in this respect and I found these parts to be incredibly raw and emotional. I strongly recommend this book. But if you don't read it, please remember these questions for your loved ones: 

“Whenever serious sickness or injury strikes and your body or mind breaks down, the vital questions are the same: What is your understanding of the situation and its potential outcomes? What are your fears and what are your hopes? What are the trade-offs you are willing to make and not willing to make? And what is the course of action that best serves this understanding?”

 Ask questions, advocate as needed, and enjoy this short life with the people you love ♥My favorite quote:""This is what it means to have autonomy -- you may not control life's circumstances, but getting to be the author of your life means getting to control what you do with them.”"
69,0805095152,http://goodreads.com/user/show/83445-lisa-vegan,5,"This book is excellent. It’s accessible and always interesting. It’s one of those books that probably everybody should read. I’m thinking every physician should read it upon graduating from medical school or during their residency. I think that it’s an important book.I do disagree with him at times, though overall think what he says is spot on.The parts where I disagree are in two major areas: The main one is his reluctance about supporting widespread assisted suicide because he says in those places, palliative hospice care isn’t as advanced an offering. However, even with hospice, I’ve witnessed horrible suffering, unbearable suffering, and it seems rare that people have none of that in their last days and weeks. I think both assisted suicide and competent hospice should always be options. I think not all hospices care works very well at all, though I know that some does. The other place I disagree is his contention that genetics isn’t as crucial to longevity as I think it is, especially in those families where so many live to over 100 and, I know by knowing them, that they often do not take at all good care of themselves, living in a way where others without their genes would die at much younger ages and with more infirmities before their deaths. The gist of what he says about quality of life when aged or with a terminal illness I agree with wholeheartedly though. A lot of what he says about that and examples he gives, makes the book fun to read. I really appreciated the several very personal stories, including his father’s story. So, not only do I not want to live until end stage cancer or ALS, etc. which I’ve always known, but I have no desire to get so old or sick that I can’t take care of myself – with my situation I wouldn’t end up at one of the good places and even those wouldn’t be great for me. These are issues I’ve thought about since about age 12, and I will do anything I can to avoid physical pain, nausea, shortness of breath, and other forms of suffering. Great book for getting readers to think about what they want when they’re elderly or have a life threatening illness, and also for having conversations about their wishes, and encouraging others in their lives to also share their wishes.The best thing about the book, and I wish 100% of medical people would get on board, is the weighing of what is worth it and not worth it to patients, and facing what medicine can’t do as well as what it can do. Not lying! Not evading! Not giving false hope! Allowing patients to take the lead with their own lives! Advocating that conversations should be had with the ill/elderly and doctors shouldn’t assume they know what should be done without knowing the patients’ goals and wishes for themselves. Early in the book, a death mentioned sounded exactly like my mother in 1964-1965 – I have to read that book! Books leading to other books…I'm still laughing about the 100 loose birds!!!"
70,0805095152,http://goodreads.com/user/show/632247-chrissie,3,"Before reading: I am reading this not because I want to but because I feel I ought to. Is it going to make me feel all horrible? I can accept this if it constructively explains what you can do to ""improve"" the end of life. In conclusion: I am glad I read the book, but it wasn’t particularly fun. There are many examples given of particular people, their illnesses and the difficulties they had, one being the author’s father. I didn’t understand all the medical terms used. Examples are given to illustrate the author’s conclusions on how medical care of the aging should be altered. The author, who is himself a surgeon, shows new, better alternatives and how they came to be. He does this by naming pioneers of better nursing homes, assisted care units and hospice development. For a person in the medical field I think this book is essential because it shows how medical changes need to be and can be implemented…., but I am not employed in the medical field and the historical developments, although interesting, were a bit extraneous for me. From my point of view, these sections could have been shortened, even if they do show the direction the author is supporting. One can ask, “Who is this book for?”In my family we have had several deaths in the past years. So the weaknesses coupled to end of life medical care, nursing homes and hospices were not new to me. I didn’t have to be told; I was not surprised in the least. What I wanted from this book were guidelines showing me how I could improve my husband’s and my own end of life. Did the book do this? Well, it made me face my own situation and what lay ahead. As a result of reading this book I will be looking into what alternatives are available here in Sweden when we are no longer able to manage alone. My husband and I have discussed exactly how we see the future. It has made clear to us that we value independence and that we want to stay where we are as long as possible – even if such living may be less safe than living near a hospital. We plan on looking in to Assisted Care Facilities that offer a gradual increase of care as needs increase. Do they have queues? Are they expensive? Where are they located? The essential point is that you have to know what you are looking for and that will be different for each family. So, yes, I am glad I read the book. It made me evaluate what is important to me – nature and independence and a dog and pretty landscape. The book pushed me to do this.  Another issue the book pushes you to evaluate is how long you want to extend the years of your life even if that time is filled with pain and discomfort. This too is a personal decision. The book guides you in what sort of questions you should ask your doctor, but of course some questions are specific to the illness one is coping with. Some conclusions are drawn that may be true for many, but not for my husband and I. Generally, most seem to want more contact with family as they age. This has its difficult sides too, and the book mentions this only briefly. I think more attention could have been devoted to this topic. While funeral wishes are important to discuss at life’s end, I found it unnecessary that the author discussed the details of his father’s funeral in this book.Practically nothing is said about how the elderly no longer want to travel. I may add that if you want to travel do it when you are young and fit. I am thankful to have traveled earlier in my life. The book is primarily concerned with American facilities, and practically nothing is said about costs. The audiobook is narrated by Robert Petkoff. It is read at a good speed. When good nursing facilities were being discussed he tended to sound SO enthused, SO exuberant. Really, I found this a bit childish. It doesn’t distort the text, but exaggerates how wonderful it all is. I could have done without this. The book has made me more appreciative of what I have. It has pushed my husband and me to evaluate which qualities of life we deem most important. With a clearer understanding of our preferences we can more easily deal with what lies ahead."
71,0805095152,http://goodreads.com/user/show/730754-ken,4,"Anyone who is planning on dying some day should read this book. It can be jumpy at times, but overall, Gawande's a straight shooting, no-nonsense writer who gives the straight dope on nursing homes, assisted living, hospice, and the heart-rending decisions we are all forced into at our end-of-days. As many of his accounts deal with cancer cases, it's a bit of a downer, but it's medicine to be taken and there's no better way to illustrate his point than through real-life examples, including his own father, who developed a fatal tumor in his spinal cord. God save us all from ends like this, but sorry, we all don't get to die suddenly and peacefully in our sleep.Among topics Gawande tackles: the dearth of geriatricians in this country. So ironic. So American. But the money is not there for doctors dedicated to our fastest growing demographic. Oh. And the preventative-style approach, the in-the-moment treatments needed to keep the elderly happy? Often not paid for by insurance companies, either.He also gets into nursing home/assisted living situations, focusing on the story of an upstate NY facility where a maverick doctor/director decided to introduce parakeets and live plants in every room as well as two cats and two dogs who had the run of the place. The nurses were thrown by this -- one refused to pick up a doggy mistake on the floor because that wasn't what she got a nursing license for -- but eventually everyone saw the seismic shift this simple yet dramatic change had on the previously-listless residents. The ""inmates"" (what they felt like, previously) started to perk up, tell people about the personalities of their parakeets, take a hand in caring for both plants and birds. Meanwhile, they became entranced with the wandering dogs and cats. Those patients who were ambulatory surprised the nurses by stepping up and volunteering to walk the dogs. The director had kids visit, too, providing training to middle schoolers on how to talk even with people with Alzheimer's. The young people's two or three visits a week became events to look forward to for the elderly residents, who, between pets and children, suddenly discovered purpose and felt more like human beings, more like they used to when they were living alone.There are other variations here, too, like assisted living purposely designed in pods of smaller units, created to look more like homes and less like institutions. Chief among the changes? Allowing people some privacy -- their own rooms. Giving them more leeway on what to do, when to eat. The schedules work around the people vs. vice versa.But the bulk of the book focuses on decisions and consequences. There are no definitive moves to make once a fatal disease begins its course, but Gawande shows that it's spinning a bit out of control in too many cases. The money being spent to prolong lives, often to make those lives so much more miserable just because people refuse to accept the oldest fact of life -- death -- is truly a scary thing. Modern medicine may be many things, but it is no match for Death, who remains undefeated. Still, there is a measure of victory to be had. For many people, that may mean a shorter but higher quality amount of time with family and friends. And, paradoxically, Gawande points to studies showing that many people who choose hospice care actually live longer than those who take the harsh and risky treatment road. They have less pain. They are happier. Together, these effects lead to slightly longer days with those they love. So, if you think hospice is a white flag, think again. It's not as simple as all that. Nor is this book. It's food for thought. Not that it will get any easier for you, the reader, when such choices visit you or your loved ones (and they will), but at least you'll have a better sense of balance and perspective. Can we ask for any more than that?"
72,0805095152,http://goodreads.com/user/show/275498-jim,5,"This is a brilliantly written book, and I was super-impressed with the genius of the good Dr Gawande right up to the point where he drank water out of the Ganges...I wouldn't do that at gunpoint! But while I might question the doc's wisdom in choice of beverages, I have to say he wrote a darn fine book.All of the occupants of this globe have a single thing in common...we will all die. Hopefully, we enjoy a long life and peaceful old age before our expiry date and, thanks to modern medicine and the care of good physicians, this is getting to be the reality for more people. This presents us with another problem: caring for a growing population of oldsters who require care as they ease their way into the hereafter. Families are getting smaller, so the progeny that would have cared for ailing seniors in the past are absent, or already employed. Expensive medical treatments are being employed to attempt to extend the lives of oldsters who would have slipped away without treatment, but at what cost? Frequently the result of this practice is that the medical treatment gives the patient an agonized existence suffering from side effects.Dr Gawande believes that, in most cases, if given a choice between having some quality time with loved ones or a possibly longer painful and befuddled existence under medical care, most people will choose the quality time even though it may be shorter. And here's another point to consider: Gawande has determined that 63% of doctors overestimate the amount of time a patient has to live, and that the better the doctor knows the patient, the more likely he/she will be to overestimate the patient's remaining time.Of interest to me was the fact that he basically confirmed an old homily my Granny used to toss out from time to time: ""A son is a son 'til he gets him a wife, but a daughter's a daughter for all of her life"". Here's what Dr Gawande had to say about the matter (from P. 79):  ""your chances of avoiding the nursing home are directly related to the number of children you have, and, according to what little research has been done, having at least one daughter seems to be crucial to the amount of help you will receive.""Naturally, one cannot always expect that sons and daughters will be able to care for them. Dr Gawande is firmly on the side of those who consult a palliative care specialist (From P.177):  ""The result; those who saw a palliative care specialist stopped chemotherapy sooner, entered hospice far earlier, experienced less suffering at the end of their lives - and they lived 25 percent longer. In other words, our decision making in medicine has failed so spectacularly that we have reached the point of actually inflicting harm on patients rather than confronting the subject of mortality.""This could have been a boring book...it wasn't. Dr Gawande has the gift of imparting information without making you feel like you are being tutored. A very interesting read, particularly for those of us who are around the last curve and racing toward the finish line."

74,0805095152,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5550397-britany,4,"Atul Gawande illustrates life as you age and how families must cope with aging parents.I appreciated learning about a topic that I knew little about previously. The difficulty of what to do with the aging population is an interesting and highly debatable (if not slightly depressing) topic. Gawande shares real life client stories, including his own family. This made this book relatable, who hasn't watched an elder age and eventually pass away. The best story was the one with the home that brought in dogs, cats, birds and plants. I just loved reading about the after effects of bringing life and small responsibilities in for the elderly residents. Innovating for this demographic brought hope to this challenging time in our history and while the topic is dark, this perspective shone a tiny light of hope for the future.Would highly recommend."
75,0805095152,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6041973-josh,4,"As I sit here at work, basically doing nothing but typing this review and speaking to my fiancé on Microsoft Lync, I am drinking a cup of coffee and wondering about my mortality.  Yes, I admit, I usually think of it more than once a day, sometimes twice a day, but never 4.5 times a day because that’s actually impossible.When reading Gawande’s ‘Being Mortal’, I found myself not questioning my own life, but many others; he exposed a sense of compassion in this misanthropic heart and how the geriatric community are treated in their final days.  His views on how doctors tend to be either vague or as he puts it, ‘Mr. Informative’, (saying too much about the disease and focusing more on it than the actual patient and their well-being) is a unique perspective from a doctor that actually cares for his patients.  Now, I’m not saying that doctors, as a whole do not, but the way it seems (from my knowledgeable perspective), they go in and out of doors seeing people like paying consumers instead of human beings and making it more of a business than actually trying to treat a person, much less about their well-being.The majority of the book takes us through first-hand accounts from the author; a multitude of case studies, that state interesting statistics about subjects such as: how people in their 50’s-90’s are leaning more towards living independently; how people with a terminal illness find themselves to want to die, rather than live out their days because of the guilt on how embarrassing and burdensome they may be to loved ones; how palliative care has helped many people in having a better life at home rather than being stuck with needles and prolonging their inevitable death in a place they hate to be (somewhat contradictory, yet for good reason, many that go through palliative care or hospice tend to live slightly longer than if they were laid up inside a hospital due to the quality of care towards the patient and not the disease); and how it takes courage to let go when no other option is available.His insight on these subjects is based on a close, personal relationship.  He saw how his own father dealt with terminal cancer for many years, but also used the methods of care listed above and it ended up being the right call; his father lived a lot longer than if he would’ve had extremely intrusive surgery and only had mild suffering, but always in a conscious state knowing what was being done to him, enjoying things before his final breath.Overall, I found much of the information helpful on drawing my own opinions on the matter and opened my eyes to other aspects.Many may find this book depressing because it deals with a subject that we cannot control ultimately, but with understanding and acceptance, we can manage the best we can."
76,0805095152,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7392004-quo,5,"I suspect that what makes some teachers revered is not just a mastery of the subject they mean to impart but that they also have retained an elemental sense of being a learner as well. One of the facets that impressed me most about Atul Gawande's Being Mortal: Medicine & What Matters in the End is that the author conveys the importance of the essential dialogue between doctor & patient by asking himself how he would like to be treated if he were the patient and not the medical specialist. To suggest that this is an important book is almost to diminish it, for Dr. Gawande involves the reader not just in reviewing a series of case studies & other background detail on how each of us attempts to deal with our own mortality but also causes something very personal to take place, the rare sensation of being spoken to directly in a meaningful, compassionate manner. For, as people become aware of the finitude of their life, they do not ask for much. They do not seek riches, they do not seek more power. They ask only to be permitted, insofar as possible, to keep shaping the story of their life in the world--to make choices & to sustain connections to others according to their own priorities.I found Being Mortal a treasure in many gradually unfolding ways. For example, little gerontological training occurs as a component part of medical school, so much so that many doctors feel they are often unable to offer treatment as much as the lure of hope. Dr. Gawande comments thatThere is almost always a long trail of possibility, however slim. However, we have built a multi-trillion dollar edifice for dispensing the medical equivalent of lottery tickets, while having only a rudimentary system to prepare patients for the near certainty that those tickets will not win. Hope is not a plan.Thus, 63% of M.D.'s overestimate survival time, not wanting to trample a patient's hopes, while only 17% underestimate survival time. Interestingly, if a doctor knows a patient well, he or she is more likely to be overly optimistic, ""even to the point of engaging in fantasy about experimental drugs to cure a patient or to extend life in an unrealistic way."" There are many humorous anecdotes which serve to relieve, at least in part, the difficult task of considering one's own mortality in this book, one being Philip Roth's comment that ""Old age is not a battle, it's a massacre."" And the late Harvard scientist & gifted writer, Prof. Steven Jay Gould, wistfully observed that ""the medium isn't always the message"", preferring the more realistic view of death as the ultimate enemy and finding nothing reproachable about those who ""rage against the dying of the light"", borrowing words from Dylan Thomas. Gould lived an additional 20 years after his original diagnosis. Another funny inclusion occurs when General Custer is compared with General Robert E. Lee, with the latter knowing when the battle could not be won.Included among the meaningful case studies is the story of Karen Brown Wilson on the west coast who develops a model for extended care or assisted living as an alternative to conventional nursing homes, though her new paradigm is quickly absorbed into a corporate structure & radically changed. Also, Dr. Bill Thomas in upstate New York, a restless Harvard Med School grad decides to attempt a new model for nursing homes, concluding that ""what was missing was life itself."" He introduces pets aplenty, including dogs, cats, birds and also inserts plants in each room to help confront the 3 plagues of nursing home existence: boredom, loneliness & helplessness. And, in so doing, he alters the relationship of patient to nursing home. Lastly, Dr. Atul Gawande's own father, also a surgeon & born in India, deals with his own mortality and when afflicted with cancer, he attempts to reinvent his life in a meaningful way during his remaining days by performing community service as a Rotarian and extending his ministry to a school he founded in his native India. Ultimately, Atul Gawande concludes that our ultimate goal should not be a good death but a good life till the very end and that assisted living is far more difficult than assisted death. In spite of the notion that every life ends in an execution, so to speak, there are countless uplifting vignettes of people dealing with their own mortality in a positive manner & with great courage in Dr. Gawande's wonderful book, Being Mortal and also in a one hour television episode of ""Frontline"", available via the Internet."

“Death is the enemy. But the enemy has superior forces. Eventually, it wins. And in a war that you cannot win, you don’t want a general who fights to the point of total annihilation. You don’t want Custer. You want Robert E. Lee, someone who knows how to fight for territory that can be won and how to surrender it when it can’t, someone who understands that the damage is greatest if all you do is battle to the bitter end.”

 “We’ve been wrong about what our job is in medicine. We think our job is to ensure health and survival. But really it is larger than that. It is to enable well-being.” 
This is not an easy simple-read. It is a brain-storming perspective-changing book.In all our modern medical learning and practice we aim at making life last ""longer"", but we should make it feel ""better""We try to elongate the lives of the elder, or the ""life"" of their bodies/corpses. Using unjustified mechanical ventilation, Inotropic support, unjustified high-risk operations and the result is an end-of-life ""lived"" in hospitals.
 “A few conclusions become clear when we understand this: that our most cruel failure in how we treat the sick and the aged is the failure to recognize that they have priorities beyond merely being safe and living longer; that the chance to shape one’s story is essential to sustaining meaning in life; that we have the opportunity to refashion our institutions, our culture, and our conversations in ways that transform the possibilities for the last chapters of everyone’s lives.” 

 “I learned about a lot of things in medical school, but mortality wasn’t one of them. Although I was given a dry, leathery corpse to dissect in my first term, that was solely a way to learn about human anatomy. Our textbooks had almost nothing on aging or frailty or dying. How the process unfolds, how people experience the end of their lives, and how it affects those around them seemed beside the point. The way we saw it, and the way our professors saw it, the purpose of medical schooling was to teach how to save lives, not how to tend to their demise.” 
This book is about how can we make life worth-living when we are too frail, too fragile, vulnerable and dependent.Our societies confronts these circumstances by avoiding talking about them, we all deny death, deny talking about it until it is too late.We designed nurseries to control the elder, their safety and their privacy and to make their lives impervious to change . . And the result is a life supposed to be safe, but empty of everything they care about.
 “It is not death that the very old tell me they fear. It is what happens short of death—losing their hearing, their memory, their best friends, their way of life. As Felix put it to me, “Old age is a continuous series of losses.” Philip Roth put it more bitterly in his novel Everyman: “Old age is not a battle. Old age is a massacre.” 
in this book you learn how to listen to them, to acknowledge their fears and how to feel their hopes. You will learn that death is inevitable, that you should respect death, you should respect aging, you should talk about it, and above all you should truly ""live"" to the very end of your life.
 “The problem with medicine and the institutions it has spawned for the care of the sick and the old is not that they have had an incorrect view of what makes life significant. The problem is that they have had almost no view at all. Medicine’s focus is narrow. Medical professionals concentrate on repair of health, not sustenance of the soul. Yet—and this is the painful paradox—we have decided that they should be the ones who largely define how we live in our waning days.” 

 “Sometimes we can offer a cure, sometimes only a salve, sometimes not even that. But whatever we can offer, our interventions, and the risks and sacrifices they entail, are justified only if they serve the larger aims of a person’s life. When we forget that, the suffering we inflict can be barbaric. When we remember it the good we do can be breathtaking.” 

 “Our ultimate goal, after all, is not a good death but a good life to the very end.” 

 “Death, of course, is not a failure. Death is normal. Death may be the enemy, but it is also the natural order of things.”

Should we want them to? At what cost – not to society or to our wallets, but at what cost to our humanity and dignity? Atul Gawunde, a surgeon in Boston Massachusetts, explores the ways in which medicine (and specifically American medicine and American society) helps and hinders the aged, the infirm, and the dying. If you know anyone who will someday die … stop reading this review and read this book.As he did in his previous books, Gawunde gives clear information and asks probing questions. He does not necessarily try to give us THE answer, but he does propose some alternatives, ultimately leaving the final answer up to each and every one of us. Having helped both my parents face their mortal ends, I can tell you that my family members and I – brothers, sister-in-law, and husband – have had many discussions about these issues over the past several years. Some of the physicians we encountered were open to such frank discussion, but not all were. There are difficult issues, heart-wrenching dilemmas, and anxiety-producing situations. But they do not get less difficult, less anxiety-producing, or less heart-wrenching when we ignore them. Oliver Sacks wrote the following blurb: “We have come to medicalize aging, frailty, and death, treating them as if they were just one more clinical problem to overcome. However it is not only medicine that is needed in one’s declining years but life – a life with meaning, a life as rich and full as possible under the circumstances. Being Mortal is not only wise and deeply moving, it is an essential and insightful book for our times…” WHY are you still reading this review? Read the book … NOW! Think carefully about what you want, and then talk about it – to your family, your friends, your doctors. Encourage them to read the book, too.

Why are parents cared for---as if they were made of gold---better in India?Truly an arduous journey on a path laden with geriatric patients and a transformation from independence to its’ opposite. This imposing trudge into considerations, care and realities of mortality and “how hope is an elixir.” Most elegantly summarized. Gawande writes: “Being Mortal is about the struggle to cope with the strength of our biology. We think our job is to insure health and survival but it is to enable well-being.” This communicates the goal for all engaging in the practice of medicine. This book is not for shy, sensitive or frail as it's an honest and blatantly truthful aperçu of what is/was observed by Dr. Gawande in geriatric medicine today. Educational and somber.

This is easy to acknowledge, not so easy to come to terms with and certainly not easy to prepare for.Gawande's book is essential reading for anyone who is ageing themselves, or for anyone caring for somebody who is ill or frail enough to be approaching a state of dependency. Reading this has helped me to be aware of the questions I need to ask myself and those I care about. You can't ever assume you know what someone else really wants to do with their lives as they become dependent, or as they near death.How can you live well till the end, avoiding medically institutionalised interactions, treatments and living space? I wish I had read this before my parents became frail and certainly well before their last illnesses. This was an unusual book club choice, but then it's a great group of women.

81,0805095152,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2375838-cheryl,5,"There is a long phase in the first parts of our lives where, if we are lucky enough to have avoided critical disease or injury, we are blithely unaware of the effects of aging and of the inevitability of death. It seems so far ahead in the future as to be imaginary. Like imagining what a trillion dollars is like. You know that is a real thing, but still…it seems impossible to know what it really is. The other day I said to my teenage daughter, “Just imagine, in only forty years from now you will be standing in the kitchen with your partner and asking the same questions I’m asking now, like “When can we retire and go do what we really want?” “ She snorted. “Forty years? That’s ages from now!” And I’m saying, “no, forty years isn’t long at all! You will be planning your retirement!”She doesn’t really believe it.I sort of wish I had that back again. Those days of childhood, adolescence, young adulthood, where we never gave a thought to retirement, to aging, to death. Later on in life, we end up sometimes dwelling too much on those things, as if to make up for our inattention earlier. Nowadays, I sometimes feel hyper-aware of the universality of disease, the effects of aging, and shuffling off the mortal coil. It is unavoidable - I stare at it through the microscope daily as a pathologist. I often wonder which of those diseases that we hand out like playing cards will be the one dealt to me. “There’s no escaping the tragedy of life., which is that we are all aging from the day we are born… This experiment of making mortality a medical experience is just decades old. And the evidence is it is failing.”“Our reluctance to honestly examine the experience of aging and dying has increased the harm we inflict on people and denied them the basic comforts they most need.”The chapters of the book follow the course of our lives, and are richly illustrated with examples from Gawande’s own family and from his medical practice. Their stories are woven through the book, providing compelling and touching portraits. They are us. We are independent beings who are increasingly living longer and living independently longer.But ‘Things Fall Apart.’ “The culprit is just the accumulated crumbling of one’s bodily systems while medicine carries out its maintenance measures and patch jobs""“Human beings fail the way all complex systems fail: randomly and gradually…as the defects in a complex system increase, the time comes when just one more defect is enough to impair the whole, resulting in the condition known as frailty. It happens to power plants, cars, and large organizations. And it happens to us: eventually, one too many joints are damaged, one too many arteries calcify. There are no more backups. We wear down until we can’t wear down anymore.”So gradually, as the losses accumulate, we become Dependent. We need increasing amounts of Assistance, often in the form of retirement or nursing homes. These tend to provide an institutionalized life — that is not a good life, it’s just as good as can be got in the circumstances. But that robs us of our autonomy and our ability to make choices and to shape the story of our life in the world. “Whatever the limits and travails we face, we want to retain the autonomy—the freedom—to be the authors of our lives. This is the very marrow of being human” New models of care are evolving though, so people like 94 year old Lou are “…still able to live in a way that made him feel that he still had a place in this world.” I found this chapter particularly encouraging. The chapters on Letting Go and Hard Conversations are thoughtful, valuable discussions not only for clinical physicians, nurses and other members of the health care team, but also for anyone — patient, family, friend — who has reached that place where the end of life is in sight. “Technological society has forgotten what scholars call the “dying role” and its importance to people as life approaches its end. People want to share memories, pass on wisdoms and keepsakes, settle relationships, establish their legacies, make peace with God, and ensure that those who are left behind will be okay. They want to end their stories on their own terms.”Finally, Courage. “At least two kinds of courage are required in aging and sickness. The first is the courage to confront the reality of mortality—the courage to seek out the truth of what is to be feared and what is to be hoped.” We need the courage to act on the truth we find. One has to decide whether one’s fears or one’s hopes are what should matter most.This was a profoundly enriching book. It should be required reading for all health care professionals who work with seriously ill patients, and for those who work with the aged, and for those who run our health care systems, and for those who have aging/ill parents/relatives, and for those who are embarking on those final passages, and in some ways especially for those who haven’t yet reached those phases, so that they will be better prepared. It is intelligent, rational, touching, and warmly profound. It is a classic. "
82,0805095152,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4146473-connie,5," I read this a while ago, and it is a book that comes up quite often in conversation, and one that I highly recommend. For medical students, Dr's, nurses, anyone who works in medicine, anyone with aging parents and quite frankly anyone who is aging. Pretty much everyone I know. When talking about it I realized that though I remember it well and recommend it I had never written a review. So here you go. One of the first chapters tells the story of the author when he was shadowing a family practitioner. An elderly woman came in with her main complaint of heart issues. She also commented on poor balance and the Dr noted weight loss. The young writer was confused when the Dr. asked her if she ate alone. More confusion when the physician commented on her pretty manicure, which the patient proudly said she did herself. When the doctor asked her to remove her shoes, the young student was even more perplexed. Came to be that the older physician realized she could not trim her toenails, and they were hurting in her shoes, causing her to change her gait...and at a risk for losing her balance and falling. Another concern was her weight loss, as she did not eat well due to eating alone. She was much frailer and he worried a fall may result in a broken hip or worse. He recommended a podiatrist and that her family try to eat several meals with her throughout the week. He told the young student that he could give medicine for the heart....but a fall with a break would cause much distress and change in her quality of life. This is the basis of this book. Physicians need to learn to look at the whole person, not just the complaint. So often we see a ""specialist"" whose focus is on what they specialize in, and they miss the other signs. Believe me, I have seen this happen. Yet I have also seen those who look at the big picture and those folks are the ones I would want to care for me. We are often so busy trying to live longer. Yet sometimes, or often it is the ""quality"" not the ""quantity"" of our lives that matter. This author delves into this issue with first hand knowledge of patients he has treated as well as his own family members. He admits how hard it is to step back and not always have to ""fix"" everything, but learn to listen to what is important to his patient. We can all learn this lesson. How do we picture the end of our lives? What do we really need to do to achieve that?  This is a book that makes you think about aging, aging in place and aging well. It makes you think about maintaining dignity. I know I thought of this often with family members who were facing the end of life, and I often had to stop and listen to what it was that was important to them, not to me. I only hope that someone allows me that same choice."
83,0805095152,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7958239-elizabeth-theiss,5,"When is it time to stop fighting disease and death, and work instead on the best quality of life possible? Gawande has given us a wise and thoughtful discussion of how to approach the question, one I found helpful and convincing.As always Gawande uses stories to demonstrate the problems attendant to the medicalization of death. Doctors are trained to treat death as the enemy, not death as the inevitable. In an effort to forestall the inevitable, doctors' use every available tool from invasive surgeries to brutal successive chemo therapies that leave patients, that is, people, lingering in pain. As in The Checklist Manifesto, Gawande's solution is simple, a short set of questions that doctors should ask patients nearing the end of their lives. The conversation centers around what is most important to the person; what immediate goals are central; and what trade-offs between length of life and quality of life a person is willing to make. Gawande's ideas about nursing homes as places to avoid are spot on as well. His description of these ""homes"" driven by staff's needs for cookie cutter treatment of residents From assembly line pill dispensing to early morning shower times are downright depressing. We just sprang my husband from a month in a nursing home and it was exactly as described. But alternatives do exist, some better than others. The key seems to be finding a place that allows individual autonomy and provides support for quality of life. The one element ignored here is the cost of this kind of support; it is out of the reach of most people who need it and not supported by Medicare, despite the fact that it is less expensive than a traditional nursing home. My father was fortunate to live out the last two years of his life in a truly wonderful care center with a home-like environment, a small number of house mates, and home cooked meals each night. Gawande made me think we should just tear down the old ones and start over.I have spent a good deal of time thinking about these questions and problems as I helped my father through Alzheimer's and my spouse through 23 years of Parkinson's disease. Gawande has it exactly right and I'm hoping Being Mortal is a best seller so doctors and everyone else benefits from his perspective on what a good life and a good death means."
84,0805095152,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1608124-dana-stabenow,5,"I give this book five stars not because I loved it but because it is what I would call a necessary read, and I mean necessary for everyone, young, old, medical professional and laity alike. It's about That Conversation, what Gawande calls in one chapter ""Hard Conversations."" The subject is how we want to live out the end of our life.Gawande is a surgeon and one of the best parts of this book is that he is learning how to have this conversation himself. He's learning how to do it as a medical professional with his patients, and he's not shy about telling us where and how he has screwed up. He is also learning how to do it as a son to his father, also a surgeon, who has been diagnosed with a rare spinal tumor.The difficulty, he writes, is that in the last fifty years we have learned how to prolong life.As recently as 1945, most deaths occurred in the home. By the 1980s, just 17 percent did...Across not just the United States but also the entire industrialized world, the experience of advanced aging and death has shifted to hospitals and nursing homes...You don't have to spend much time with the elderly or those with terminal illness to see how often medicine fails the people it is supposed to help...Our reluctance to honestly examine the experience of aging and dying has increased the harm we inflict on people and denied them the basic comforts they most need.Later he writes You'd think people would have rebelled. You'd think we would have burned the nursing homes to the ground.But we haven't, and new discoveries and better medical practice mean that citizens of industrialized nations are living longer, healthier lives. ""A life,"" Gawande writes, ""designed to be safe but empty of anything they care about."" The trick now is to make sure our aging populations are not just safe, or even--heresy! sacrilege!--not safe at all, but living a life that achieves quality of life, not just quantity. The good news is, things are changing. (He doesn't say so but you know it has everything to do with the Boomers, a generation now making decisions for their parents, and who will soon be making those decisions--or not--for themselves.) Keren Brown Wilson built the first assisted living facility in Oregon in 1980, and when that concept became bastardized people like Dr. Tom Wilson revolutionized an assisted living facility with two dogs, four cats, 100 parakeets and child care for employees that brought children back into the lives of the inmates (using that word deliberately, as Gawande does himself). Researchers studied the effects of this program over two years, comparing a variety of measures for Chase's residents with those of residents at another nursing home nearby. Their study found that the number of prescriptions required per resident fell to half that of the control nursing home. Psychotropic drugs for agitation, like Haldol, decreased in particular. The total drug costs fell to just 38 percent of the comparison facility. Deaths fell 15 percent.From inmates locked away from life, warehoused until they died, Dr. Wilson's patients became once again members of a community. And as Gawande goes on to say, this experiment and others like it are beginning all across the nation.There is also Hospice, which organization Gawande's father chooses to help him through the end of his life with palliative care. For Hospice, it's all about making the end of each individual story as valuable to them as is physically possible for them. It's impossible to say enough good things about Hospice and Gawande doesn't stint them here. (Full disclosure: I already support Hospice and this book is making me double that support this year.) I know it sounds a little macabre, but this is the one book you really should read. Make a teenager read it and they will understand that much more about what Grandma is going through. Make a Millennial read it and he'll understand in spades how important that retirement plan is and how they should start one now. Make your doctor read it and she'll see how important first asking those essential questions is, ""What do you want? What is most important to you?"" instead of automatically reaching for the scalpel or the drugs. ""Death,"" writes Gawandeis normal. Death may be the enemy, but it is also the natural order of things. I knew these truths abstractly, but I didn't know them concretely--that they could be truths not just for everyone but also for this person right in front of me, for this person I was responsible for.Me, either. Now I feel like I do. Read this book, and recommend it to everyone you know. It is very frank, very well written, and actually? Kind of hopeful.****See also on Vox, ""2015 is the year America started having a sane conversation about death,"" http://www.vox.com/2015/12/16/1011744...."
85,0805095152,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3897817-morgan-blackledge,5,"This is a heart wrenchingly moving and important book. It speaks directly to our cultures strained and distant relationship to aging, the elderly, death and dying. Rarely if ever have I heard a medical clinician speak with such vulnerability and humility about the limits of modern medicine.French cultural theorist and urbanist Paul Virilio observed, with every invention or technical advance, an equally powerful disaster is co-created, for example, when we invented the locomotive, we simultaneously invented the train wreck.In a sense, Being Mortal is Dr. Atul Gawande's analogous observation about the incredible benefits of advanced medicine and the unprecedented opportunities for prolonged suffering and denial it affords us. I'm so grateful to be alive in this time, and science and technology have everything to do with that. Ordinary people have never had as much freedom to pursue knowledge or self expression as we currently enjoy.Advanced medicine is central to the high standard of living we currently have. It prolongs our lives and reduces suffering in many ways that we completely take for granted. But in a real sense, our faith in technology and medical advances has lulled us to sleep on some of life's most important and philosophical, psychological, and spiritual issues. Those of impermanence, suffering, loss and mortality.Our culture does a phenomenal job of keeping death and suffering out of plain sight. This affords the individuals facing these challenges the privacy and professional care that most people chose if given the option.This represents a real advance. But the equally powerful disaster that accompanies this advance is not trivial. The fact that most of us now live the majority of our lives insulated from the reality of death and dying means that we are quite likely to be utterly naive and under developed in this important existential domain.Frankly speaking, these are difficult and unsightly truths most of us would rather defer encountering. In the short term we enjoy the bliss that ignorance affords, but in the long term we suffer the numerous negative consequences that accompany the unexamined life.This book is attempting to address this issue by presenting us with a sober but empathetic and even optimistic view of the end of the road. Highly recommended, five stars."

88,0805095152,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4342402-tl,5,"See Caroline's review here:https://www.goodreads.com/review/show... (her review convinced me to pick this up)----She says it all beautifully so I will add my thoughts here (this'll be fairly short mostly cause my head hurts right now).This book brings up topics most of us don't think about when we are young. It seems too far away to contemplate so we put it out of our minds. Sure, we may talk about it time to time with our loved ones but how many of give it serious thought until something happens, let alone what questions to ask?The subject matter is a bit weighty in here but never felt dry or boring. There's feeling and passion  here. Gawande transports you into what he is talking about, like you are sitting with him at his kitchen table. The personal stories and histories he shares throughout the book were in turns touching and very informative. Of the former, a few had me tearing up and wanting to hug them all. The latter fascinated me, as I didn't know how those things all came about (one of those ""it has always been around"" that you just don't explore further) .I agreed with him on alot of the things he said and it got me thinking about my wishes on the future as well. Hopefully this will help with the hard conversation in the future (even though we wish we could live forever).This is an important book that should be on the bookshelves of everyone, in my humble opinion. Highly recommended.(Excuse any errors, typing on my phone)Narrator: Five starsBonus interview with the author was a nice touch."
89,0805095152,http://goodreads.com/user/show/28602001-emma,5,"An incredible book, but one that has the potential to cause considerable distress.‘Being Mortal’ is a book that addresses the experience of dying in modern society and questions whether we are getting it right. Chapters 1-5 focus primarily on mortality and the diverse nature of the end of life care provided for the elderly. Chapters 6-8 deal more specifically with how those with serious or terminal illnesses, and their families, cope with the process of dying. In these later chapters, the stories related by Gawande are frequently those in which the suffering and death of individuals is caused by cancer, including that of his own father. Though dying is an event that eventually comes to us all, it is a subject that is inherently difficult to address. In talking about our mortality, each person must confront not only the idea of their own death, but that of those who matter to them. It is entirely understandable that people choose to avoid discussing it. Yet Gawande’s book shows why it is important for everybody to stop putting aside the conversation about dying; that, in fact, refusing to tackle death until it is right upon you can lead to much greater pain and suffering. It is at this point when medical intervention takes over, often at the expense of compassion. Medical professionals would do well to read this book as part of their training and development, if only to understand how important honest communication can be to patient outcomes. They are only human, and as such, may feel as awkward about such matters as the rest of us, but they have a duty to provide accurate/truthful information about an individual’s illnesses/conditions so that they can have realistic expectations. Gawande argues that instead of defaulting to the most aggressive form of medical intervention, it is more important to talk to the individual about their goals, what is most important to them, what they can and can’t live with, what their fears and concerns are, what trade offs they are willing to make. Through discussion, a better path can be found for those who may be in pain or who are coming to the end of their life. Such conversations are necessarily incredibly difficult but Gawande highlights the benefits of having a plan put together by the individual, their family, and the medical professionals in collaboration; it is this honest dialogue that will allow an individual to manage their illness and the end of their life in a way that suits their needs. Gawande’s argument is empowering, it promotes the active role of the individual as the centre of their care and what happens to them. Within each chapter, Gawande often addresses what has happened in the past, what is happening now (including in different parts of the world), how people are trying to change things, and what the focus for the future should be. This plan means that the book is not depressing; it highlights the failures but injects positivity by showing ways in which things are being improved, or can/should be improved. At no point does Gawande fall into pessimism, he believes that while the majority of systems and institutions may not be meeting the needs of individuals right now, there is a chance that more of them will do so in the future. The book is his way of showing the difference between what is, and what should be, including examples of people and places that are getting it right. Importantly, Gawande is not prescriptive. He does not say ‘this is THE way to do things’, instead he shows how different solutions are being implemented. The variety of solutions reflect the multitude of differing ways people want and need to approach their ill health, old age, and death.       ‘Being Mortal’ is incredibly difficult to review. Given that I agree with Gawande, it would be easy to say that everyone should read this book. Yet in saying that, it feels like I am telling people that they need to deal with the idea of their death as soon as possible and, if they are currently unwell, that they should open a dialogue with their doctor to plan how they want it to proceed. It sounds more challenging when phrased this way, and is it not truly understandable that someone may not want to deal with the idea of their death by calmly talking through the steps? At the same time, I fundamentally believe Gawande’s argument that honest communication is the way forward for those who are living with terminal illness. Perhaps this is because I would rather make my own decisions while I can, and not leave them for others, who may have to guess what I might want in emergency situations if I hadn’t made my thoughts clear. The role of friends and family as support network seems intrinsically opposed to making these hard choices, the love and hope with which these decisions are made might not be compatible with the path I would want. Neither, perhaps, would the medical intervention. In modern society, people have become a medical problem to be solved, they must be ‘made safe’, increasingly separated from the rest of society and even from themselves, thereby removing any chance at individuality or choice. The problem is exacerbated by the disconnection between what medicine can do and what it should do. Gawande treats the grave and emotive subject matter with respect and conviction. At the end of someone’s life, or as they cope with ill health, he wants people to be able to have choices, to focus on what’s important to the , and to be supported in those goals by everyone around them. This is what I will hope for. "
90,0805095152,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2231715-lewis-weinstein,5,"This book is not pleasant to read. It is challenging, emotional, difficult ... and a spectacular journey along a path we will all follow. As we face the inevitable, Gawande gives us a framework within which to consider the options we may have, the choices we might want to make, and the medical and/or other assistance we may or may not desire. His thoughtful discussion of the people he has accompanied through their dying days, including his father, provides much to stimulate our own thoughts. The central theme is that these decisions should be, to the maximum possible extent, the patient's, with family and medical input, and not the other way around. In Gawande's experience that process, difficult and uncertain as it may be, yields the best results for all those involved."
91,0805095152,http://goodreads.com/user/show/10770371-dan,5,"Being Mortal by Atul GawandeGawande, as a surgeon, steps us through the reality of life’s waning moments. There is a heavy focus on cancer and old age and decisions around hospice care. Not easy subject matter but very useful information. I didn’t get choked up until the end of the book when the author takes us through the last few months of his father’s life as he battled cancer. The US is different from nearly all other countries in the world in how we deal with the elderly. As Americans we don’t live with aging parents and by extension a significant percentage of the elderly are put into retirement homes when they can no longer maintain independence. Gawande points out that our bodies are like machines and quite literally wear out. Most end of life situations spend a great deal of time on pain management and medications and often in the waning days, an inability to digest food.Some interesting facts. “By the age of sixty, people in an industrialized country like the United States have lost, on average, a third of their teeth. After eighty-five, almost 40 percent have no teeth at all.”Philip Roth said “Old age is not a battle. Old age is a massacre.”Gawande also discusses Do Not Resuscitate directives. There is part of a chapter where he recalls interning at a Boston area hospital. On one night he forgets that a patient had signed a DNR. When the patient goes into cardiac arrest, it sets in motion the CPR team to come revive the patient. When Gawande realizes his mistake and tries to call it off he is pushed aside. When the revival effort fails he is tongue lashed by the CPR team. The author feels very strongly about the value of hospice care. Almost everyone, if given the choice, would choose to die at home versus the hospital but the latter situation is still the norm. Sometimes because others have to make the medical decisions when the elderly become incapacitated. 4.5 stars. The writing here is easy to follow and the stories are quite compelling. There is also a lot of practical advice. The book was published in 2014. Highly recommended."
92,0805095152,http://goodreads.com/user/show/8079403-max,5,"This is an important book, whether you are approaching old age or family or friends you care about are. It set my mind spinning thinking how I would deal with the situations Gawande describes. Coming face to face with one’s decline and death is at least depressing and can be terrifying. Gawande points out that the medical profession and most of our institutions are not designed to deal with the human problem. He identifies a number of changes that could be made at a policy level that would improve things. But the fundamental problem is knowing ourselves and communicating our wishes or helping loved ones to reflect and do the same. Gawande points to helpful experiences with hospice care, but we must first make that decision. My notes follow.Gawande explains how growing old has changed and how we in developed countries have adjusted or failed to adjust to it. As the twentieth century wore on medicine made great advances and people’s life spans increased significantly. At the beginning of the century people would stay relatively healthy as they aged until they met a devastating disease, say the flu or cancer or heart disease. These would usually kill people rather quickly and they would die in their homes near friends and family. Now modern medicine fixes most of these problems, at least temporarily, so as people age their health ratchets down step by step. Eventually many of us will be unable to care for ourselves while the doctors keep us alive. There are in home services available and assisted living facilities for those who can afford them. But for the average person without significant savings this is a serious financial as well as personal dilemma and too often ends with a person’s final days spent in an impersonal nursing home.Both medical care for the elderly and institutional care suffer from the same problem – task orientation rather than people orientation. Doctors are trained to fix your issue and keep you alive, not evaluate the impact on your overall quality of life. Similarly institutions for the elderly are designed to meet set goals: To keep you safe, ensure you get your medications, get you fed, keep you clean, etc. The staff is rated on these things and focus on them, but they create an environment their residents typically hate. And of course many institutions don’t meet even basic standards. So the modern way of growing old often means becoming disabled enough to have to leave your home with little choice but to share a room with a stranger in an institutional environment. Gawande paints a grim picture of our future, but he also points to people trying to change things. These people are focused more on care than treatment. The woman who pioneered assisted living was looking for an alternative to the nursing home, not a stepping stone as it too often is. Others have tried to change the focus of nursing homes to enrich the lives of the residents through measures that allow more autonomy to the residents and less regimentation. The design of nursing homes can make them seem more like real homes and less like institutions. The more residents can participate, have choices, have outside interests, the better they will feel and do. Efficiency and safety have to be balanced against their effect on the patient’s quality of life. Throughout life we take reasonable chances to get more out of living. Why should that stop when time becomes short, when it is most precious?Gawande discusses terminal illness and the inevitable decision of whether to stop treatment. Doctors tend not to be helpful. They give choices of your treatment options. That is their job. But today there is hospice and palliative care. When is this a reasonable choice? The decision is personal. Doctors and family can’t really make it which is why drawing out the feelings of the patient is so important. From Gawande’s examples there is clearly a point in which treatment does more harm than good. We all want to die with some dignity and as little pain as possible. We all would rather die in a bed where we can say goodbye to friends and family rather than on a respirator in an ICU. But it is difficult to give up hope that the next procedure might work or buy us significant time. The decision is a tradeoff to achieve some quality of life at the end. Gawande talks about his own father’s case. His father, also a doctor, had terminal cancer and was facing paralysis. It took what Gawande calls the hard conversation to make the decision to accept hospice and the inevitable. In a testimony to the notion that the most sophisticated doctor may not be the best choice to initiate this conversation, Gawande’s father’s feelings were skillfully drawn out by a small town nurse practitioner from the local hospice. She was interested in him, his problems as he saw them, not in the disease and its treatment."
93,0805095152,http://goodreads.com/user/show/9049915-james-barker,5,"It is commonly phrased that we battle illness. But this remarkable book by Atul Gawande points out that it is an ill-thought battle and, dare I say it, an ill-fought one.For the last three years of my wonderful mother’s life I was her carer. Coping with the advanced stages of multiple sclerosis she was mostly restricted to her bed (which was in fact a hospital bed delivered to our family home along with all the other paraphernalia of sickness), permanently catheterised, unable to walk or do anything for herself. Mom also had severe dementia and often mistook me for my recently-deceased Dad. As an immersive carer I managed a team of women who assisted me in the day with my mother’s personal care. The rest of the time I sat with her, or fed her, or tried to unblock her catheter (while going out of my mind), or sang with her. Naturally, the last activity was the most enjoyable. Despite her dementia, Mom had a seemingly inexhaustible trove of perfectly-remembered lyrics in her head. We sang Doris Day songs, the Bellamy Brothers, the Beautiful South, the Beatles, Tori Amos, the Hollies, Cyndi Lauper, the Mama and Papas, Simon and Garfunkel, ABBA, songs from musicals. Even new songs she had only heard once we tackled together. Somehow she remembered these lyrics too.But 16 months before Mom passed away she developed septicaemia and was rushed into hospital. Her organs were shutting down, her pulse was weak and fading fast. We were told her quality of life was so bad, her disability so extreme, that the hospital was to offer no treatment- it would be kinder to let her go.We didn’t. I won’t go into the whys and wherefores of that decision but at least one of my sisters- who had driven in terror the 150 miles from where she lived- thought that letting go would be an idea we should not entertain and I wavered, full of love for this extraordinary woman who had been the life and soul of any party when I was growing up, rock and rolling on the dance floor, full of fast wit and laughter that was infectious in its affirmation of life. The doctor in charge asked me for one piece of evidence that suggested my mother had any quality of life at all. We sing every day- we sing together all the time, I said. So he treated her and somehow, over 7 long and painful weeks, she became well enough to be sent back home and into my care.But what did this ‘well enough’ mean? Mom was no longer capable of swallowing so had had a peg inserted into her stomach. I was trained in the art of its upkeep- everyday the wound needed to be cleaned and the peg rotated 360 degrees (otherwise it would fuse to her skin). Any strength Mom had had in her arms had gone. To all intents and purposes she was incapable of moving anything but her head (a fraction), her eyes and mouth. But by and large Mom slept, in a virtual coma that meant our daily songs felt like a golden time remembered and grieved from the perspective of a new time of horrors. Three days after returning home and in a fever caused by kidney stones that were trying to be passed (another tier of Hell) Mom whispered to me, “I have had enough.”But of course it didn’t end there. Mom stayed in a limbo of pain and half-consciousness for well over another year. She would emit blood-curdling screams when being cleaned, when being moved, but she did not sing. Fed a noxious mixture through a machine, one of the few joys she had had left (sucking on a piece of chocolate or enjoying slow mouthfuls of a home-cooked dinner) had gone. It struck me sitting beside her that we had consigned her to an exit that was barbarous and devoid of love. All I could do was ensure she was as comfortable as possible and that, on the occasions she was awake, she could see that I was there, smiling at her and telling her I loved her more than the world.When the end time came we were told on three separate occasions that today was the day. But a little woman of 5’2”, ranked a Zero by hospital doctors when her ability was assessed, she defied every professional speculation and breathed on another day, then another, then another. When she died in November 2012, a few weeks shy of her 68th birthday, I have truly never seen such peace on a face.In the last year of her life Mom had been well enough on a handful of occasions to wake and smile at me and sing with me. One of these occasions I captured on video. We sit together, smiling, singing ‘Zip A Dee Doo Dah,’ (my oh my what a wonderful day) and she tells me she loves me. An exquisite moment that I am glad I captured. But was it really worth the 16 months of Hell she went through?Atul Gawande’s book is all about acceptance of our mortality. But it is about much more than that. Modern medicine has it wrong, he says. It is about preserving life at all costs- battle for a year through procedure after procedure rather than enjoy your remaining months of life at the best possible quality. Yes, it turns out the emergency room where my mother ended up in 2011 made the right call and we did not. But, by and large, if you have a life-limiting prognosis with a disease such as cancer you will be offered all sorts of treatments to extend that life at the detriment of its quality.But this is also a book about the way the elderly are treated in the industry of care homes and sheltered housing. With all meaning to life removed, with all responsibility removed, people become shells of their former selves, depressed and longing for the death that the (questionable) care they are receiving is preventing. Visionary projects from the 1970s- with more pets in care homes, with pairs of birds in every room for residents to have a vested interest in looking after, with children of staff visiting, filling the emptiness with the joy of activity, of noise- show that it is possible for care homes to be places of life rather than death. But it takes more effort to achieve this, more resources. More determination to give the elderly a life worth enjoying. And so, of course, such ideas largely fall by the wayside, because in a capitalist world the elderly are a drain on life, on resources... which is frankly sickening.I cannot stress enough how important this book is. It was, at times, a painful read for me, and that will be the case for anyone who has lost someone in a medicalised nightmare of end-time. But you owe it to yourself to understand what best befits you when your time comes. You owe it to yourself to choose your own ending. This book arms you with the knowledge to make the right decision, however painful that is.As for my mother.. after 3 touch and go trips to the hospital in the last year of her life I spoke to my sisters and told them it all came down to what we felt Mom would prefer- to die at home or have more and more (hopeless) treatment at hospital, where it was inevitable that one day she would happen to die. We agreed that just as my father had passed away at home, surrounded by people who loved him, our mother deserved the same. It was the best decision we made. She passed on in her home of 40 years held by those she loved and surrounded by their voices. She died in peace."

Gawande has about three major points in this book, all of which were made in a news magazine article he wrote for the Atlantic: 1, We should have tough conversations with those in our lives about their vision for their end-of-life; 2, Doctors should also have these conversations with their patients; and 3, If we have these conversations, we can shift medicine and end-of-life care away from a stave-off-death model and towards a model that promotes humanity, autonomy, and dignity for the dying (and thus no longer need institutional nursing homes). I do not disagree, but the book itself is heavy on anecdotes and light on actual research or policy analysis.My major stylistic critique is that Gawande buries his three points in pages of anecdotes about patients and memories of his own father's decline and death. I'm not being unsympathetic to the suffering of these colorful characters (and Gawande's own personal suffering), but I found the anecdotes long-winded, distracting, and ultimately boring. Gawande intended them to have emotional impact for the reader, but for me, the stories smacked of filling pages for the pure commercial gain of selling a book. My major substantive critique is that Gawande spends too little time on policy, instead championing the heroism of individual doctors, caregivers, and entrepreneurs-- as if the system can be saved by some brave individuals. He is far too sanguine about the difficulty of changing institutions at the macro-level. Yes, Gawande mentions that these alternative living arrangements and alternative therapeutic approaches save money in the long run, but most of the initiatives Gawande covers were developed by private entrepreneurs, not governments (though some government funds may have been made available in the form of grants). Dramatic policy change would be needed to scale and fund these initiatives at the state or federal level, and I do not see the current vested interests in the healthcare lobby supporting these changes (nor does Gawande provide a path for fighting for policy change, besides mentioning the cost-effectiveness argument). The one scale-able initiative that Gawande discusses, Hospice, already exists-- but Gawande ignores that Hospice's ranks are often filled with low-skilled, under-paid, and over-worked caregivers who are hardly in the position to give the attentive, individualized care that Gawande received for his father. Gawande is also too sanguine about the role of socioeconomic class, which is perhaps why his friends and his patients receive such excellent care. He is wrapped in a bubble of privilege -- access to the top surgeons and the most committed nurses. True, some of the alternative homes that Gawande mentions do take Medicaid, but these homes are so few that they have waitlists that are hundreds of names long. The type of ""better death"" that Gawande argues for so eloquently is available only to the wealthiest or the most educated (those empowered to fight the system and search for better options). Without a serious treatment of the nexus between healthcare policy, quality of life, and socioeconomic status, this book seems to me squarely in the realm of theory, not practice. "
95,0805095152,http://goodreads.com/user/show/929238-hbalikov,5,"This is an excellent book. It is also the most important book that I have read in the past year.Dr. Gawande is that rare physician who can write well and write well for the layman. There is nothing glamorous about growing old. There is nothing glamorous in taking care of those who are growing old. As to the former, Gawande, makes it clear as he describes the way our bodies decline and breakdown over time. As to the later, it helps to explain both why very few doctors are attracted to gerontology and why those who aren't are not particularly adept at dealing with those who are at or near the end of their lives. This book is about ""what matters in the end,"" but it is also about Gawande's journey as a physician and surgeon. ""I never expected that among the most meaningful experiences I'd have as a doctor --- and, really, as a human being --- would come from helping others deal with what medicine cannot do as well as what it can.""Atul Gawande is meticulous in describing how we wear down and wear out. ""There is, he told me, 'no single, common cellular mechanism to the aging process.'....The process is gradual and unrelenting."" And, how many of us believe that we can put that aside for the present. ""People naturally prefer to avoid the subject of their decrepitude."" Yet, it colors many things that we do and many decisions that we have to make. In his own learning process, Gawande shares his experiences, and his encounters with doctors, other care givers and physicians. ""The job of any doctor, Bludau later told me, is to support quality of life, by which he meant two things: as much freedom from the ravages of disease as possible and the retention of enough function for active engagement in the world. Most doctors treat disease and figure that the rest will take care of itself.""He exposes a lot of the ""nursing home approach"" as insensitive with facilities that may come to resemble an asylum (in the worst sense). He explores the question, ""what makes life worth living when we are old and frail and unable to care for ourselves,"" is its many facets. There are: basic needs for survival; need for love and belonging; desire for growth (""the opportunity to attain personal goals, to master knowledge and skills, and to recognized and rewarded for our achievements); and, perhaps, ""self-fulfillment through pursuit or moral ideals and creativity for their own sake."" He points out that ""our driving motivations in life, instead of remaining constant, change hugely over time...""I learned a lot about how we often treat those who cannot care entirely for themselves and how attitudes and venues are changing. When doctors are just about ""tinkering"" with the seriously ill, a lot is ignored. Particularly, that those people ""have priorities (perhaps poorly expressed or not discussed) besides prolonging their lives. Surveys find that their top concerns include avoiding suffering, strengthening relationships with family and friends, being mentally alert, not being a burden to others, and achieving a sense that their life is complete.""I wish I had had this book to read before I found myself with friends and family members who were seriously ill or dying. Gawande describes how both amateur and professional caregivers can be sensitive to these issues. And, how they can give the ill and dying the opportunity to reflect on their own desires. One of those, for many, is that they would rather spend their remaining days at home instead of in an institution. There is a very illuminating section on hospice and how this should be explored far earlier than it currently is. Not necessarily invoking hospice care earlier, but being aware of what if can offer and, if desired, getting it going in time to make a difference with quality of life.""(Though), no one ever really has control. Physics and biology and accident ultimately have their way in our lives. But the point is that we are not helpless either. Courage is the strength to recognize BOTH realities. We have room to act, to shape our stories, though as time goes on it is within narrower and narrower confines. A few conclusions become clear when we understand this: that our most cruel failure in how we treat the sick and the aged is the failure to recognize that they have priorities beyond merely being safe and living longer; that the chance to shape one's story is essential to sustaining meaning in life; that we have the opportunity to refashion our institutions, our culture, and our conversations in ways that transform the possibilities for the last chapters of everyone's lives."""

In his effortlessly lucid prose, Gawande comes to terms with the medical establishment's failure in providing end-of-life care. Too often, doctors work to fix what's broken in the service of extending life, without considering how quality of life is compromised, inflicting even more suffering as a result. He extols the value of hospice and palliative care, whose aim is not to give up on patients, but to provide as many good days as possible in the inevitable slide to death. He advocates asking difficult questions with patients and loved ones to determine what can bring meaning and value to them, even in the harsh narrowing of life's possibilities brought on by failing bodies and minds. He does not exempt himself from this critique -- instead he offers personal stories, iike those of his father and his daughter's piano teacher, to show how he came to understand the necessity of these important discussions and the possibilities they offer. It's moving, and timely, and despite the less-than-cheerful subject matter, never a burden to read (a testament to his writerly skill). I can't recommend this book highly enough to anyone who will face these issues -- and we all most likely will, in some form."
97,0805095152,http://goodreads.com/user/show/47188780-kathleen,5,"•	This is an important book for all who have elderly parents that are struggling with end-of-life health issues. Dr. Gawande personalizes the key issues through individual case histories, but he backs up his arguments with solid statistics. First, our society does not have enough gerontologists to serve our aging population, and our medical schools are cutting back on training new ones. More importantly, medical doctors tend to want to solve medical problems. And often, that results in them not recognizing, or even asking, what is important to their patient’s quality of life. The elderly want to live in ‘a home’, not an institution. They want to feel in control of their lives as much as possible. Safety is less of a concern to them than independence. Privacy is important too. They tend to want their own space, with furniture from their own home. They want to be able to turn on the television when and at what volume they want. These needs are not compatible with institutional long-term care facilities. So, new options are being explored—particularly in the United States. Highly recommend."

 This right here is the theme of Atul Gawande's Being Mortal: Medicine and What Matters in the End. This incredible piece of medical/science nonfiction starts out by introducing historical and cultural norms for caring for our elders and how this has significantly shifted in many societies. Mr. Gawande does not pass judgement but presents the observations and facts so we the reader may have an objective view which starts a journey of perspective. And when we view the world from another perspective, self-examination takes place, thus change. I absolutely loved this book. Many books I have been reading lately have been all about timing it seems. Last year, I watched both my grandfathers die (within 3 days of each other) and this year I am really beginning to take note of my parents and in-law's escalating aging. I guess chronic diseases, strokes, and fickle organs will do that to you. Like many self-centered Americans, I have been looking at the process in terms of what it means for me. How will my life change as they become more and more dependent on me? This book. This book! My perspective and priorities are forever altered. It is about me, after all I am living my life, but it is also about them. They want to be the author of their own life just as much as I do and if I'm lucky, they will live long enough to require assistance with that. They didn't ask for these complications and they fear the loss of independence far more than I could ever begin to imagine. The true terror: that no one will care.Mr. Gawande stresses that end of life conversations are crucial and surprisingly liberating, not only as a son or daughter but as a medical provider. There is a sense of control even in the midst of very uncontrollable circumstances. Questions need to be asked and once answers are decided upon, fear and anxiety of all parties involved can relax a bit. Your wishes will be respected in terms of what a quality life means to you. In a world of nursing homes that might as well be classified as prisons, knowing that someone listens and cares about what you want (despite the options and risks) is priceless. Mr. Gawande draws from his personal experience with his father in this respect and I found these parts to be incredibly raw and emotional. I strongly recommend this book. But if you don't read it, please remember these questions for your loved ones: 

“Whenever serious sickness or injury strikes and your body or mind breaks down, the vital questions are the same: What is your understanding of the situation and its potential outcomes? What are your fears and what are your hopes? What are the trade-offs you are willing to make and not willing to make? And what is the course of action that best serves this understanding?”

 Ask questions, advocate as needed, and enjoy this short life with the people you love ♥My favorite quote:""This is what it means to have autonomy -- you may not control life's circumstances, but getting to be the author of your life means getting to control what you do with them.”"
99,0805095152,http://goodreads.com/user/show/83445-lisa-vegan,5,"This book is excellent. It’s accessible and always interesting. It’s one of those books that probably everybody should read. I’m thinking every physician should read it upon graduating from medical school or during their residency. I think that it’s an important book.I do disagree with him at times, though overall think what he says is spot on.The parts where I disagree are in two major areas: The main one is his reluctance about supporting widespread assisted suicide because he says in those places, palliative hospice care isn’t as advanced an offering. However, even with hospice, I’ve witnessed horrible suffering, unbearable suffering, and it seems rare that people have none of that in their last days and weeks. I think both assisted suicide and competent hospice should always be options. I think not all hospices care works very well at all, though I know that some does. The other place I disagree is his contention that genetics isn’t as crucial to longevity as I think it is, especially in those families where so many live to over 100 and, I know by knowing them, that they often do not take at all good care of themselves, living in a way where others without their genes would die at much younger ages and with more infirmities before their deaths. The gist of what he says about quality of life when aged or with a terminal illness I agree with wholeheartedly though. A lot of what he says about that and examples he gives, makes the book fun to read. I really appreciated the several very personal stories, including his father’s story. So, not only do I not want to live until end stage cancer or ALS, etc. which I’ve always known, but I have no desire to get so old or sick that I can’t take care of myself – with my situation I wouldn’t end up at one of the good places and even those wouldn’t be great for me. These are issues I’ve thought about since about age 12, and I will do anything I can to avoid physical pain, nausea, shortness of breath, and other forms of suffering. Great book for getting readers to think about what they want when they’re elderly or have a life threatening illness, and also for having conversations about their wishes, and encouraging others in their lives to also share their wishes.The best thing about the book, and I wish 100% of medical people would get on board, is the weighing of what is worth it and not worth it to patients, and facing what medicine can’t do as well as what it can do. Not lying! Not evading! Not giving false hope! Allowing patients to take the lead with their own lives! Advocating that conversations should be had with the ill/elderly and doctors shouldn’t assume they know what should be done without knowing the patients’ goals and wishes for themselves. Early in the book, a death mentioned sounded exactly like my mother in 1964-1965 – I have to read that book! Books leading to other books…I'm still laughing about the 100 loose birds!!!"
100,0805095152,http://goodreads.com/user/show/632247-chrissie,3,"Before reading: I am reading this not because I want to but because I feel I ought to. Is it going to make me feel all horrible? I can accept this if it constructively explains what you can do to ""improve"" the end of life. In conclusion: I am glad I read the book, but it wasn’t particularly fun. There are many examples given of particular people, their illnesses and the difficulties they had, one being the author’s father. I didn’t understand all the medical terms used. Examples are given to illustrate the author’s conclusions on how medical care of the aging should be altered. The author, who is himself a surgeon, shows new, better alternatives and how they came to be. He does this by naming pioneers of better nursing homes, assisted care units and hospice development. For a person in the medical field I think this book is essential because it shows how medical changes need to be and can be implemented…., but I am not employed in the medical field and the historical developments, although interesting, were a bit extraneous for me. From my point of view, these sections could have been shortened, even if they do show the direction the author is supporting. One can ask, “Who is this book for?”In my family we have had several deaths in the past years. So the weaknesses coupled to end of life medical care, nursing homes and hospices were not new to me. I didn’t have to be told; I was not surprised in the least. What I wanted from this book were guidelines showing me how I could improve my husband’s and my own end of life. Did the book do this? Well, it made me face my own situation and what lay ahead. As a result of reading this book I will be looking into what alternatives are available here in Sweden when we are no longer able to manage alone. My husband and I have discussed exactly how we see the future. It has made clear to us that we value independence and that we want to stay where we are as long as possible – even if such living may be less safe than living near a hospital. We plan on looking in to Assisted Care Facilities that offer a gradual increase of care as needs increase. Do they have queues? Are they expensive? Where are they located? The essential point is that you have to know what you are looking for and that will be different for each family. So, yes, I am glad I read the book. It made me evaluate what is important to me – nature and independence and a dog and pretty landscape. The book pushed me to do this.  Another issue the book pushes you to evaluate is how long you want to extend the years of your life even if that time is filled with pain and discomfort. This too is a personal decision. The book guides you in what sort of questions you should ask your doctor, but of course some questions are specific to the illness one is coping with. Some conclusions are drawn that may be true for many, but not for my husband and I. Generally, most seem to want more contact with family as they age. This has its difficult sides too, and the book mentions this only briefly. I think more attention could have been devoted to this topic. While funeral wishes are important to discuss at life’s end, I found it unnecessary that the author discussed the details of his father’s funeral in this book.Practically nothing is said about how the elderly no longer want to travel. I may add that if you want to travel do it when you are young and fit. I am thankful to have traveled earlier in my life. The book is primarily concerned with American facilities, and practically nothing is said about costs. The audiobook is narrated by Robert Petkoff. It is read at a good speed. When good nursing facilities were being discussed he tended to sound SO enthused, SO exuberant. Really, I found this a bit childish. It doesn’t distort the text, but exaggerates how wonderful it all is. I could have done without this. The book has made me more appreciative of what I have. It has pushed my husband and me to evaluate which qualities of life we deem most important. With a clearer understanding of our preferences we can more easily deal with what lies ahead."
101,0805095152,http://goodreads.com/user/show/730754-ken,4,"Anyone who is planning on dying some day should read this book. It can be jumpy at times, but overall, Gawande's a straight shooting, no-nonsense writer who gives the straight dope on nursing homes, assisted living, hospice, and the heart-rending decisions we are all forced into at our end-of-days. As many of his accounts deal with cancer cases, it's a bit of a downer, but it's medicine to be taken and there's no better way to illustrate his point than through real-life examples, including his own father, who developed a fatal tumor in his spinal cord. God save us all from ends like this, but sorry, we all don't get to die suddenly and peacefully in our sleep.Among topics Gawande tackles: the dearth of geriatricians in this country. So ironic. So American. But the money is not there for doctors dedicated to our fastest growing demographic. Oh. And the preventative-style approach, the in-the-moment treatments needed to keep the elderly happy? Often not paid for by insurance companies, either.He also gets into nursing home/assisted living situations, focusing on the story of an upstate NY facility where a maverick doctor/director decided to introduce parakeets and live plants in every room as well as two cats and two dogs who had the run of the place. The nurses were thrown by this -- one refused to pick up a doggy mistake on the floor because that wasn't what she got a nursing license for -- but eventually everyone saw the seismic shift this simple yet dramatic change had on the previously-listless residents. The ""inmates"" (what they felt like, previously) started to perk up, tell people about the personalities of their parakeets, take a hand in caring for both plants and birds. Meanwhile, they became entranced with the wandering dogs and cats. Those patients who were ambulatory surprised the nurses by stepping up and volunteering to walk the dogs. The director had kids visit, too, providing training to middle schoolers on how to talk even with people with Alzheimer's. The young people's two or three visits a week became events to look forward to for the elderly residents, who, between pets and children, suddenly discovered purpose and felt more like human beings, more like they used to when they were living alone.There are other variations here, too, like assisted living purposely designed in pods of smaller units, created to look more like homes and less like institutions. Chief among the changes? Allowing people some privacy -- their own rooms. Giving them more leeway on what to do, when to eat. The schedules work around the people vs. vice versa.But the bulk of the book focuses on decisions and consequences. There are no definitive moves to make once a fatal disease begins its course, but Gawande shows that it's spinning a bit out of control in too many cases. The money being spent to prolong lives, often to make those lives so much more miserable just because people refuse to accept the oldest fact of life -- death -- is truly a scary thing. Modern medicine may be many things, but it is no match for Death, who remains undefeated. Still, there is a measure of victory to be had. For many people, that may mean a shorter but higher quality amount of time with family and friends. And, paradoxically, Gawande points to studies showing that many people who choose hospice care actually live longer than those who take the harsh and risky treatment road. They have less pain. They are happier. Together, these effects lead to slightly longer days with those they love. So, if you think hospice is a white flag, think again. It's not as simple as all that. Nor is this book. It's food for thought. Not that it will get any easier for you, the reader, when such choices visit you or your loved ones (and they will), but at least you'll have a better sense of balance and perspective. Can we ask for any more than that?"
102,0805095152,http://goodreads.com/user/show/275498-jim,5,"This is a brilliantly written book, and I was super-impressed with the genius of the good Dr Gawande right up to the point where he drank water out of the Ganges...I wouldn't do that at gunpoint! But while I might question the doc's wisdom in choice of beverages, I have to say he wrote a darn fine book.All of the occupants of this globe have a single thing in common...we will all die. Hopefully, we enjoy a long life and peaceful old age before our expiry date and, thanks to modern medicine and the care of good physicians, this is getting to be the reality for more people. This presents us with another problem: caring for a growing population of oldsters who require care as they ease their way into the hereafter. Families are getting smaller, so the progeny that would have cared for ailing seniors in the past are absent, or already employed. Expensive medical treatments are being employed to attempt to extend the lives of oldsters who would have slipped away without treatment, but at what cost? Frequently the result of this practice is that the medical treatment gives the patient an agonized existence suffering from side effects.Dr Gawande believes that, in most cases, if given a choice between having some quality time with loved ones or a possibly longer painful and befuddled existence under medical care, most people will choose the quality time even though it may be shorter. And here's another point to consider: Gawande has determined that 63% of doctors overestimate the amount of time a patient has to live, and that the better the doctor knows the patient, the more likely he/she will be to overestimate the patient's remaining time.Of interest to me was the fact that he basically confirmed an old homily my Granny used to toss out from time to time: ""A son is a son 'til he gets him a wife, but a daughter's a daughter for all of her life"". Here's what Dr Gawande had to say about the matter (from P. 79):  ""your chances of avoiding the nursing home are directly related to the number of children you have, and, according to what little research has been done, having at least one daughter seems to be crucial to the amount of help you will receive.""Naturally, one cannot always expect that sons and daughters will be able to care for them. Dr Gawande is firmly on the side of those who consult a palliative care specialist (From P.177):  ""The result; those who saw a palliative care specialist stopped chemotherapy sooner, entered hospice far earlier, experienced less suffering at the end of their lives - and they lived 25 percent longer. In other words, our decision making in medicine has failed so spectacularly that we have reached the point of actually inflicting harm on patients rather than confronting the subject of mortality.""This could have been a boring book...it wasn't. Dr Gawande has the gift of imparting information without making you feel like you are being tutored. A very interesting read, particularly for those of us who are around the last curve and racing toward the finish line."

The difficulty of what to do with the aging population is an interesting and highly debatable (if not slightly depressing) topic. Gawande shares real life client stories, including his own family. This made this book relatable, who hasn't watched an elder age and eventually pass away. The best story was the one with the home that brought in dogs, cats, birds and plants. I just loved reading about the after effects of bringing life and small responsibilities in for the elderly residents. Innovating for this demographic brought hope to this challenging time in our history and while the topic is dark, this perspective shone a tiny light of hope for the future.Would highly recommend."

106,0805095152,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7392004-quo,5,"I suspect that what makes some teachers revered is not just a mastery of the subject they mean to impart but that they also have retained an elemental sense of being a learner as well. One of the facets that impressed me most about Atul Gawande's Being Mortal: Medicine & What Matters in the End is that the author conveys the importance of the essential dialogue between doctor & patient by asking himself how he would like to be treated if he were the patient and not the medical specialist. To suggest that this is an important book is almost to diminish it, for Dr. Gawande involves the reader not just in reviewing a series of case studies & other background detail on how each of us attempts to deal with our own mortality but also causes something very personal to take place, the rare sensation of being spoken to directly in a meaningful, compassionate manner. For, as people become aware of the finitude of their life, they do not ask for much. They do not seek riches, they do not seek more power. They ask only to be permitted, insofar as possible, to keep shaping the story of their life in the world--to make choices & to sustain connections to others according to their own priorities.I found Being Mortal a treasure in many gradually unfolding ways. For example, little gerontological training occurs as a component part of medical school, so much so that many doctors feel they are often unable to offer treatment as much as the lure of hope. Dr. Gawande comments thatThere is almost always a long trail of possibility, however slim. However, we have built a multi-trillion dollar edifice for dispensing the medical equivalent of lottery tickets, while having only a rudimentary system to prepare patients for the near certainty that those tickets will not win. Hope is not a plan.Thus, 63% of M.D.'s overestimate survival time, not wanting to trample a patient's hopes, while only 17% underestimate survival time. Interestingly, if a doctor knows a patient well, he or she is more likely to be overly optimistic, ""even to the point of engaging in fantasy about experimental drugs to cure a patient or to extend life in an unrealistic way."" There are many humorous anecdotes which serve to relieve, at least in part, the difficult task of considering one's own mortality in this book, one being Philip Roth's comment that ""Old age is not a battle, it's a massacre."" And the late Harvard scientist & gifted writer, Prof. Steven Jay Gould, wistfully observed that ""the medium isn't always the message"", preferring the more realistic view of death as the ultimate enemy and finding nothing reproachable about those who ""rage against the dying of the light"", borrowing words from Dylan Thomas. Gould lived an additional 20 years after his original diagnosis. Another funny inclusion occurs when General Custer is compared with General Robert E. Lee, with the latter knowing when the battle could not be won.Included among the meaningful case studies is the story of Karen Brown Wilson on the west coast who develops a model for extended care or assisted living as an alternative to conventional nursing homes, though her new paradigm is quickly absorbed into a corporate structure & radically changed. Also, Dr. Bill Thomas in upstate New York, a restless Harvard Med School grad decides to attempt a new model for nursing homes, concluding that ""what was missing was life itself."" He introduces pets aplenty, including dogs, cats, birds and also inserts plants in each room to help confront the 3 plagues of nursing home existence: boredom, loneliness & helplessness. And, in so doing, he alters the relationship of patient to nursing home. Lastly, Dr. Atul Gawande's own father, also a surgeon & born in India, deals with his own mortality and when afflicted with cancer, he attempts to reinvent his life in a meaningful way during his remaining days by performing community service as a Rotarian and extending his ministry to a school he founded in his native India. Ultimately, Atul Gawande concludes that our ultimate goal should not be a good death but a good life till the very end and that assisted living is far more difficult than assisted death. In spite of the notion that every life ends in an execution, so to speak, there are countless uplifting vignettes of people dealing with their own mortality in a positive manner & with great courage in Dr. Gawande's wonderful book, Being Mortal and also in a one hour television episode of ""Frontline"", available via the Internet."

“Death is the enemy. But the enemy has superior forces. Eventually, it wins. And in a war that you cannot win, you don’t want a general who fights to the point of total annihilation. You don’t want Custer. You want Robert E. Lee, someone who knows how to fight for territory that can be won and how to surrender it when it can’t, someone who understands that the damage is greatest if all you do is battle to the bitter end.”

 “We’ve been wrong about what our job is in medicine. We think our job is to ensure health and survival. But really it is larger than that. It is to enable well-being.” 
This is not an easy simple-read. It is a brain-storming perspective-changing book.In all our modern medical learning and practice we aim at making life last ""longer"", but we should make it feel ""better""We try to elongate the lives of the elder, or the ""life"" of their bodies/corpses. Using unjustified mechanical ventilation, Inotropic support, unjustified high-risk operations and the result is an end-of-life ""lived"" in hospitals.
 “A few conclusions become clear when we understand this: that our most cruel failure in how we treat the sick and the aged is the failure to recognize that they have priorities beyond merely being safe and living longer; that the chance to shape one’s story is essential to sustaining meaning in life; that we have the opportunity to refashion our institutions, our culture, and our conversations in ways that transform the possibilities for the last chapters of everyone’s lives.” 

 “I learned about a lot of things in medical school, but mortality wasn’t one of them. Although I was given a dry, leathery corpse to dissect in my first term, that was solely a way to learn about human anatomy. Our textbooks had almost nothing on aging or frailty or dying. How the process unfolds, how people experience the end of their lives, and how it affects those around them seemed beside the point. The way we saw it, and the way our professors saw it, the purpose of medical schooling was to teach how to save lives, not how to tend to their demise.” 
This book is about how can we make life worth-living when we are too frail, too fragile, vulnerable and dependent.Our societies confronts these circumstances by avoiding talking about them, we all deny death, deny talking about it until it is too late.We designed nurseries to control the elder, their safety and their privacy and to make their lives impervious to change . . And the result is a life supposed to be safe, but empty of everything they care about.
 “It is not death that the very old tell me they fear. It is what happens short of death—losing their hearing, their memory, their best friends, their way of life. As Felix put it to me, “Old age is a continuous series of losses.” Philip Roth put it more bitterly in his novel Everyman: “Old age is not a battle. Old age is a massacre.” 
in this book you learn how to listen to them, to acknowledge their fears and how to feel their hopes. You will learn that death is inevitable, that you should respect death, you should respect aging, you should talk about it, and above all you should truly ""live"" to the very end of your life.
 “The problem with medicine and the institutions it has spawned for the care of the sick and the old is not that they have had an incorrect view of what makes life significant. The problem is that they have had almost no view at all. Medicine’s focus is narrow. Medical professionals concentrate on repair of health, not sustenance of the soul. Yet—and this is the painful paradox—we have decided that they should be the ones who largely define how we live in our waning days.” 

 “Sometimes we can offer a cure, sometimes only a salve, sometimes not even that. But whatever we can offer, our interventions, and the risks and sacrifices they entail, are justified only if they serve the larger aims of a person’s life. When we forget that, the suffering we inflict can be barbaric. When we remember it the good we do can be breathtaking.” 

 “Our ultimate goal, after all, is not a good death but a good life to the very end.” 

 “Death, of course, is not a failure. Death is normal. Death may be the enemy, but it is also the natural order of things.”

Should we want them to? At what cost – not to society or to our wallets, but at what cost to our humanity and dignity? Atul Gawunde, a surgeon in Boston Massachusetts, explores the ways in which medicine (and specifically American medicine and American society) helps and hinders the aged, the infirm, and the dying. If you know anyone who will someday die … stop reading this review and read this book.As he did in his previous books, Gawunde gives clear information and asks probing questions. He does not necessarily try to give us THE answer, but he does propose some alternatives, ultimately leaving the final answer up to each and every one of us. Having helped both my parents face their mortal ends, I can tell you that my family members and I – brothers, sister-in-law, and husband – have had many discussions about these issues over the past several years. Some of the physicians we encountered were open to such frank discussion, but not all were. There are difficult issues, heart-wrenching dilemmas, and anxiety-producing situations. But they do not get less difficult, less anxiety-producing, or less heart-wrenching when we ignore them. Oliver Sacks wrote the following blurb: “We have come to medicalize aging, frailty, and death, treating them as if they were just one more clinical problem to overcome. However it is not only medicine that is needed in one’s declining years but life – a life with meaning, a life as rich and full as possible under the circumstances. Being Mortal is not only wise and deeply moving, it is an essential and insightful book for our times…” WHY are you still reading this review? Read the book … NOW! Think carefully about what you want, and then talk about it – to your family, your friends, your doctors. Encourage them to read the book, too. Robert Petkoff does a superb job reading the audio book. There is a bonus interview with the author at the end of the audio version. "
109,0805095152,http://goodreads.com/user/show/24882791-india-m-clamp,4,"“Is empathy and kindness standard in geriatric medicine?” Why did Dr. Gawande find it disconcerting how old/frail patients are being treated? Why are parents cared for---as if they were made of gold---better in India?Truly an arduous journey on a path laden with geriatric patients and a transformation from independence to its’ opposite. This imposing trudge into considerations, care and realities of mortality and “how hope is an elixir.” Most elegantly summarized. Gawande writes: “Being Mortal is about the struggle to cope with the strength of our biology. We think our job is to insure health and survival but it is to enable well-being.” This communicates the goal for all engaging in the practice of medicine. This book is not for shy, sensitive or frail as it's an honest and blatantly truthful aperçu of what is/was observed by Dr. Gawande in geriatric medicine today. Educational and somber. Must read for all physicians. Buy and keep Kleenex on stand-by."
110,0805095152,http://goodreads.com/user/show/10312986-lyn-elliott,5,"We all want to live independent lives but as we age we are likely to lose at least some elements of that independence. This is easy to acknowledge, not so easy to come to terms with and certainly not easy to prepare for.Gawande's book is essential reading for anyone who is ageing themselves, or for anyone caring for somebody who is ill or frail enough to be approaching a state of dependency. Reading this has helped me to be aware of the questions I need to ask myself and those I care about. You can't ever assume you know what someone else really wants to do with their lives as they become dependent, or as they near death.How can you live well till the end, avoiding medically institutionalised interactions, treatments and living space? I wish I had read this before my parents became frail and certainly well before their last illnesses. This was an unusual book club choice, but then it's a great group of women. Not a wimp amongst us. "
111,0805095152,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2375838-cheryl,5,"There is a long phase in the first parts of our lives where, if we are lucky enough to have avoided critical disease or injury, we are blithely unaware of the effects of aging and of the inevitability of death. It seems so far ahead in the future as to be imaginary. Like imagining what a trillion dollars is like. You know that is a real thing, but still…it seems impossible to know what it really is. The other day I said to my teenage daughter, “Just imagine, in only forty years from now you will be standing in the kitchen with your partner and asking the same questions I’m asking now, like “When can we retire and go do what we really want?” “ She snorted. “Forty years? That’s ages from now!” And I’m saying, “no, forty years isn’t long at all! You will be planning your retirement!”She doesn’t really believe it.I sort of wish I had that back again. Those days of childhood, adolescence, young adulthood, where we never gave a thought to retirement, to aging, to death. Later on in life, we end up sometimes dwelling too much on those things, as if to make up for our inattention earlier. Nowadays, I sometimes feel hyper-aware of the universality of disease, the effects of aging, and shuffling off the mortal coil. It is unavoidable - I stare at it through the microscope daily as a pathologist. I often wonder which of those diseases that we hand out like playing cards will be the one dealt to me. “There’s no escaping the tragedy of life., which is that we are all aging from the day we are born… This experiment of making mortality a medical experience is just decades old. And the evidence is it is failing.”“Our reluctance to honestly examine the experience of aging and dying has increased the harm we inflict on people and denied them the basic comforts they most need.”The chapters of the book follow the course of our lives, and are richly illustrated with examples from Gawande’s own family and from his medical practice. Their stories are woven through the book, providing compelling and touching portraits. They are us. We are independent beings who are increasingly living longer and living independently longer.But ‘Things Fall Apart.’ “The culprit is just the accumulated crumbling of one’s bodily systems while medicine carries out its maintenance measures and patch jobs""“Human beings fail the way all complex systems fail: randomly and gradually…as the defects in a complex system increase, the time comes when just one more defect is enough to impair the whole, resulting in the condition known as frailty. It happens to power plants, cars, and large organizations. And it happens to us: eventually, one too many joints are damaged, one too many arteries calcify. There are no more backups. We wear down until we can’t wear down anymore.”So gradually, as the losses accumulate, we become Dependent. We need increasing amounts of Assistance, often in the form of retirement or nursing homes. These tend to provide an institutionalized life — that is not a good life, it’s just as good as can be got in the circumstances. But that robs us of our autonomy and our ability to make choices and to shape the story of our life in the world. “Whatever the limits and travails we face, we want to retain the autonomy—the freedom—to be the authors of our lives. This is the very marrow of being human” New models of care are evolving though, so people like 94 year old Lou are “…still able to live in a way that made him feel that he still had a place in this world.” I found this chapter particularly encouraging. The chapters on Letting Go and Hard Conversations are thoughtful, valuable discussions not only for clinical physicians, nurses and other members of the health care team, but also for anyone — patient, family, friend — who has reached that place where the end of life is in sight. “Technological society has forgotten what scholars call the “dying role” and its importance to people as life approaches its end. People want to share memories, pass on wisdoms and keepsakes, settle relationships, establish their legacies, make peace with God, and ensure that those who are left behind will be okay. They want to end their stories on their own terms.”Finally, Courage. “At least two kinds of courage are required in aging and sickness. The first is the courage to confront the reality of mortality—the courage to seek out the truth of what is to be feared and what is to be hoped.” We need the courage to act on the truth we find. One has to decide whether one’s fears or one’s hopes are what should matter most.This was a profoundly enriching book. It should be required reading for all health care professionals who work with seriously ill patients, and for those who work with the aged, and for those who run our health care systems, and for those who have aging/ill parents/relatives, and for those who are embarking on those final passages, and in some ways especially for those who haven’t yet reached those phases, so that they will be better prepared. It is intelligent, rational, touching, and warmly profound. It is a classic. "
112,0805095152,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4146473-connie,5," I read this a while ago, and it is a book that comes up quite often in conversation, and one that I highly recommend. For medical students, Dr's, nurses, anyone who works in medicine, anyone with aging parents and quite frankly anyone who is aging. Pretty much everyone I know. When talking about it I realized that though I remember it well and recommend it I had never written a review. So here you go. One of the first chapters tells the story of the author when he was shadowing a family practitioner. An elderly woman came in with her main complaint of heart issues. She also commented on poor balance and the Dr noted weight loss. The young writer was confused when the Dr. asked her if she ate alone. More confusion when the physician commented on her pretty manicure, which the patient proudly said she did herself. When the doctor asked her to remove her shoes, the young student was even more perplexed. Came to be that the older physician realized she could not trim her toenails, and they were hurting in her shoes, causing her to change her gait...and at a risk for losing her balance and falling. Another concern was her weight loss, as she did not eat well due to eating alone. She was much frailer and he worried a fall may result in a broken hip or worse. He recommended a podiatrist and that her family try to eat several meals with her throughout the week. He told the young student that he could give medicine for the heart....but a fall with a break would cause much distress and change in her quality of life. This is the basis of this book. Physicians need to learn to look at the whole person, not just the complaint. So often we see a ""specialist"" whose focus is on what they specialize in, and they miss the other signs. Believe me, I have seen this happen. Yet I have also seen those who look at the big picture and those folks are the ones I would want to care for me. We are often so busy trying to live longer. Yet sometimes, or often it is the ""quality"" not the ""quantity"" of our lives that matter. This author delves into this issue with first hand knowledge of patients he has treated as well as his own family members. He admits how hard it is to step back and not always have to ""fix"" everything, but learn to listen to what is important to his patient. We can all learn this lesson. How do we picture the end of our lives? What do we really need to do to achieve that?  This is a book that makes you think about aging, aging in place and aging well. It makes you think about maintaining dignity. I know I thought of this often with family members who were facing the end of life, and I often had to stop and listen to what it was that was important to them, not to me. I only hope that someone allows me that same choice."
113,0805095152,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7958239-elizabeth-theiss,5,"When is it time to stop fighting disease and death, and work instead on the best quality of life possible? Gawande has given us a wise and thoughtful discussion of how to approach the question, one I found helpful and convincing.As always Gawande uses stories to demonstrate the problems attendant to the medicalization of death. Doctors are trained to treat death as the enemy, not death as the inevitable. In an effort to forestall the inevitable, doctors' use every available tool from invasive surgeries to brutal successive chemo therapies that leave patients, that is, people, lingering in pain. As in The Checklist Manifesto, Gawande's solution is simple, a short set of questions that doctors should ask patients nearing the end of their lives. The conversation centers around what is most important to the person; what immediate goals are central; and what trade-offs between length of life and quality of life a person is willing to make. Gawande's ideas about nursing homes as places to avoid are spot on as well. His description of these ""homes"" driven by staff's needs for cookie cutter treatment of residents From assembly line pill dispensing to early morning shower times are downright depressing. We just sprang my husband from a month in a nursing home and it was exactly as described. But alternatives do exist, some better than others. The key seems to be finding a place that allows individual autonomy and provides support for quality of life. The one element ignored here is the cost of this kind of support; it is out of the reach of most people who need it and not supported by Medicare, despite the fact that it is less expensive than a traditional nursing home. My father was fortunate to live out the last two years of his life in a truly wonderful care center with a home-like environment, a small number of house mates, and home cooked meals each night. Gawande made me think we should just tear down the old ones and start over.I have spent a good deal of time thinking about these questions and problems as I helped my father through Alzheimer's and my spouse through 23 years of Parkinson's disease. Gawande has it exactly right and I'm hoping Being Mortal is a best seller so doctors and everyone else benefits from his perspective on what a good life and a good death means."
114,0805095152,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1608124-dana-stabenow,5,"I give this book five stars not because I loved it but because it is what I would call a necessary read, and I mean necessary for everyone, young, old, medical professional and laity alike. It's about That Conversation, what Gawande calls in one chapter ""Hard Conversations."" The subject is how we want to live out the end of our life.Gawande is a surgeon and one of the best parts of this book is that he is learning how to have this conversation himself. He's learning how to do it as a medical professional with his patients, and he's not shy about telling us where and how he has screwed up. He is also learning how to do it as a son to his father, also a surgeon, who has been diagnosed with a rare spinal tumor.The difficulty, he writes, is that in the last fifty years we have learned how to prolong life.As recently as 1945, most deaths occurred in the home. By the 1980s, just 17 percent did...Across not just the United States but also the entire industrialized world, the experience of advanced aging and death has shifted to hospitals and nursing homes...You don't have to spend much time with the elderly or those with terminal illness to see how often medicine fails the people it is supposed to help...Our reluctance to honestly examine the experience of aging and dying has increased the harm we inflict on people and denied them the basic comforts they most need.Later he writes You'd think people would have rebelled. You'd think we would have burned the nursing homes to the ground.But we haven't, and new discoveries and better medical practice mean that citizens of industrialized nations are living longer, healthier lives. ""A life,"" Gawande writes, ""designed to be safe but empty of anything they care about."" The trick now is to make sure our aging populations are not just safe, or even--heresy! sacrilege!--not safe at all, but living a life that achieves quality of life, not just quantity. The good news is, things are changing. (He doesn't say so but you know it has everything to do with the Boomers, a generation now making decisions for their parents, and who will soon be making those decisions--or not--for themselves.) Keren Brown Wilson built the first assisted living facility in Oregon in 1980, and when that concept became bastardized people like Dr. Tom Wilson revolutionized an assisted living facility with two dogs, four cats, 100 parakeets and child care for employees that brought children back into the lives of the inmates (using that word deliberately, as Gawande does himself). Researchers studied the effects of this program over two years, comparing a variety of measures for Chase's residents with those of residents at another nursing home nearby. Their study found that the number of prescriptions required per resident fell to half that of the control nursing home. Psychotropic drugs for agitation, like Haldol, decreased in particular. The total drug costs fell to just 38 percent of the comparison facility. Deaths fell 15 percent.From inmates locked away from life, warehoused until they died, Dr. Wilson's patients became once again members of a community. And as Gawande goes on to say, this experiment and others like it are beginning all across the nation.There is also Hospice, which organization Gawande's father chooses to help him through the end of his life with palliative care. For Hospice, it's all about making the end of each individual story as valuable to them as is physically possible for them. It's impossible to say enough good things about Hospice and Gawande doesn't stint them here. (Full disclosure: I already support Hospice and this book is making me double that support this year.) I know it sounds a little macabre, but this is the one book you really should read. Make a teenager read it and they will understand that much more about what Grandma is going through. Make a Millennial read it and he'll understand in spades how important that retirement plan is and how they should start one now. Make your doctor read it and she'll see how important first asking those essential questions is, ""What do you want? What is most important to you?"" instead of automatically reaching for the scalpel or the drugs. ""Death,"" writes Gawandeis normal. Death may be the enemy, but it is also the natural order of things. I knew these truths abstractly, but I didn't know them concretely--that they could be truths not just for everyone but also for this person right in front of me, for this person I was responsible for.Me, either. Now I feel like I do. Read this book, and recommend it to everyone you know. It is very frank, very well written, and actually? Kind of hopeful.****See also on Vox, ""2015 is the year America started having a sane conversation about death,"" http://www.vox.com/2015/12/16/1011744...."
115,0805095152,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3897817-morgan-blackledge,5,"This is a heart wrenchingly moving and important book. It speaks directly to our cultures strained and distant relationship to aging, the elderly, death and dying. Rarely if ever have I heard a medical clinician speak with such vulnerability and humility about the limits of modern medicine.French cultural theorist and urbanist Paul Virilio observed, with every invention or technical advance, an equally powerful disaster is co-created, for example, when we invented the locomotive, we simultaneously invented the train wreck.In a sense, Being Mortal is Dr. Atul Gawande's analogous observation about the incredible benefits of advanced medicine and the unprecedented opportunities for prolonged suffering and denial it affords us. I'm so grateful to be alive in this time, and science and technology have everything to do with that. Ordinary people have never had as much freedom to pursue knowledge or self expression as we currently enjoy.Advanced medicine is central to the high standard of living we currently have. It prolongs our lives and reduces suffering in many ways that we completely take for granted. But in a real sense, our faith in technology and medical advances has lulled us to sleep on some of life's most important and philosophical, psychological, and spiritual issues. Those of impermanence, suffering, loss and mortality.Our culture does a phenomenal job of keeping death and suffering out of plain sight. This affords the individuals facing these challenges the privacy and professional care that most people chose if given the option.This represents a real advance. But the equally powerful disaster that accompanies this advance is not trivial. The fact that most of us now live the majority of our lives insulated from the reality of death and dying means that we are quite likely to be utterly naive and under developed in this important existential domain.Frankly speaking, these are difficult and unsightly truths most of us would rather defer encountering. In the short term we enjoy the bliss that ignorance affords, but in the long term we suffer the numerous negative consequences that accompany the unexamined life.This book is attempting to address this issue by presenting us with a sober but empathetic and even optimistic view of the end of the road. Highly recommended, five stars."

118,0805095152,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4342402-tl,5,"See Caroline's review here:https://www.goodreads.com/review/show... (her review convinced me to pick this up)----She says it all beautifully so I will add my thoughts here (this'll be fairly short mostly cause my head hurts right now).This book brings up topics most of us don't think about when we are young. It seems too far away to contemplate so we put it out of our minds. Sure, we may talk about it time to time with our loved ones but how many of give it serious thought until something happens, let alone what questions to ask?The subject matter is a bit weighty in here but never felt dry or boring. There's feeling and passion  here. Gawande transports you into what he is talking about, like you are sitting with him at his kitchen table. The personal stories and histories he shares throughout the book were in turns touching and very informative. Of the former, a few had me tearing up and wanting to hug them all. The latter fascinated me, as I didn't know how those things all came about (one of those ""it has always been around"" that you just don't explore further) .I agreed with him on alot of the things he said and it got me thinking about my wishes on the future as well. Hopefully this will help with the hard conversation in the future (even though we wish we could live forever).This is an important book that should be on the bookshelves of everyone, in my humble opinion. Highly recommended.(Excuse any errors, typing on my phone)Narrator: Five starsBonus interview with the author was a nice touch."
119,0805095152,http://goodreads.com/user/show/28602001-emma,5,"An incredible book, but one that has the potential to cause considerable distress.‘Being Mortal’ is a book that addresses the experience of dying in modern society and questions whether we are getting it right. Chapters 1-5 focus primarily on mortality and the diverse nature of the end of life care provided for the elderly. Chapters 6-8 deal more specifically with how those with serious or terminal illnesses, and their families, cope with the process of dying. In these later chapters, the stories related by Gawande are frequently those in which the suffering and death of individuals is caused by cancer, including that of his own father. Though dying is an event that eventually comes to us all, it is a subject that is inherently difficult to address. In talking about our mortality, each person must confront not only the idea of their own death, but that of those who matter to them. It is entirely understandable that people choose to avoid discussing it. Yet Gawande’s book shows why it is important for everybody to stop putting aside the conversation about dying; that, in fact, refusing to tackle death until it is right upon you can lead to much greater pain and suffering. It is at this point when medical intervention takes over, often at the expense of compassion. Medical professionals would do well to read this book as part of their training and development, if only to understand how important honest communication can be to patient outcomes. They are only human, and as such, may feel as awkward about such matters as the rest of us, but they have a duty to provide accurate/truthful information about an individual’s illnesses/conditions so that they can have realistic expectations. Gawande argues that instead of defaulting to the most aggressive form of medical intervention, it is more important to talk to the individual about their goals, what is most important to them, what they can and can’t live with, what their fears and concerns are, what trade offs they are willing to make. Through discussion, a better path can be found for those who may be in pain or who are coming to the end of their life. Such conversations are necessarily incredibly difficult but Gawande highlights the benefits of having a plan put together by the individual, their family, and the medical professionals in collaboration; it is this honest dialogue that will allow an individual to manage their illness and the end of their life in a way that suits their needs. Gawande’s argument is empowering, it promotes the active role of the individual as the centre of their care and what happens to them. Within each chapter, Gawande often addresses what has happened in the past, what is happening now (including in different parts of the world), how people are trying to change things, and what the focus for the future should be. This plan means that the book is not depressing; it highlights the failures but injects positivity by showing ways in which things are being improved, or can/should be improved. At no point does Gawande fall into pessimism, he believes that while the majority of systems and institutions may not be meeting the needs of individuals right now, there is a chance that more of them will do so in the future. The book is his way of showing the difference between what is, and what should be, including examples of people and places that are getting it right. Importantly, Gawande is not prescriptive. He does not say ‘this is THE way to do things’, instead he shows how different solutions are being implemented. The variety of solutions reflect the multitude of differing ways people want and need to approach their ill health, old age, and death.       ‘Being Mortal’ is incredibly difficult to review. Given that I agree with Gawande, it would be easy to say that everyone should read this book. Yet in saying that, it feels like I am telling people that they need to deal with the idea of their death as soon as possible and, if they are currently unwell, that they should open a dialogue with their doctor to plan how they want it to proceed. It sounds more challenging when phrased this way, and is it not truly understandable that someone may not want to deal with the idea of their death by calmly talking through the steps? At the same time, I fundamentally believe Gawande’s argument that honest communication is the way forward for those who are living with terminal illness. Perhaps this is because I would rather make my own decisions while I can, and not leave them for others, who may have to guess what I might want in emergency situations if I hadn’t made my thoughts clear. The role of friends and family as support network seems intrinsically opposed to making these hard choices, the love and hope with which these decisions are made might not be compatible with the path I would want. Neither, perhaps, would the medical intervention. In modern society, people have become a medical problem to be solved, they must be ‘made safe’, increasingly separated from the rest of society and even from themselves, thereby removing any chance at individuality or choice. The problem is exacerbated by the disconnection between what medicine can do and what it should do. Gawande treats the grave and emotive subject matter with respect and conviction. At the end of someone’s life, or as they cope with ill health, he wants people to be able to have choices, to focus on what’s important to the , and to be supported in those goals by everyone around them. This is what I will hope for. "
120,0805095152,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2231715-lewis-weinstein,5,"This book is not pleasant to read. It is challenging, emotional, difficult ... and a spectacular journey along a path we will all follow. As we face the inevitable, Gawande gives us a framework within which to consider the options we may have, the choices we might want to make, and the medical and/or other assistance we may or may not desire. His thoughtful discussion of the people he has accompanied through their dying days, including his father, provides much to stimulate our own thoughts. The central theme is that these decisions should be, to the maximum possible extent, the patient's, with family and medical input, and not the other way around. In Gawande's experience that process, difficult and uncertain as it may be, yields the best results for all those involved."
121,0805095152,http://goodreads.com/user/show/10770371-dan,5,"Being Mortal by Atul GawandeGawande, as a surgeon, steps us through the reality of life’s waning moments. There is a heavy focus on cancer and old age and decisions around hospice care. Not easy subject matter but very useful information. I didn’t get choked up until the end of the book when the author takes us through the last few months of his father’s life as he battled cancer. The US is different from nearly all other countries in the world in how we deal with the elderly. As Americans we don’t live with aging parents and by extension a significant percentage of the elderly are put into retirement homes when they can no longer maintain independence. Gawande points out that our bodies are like machines and quite literally wear out. Most end of life situations spend a great deal of time on pain management and medications and often in the waning days, an inability to digest food.Some interesting facts. “By the age of sixty, people in an industrialized country like the United States have lost, on average, a third of their teeth. After eighty-five, almost 40 percent have no teeth at all.”Philip Roth said “Old age is not a battle. Old age is a massacre.”Gawande also discusses Do Not Resuscitate directives. There is part of a chapter where he recalls interning at a Boston area hospital. On one night he forgets that a patient had signed a DNR. When the patient goes into cardiac arrest, it sets in motion the CPR team to come revive the patient. When Gawande realizes his mistake and tries to call it off he is pushed aside. When the revival effort fails he is tongue lashed by the CPR team. The author feels very strongly about the value of hospice care. Almost everyone, if given the choice, would choose to die at home versus the hospital but the latter situation is still the norm. Sometimes because others have to make the medical decisions when the elderly become incapacitated. 4.5 stars. The writing here is easy to follow and the stories are quite compelling. There is also a lot of practical advice. The book was published in 2014. Highly recommended."
122,0805095152,http://goodreads.com/user/show/8079403-max,5,"This is an important book, whether you are approaching old age or family or friends you care about are. It set my mind spinning thinking how I would deal with the situations Gawande describes. Coming face to face with one’s decline and death is at least depressing and can be terrifying. Gawande points out that the medical profession and most of our institutions are not designed to deal with the human problem. He identifies a number of changes that could be made at a policy level that would improve things. But the fundamental problem is knowing ourselves and communicating our wishes or helping loved ones to reflect and do the same. Gawande points to helpful experiences with hospice care, but we must first make that decision. My notes follow.Gawande explains how growing old has changed and how we in developed countries have adjusted or failed to adjust to it. As the twentieth century wore on medicine made great advances and people’s life spans increased significantly. At the beginning of the century people would stay relatively healthy as they aged until they met a devastating disease, say the flu or cancer or heart disease. These would usually kill people rather quickly and they would die in their homes near friends and family. Now modern medicine fixes most of these problems, at least temporarily, so as people age their health ratchets down step by step. Eventually many of us will be unable to care for ourselves while the doctors keep us alive. There are in home services available and assisted living facilities for those who can afford them. But for the average person without significant savings this is a serious financial as well as personal dilemma and too often ends with a person’s final days spent in an impersonal nursing home.Both medical care for the elderly and institutional care suffer from the same problem – task orientation rather than people orientation. Doctors are trained to fix your issue and keep you alive, not evaluate the impact on your overall quality of life. Similarly institutions for the elderly are designed to meet set goals: To keep you safe, ensure you get your medications, get you fed, keep you clean, etc. The staff is rated on these things and focus on them, but they create an environment their residents typically hate. And of course many institutions don’t meet even basic standards. So the modern way of growing old often means becoming disabled enough to have to leave your home with little choice but to share a room with a stranger in an institutional environment. Gawande paints a grim picture of our future, but he also points to people trying to change things. These people are focused more on care than treatment. The woman who pioneered assisted living was looking for an alternative to the nursing home, not a stepping stone as it too often is. Others have tried to change the focus of nursing homes to enrich the lives of the residents through measures that allow more autonomy to the residents and less regimentation. The design of nursing homes can make them seem more like real homes and less like institutions. The more residents can participate, have choices, have outside interests, the better they will feel and do. Efficiency and safety have to be balanced against their effect on the patient’s quality of life. Throughout life we take reasonable chances to get more out of living. Why should that stop when time becomes short, when it is most precious?Gawande discusses terminal illness and the inevitable decision of whether to stop treatment. Doctors tend not to be helpful. They give choices of your treatment options. That is their job. But today there is hospice and palliative care. When is this a reasonable choice? The decision is personal. Doctors and family can’t really make it which is why drawing out the feelings of the patient is so important. From Gawande’s examples there is clearly a point in which treatment does more harm than good. We all want to die with some dignity and as little pain as possible. We all would rather die in a bed where we can say goodbye to friends and family rather than on a respirator in an ICU. But it is difficult to give up hope that the next procedure might work or buy us significant time. The decision is a tradeoff to achieve some quality of life at the end. Gawande talks about his own father’s case. His father, also a doctor, had terminal cancer and was facing paralysis. It took what Gawande calls the hard conversation to make the decision to accept hospice and the inevitable. In a testimony to the notion that the most sophisticated doctor may not be the best choice to initiate this conversation, Gawande’s father’s feelings were skillfully drawn out by a small town nurse practitioner from the local hospice. She was interested in him, his problems as he saw them, not in the disease and its treatment."
123,0805095152,http://goodreads.com/user/show/9049915-james-barker,5,"It is commonly phrased that we battle illness. But this remarkable book by Atul Gawande points out that it is an ill-thought battle and, dare I say it, an ill-fought one.For the last three years of my wonderful mother’s life I was her carer. Coping with the advanced stages of multiple sclerosis she was mostly restricted to her bed (which was in fact a hospital bed delivered to our family home along with all the other paraphernalia of sickness), permanently catheterised, unable to walk or do anything for herself. Mom also had severe dementia and often mistook me for my recently-deceased Dad. As an immersive carer I managed a team of women who assisted me in the day with my mother’s personal care. The rest of the time I sat with her, or fed her, or tried to unblock her catheter (while going out of my mind), or sang with her. Naturally, the last activity was the most enjoyable. Despite her dementia, Mom had a seemingly inexhaustible trove of perfectly-remembered lyrics in her head. We sang Doris Day songs, the Bellamy Brothers, the Beautiful South, the Beatles, Tori Amos, the Hollies, Cyndi Lauper, the Mama and Papas, Simon and Garfunkel, ABBA, songs from musicals. Even new songs she had only heard once we tackled together. Somehow she remembered these lyrics too.But 16 months before Mom passed away she developed septicaemia and was rushed into hospital. Her organs were shutting down, her pulse was weak and fading fast. We were told her quality of life was so bad, her disability so extreme, that the hospital was to offer no treatment- it would be kinder to let her go.We didn’t. I won’t go into the whys and wherefores of that decision but at least one of my sisters- who had driven in terror the 150 miles from where she lived- thought that letting go would be an idea we should not entertain and I wavered, full of love for this extraordinary woman who had been the life and soul of any party when I was growing up, rock and rolling on the dance floor, full of fast wit and laughter that was infectious in its affirmation of life. The doctor in charge asked me for one piece of evidence that suggested my mother had any quality of life at all. We sing every day- we sing together all the time, I said. So he treated her and somehow, over 7 long and painful weeks, she became well enough to be sent back home and into my care.But what did this ‘well enough’ mean? Mom was no longer capable of swallowing so had had a peg inserted into her stomach. I was trained in the art of its upkeep- everyday the wound needed to be cleaned and the peg rotated 360 degrees (otherwise it would fuse to her skin). Any strength Mom had had in her arms had gone. To all intents and purposes she was incapable of moving anything but her head (a fraction), her eyes and mouth. But by and large Mom slept, in a virtual coma that meant our daily songs felt like a golden time remembered and grieved from the perspective of a new time of horrors. Three days after returning home and in a fever caused by kidney stones that were trying to be passed (another tier of Hell) Mom whispered to me, “I have had enough.”But of course it didn’t end there. Mom stayed in a limbo of pain and half-consciousness for well over another year. She would emit blood-curdling screams when being cleaned, when being moved, but she did not sing. Fed a noxious mixture through a machine, one of the few joys she had had left (sucking on a piece of chocolate or enjoying slow mouthfuls of a home-cooked dinner) had gone. It struck me sitting beside her that we had consigned her to an exit that was barbarous and devoid of love. All I could do was ensure she was as comfortable as possible and that, on the occasions she was awake, she could see that I was there, smiling at her and telling her I loved her more than the world.When the end time came we were told on three separate occasions that today was the day. But a little woman of 5’2”, ranked a Zero by hospital doctors when her ability was assessed, she defied every professional speculation and breathed on another day, then another, then another. When she died in November 2012, a few weeks shy of her 68th birthday, I have truly never seen such peace on a face.In the last year of her life Mom had been well enough on a handful of occasions to wake and smile at me and sing with me. One of these occasions I captured on video. We sit together, smiling, singing ‘Zip A Dee Doo Dah,’ (my oh my what a wonderful day) and she tells me she loves me. An exquisite moment that I am glad I captured. But was it really worth the 16 months of Hell she went through?Atul Gawande’s book is all about acceptance of our mortality. But it is about much more than that. Modern medicine has it wrong, he says. It is about preserving life at all costs- battle for a year through procedure after procedure rather than enjoy your remaining months of life at the best possible quality. Yes, it turns out the emergency room where my mother ended up in 2011 made the right call and we did not. But, by and large, if you have a life-limiting prognosis with a disease such as cancer you will be offered all sorts of treatments to extend that life at the detriment of its quality.But this is also a book about the way the elderly are treated in the industry of care homes and sheltered housing. With all meaning to life removed, with all responsibility removed, people become shells of their former selves, depressed and longing for the death that the (questionable) care they are receiving is preventing. Visionary projects from the 1970s- with more pets in care homes, with pairs of birds in every room for residents to have a vested interest in looking after, with children of staff visiting, filling the emptiness with the joy of activity, of noise- show that it is possible for care homes to be places of life rather than death. But it takes more effort to achieve this, more resources. More determination to give the elderly a life worth enjoying. And so, of course, such ideas largely fall by the wayside, because in a capitalist world the elderly are a drain on life, on resources... which is frankly sickening.I cannot stress enough how important this book is. It was, at times, a painful read for me, and that will be the case for anyone who has lost someone in a medicalised nightmare of end-time. But you owe it to yourself to understand what best befits you when your time comes. You owe it to yourself to choose your own ending. This book arms you with the knowledge to make the right decision, however painful that is.As for my mother.. after 3 touch and go trips to the hospital in the last year of her life I spoke to my sisters and told them it all came down to what we felt Mom would prefer- to die at home or have more and more (hopeless) treatment at hospital, where it was inevitable that one day she would happen to die. We agreed that just as my father had passed away at home, surrounded by people who loved him, our mother deserved the same. It was the best decision we made. She passed on in her home of 40 years held by those she loved and surrounded by their voices. She died in peace."
124,0805095152,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6468566-jennifer,2,"2.5 stars. Gawande has about three major points in this book, all of which were made in a news magazine article he wrote for the Atlantic: 1, We should have tough conversations with those in our lives about their vision for their end-of-life; 2, Doctors should also have these conversations with their patients; and 3, If we have these conversations, we can shift medicine and end-of-life care away from a stave-off-death model and towards a model that promotes humanity, autonomy, and dignity for the dying (and thus no longer need institutional nursing homes). I do not disagree, but the book itself is heavy on anecdotes and light on actual research or policy analysis.My major stylistic critique is that Gawande buries his three points in pages of anecdotes about patients and memories of his own father's decline and death. I'm not being unsympathetic to the suffering of these colorful characters (and Gawande's own personal suffering), but I found the anecdotes long-winded, distracting, and ultimately boring. Gawande intended them to have emotional impact for the reader, but for me, the stories smacked of filling pages for the pure commercial gain of selling a book. My major substantive critique is that Gawande spends too little time on policy, instead championing the heroism of individual doctors, caregivers, and entrepreneurs-- as if the system can be saved by some brave individuals. He is far too sanguine about the difficulty of changing institutions at the macro-level. Yes, Gawande mentions that these alternative living arrangements and alternative therapeutic approaches save money in the long run, but most of the initiatives Gawande covers were developed by private entrepreneurs, not governments (though some government funds may have been made available in the form of grants). Dramatic policy change would be needed to scale and fund these initiatives at the state or federal level, and I do not see the current vested interests in the healthcare lobby supporting these changes (nor does Gawande provide a path for fighting for policy change, besides mentioning the cost-effectiveness argument). The one scale-able initiative that Gawande discusses, Hospice, already exists-- but Gawande ignores that Hospice's ranks are often filled with low-skilled, under-paid, and over-worked caregivers who are hardly in the position to give the attentive, individualized care that Gawande received for his father. Gawande is also too sanguine about the role of socioeconomic class, which is perhaps why his friends and his patients receive such excellent care. He is wrapped in a bubble of privilege -- access to the top surgeons and the most committed nurses. True, some of the alternative homes that Gawande mentions do take Medicaid, but these homes are so few that they have waitlists that are hundreds of names long. The type of ""better death"" that Gawande argues for so eloquently is available only to the wealthiest or the most educated (those empowered to fight the system and search for better options). Without a serious treatment of the nexus between healthcare policy, quality of life, and socioeconomic status, this book seems to me squarely in the realm of theory, not practice. "
125,0805095152,http://goodreads.com/user/show/929238-hbalikov,5,"This is an excellent book. It is also the most important book that I have read in the past year.Dr. Gawande is that rare physician who can write well and write well for the layman. There is nothing glamorous about growing old. There is nothing glamorous in taking care of those who are growing old. As to the former, Gawande, makes it clear as he describes the way our bodies decline and breakdown over time. As to the later, it helps to explain both why very few doctors are attracted to gerontology and why those who aren't are not particularly adept at dealing with those who are at or near the end of their lives. This book is about ""what matters in the end,"" but it is also about Gawande's journey as a physician and surgeon. ""I never expected that among the most meaningful experiences I'd have as a doctor --- and, really, as a human being --- would come from helping others deal with what medicine cannot do as well as what it can.""Atul Gawande is meticulous in describing how we wear down and wear out. ""There is, he told me, 'no single, common cellular mechanism to the aging process.'....The process is gradual and unrelenting."" And, how many of us believe that we can put that aside for the present. ""People naturally prefer to avoid the subject of their decrepitude."" Yet, it colors many things that we do and many decisions that we have to make. In his own learning process, Gawande shares his experiences, and his encounters with doctors, other care givers and physicians. ""The job of any doctor, Bludau later told me, is to support quality of life, by which he meant two things: as much freedom from the ravages of disease as possible and the retention of enough function for active engagement in the world. Most doctors treat disease and figure that the rest will take care of itself.""He exposes a lot of the ""nursing home approach"" as insensitive with facilities that may come to resemble an asylum (in the worst sense). He explores the question, ""what makes life worth living when we are old and frail and unable to care for ourselves,"" is its many facets. There are: basic needs for survival; need for love and belonging; desire for growth (""the opportunity to attain personal goals, to master knowledge and skills, and to recognized and rewarded for our achievements); and, perhaps, ""self-fulfillment through pursuit or moral ideals and creativity for their own sake."" He points out that ""our driving motivations in life, instead of remaining constant, change hugely over time...""I learned a lot about how we often treat those who cannot care entirely for themselves and how attitudes and venues are changing. When doctors are just about ""tinkering"" with the seriously ill, a lot is ignored. Particularly, that those people ""have priorities (perhaps poorly expressed or not discussed) besides prolonging their lives. Surveys find that their top concerns include avoiding suffering, strengthening relationships with family and friends, being mentally alert, not being a burden to others, and achieving a sense that their life is complete.""I wish I had had this book to read before I found myself with friends and family members who were seriously ill or dying. Gawande describes how both amateur and professional caregivers can be sensitive to these issues. And, how they can give the ill and dying the opportunity to reflect on their own desires. One of those, for many, is that they would rather spend their remaining days at home instead of in an institution. There is a very illuminating section on hospice and how this should be explored far earlier than it currently is. Not necessarily invoking hospice care earlier, but being aware of what if can offer and, if desired, getting it going in time to make a difference with quality of life.""(Though), no one ever really has control. Physics and biology and accident ultimately have their way in our lives. But the point is that we are not helpless either. Courage is the strength to recognize BOTH realities. We have room to act, to shape our stories, though as time goes on it is within narrower and narrower confines. A few conclusions become clear when we understand this: that our most cruel failure in how we treat the sick and the aged is the failure to recognize that they have priorities beyond merely being safe and living longer; that the chance to shape one's story is essential to sustaining meaning in life; that we have the opportunity to refashion our institutions, our culture, and our conversations in ways that transform the possibilities for the last chapters of everyone's lives."""
126,0805095152,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1067741-susan,5,"If you have aging/elderly parents whose care you might someday be involved in, or expect to care for someone with a terminal condition, you cannot afford to miss this book. In his effortlessly lucid prose, Gawande comes to terms with the medical establishment's failure in providing end-of-life care. Too often, doctors work to fix what's broken in the service of extending life, without considering how quality of life is compromised, inflicting even more suffering as a result. He extols the value of hospice and palliative care, whose aim is not to give up on patients, but to provide as many good days as possible in the inevitable slide to death. He advocates asking difficult questions with patients and loved ones to determine what can bring meaning and value to them, even in the harsh narrowing of life's possibilities brought on by failing bodies and minds. He does not exempt himself from this critique -- instead he offers personal stories, iike those of his father and his daughter's piano teacher, to show how he came to understand the necessity of these important discussions and the possibilities they offer. It's moving, and timely, and despite the less-than-cheerful subject matter, never a burden to read (a testament to his writerly skill). I can't recommend this book highly enough to anyone who will face these issues -- and we all most likely will, in some form."
127,0805095152,http://goodreads.com/user/show/47188780-kathleen,5,"•	This is an important book for all who have elderly parents that are struggling with end-of-life health issues. Dr. Gawande personalizes the key issues through individual case histories, but he backs up his arguments with solid statistics. First, our society does not have enough gerontologists to serve our aging population, and our medical schools are cutting back on training new ones. More importantly, medical doctors tend to want to solve medical problems. And often, that results in them not recognizing, or even asking, what is important to their patient’s quality of life. The elderly want to live in ‘a home’, not an institution. They want to feel in control of their lives as much as possible. Safety is less of a concern to them than independence. Privacy is important too. They tend to want their own space, with furniture from their own home. They want to be able to turn on the television when and at what volume they want. These needs are not compatible with institutional long-term care facilities. So, new options are being explored—particularly in the United States. Highly recommend."

 This right here is the theme of Atul Gawande's Being Mortal: Medicine and What Matters in the End. This incredible piece of medical/science nonfiction starts out by introducing historical and cultural norms for caring for our elders and how this has significantly shifted in many societies. Mr. Gawande does not pass judgement but presents the observations and facts so we the reader may have an objective view which starts a journey of perspective. And when we view the world from another perspective, self-examination takes place, thus change. I absolutely loved this book. Many books I have been reading lately have been all about timing it seems. Last year, I watched both my grandfathers die (within 3 days of each other) and this year I am really beginning to take note of my parents and in-law's escalating aging. I guess chronic diseases, strokes, and fickle organs will do that to you. Like many self-centered Americans, I have been looking at the process in terms of what it means for me. How will my life change as they become more and more dependent on me? This book. This book! My perspective and priorities are forever altered. It is about me, after all I am living my life, but it is also about them. They want to be the author of their own life just as much as I do and if I'm lucky, they will live long enough to require assistance with that. They didn't ask for these complications and they fear the loss of independence far more than I could ever begin to imagine. The true terror: that no one will care.Mr. Gawande stresses that end of life conversations are crucial and surprisingly liberating, not only as a son or daughter but as a medical provider. There is a sense of control even in the midst of very uncontrollable circumstances. Questions need to be asked and once answers are decided upon, fear and anxiety of all parties involved can relax a bit. Your wishes will be respected in terms of what a quality life means to you. In a world of nursing homes that might as well be classified as prisons, knowing that someone listens and cares about what you want (despite the options and risks) is priceless. Mr. Gawande draws from his personal experience with his father in this respect and I found these parts to be incredibly raw and emotional. I strongly recommend this book. But if you don't read it, please remember these questions for your loved ones: 

“Whenever serious sickness or injury strikes and your body or mind breaks down, the vital questions are the same: What is your understanding of the situation and its potential outcomes? What are your fears and what are your hopes? What are the trade-offs you are willing to make and not willing to make? And what is the course of action that best serves this understanding?”

 Ask questions, advocate as needed, and enjoy this short life with the people you love ♥My favorite quote:""This is what it means to have autonomy -- you may not control life's circumstances, but getting to be the author of your life means getting to control what you do with them.”"
129,0805095152,http://goodreads.com/user/show/83445-lisa-vegan,5,"This book is excellent. It’s accessible and always interesting. It’s one of those books that probably everybody should read. I’m thinking every physician should read it upon graduating from medical school or during their residency. I think that it’s an important book.I do disagree with him at times, though overall think what he says is spot on.The parts where I disagree are in two major areas: The main one is his reluctance about supporting widespread assisted suicide because he says in those places, palliative hospice care isn’t as advanced an offering. However, even with hospice, I’ve witnessed horrible suffering, unbearable suffering, and it seems rare that people have none of that in their last days and weeks. I think both assisted suicide and competent hospice should always be options. I think not all hospices care works very well at all, though I know that some does. The other place I disagree is his contention that genetics isn’t as crucial to longevity as I think it is, especially in those families where so many live to over 100 and, I know by knowing them, that they often do not take at all good care of themselves, living in a way where others without their genes would die at much younger ages and with more infirmities before their deaths. The gist of what he says about quality of life when aged or with a terminal illness I agree with wholeheartedly though. A lot of what he says about that and examples he gives, makes the book fun to read. I really appreciated the several very personal stories, including his father’s story. So, not only do I not want to live until end stage cancer or ALS, etc. which I’ve always known, but I have no desire to get so old or sick that I can’t take care of myself – with my situation I wouldn’t end up at one of the good places and even those wouldn’t be great for me. These are issues I’ve thought about since about age 12, and I will do anything I can to avoid physical pain, nausea, shortness of breath, and other forms of suffering. Great book for getting readers to think about what they want when they’re elderly or have a life threatening illness, and also for having conversations about their wishes, and encouraging others in their lives to also share their wishes.The best thing about the book, and I wish 100% of medical people would get on board, is the weighing of what is worth it and not worth it to patients, and facing what medicine can’t do as well as what it can do. Not lying! Not evading! Not giving false hope! Allowing patients to take the lead with their own lives! Advocating that conversations should be had with the ill/elderly and doctors shouldn’t assume they know what should be done without knowing the patients’ goals and wishes for themselves. Early in the book, a death mentioned sounded exactly like my mother in 1964-1965 – I have to read that book! Books leading to other books…I'm still laughing about the 100 loose birds!!!"
130,0805095152,http://goodreads.com/user/show/632247-chrissie,3,"Before reading: I am reading this not because I want to but because I feel I ought to. Is it going to make me feel all horrible? I can accept this if it constructively explains what you can do to ""improve"" the end of life. In conclusion: I am glad I read the book, but it wasn’t particularly fun. There are many examples given of particular people, their illnesses and the difficulties they had, one being the author’s father. I didn’t understand all the medical terms used. Examples are given to illustrate the author’s conclusions on how medical care of the aging should be altered. The author, who is himself a surgeon, shows new, better alternatives and how they came to be. He does this by naming pioneers of better nursing homes, assisted care units and hospice development. For a person in the medical field I think this book is essential because it shows how medical changes need to be and can be implemented…., but I am not employed in the medical field and the historical developments, although interesting, were a bit extraneous for me. From my point of view, these sections could have been shortened, even if they do show the direction the author is supporting. One can ask, “Who is this book for?”In my family we have had several deaths in the past years. So the weaknesses coupled to end of life medical care, nursing homes and hospices were not new to me. I didn’t have to be told; I was not surprised in the least. What I wanted from this book were guidelines showing me how I could improve my husband’s and my own end of life. Did the book do this? Well, it made me face my own situation and what lay ahead. As a result of reading this book I will be looking into what alternatives are available here in Sweden when we are no longer able to manage alone. My husband and I have discussed exactly how we see the future. It has made clear to us that we value independence and that we want to stay where we are as long as possible – even if such living may be less safe than living near a hospital. We plan on looking in to Assisted Care Facilities that offer a gradual increase of care as needs increase. Do they have queues? Are they expensive? Where are they located? The essential point is that you have to know what you are looking for and that will be different for each family. So, yes, I am glad I read the book. It made me evaluate what is important to me – nature and independence and a dog and pretty landscape. The book pushed me to do this.  Another issue the book pushes you to evaluate is how long you want to extend the years of your life even if that time is filled with pain and discomfort. This too is a personal decision. The book guides you in what sort of questions you should ask your doctor, but of course some questions are specific to the illness one is coping with. Some conclusions are drawn that may be true for many, but not for my husband and I. Generally, most seem to want more contact with family as they age. This has its difficult sides too, and the book mentions this only briefly. I think more attention could have been devoted to this topic. While funeral wishes are important to discuss at life’s end, I found it unnecessary that the author discussed the details of his father’s funeral in this book.Practically nothing is said about how the elderly no longer want to travel. I may add that if you want to travel do it when you are young and fit. I am thankful to have traveled earlier in my life. The book is primarily concerned with American facilities, and practically nothing is said about costs. The audiobook is narrated by Robert Petkoff. It is read at a good speed. When good nursing facilities were being discussed he tended to sound SO enthused, SO exuberant. Really, I found this a bit childish. It doesn’t distort the text, but exaggerates how wonderful it all is. I could have done without this. The book has made me more appreciative of what I have. It has pushed my husband and me to evaluate which qualities of life we deem most important. With a clearer understanding of our preferences we can more easily deal with what lies ahead."
131,0805095152,http://goodreads.com/user/show/730754-ken,4,"Anyone who is planning on dying some day should read this book. It can be jumpy at times, but overall, Gawande's a straight shooting, no-nonsense writer who gives the straight dope on nursing homes, assisted living, hospice, and the heart-rending decisions we are all forced into at our end-of-days. As many of his accounts deal with cancer cases, it's a bit of a downer, but it's medicine to be taken and there's no better way to illustrate his point than through real-life examples, including his own father, who developed a fatal tumor in his spinal cord. God save us all from ends like this, but sorry, we all don't get to die suddenly and peacefully in our sleep.Among topics Gawande tackles: the dearth of geriatricians in this country. So ironic. So American. But the money is not there for doctors dedicated to our fastest growing demographic. Oh. And the preventative-style approach, the in-the-moment treatments needed to keep the elderly happy? Often not paid for by insurance companies, either.He also gets into nursing home/assisted living situations, focusing on the story of an upstate NY facility where a maverick doctor/director decided to introduce parakeets and live plants in every room as well as two cats and two dogs who had the run of the place. The nurses were thrown by this -- one refused to pick up a doggy mistake on the floor because that wasn't what she got a nursing license for -- but eventually everyone saw the seismic shift this simple yet dramatic change had on the previously-listless residents. The ""inmates"" (what they felt like, previously) started to perk up, tell people about the personalities of their parakeets, take a hand in caring for both plants and birds. Meanwhile, they became entranced with the wandering dogs and cats. Those patients who were ambulatory surprised the nurses by stepping up and volunteering to walk the dogs. The director had kids visit, too, providing training to middle schoolers on how to talk even with people with Alzheimer's. The young people's two or three visits a week became events to look forward to for the elderly residents, who, between pets and children, suddenly discovered purpose and felt more like human beings, more like they used to when they were living alone.There are other variations here, too, like assisted living purposely designed in pods of smaller units, created to look more like homes and less like institutions. Chief among the changes? Allowing people some privacy -- their own rooms. Giving them more leeway on what to do, when to eat. The schedules work around the people vs. vice versa.But the bulk of the book focuses on decisions and consequences. There are no definitive moves to make once a fatal disease begins its course, but Gawande shows that it's spinning a bit out of control in too many cases. The money being spent to prolong lives, often to make those lives so much more miserable just because people refuse to accept the oldest fact of life -- death -- is truly a scary thing. Modern medicine may be many things, but it is no match for Death, who remains undefeated. Still, there is a measure of victory to be had. For many people, that may mean a shorter but higher quality amount of time with family and friends. And, paradoxically, Gawande points to studies showing that many people who choose hospice care actually live longer than those who take the harsh and risky treatment road. They have less pain. They are happier. Together, these effects lead to slightly longer days with those they love. So, if you think hospice is a white flag, think again. It's not as simple as all that. Nor is this book. It's food for thought. Not that it will get any easier for you, the reader, when such choices visit you or your loved ones (and they will), but at least you'll have a better sense of balance and perspective. Can we ask for any more than that?"
132,0805095152,http://goodreads.com/user/show/275498-jim,5,"This is a brilliantly written book, and I was super-impressed with the genius of the good Dr Gawande right up to the point where he drank water out of the Ganges...I wouldn't do that at gunpoint! But while I might question the doc's wisdom in choice of beverages, I have to say he wrote a darn fine book.All of the occupants of this globe have a single thing in common...we will all die. Hopefully, we enjoy a long life and peaceful old age before our expiry date and, thanks to modern medicine and the care of good physicians, this is getting to be the reality for more people. This presents us with another problem: caring for a growing population of oldsters who require care as they ease their way into the hereafter. Families are getting smaller, so the progeny that would have cared for ailing seniors in the past are absent, or already employed. Expensive medical treatments are being employed to attempt to extend the lives of oldsters who would have slipped away without treatment, but at what cost? Frequently the result of this practice is that the medical treatment gives the patient an agonized existence suffering from side effects.Dr Gawande believes that, in most cases, if given a choice between having some quality time with loved ones or a possibly longer painful and befuddled existence under medical care, most people will choose the quality time even though it may be shorter. And here's another point to consider: Gawande has determined that 63% of doctors overestimate the amount of time a patient has to live, and that the better the doctor knows the patient, the more likely he/she will be to overestimate the patient's remaining time.Of interest to me was the fact that he basically confirmed an old homily my Granny used to toss out from time to time: ""A son is a son 'til he gets him a wife, but a daughter's a daughter for all of her life"". Here's what Dr Gawande had to say about the matter (from P. 79):  ""your chances of avoiding the nursing home are directly related to the number of children you have, and, according to what little research has been done, having at least one daughter seems to be crucial to the amount of help you will receive.""Naturally, one cannot always expect that sons and daughters will be able to care for them. Dr Gawande is firmly on the side of those who consult a palliative care specialist (From P.177):  ""The result; those who saw a palliative care specialist stopped chemotherapy sooner, entered hospice far earlier, experienced less suffering at the end of their lives - and they lived 25 percent longer. In other words, our decision making in medicine has failed so spectacularly that we have reached the point of actually inflicting harm on patients rather than confronting the subject of mortality.""This could have been a boring book...it wasn't. Dr Gawande has the gift of imparting information without making you feel like you are being tutored. A very interesting read, particularly for those of us who are around the last curve and racing toward the finish line."

134,0805095152,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5550397-britany,4,"Atul Gawande illustrates life as you age and how families must cope with aging parents.I appreciated learning about a topic that I knew little about previously. The difficulty of what to do with the aging population is an interesting and highly debatable (if not slightly depressing) topic. Gawande shares real life client stories, including his own family. This made this book relatable, who hasn't watched an elder age and eventually pass away. The best story was the one with the home that brought in dogs, cats, birds and plants. I just loved reading about the after effects of bringing life and small responsibilities in for the elderly residents. Innovating for this demographic brought hope to this challenging time in our history and while the topic is dark, this perspective shone a tiny light of hope for the future.Would highly recommend."
135,0805095152,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6041973-josh,4,"As I sit here at work, basically doing nothing but typing this review and speaking to my fiancé on Microsoft Lync, I am drinking a cup of coffee and wondering about my mortality.  Yes, I admit, I usually think of it more than once a day, sometimes twice a day, but never 4.5 times a day because that’s actually impossible.When reading Gawande’s ‘Being Mortal’, I found myself not questioning my own life, but many others; he exposed a sense of compassion in this misanthropic heart and how the geriatric community are treated in their final days.  His views on how doctors tend to be either vague or as he puts it, ‘Mr. Informative’, (saying too much about the disease and focusing more on it than the actual patient and their well-being) is a unique perspective from a doctor that actually cares for his patients.  Now, I’m not saying that doctors, as a whole do not, but the way it seems (from my knowledgeable perspective), they go in and out of doors seeing people like paying consumers instead of human beings and making it more of a business than actually trying to treat a person, much less about their well-being.The majority of the book takes us through first-hand accounts from the author; a multitude of case studies, that state interesting statistics about subjects such as: how people in their 50’s-90’s are leaning more towards living independently; how people with a terminal illness find themselves to want to die, rather than live out their days because of the guilt on how embarrassing and burdensome they may be to loved ones; how palliative care has helped many people in having a better life at home rather than being stuck with needles and prolonging their inevitable death in a place they hate to be (somewhat contradictory, yet for good reason, many that go through palliative care or hospice tend to live slightly longer than if they were laid up inside a hospital due to the quality of care towards the patient and not the disease); and how it takes courage to let go when no other option is available.His insight on these subjects is based on a close, personal relationship.  He saw how his own father dealt with terminal cancer for many years, but also used the methods of care listed above and it ended up being the right call; his father lived a lot longer than if he would’ve had extremely intrusive surgery and only had mild suffering, but always in a conscious state knowing what was being done to him, enjoying things before his final breath.Overall, I found much of the information helpful on drawing my own opinions on the matter and opened my eyes to other aspects.Many may find this book depressing because it deals with a subject that we cannot control ultimately, but with understanding and acceptance, we can manage the best we can."
136,0805095152,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7392004-quo,5,"I suspect that what makes some teachers revered is not just a mastery of the subject they mean to impart but that they also have retained an elemental sense of being a learner as well. One of the facets that impressed me most about Atul Gawande's Being Mortal: Medicine & What Matters in the End is that the author conveys the importance of the essential dialogue between doctor & patient by asking himself how he would like to be treated if he were the patient and not the medical specialist. To suggest that this is an important book is almost to diminish it, for Dr. Gawande involves the reader not just in reviewing a series of case studies & other background detail on how each of us attempts to deal with our own mortality but also causes something very personal to take place, the rare sensation of being spoken to directly in a meaningful, compassionate manner. For, as people become aware of the finitude of their life, they do not ask for much. They do not seek riches, they do not seek more power. They ask only to be permitted, insofar as possible, to keep shaping the story of their life in the world--to make choices & to sustain connections to others according to their own priorities.I found Being Mortal a treasure in many gradually unfolding ways. For example, little gerontological training occurs as a component part of medical school, so much so that many doctors feel they are often unable to offer treatment as much as the lure of hope. Dr. Gawande comments thatThere is almost always a long trail of possibility, however slim. However, we have built a multi-trillion dollar edifice for dispensing the medical equivalent of lottery tickets, while having only a rudimentary system to prepare patients for the near certainty that those tickets will not win. Hope is not a plan.Thus, 63% of M.D.'s overestimate survival time, not wanting to trample a patient's hopes, while only 17% underestimate survival time. Interestingly, if a doctor knows a patient well, he or she is more likely to be overly optimistic, ""even to the point of engaging in fantasy about experimental drugs to cure a patient or to extend life in an unrealistic way."" There are many humorous anecdotes which serve to relieve, at least in part, the difficult task of considering one's own mortality in this book, one being Philip Roth's comment that ""Old age is not a battle, it's a massacre."" And the late Harvard scientist & gifted writer, Prof. Steven Jay Gould, wistfully observed that ""the medium isn't always the message"", preferring the more realistic view of death as the ultimate enemy and finding nothing reproachable about those who ""rage against the dying of the light"", borrowing words from Dylan Thomas. Gould lived an additional 20 years after his original diagnosis. Another funny inclusion occurs when General Custer is compared with General Robert E. Lee, with the latter knowing when the battle could not be won.Included among the meaningful case studies is the story of Karen Brown Wilson on the west coast who develops a model for extended care or assisted living as an alternative to conventional nursing homes, though her new paradigm is quickly absorbed into a corporate structure & radically changed. Also, Dr. Bill Thomas in upstate New York, a restless Harvard Med School grad decides to attempt a new model for nursing homes, concluding that ""what was missing was life itself."" He introduces pets aplenty, including dogs, cats, birds and also inserts plants in each room to help confront the 3 plagues of nursing home existence: boredom, loneliness & helplessness. And, in so doing, he alters the relationship of patient to nursing home. Lastly, Dr. Atul Gawande's own father, also a surgeon & born in India, deals with his own mortality and when afflicted with cancer, he attempts to reinvent his life in a meaningful way during his remaining days by performing community service as a Rotarian and extending his ministry to a school he founded in his native India. Ultimately, Atul Gawande concludes that our ultimate goal should not be a good death but a good life till the very end and that assisted living is far more difficult than assisted death. In spite of the notion that every life ends in an execution, so to speak, there are countless uplifting vignettes of people dealing with their own mortality in a positive manner & with great courage in Dr. Gawande's wonderful book, Being Mortal and also in a one hour television episode of ""Frontline"", available via the Internet."

“Death is the enemy. But the enemy has superior forces. Eventually, it wins. And in a war that you cannot win, you don’t want a general who fights to the point of total annihilation. You don’t want Custer. You want Robert E. Lee, someone who knows how to fight for territory that can be won and how to surrender it when it can’t, someone who understands that the damage is greatest if all you do is battle to the bitter end.”

 “We’ve been wrong about what our job is in medicine. We think our job is to ensure health and survival. But really it is larger than that. It is to enable well-being.” 
This is not an easy simple-read. It is a brain-storming perspective-changing book.In all our modern medical learning and practice we aim at making life last ""longer"", but we should make it feel ""better""We try to elongate the lives of the elder, or the ""life"" of their bodies/corpses. Using unjustified mechanical ventilation, Inotropic support, unjustified high-risk operations and the result is an end-of-life ""lived"" in hospitals.
 “A few conclusions become clear when we understand this: that our most cruel failure in how we treat the sick and the aged is the failure to recognize that they have priorities beyond merely being safe and living longer; that the chance to shape one’s story is essential to sustaining meaning in life; that we have the opportunity to refashion our institutions, our culture, and our conversations in ways that transform the possibilities for the last chapters of everyone’s lives.” 

 “I learned about a lot of things in medical school, but mortality wasn’t one of them. Although I was given a dry, leathery corpse to dissect in my first term, that was solely a way to learn about human anatomy. Our textbooks had almost nothing on aging or frailty or dying. How the process unfolds, how people experience the end of their lives, and how it affects those around them seemed beside the point. The way we saw it, and the way our professors saw it, the purpose of medical schooling was to teach how to save lives, not how to tend to their demise.” 
This book is about how can we make life worth-living when we are too frail, too fragile, vulnerable and dependent.Our societies confronts these circumstances by avoiding talking about them, we all deny death, deny talking about it until it is too late.We designed nurseries to control the elder, their safety and their privacy and to make their lives impervious to change . . And the result is a life supposed to be safe, but empty of everything they care about.
 “It is not death that the very old tell me they fear. It is what happens short of death—losing their hearing, their memory, their best friends, their way of life. As Felix put it to me, “Old age is a continuous series of losses.” Philip Roth put it more bitterly in his novel Everyman: “Old age is not a battle. Old age is a massacre.” 
in this book you learn how to listen to them, to acknowledge their fears and how to feel their hopes. You will learn that death is inevitable, that you should respect death, you should respect aging, you should talk about it, and above all you should truly ""live"" to the very end of your life.
 “The problem with medicine and the institutions it has spawned for the care of the sick and the old is not that they have had an incorrect view of what makes life significant. The problem is that they have had almost no view at all. Medicine’s focus is narrow. Medical professionals concentrate on repair of health, not sustenance of the soul. Yet—and this is the painful paradox—we have decided that they should be the ones who largely define how we live in our waning days.” 

 “Sometimes we can offer a cure, sometimes only a salve, sometimes not even that. But whatever we can offer, our interventions, and the risks and sacrifices they entail, are justified only if they serve the larger aims of a person’s life. When we forget that, the suffering we inflict can be barbaric. When we remember it the good we do can be breathtaking.” 

 “Our ultimate goal, after all, is not a good death but a good life to the very end.” 

 “Death, of course, is not a failure. Death is normal. Death may be the enemy, but it is also the natural order of things.”

Should we want them to? At what cost – not to society or to our wallets, but at what cost to our humanity and dignity? Atul Gawunde, a surgeon in Boston Massachusetts, explores the ways in which medicine (and specifically American medicine and American society) helps and hinders the aged, the infirm, and the dying. If you know anyone who will someday die … stop reading this review and read this book.As he did in his previous books, Gawunde gives clear information and asks probing questions. He does not necessarily try to give us THE answer, but he does propose some alternatives, ultimately leaving the final answer up to each and every one of us. Having helped both my parents face their mortal ends, I can tell you that my family members and I – brothers, sister-in-law, and husband – have had many discussions about these issues over the past several years. Some of the physicians we encountered were open to such frank discussion, but not all were. There are difficult issues, heart-wrenching dilemmas, and anxiety-producing situations. But they do not get less difficult, less anxiety-producing, or less heart-wrenching when we ignore them. Oliver Sacks wrote the following blurb: “We have come to medicalize aging, frailty, and death, treating them as if they were just one more clinical problem to overcome. However it is not only medicine that is needed in one’s declining years but life – a life with meaning, a life as rich and full as possible under the circumstances. Being Mortal is not only wise and deeply moving, it is an essential and insightful book for our times…” WHY are you still reading this review? Read the book … NOW! Think carefully about what you want, and then talk about it – to your family, your friends, your doctors. Encourage them to read the book, too. Robert Petkoff does a superb job reading the audio book. There is a bonus interview with the author at the end of the audio version. "
139,0805095152,http://goodreads.com/user/show/24882791-india-m-clamp,4,"“Is empathy and kindness standard in geriatric medicine?” Why did Dr. Gawande find it disconcerting how old/frail patients are being treated? Why are parents cared for---as if they were made of gold---better in India?Truly an arduous journey on a path laden with geriatric patients and a transformation from independence to its’ opposite. This imposing trudge into considerations, care and realities of mortality and “how hope is an elixir.” Most elegantly summarized. Gawande writes: “Being Mortal is about the struggle to cope with the strength of our biology. We think our job is to insure health and survival but it is to enable well-being.” This communicates the goal for all engaging in the practice of medicine. This book is not for shy, sensitive or frail as it's an honest and blatantly truthful aperçu of what is/was observed by Dr. Gawande in geriatric medicine today. Educational and somber. Must read for all physicians. Buy and keep Kleenex on stand-by."
140,0805095152,http://goodreads.com/user/show/10312986-lyn-elliott,5,"We all want to live independent lives but as we age we are likely to lose at least some elements of that independence. This is easy to acknowledge, not so easy to come to terms with and certainly not easy to prepare for.Gawande's book is essential reading for anyone who is ageing themselves, or for anyone caring for somebody who is ill or frail enough to be approaching a state of dependency. Reading this has helped me to be aware of the questions I need to ask myself and those I care about. You can't ever assume you know what someone else really wants to do with their lives as they become dependent, or as they near death.How can you live well till the end, avoiding medically institutionalised interactions, treatments and living space? I wish I had read this before my parents became frail and certainly well before their last illnesses. This was an unusual book club choice, but then it's a great group of women. Not a wimp amongst us. "
141,0805095152,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2375838-cheryl,5,"There is a long phase in the first parts of our lives where, if we are lucky enough to have avoided critical disease or injury, we are blithely unaware of the effects of aging and of the inevitability of death. It seems so far ahead in the future as to be imaginary. Like imagining what a trillion dollars is like. You know that is a real thing, but still…it seems impossible to know what it really is. The other day I said to my teenage daughter, “Just imagine, in only forty years from now you will be standing in the kitchen with your partner and asking the same questions I’m asking now, like “When can we retire and go do what we really want?” “ She snorted. “Forty years? That’s ages from now!” And I’m saying, “no, forty years isn’t long at all! You will be planning your retirement!”She doesn’t really believe it.I sort of wish I had that back again. Those days of childhood, adolescence, young adulthood, where we never gave a thought to retirement, to aging, to death. Later on in life, we end up sometimes dwelling too much on those things, as if to make up for our inattention earlier. Nowadays, I sometimes feel hyper-aware of the universality of disease, the effects of aging, and shuffling off the mortal coil. It is unavoidable - I stare at it through the microscope daily as a pathologist. I often wonder which of those diseases that we hand out like playing cards will be the one dealt to me. “There’s no escaping the tragedy of life., which is that we are all aging from the day we are born… This experiment of making mortality a medical experience is just decades old. And the evidence is it is failing.”“Our reluctance to honestly examine the experience of aging and dying has increased the harm we inflict on people and denied them the basic comforts they most need.”The chapters of the book follow the course of our lives, and are richly illustrated with examples from Gawande’s own family and from his medical practice. Their stories are woven through the book, providing compelling and touching portraits. They are us. We are independent beings who are increasingly living longer and living independently longer.But ‘Things Fall Apart.’ “The culprit is just the accumulated crumbling of one’s bodily systems while medicine carries out its maintenance measures and patch jobs""“Human beings fail the way all complex systems fail: randomly and gradually…as the defects in a complex system increase, the time comes when just one more defect is enough to impair the whole, resulting in the condition known as frailty. It happens to power plants, cars, and large organizations. And it happens to us: eventually, one too many joints are damaged, one too many arteries calcify. There are no more backups. We wear down until we can’t wear down anymore.”So gradually, as the losses accumulate, we become Dependent. We need increasing amounts of Assistance, often in the form of retirement or nursing homes. These tend to provide an institutionalized life — that is not a good life, it’s just as good as can be got in the circumstances. But that robs us of our autonomy and our ability to make choices and to shape the story of our life in the world. “Whatever the limits and travails we face, we want to retain the autonomy—the freedom—to be the authors of our lives. This is the very marrow of being human” New models of care are evolving though, so people like 94 year old Lou are “…still able to live in a way that made him feel that he still had a place in this world.” I found this chapter particularly encouraging. The chapters on Letting Go and Hard Conversations are thoughtful, valuable discussions not only for clinical physicians, nurses and other members of the health care team, but also for anyone — patient, family, friend — who has reached that place where the end of life is in sight. “Technological society has forgotten what scholars call the “dying role” and its importance to people as life approaches its end. People want to share memories, pass on wisdoms and keepsakes, settle relationships, establish their legacies, make peace with God, and ensure that those who are left behind will be okay. They want to end their stories on their own terms.”Finally, Courage. “At least two kinds of courage are required in aging and sickness. The first is the courage to confront the reality of mortality—the courage to seek out the truth of what is to be feared and what is to be hoped.” We need the courage to act on the truth we find. One has to decide whether one’s fears or one’s hopes are what should matter most.This was a profoundly enriching book. It should be required reading for all health care professionals who work with seriously ill patients, and for those who work with the aged, and for those who run our health care systems, and for those who have aging/ill parents/relatives, and for those who are embarking on those final passages, and in some ways especially for those who haven’t yet reached those phases, so that they will be better prepared. It is intelligent, rational, touching, and warmly profound. It is a classic. "
142,0805095152,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4146473-connie,5," I read this a while ago, and it is a book that comes up quite often in conversation, and one that I highly recommend. For medical students, Dr's, nurses, anyone who works in medicine, anyone with aging parents and quite frankly anyone who is aging. Pretty much everyone I know. When talking about it I realized that though I remember it well and recommend it I had never written a review. So here you go. One of the first chapters tells the story of the author when he was shadowing a family practitioner. An elderly woman came in with her main complaint of heart issues. She also commented on poor balance and the Dr noted weight loss. The young writer was confused when the Dr. asked her if she ate alone. More confusion when the physician commented on her pretty manicure, which the patient proudly said she did herself. When the doctor asked her to remove her shoes, the young student was even more perplexed. Came to be that the older physician realized she could not trim her toenails, and they were hurting in her shoes, causing her to change her gait...and at a risk for losing her balance and falling. Another concern was her weight loss, as she did not eat well due to eating alone. She was much frailer and he worried a fall may result in a broken hip or worse. He recommended a podiatrist and that her family try to eat several meals with her throughout the week. He told the young student that he could give medicine for the heart....but a fall with a break would cause much distress and change in her quality of life. This is the basis of this book. Physicians need to learn to look at the whole person, not just the complaint. So often we see a ""specialist"" whose focus is on what they specialize in, and they miss the other signs. Believe me, I have seen this happen. Yet I have also seen those who look at the big picture and those folks are the ones I would want to care for me. We are often so busy trying to live longer. Yet sometimes, or often it is the ""quality"" not the ""quantity"" of our lives that matter. This author delves into this issue with first hand knowledge of patients he has treated as well as his own family members. He admits how hard it is to step back and not always have to ""fix"" everything, but learn to listen to what is important to his patient. We can all learn this lesson. How do we picture the end of our lives? What do we really need to do to achieve that?  This is a book that makes you think about aging, aging in place and aging well. It makes you think about maintaining dignity. I know I thought of this often with family members who were facing the end of life, and I often had to stop and listen to what it was that was important to them, not to me. I only hope that someone allows me that same choice."
143,0805095152,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7958239-elizabeth-theiss,5,"When is it time to stop fighting disease and death, and work instead on the best quality of life possible? Gawande has given us a wise and thoughtful discussion of how to approach the question, one I found helpful and convincing.As always Gawande uses stories to demonstrate the problems attendant to the medicalization of death. Doctors are trained to treat death as the enemy, not death as the inevitable. In an effort to forestall the inevitable, doctors' use every available tool from invasive surgeries to brutal successive chemo therapies that leave patients, that is, people, lingering in pain. As in The Checklist Manifesto, Gawande's solution is simple, a short set of questions that doctors should ask patients nearing the end of their lives. The conversation centers around what is most important to the person; what immediate goals are central; and what trade-offs between length of life and quality of life a person is willing to make. Gawande's ideas about nursing homes as places to avoid are spot on as well. His description of these ""homes"" driven by staff's needs for cookie cutter treatment of residents From assembly line pill dispensing to early morning shower times are downright depressing. We just sprang my husband from a month in a nursing home and it was exactly as described. But alternatives do exist, some better than others. The key seems to be finding a place that allows individual autonomy and provides support for quality of life. The one element ignored here is the cost of this kind of support; it is out of the reach of most people who need it and not supported by Medicare, despite the fact that it is less expensive than a traditional nursing home. My father was fortunate to live out the last two years of his life in a truly wonderful care center with a home-like environment, a small number of house mates, and home cooked meals each night. Gawande made me think we should just tear down the old ones and start over.I have spent a good deal of time thinking about these questions and problems as I helped my father through Alzheimer's and my spouse through 23 years of Parkinson's disease. Gawande has it exactly right and I'm hoping Being Mortal is a best seller so doctors and everyone else benefits from his perspective on what a good life and a good death means."
144,0805095152,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1608124-dana-stabenow,5,"I give this book five stars not because I loved it but because it is what I would call a necessary read, and I mean necessary for everyone, young, old, medical professional and laity alike. It's about That Conversation, what Gawande calls in one chapter ""Hard Conversations."" The subject is how we want to live out the end of our life.Gawande is a surgeon and one of the best parts of this book is that he is learning how to have this conversation himself. He's learning how to do it as a medical professional with his patients, and he's not shy about telling us where and how he has screwed up. He is also learning how to do it as a son to his father, also a surgeon, who has been diagnosed with a rare spinal tumor.The difficulty, he writes, is that in the last fifty years we have learned how to prolong life.As recently as 1945, most deaths occurred in the home. By the 1980s, just 17 percent did...Across not just the United States but also the entire industrialized world, the experience of advanced aging and death has shifted to hospitals and nursing homes...You don't have to spend much time with the elderly or those with terminal illness to see how often medicine fails the people it is supposed to help...Our reluctance to honestly examine the experience of aging and dying has increased the harm we inflict on people and denied them the basic comforts they most need.Later he writes You'd think people would have rebelled. You'd think we would have burned the nursing homes to the ground.But we haven't, and new discoveries and better medical practice mean that citizens of industrialized nations are living longer, healthier lives. ""A life,"" Gawande writes, ""designed to be safe but empty of anything they care about."" The trick now is to make sure our aging populations are not just safe, or even--heresy! sacrilege!--not safe at all, but living a life that achieves quality of life, not just quantity. The good news is, things are changing. (He doesn't say so but you know it has everything to do with the Boomers, a generation now making decisions for their parents, and who will soon be making those decisions--or not--for themselves.) Keren Brown Wilson built the first assisted living facility in Oregon in 1980, and when that concept became bastardized people like Dr. Tom Wilson revolutionized an assisted living facility with two dogs, four cats, 100 parakeets and child care for employees that brought children back into the lives of the inmates (using that word deliberately, as Gawande does himself). Researchers studied the effects of this program over two years, comparing a variety of measures for Chase's residents with those of residents at another nursing home nearby. Their study found that the number of prescriptions required per resident fell to half that of the control nursing home. Psychotropic drugs for agitation, like Haldol, decreased in particular. The total drug costs fell to just 38 percent of the comparison facility. Deaths fell 15 percent.From inmates locked away from life, warehoused until they died, Dr. Wilson's patients became once again members of a community. And as Gawande goes on to say, this experiment and others like it are beginning all across the nation.There is also Hospice, which organization Gawande's father chooses to help him through the end of his life with palliative care. For Hospice, it's all about making the end of each individual story as valuable to them as is physically possible for them. It's impossible to say enough good things about Hospice and Gawande doesn't stint them here. (Full disclosure: I already support Hospice and this book is making me double that support this year.) I know it sounds a little macabre, but this is the one book you really should read. Make a teenager read it and they will understand that much more about what Grandma is going through. Make a Millennial read it and he'll understand in spades how important that retirement plan is and how they should start one now. Make your doctor read it and she'll see how important first asking those essential questions is, ""What do you want? What is most important to you?"" instead of automatically reaching for the scalpel or the drugs. ""Death,"" writes Gawandeis normal. Death may be the enemy, but it is also the natural order of things. I knew these truths abstractly, but I didn't know them concretely--that they could be truths not just for everyone but also for this person right in front of me, for this person I was responsible for.Me, either. Now I feel like I do. Read this book, and recommend it to everyone you know. It is very frank, very well written, and actually? Kind of hopeful.****See also on Vox, ""2015 is the year America started having a sane conversation about death,"" http://www.vox.com/2015/12/16/1011744...."
145,0805095152,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3897817-morgan-blackledge,5,"This is a heart wrenchingly moving and important book. It speaks directly to our cultures strained and distant relationship to aging, the elderly, death and dying. Rarely if ever have I heard a medical clinician speak with such vulnerability and humility about the limits of modern medicine.French cultural theorist and urbanist Paul Virilio observed, with every invention or technical advance, an equally powerful disaster is co-created, for example, when we invented the locomotive, we simultaneously invented the train wreck.In a sense, Being Mortal is Dr. Atul Gawande's analogous observation about the incredible benefits of advanced medicine and the unprecedented opportunities for prolonged suffering and denial it affords us. I'm so grateful to be alive in this time, and science and technology have everything to do with that. Ordinary people have never had as much freedom to pursue knowledge or self expression as we currently enjoy.Advanced medicine is central to the high standard of living we currently have. It prolongs our lives and reduces suffering in many ways that we completely take for granted. But in a real sense, our faith in technology and medical advances has lulled us to sleep on some of life's most important and philosophical, psychological, and spiritual issues. Those of impermanence, suffering, loss and mortality.Our culture does a phenomenal job of keeping death and suffering out of plain sight. This affords the individuals facing these challenges the privacy and professional care that most people chose if given the option.This represents a real advance. But the equally powerful disaster that accompanies this advance is not trivial. The fact that most of us now live the majority of our lives insulated from the reality of death and dying means that we are quite likely to be utterly naive and under developed in this important existential domain.Frankly speaking, these are difficult and unsightly truths most of us would rather defer encountering. In the short term we enjoy the bliss that ignorance affords, but in the long term we suffer the numerous negative consequences that accompany the unexamined life.This book is attempting to address this issue by presenting us with a sober but empathetic and even optimistic view of the end of the road. Highly recommended, five stars."

148,0805095152,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4342402-tl,5,"See Caroline's review here:https://www.goodreads.com/review/show... (her review convinced me to pick this up)----She says it all beautifully so I will add my thoughts here (this'll be fairly short mostly cause my head hurts right now).This book brings up topics most of us don't think about when we are young. It seems too far away to contemplate so we put it out of our minds. Sure, we may talk about it time to time with our loved ones but how many of give it serious thought until something happens, let alone what questions to ask?The subject matter is a bit weighty in here but never felt dry or boring. There's feeling and passion  here. Gawande transports you into what he is talking about, like you are sitting with him at his kitchen table. The personal stories and histories he shares throughout the book were in turns touching and very informative. Of the former, a few had me tearing up and wanting to hug them all. The latter fascinated me, as I didn't know how those things all came about (one of those ""it has always been around"" that you just don't explore further) .I agreed with him on alot of the things he said and it got me thinking about my wishes on the future as well. Hopefully this will help with the hard conversation in the future (even though we wish we could live forever).This is an important book that should be on the bookshelves of everyone, in my humble opinion. Highly recommended.(Excuse any errors, typing on my phone)Narrator: Five starsBonus interview with the author was a nice touch."
149,0805095152,http://goodreads.com/user/show/28602001-emma,5,"An incredible book, but one that has the potential to cause considerable distress.‘Being Mortal’ is a book that addresses the experience of dying in modern society and questions whether we are getting it right. Chapters 1-5 focus primarily on mortality and the diverse nature of the end of life care provided for the elderly. Chapters 6-8 deal more specifically with how those with serious or terminal illnesses, and their families, cope with the process of dying. In these later chapters, the stories related by Gawande are frequently those in which the suffering and death of individuals is caused by cancer, including that of his own father. Though dying is an event that eventually comes to us all, it is a subject that is inherently difficult to address. In talking about our mortality, each person must confront not only the idea of their own death, but that of those who matter to them. It is entirely understandable that people choose to avoid discussing it. Yet Gawande’s book shows why it is important for everybody to stop putting aside the conversation about dying; that, in fact, refusing to tackle death until it is right upon you can lead to much greater pain and suffering. It is at this point when medical intervention takes over, often at the expense of compassion. Medical professionals would do well to read this book as part of their training and development, if only to understand how important honest communication can be to patient outcomes. They are only human, and as such, may feel as awkward about such matters as the rest of us, but they have a duty to provide accurate/truthful information about an individual’s illnesses/conditions so that they can have realistic expectations. Gawande argues that instead of defaulting to the most aggressive form of medical intervention, it is more important to talk to the individual about their goals, what is most important to them, what they can and can’t live with, what their fears and concerns are, what trade offs they are willing to make. Through discussion, a better path can be found for those who may be in pain or who are coming to the end of their life. Such conversations are necessarily incredibly difficult but Gawande highlights the benefits of having a plan put together by the individual, their family, and the medical professionals in collaboration; it is this honest dialogue that will allow an individual to manage their illness and the end of their life in a way that suits their needs. Gawande’s argument is empowering, it promotes the active role of the individual as the centre of their care and what happens to them. Within each chapter, Gawande often addresses what has happened in the past, what is happening now (including in different parts of the world), how people are trying to change things, and what the focus for the future should be. This plan means that the book is not depressing; it highlights the failures but injects positivity by showing ways in which things are being improved, or can/should be improved. At no point does Gawande fall into pessimism, he believes that while the majority of systems and institutions may not be meeting the needs of individuals right now, there is a chance that more of them will do so in the future. The book is his way of showing the difference between what is, and what should be, including examples of people and places that are getting it right. Importantly, Gawande is not prescriptive. He does not say ‘this is THE way to do things’, instead he shows how different solutions are being implemented. The variety of solutions reflect the multitude of differing ways people want and need to approach their ill health, old age, and death.       ‘Being Mortal’ is incredibly difficult to review. Given that I agree with Gawande, it would be easy to say that everyone should read this book. Yet in saying that, it feels like I am telling people that they need to deal with the idea of their death as soon as possible and, if they are currently unwell, that they should open a dialogue with their doctor to plan how they want it to proceed. It sounds more challenging when phrased this way, and is it not truly understandable that someone may not want to deal with the idea of their death by calmly talking through the steps? At the same time, I fundamentally believe Gawande’s argument that honest communication is the way forward for those who are living with terminal illness. Perhaps this is because I would rather make my own decisions while I can, and not leave them for others, who may have to guess what I might want in emergency situations if I hadn’t made my thoughts clear. The role of friends and family as support network seems intrinsically opposed to making these hard choices, the love and hope with which these decisions are made might not be compatible with the path I would want. Neither, perhaps, would the medical intervention. In modern society, people have become a medical problem to be solved, they must be ‘made safe’, increasingly separated from the rest of society and even from themselves, thereby removing any chance at individuality or choice. The problem is exacerbated by the disconnection between what medicine can do and what it should do. Gawande treats the grave and emotive subject matter with respect and conviction. At the end of someone’s life, or as they cope with ill health, he wants people to be able to have choices, to focus on what’s important to the , and to be supported in those goals by everyone around them. This is what I will hope for. "
150,0805095152,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2231715-lewis-weinstein,5,"This book is not pleasant to read. It is challenging, emotional, difficult ... and a spectacular journey along a path we will all follow. As we face the inevitable, Gawande gives us a framework within which to consider the options we may have, the choices we might want to make, and the medical and/or other assistance we may or may not desire. His thoughtful discussion of the people he has accompanied through their dying days, including his father, provides much to stimulate our own thoughts. The central theme is that these decisions should be, to the maximum possible extent, the patient's, with family and medical input, and not the other way around. In Gawande's experience that process, difficult and uncertain as it may be, yields the best results for all those involved."
151,0805095152,http://goodreads.com/user/show/10770371-dan,5,"Being Mortal by Atul GawandeGawande, as a surgeon, steps us through the reality of life’s waning moments. There is a heavy focus on cancer and old age and decisions around hospice care. Not easy subject matter but very useful information. I didn’t get choked up until the end of the book when the author takes us through the last few months of his father’s life as he battled cancer. The US is different from nearly all other countries in the world in how we deal with the elderly. As Americans we don’t live with aging parents and by extension a significant percentage of the elderly are put into retirement homes when they can no longer maintain independence. Gawande points out that our bodies are like machines and quite literally wear out. Most end of life situations spend a great deal of time on pain management and medications and often in the waning days, an inability to digest food.Some interesting facts. “By the age of sixty, people in an industrialized country like the United States have lost, on average, a third of their teeth. After eighty-five, almost 40 percent have no teeth at all.”Philip Roth said “Old age is not a battle. Old age is a massacre.”Gawande also discusses Do Not Resuscitate directives. There is part of a chapter where he recalls interning at a Boston area hospital. On one night he forgets that a patient had signed a DNR. When the patient goes into cardiac arrest, it sets in motion the CPR team to come revive the patient. When Gawande realizes his mistake and tries to call it off he is pushed aside. When the revival effort fails he is tongue lashed by the CPR team. The author feels very strongly about the value of hospice care. Almost everyone, if given the choice, would choose to die at home versus the hospital but the latter situation is still the norm. Sometimes because others have to make the medical decisions when the elderly become incapacitated. 4.5 stars. The writing here is easy to follow and the stories are quite compelling. There is also a lot of practical advice. The book was published in 2014. Highly recommended."
152,0805095152,http://goodreads.com/user/show/8079403-max,5,"This is an important book, whether you are approaching old age or family or friends you care about are. It set my mind spinning thinking how I would deal with the situations Gawande describes. Coming face to face with one’s decline and death is at least depressing and can be terrifying. Gawande points out that the medical profession and most of our institutions are not designed to deal with the human problem. He identifies a number of changes that could be made at a policy level that would improve things. But the fundamental problem is knowing ourselves and communicating our wishes or helping loved ones to reflect and do the same. Gawande points to helpful experiences with hospice care, but we must first make that decision. My notes follow.Gawande explains how growing old has changed and how we in developed countries have adjusted or failed to adjust to it. As the twentieth century wore on medicine made great advances and people’s life spans increased significantly. At the beginning of the century people would stay relatively healthy as they aged until they met a devastating disease, say the flu or cancer or heart disease. These would usually kill people rather quickly and they would die in their homes near friends and family. Now modern medicine fixes most of these problems, at least temporarily, so as people age their health ratchets down step by step. Eventually many of us will be unable to care for ourselves while the doctors keep us alive. There are in home services available and assisted living facilities for those who can afford them. But for the average person without significant savings this is a serious financial as well as personal dilemma and too often ends with a person’s final days spent in an impersonal nursing home.Both medical care for the elderly and institutional care suffer from the same problem – task orientation rather than people orientation. Doctors are trained to fix your issue and keep you alive, not evaluate the impact on your overall quality of life. Similarly institutions for the elderly are designed to meet set goals: To keep you safe, ensure you get your medications, get you fed, keep you clean, etc. The staff is rated on these things and focus on them, but they create an environment their residents typically hate. And of course many institutions don’t meet even basic standards. So the modern way of growing old often means becoming disabled enough to have to leave your home with little choice but to share a room with a stranger in an institutional environment. Gawande paints a grim picture of our future, but he also points to people trying to change things. These people are focused more on care than treatment. The woman who pioneered assisted living was looking for an alternative to the nursing home, not a stepping stone as it too often is. Others have tried to change the focus of nursing homes to enrich the lives of the residents through measures that allow more autonomy to the residents and less regimentation. The design of nursing homes can make them seem more like real homes and less like institutions. The more residents can participate, have choices, have outside interests, the better they will feel and do. Efficiency and safety have to be balanced against their effect on the patient’s quality of life. Throughout life we take reasonable chances to get more out of living. Why should that stop when time becomes short, when it is most precious?Gawande discusses terminal illness and the inevitable decision of whether to stop treatment. Doctors tend not to be helpful. They give choices of your treatment options. That is their job. But today there is hospice and palliative care. When is this a reasonable choice? The decision is personal. Doctors and family can’t really make it which is why drawing out the feelings of the patient is so important. From Gawande’s examples there is clearly a point in which treatment does more harm than good. We all want to die with some dignity and as little pain as possible. We all would rather die in a bed where we can say goodbye to friends and family rather than on a respirator in an ICU. But it is difficult to give up hope that the next procedure might work or buy us significant time. The decision is a tradeoff to achieve some quality of life at the end. Gawande talks about his own father’s case. His father, also a doctor, had terminal cancer and was facing paralysis. It took what Gawande calls the hard conversation to make the decision to accept hospice and the inevitable. In a testimony to the notion that the most sophisticated doctor may not be the best choice to initiate this conversation, Gawande’s father’s feelings were skillfully drawn out by a small town nurse practitioner from the local hospice. She was interested in him, his problems as he saw them, not in the disease and its treatment."
153,0805095152,http://goodreads.com/user/show/9049915-james-barker,5,"It is commonly phrased that we battle illness. But this remarkable book by Atul Gawande points out that it is an ill-thought battle and, dare I say it, an ill-fought one.For the last three years of my wonderful mother’s life I was her carer. Coping with the advanced stages of multiple sclerosis she was mostly restricted to her bed (which was in fact a hospital bed delivered to our family home along with all the other paraphernalia of sickness), permanently catheterised, unable to walk or do anything for herself. Mom also had severe dementia and often mistook me for my recently-deceased Dad. As an immersive carer I managed a team of women who assisted me in the day with my mother’s personal care. The rest of the time I sat with her, or fed her, or tried to unblock her catheter (while going out of my mind), or sang with her. Naturally, the last activity was the most enjoyable. Despite her dementia, Mom had a seemingly inexhaustible trove of perfectly-remembered lyrics in her head. We sang Doris Day songs, the Bellamy Brothers, the Beautiful South, the Beatles, Tori Amos, the Hollies, Cyndi Lauper, the Mama and Papas, Simon and Garfunkel, ABBA, songs from musicals. Even new songs she had only heard once we tackled together. Somehow she remembered these lyrics too.But 16 months before Mom passed away she developed septicaemia and was rushed into hospital. Her organs were shutting down, her pulse was weak and fading fast. We were told her quality of life was so bad, her disability so extreme, that the hospital was to offer no treatment- it would be kinder to let her go.We didn’t. I won’t go into the whys and wherefores of that decision but at least one of my sisters- who had driven in terror the 150 miles from where she lived- thought that letting go would be an idea we should not entertain and I wavered, full of love for this extraordinary woman who had been the life and soul of any party when I was growing up, rock and rolling on the dance floor, full of fast wit and laughter that was infectious in its affirmation of life. The doctor in charge asked me for one piece of evidence that suggested my mother had any quality of life at all. We sing every day- we sing together all the time, I said. So he treated her and somehow, over 7 long and painful weeks, she became well enough to be sent back home and into my care.But what did this ‘well enough’ mean? Mom was no longer capable of swallowing so had had a peg inserted into her stomach. I was trained in the art of its upkeep- everyday the wound needed to be cleaned and the peg rotated 360 degrees (otherwise it would fuse to her skin). Any strength Mom had had in her arms had gone. To all intents and purposes she was incapable of moving anything but her head (a fraction), her eyes and mouth. But by and large Mom slept, in a virtual coma that meant our daily songs felt like a golden time remembered and grieved from the perspective of a new time of horrors. Three days after returning home and in a fever caused by kidney stones that were trying to be passed (another tier of Hell) Mom whispered to me, “I have had enough.”But of course it didn’t end there. Mom stayed in a limbo of pain and half-consciousness for well over another year. She would emit blood-curdling screams when being cleaned, when being moved, but she did not sing. Fed a noxious mixture through a machine, one of the few joys she had had left (sucking on a piece of chocolate or enjoying slow mouthfuls of a home-cooked dinner) had gone. It struck me sitting beside her that we had consigned her to an exit that was barbarous and devoid of love. All I could do was ensure she was as comfortable as possible and that, on the occasions she was awake, she could see that I was there, smiling at her and telling her I loved her more than the world.When the end time came we were told on three separate occasions that today was the day. But a little woman of 5’2”, ranked a Zero by hospital doctors when her ability was assessed, she defied every professional speculation and breathed on another day, then another, then another. When she died in November 2012, a few weeks shy of her 68th birthday, I have truly never seen such peace on a face.In the last year of her life Mom had been well enough on a handful of occasions to wake and smile at me and sing with me. One of these occasions I captured on video. We sit together, smiling, singing ‘Zip A Dee Doo Dah,’ (my oh my what a wonderful day) and she tells me she loves me. An exquisite moment that I am glad I captured. But was it really worth the 16 months of Hell she went through?Atul Gawande’s book is all about acceptance of our mortality. But it is about much more than that. Modern medicine has it wrong, he says. It is about preserving life at all costs- battle for a year through procedure after procedure rather than enjoy your remaining months of life at the best possible quality. Yes, it turns out the emergency room where my mother ended up in 2011 made the right call and we did not. But, by and large, if you have a life-limiting prognosis with a disease such as cancer you will be offered all sorts of treatments to extend that life at the detriment of its quality.But this is also a book about the way the elderly are treated in the industry of care homes and sheltered housing. With all meaning to life removed, with all responsibility removed, people become shells of their former selves, depressed and longing for the death that the (questionable) care they are receiving is preventing. Visionary projects from the 1970s- with more pets in care homes, with pairs of birds in every room for residents to have a vested interest in looking after, with children of staff visiting, filling the emptiness with the joy of activity, of noise- show that it is possible for care homes to be places of life rather than death. But it takes more effort to achieve this, more resources. More determination to give the elderly a life worth enjoying. And so, of course, such ideas largely fall by the wayside, because in a capitalist world the elderly are a drain on life, on resources... which is frankly sickening.I cannot stress enough how important this book is. It was, at times, a painful read for me, and that will be the case for anyone who has lost someone in a medicalised nightmare of end-time. But you owe it to yourself to understand what best befits you when your time comes. You owe it to yourself to choose your own ending. This book arms you with the knowledge to make the right decision, however painful that is.As for my mother.. after 3 touch and go trips to the hospital in the last year of her life I spoke to my sisters and told them it all came down to what we felt Mom would prefer- to die at home or have more and more (hopeless) treatment at hospital, where it was inevitable that one day she would happen to die. We agreed that just as my father had passed away at home, surrounded by people who loved him, our mother deserved the same. It was the best decision we made. She passed on in her home of 40 years held by those she loved and surrounded by their voices. She died in peace."

Gawande has about three major points in this book, all of which were made in a news magazine article he wrote for the Atlantic: 1, We should have tough conversations with those in our lives about their vision for their end-of-life; 2, Doctors should also have these conversations with their patients; and 3, If we have these conversations, we can shift medicine and end-of-life care away from a stave-off-death model and towards a model that promotes humanity, autonomy, and dignity for the dying (and thus no longer need institutional nursing homes). I do not disagree, but the book itself is heavy on anecdotes and light on actual research or policy analysis.My major stylistic critique is that Gawande buries his three points in pages of anecdotes about patients and memories of his own father's decline and death. I'm not being unsympathetic to the suffering of these colorful characters (and Gawande's own personal suffering), but I found the anecdotes long-winded, distracting, and ultimately boring. Gawande intended them to have emotional impact for the reader, but for me, the stories smacked of filling pages for the pure commercial gain of selling a book. My major substantive critique is that Gawande spends too little time on policy, instead championing the heroism of individual doctors, caregivers, and entrepreneurs-- as if the system can be saved by some brave individuals. He is far too sanguine about the difficulty of changing institutions at the macro-level. Yes, Gawande mentions that these alternative living arrangements and alternative therapeutic approaches save money in the long run, but most of the initiatives Gawande covers were developed by private entrepreneurs, not governments (though some government funds may have been made available in the form of grants). Dramatic policy change would be needed to scale and fund these initiatives at the state or federal level, and I do not see the current vested interests in the healthcare lobby supporting these changes (nor does Gawande provide a path for fighting for policy change, besides mentioning the cost-effectiveness argument). The one scale-able initiative that Gawande discusses, Hospice, already exists-- but Gawande ignores that Hospice's ranks are often filled with low-skilled, under-paid, and over-worked caregivers who are hardly in the position to give the attentive, individualized care that Gawande received for his father. Gawande is also too sanguine about the role of socioeconomic class, which is perhaps why his friends and his patients receive such excellent care. He is wrapped in a bubble of privilege -- access to the top surgeons and the most committed nurses. True, some of the alternative homes that Gawande mentions do take Medicaid, but these homes are so few that they have waitlists that are hundreds of names long. The type of ""better death"" that Gawande argues for so eloquently is available only to the wealthiest or the most educated (those empowered to fight the system and search for better options). Without a serious treatment of the nexus between healthcare policy, quality of life, and socioeconomic status, this book seems to me squarely in the realm of theory, not practice. "
155,0805095152,http://goodreads.com/user/show/929238-hbalikov,5,"This is an excellent book. It is also the most important book that I have read in the past year.Dr. Gawande is that rare physician who can write well and write well for the layman. There is nothing glamorous about growing old. There is nothing glamorous in taking care of those who are growing old. As to the former, Gawande, makes it clear as he describes the way our bodies decline and breakdown over time. As to the later, it helps to explain both why very few doctors are attracted to gerontology and why those who aren't are not particularly adept at dealing with those who are at or near the end of their lives. This book is about ""what matters in the end,"" but it is also about Gawande's journey as a physician and surgeon. ""I never expected that among the most meaningful experiences I'd have as a doctor --- and, really, as a human being --- would come from helping others deal with what medicine cannot do as well as what it can.""Atul Gawande is meticulous in describing how we wear down and wear out. ""There is, he told me, 'no single, common cellular mechanism to the aging process.'....The process is gradual and unrelenting."" And, how many of us believe that we can put that aside for the present. ""People naturally prefer to avoid the subject of their decrepitude."" Yet, it colors many things that we do and many decisions that we have to make. In his own learning process, Gawande shares his experiences, and his encounters with doctors, other care givers and physicians. ""The job of any doctor, Bludau later told me, is to support quality of life, by which he meant two things: as much freedom from the ravages of disease as possible and the retention of enough function for active engagement in the world. Most doctors treat disease and figure that the rest will take care of itself.""He exposes a lot of the ""nursing home approach"" as insensitive with facilities that may come to resemble an asylum (in the worst sense). He explores the question, ""what makes life worth living when we are old and frail and unable to care for ourselves,"" is its many facets. There are: basic needs for survival; need for love and belonging; desire for growth (""the opportunity to attain personal goals, to master knowledge and skills, and to recognized and rewarded for our achievements); and, perhaps, ""self-fulfillment through pursuit or moral ideals and creativity for their own sake."" He points out that ""our driving motivations in life, instead of remaining constant, change hugely over time...""I learned a lot about how we often treat those who cannot care entirely for themselves and how attitudes and venues are changing. When doctors are just about ""tinkering"" with the seriously ill, a lot is ignored. Particularly, that those people ""have priorities (perhaps poorly expressed or not discussed) besides prolonging their lives. Surveys find that their top concerns include avoiding suffering, strengthening relationships with family and friends, being mentally alert, not being a burden to others, and achieving a sense that their life is complete.""I wish I had had this book to read before I found myself with friends and family members who were seriously ill or dying. Gawande describes how both amateur and professional caregivers can be sensitive to these issues. And, how they can give the ill and dying the opportunity to reflect on their own desires. One of those, for many, is that they would rather spend their remaining days at home instead of in an institution. There is a very illuminating section on hospice and how this should be explored far earlier than it currently is. Not necessarily invoking hospice care earlier, but being aware of what if can offer and, if desired, getting it going in time to make a difference with quality of life.""(Though), no one ever really has control. Physics and biology and accident ultimately have their way in our lives. But the point is that we are not helpless either. Courage is the strength to recognize BOTH realities. We have room to act, to shape our stories, though as time goes on it is within narrower and narrower confines. A few conclusions become clear when we understand this: that our most cruel failure in how we treat the sick and the aged is the failure to recognize that they have priorities beyond merely being safe and living longer; that the chance to shape one's story is essential to sustaining meaning in life; that we have the opportunity to refashion our institutions, our culture, and our conversations in ways that transform the possibilities for the last chapters of everyone's lives."""

In his effortlessly lucid prose, Gawande comes to terms with the medical establishment's failure in providing end-of-life care. Too often, doctors work to fix what's broken in the service of extending life, without considering how quality of life is compromised, inflicting even more suffering as a result. He extols the value of hospice and palliative care, whose aim is not to give up on patients, but to provide as many good days as possible in the inevitable slide to death. He advocates asking difficult questions with patients and loved ones to determine what can bring meaning and value to them, even in the harsh narrowing of life's possibilities brought on by failing bodies and minds. He does not exempt himself from this critique -- instead he offers personal stories, iike those of his father and his daughter's piano teacher, to show how he came to understand the necessity of these important discussions and the possibilities they offer. It's moving, and timely, and despite the less-than-cheerful subject matter, never a burden to read (a testament to his writerly skill). I can't recommend this book highly enough to anyone who will face these issues -- and we all most likely will, in some form."
157,0805095152,http://goodreads.com/user/show/47188780-kathleen,5,"•	This is an important book for all who have elderly parents that are struggling with end-of-life health issues. Dr. Gawande personalizes the key issues through individual case histories, but he backs up his arguments with solid statistics. First, our society does not have enough gerontologists to serve our aging population, and our medical schools are cutting back on training new ones. More importantly, medical doctors tend to want to solve medical problems. And often, that results in them not recognizing, or even asking, what is important to their patient’s quality of life. The elderly want to live in ‘a home’, not an institution. They want to feel in control of their lives as much as possible. Safety is less of a concern to them than independence. Privacy is important too. They tend to want their own space, with furniture from their own home. They want to be able to turn on the television when and at what volume they want. These needs are not compatible with institutional long-term care facilities. So, new options are being explored—particularly in the United States. Highly recommend."

“A few conclusions become clear when we understand this: that our most cruel failure in how we treat the sick and the aged is the failure to recognize that they have priorities beyond merely being safe and living longer; that the chance to shape one’s story is essential to sustaining meaning in life; that we have the opportunity to refashion our institutions, our culture, and our conversations in ways that transform the possibilities for the last chapters of everyone’s lives.”

 This right here is the theme of Atul Gawande's Being Mortal: Medicine and What Matters in the End. This incredible piece of medical/science nonfiction starts out by introducing historical and cultural norms for caring for our elders and how this has significantly shifted in many societies. Mr. Gawande does not pass judgement but presents the observations and facts so we the reader may have an objective view which starts a journey of perspective. And when we view the world from another perspective, self-examination takes place, thus change. I absolutely loved this book. Many books I have been reading lately have been all about timing it seems. Last year, I watched both my grandfathers die (within 3 days of each other) and this year I am really beginning to take note of my parents and in-law's escalating aging. I guess chronic diseases, strokes, and fickle organs will do that to you. Like many self-centered Americans, I have been looking at the process in terms of what it means for me. How will my life change as they become more and more dependent on me? This book. This book! My perspective and priorities are forever altered. It is about me, after all I am living my life, but it is also about them. They want to be the author of their own life just as much as I do and if I'm lucky, they will live long enough to require assistance with that. They didn't ask for these complications and they fear the loss of independence far more than I could ever begin to imagine. The true terror: that no one will care.Mr. Gawande stresses that end of life conversations are crucial and surprisingly liberating, not only as a son or daughter but as a medical provider. There is a sense of control even in the midst of very uncontrollable circumstances. Questions need to be asked and once answers are decided upon, fear and anxiety of all parties involved can relax a bit. Your wishes will be respected in terms of what a quality life means to you. In a world of nursing homes that might as well be classified as prisons, knowing that someone listens and cares about what you want (despite the options and risks) is priceless. Mr. Gawande draws from his personal experience with his father in this respect and I found these parts to be incredibly raw and emotional. I strongly recommend this book. But if you don't read it, please remember these questions for your loved ones: 

“Whenever serious sickness or injury strikes and your body or mind breaks down, the vital questions are the same: What is your understanding of the situation and its potential outcomes? What are your fears and what are your hopes? What are the trade-offs you are willing to make and not willing to make? And what is the course of action that best serves this understanding?”

 Ask questions, advocate as needed, and enjoy this short life with the people you love ♥My favorite quote:""This is what it means to have autonomy -- you may not control life's circumstances, but getting to be the author of your life means getting to control what you do with them.”"
159,0805095152,http://goodreads.com/user/show/83445-lisa-vegan,5,"This book is excellent. It’s accessible and always interesting. It’s one of those books that probably everybody should read. I’m thinking every physician should read it upon graduating from medical school or during their residency. I think that it’s an important book.I do disagree with him at times, though overall think what he says is spot on.The parts where I disagree are in two major areas: The main one is his reluctance about supporting widespread assisted suicide because he says in those places, palliative hospice care isn’t as advanced an offering. However, even with hospice, I’ve witnessed horrible suffering, unbearable suffering, and it seems rare that people have none of that in their last days and weeks. I think both assisted suicide and competent hospice should always be options. I think not all hospices care works very well at all, though I know that some does. The other place I disagree is his contention that genetics isn’t as crucial to longevity as I think it is, especially in those families where so many live to over 100 and, I know by knowing them, that they often do not take at all good care of themselves, living in a way where others without their genes would die at much younger ages and with more infirmities before their deaths. The gist of what he says about quality of life when aged or with a terminal illness I agree with wholeheartedly though. A lot of what he says about that and examples he gives, makes the book fun to read. I really appreciated the several very personal stories, including his father’s story. So, not only do I not want to live until end stage cancer or ALS, etc. which I’ve always known, but I have no desire to get so old or sick that I can’t take care of myself – with my situation I wouldn’t end up at one of the good places and even those wouldn’t be great for me. These are issues I’ve thought about since about age 12, and I will do anything I can to avoid physical pain, nausea, shortness of breath, and other forms of suffering. Great book for getting readers to think about what they want when they’re elderly or have a life threatening illness, and also for having conversations about their wishes, and encouraging others in their lives to also share their wishes.The best thing about the book, and I wish 100% of medical people would get on board, is the weighing of what is worth it and not worth it to patients, and facing what medicine can’t do as well as what it can do. Not lying! Not evading! Not giving false hope! Allowing patients to take the lead with their own lives! Advocating that conversations should be had with the ill/elderly and doctors shouldn’t assume they know what should be done without knowing the patients’ goals and wishes for themselves. Early in the book, a death mentioned sounded exactly like my mother in 1964-1965 – I have to read that book! Books leading to other books…I'm still laughing about the 100 loose birds!!!"
160,0805095152,http://goodreads.com/user/show/632247-chrissie,3,"Before reading: I am reading this not because I want to but because I feel I ought to. Is it going to make me feel all horrible? I can accept this if it constructively explains what you can do to ""improve"" the end of life. In conclusion: I am glad I read the book, but it wasn’t particularly fun. There are many examples given of particular people, their illnesses and the difficulties they had, one being the author’s father. I didn’t understand all the medical terms used. Examples are given to illustrate the author’s conclusions on how medical care of the aging should be altered. The author, who is himself a surgeon, shows new, better alternatives and how they came to be. He does this by naming pioneers of better nursing homes, assisted care units and hospice development. For a person in the medical field I think this book is essential because it shows how medical changes need to be and can be implemented…., but I am not employed in the medical field and the historical developments, although interesting, were a bit extraneous for me. From my point of view, these sections could have been shortened, even if they do show the direction the author is supporting. One can ask, “Who is this book for?”In my family we have had several deaths in the past years. So the weaknesses coupled to end of life medical care, nursing homes and hospices were not new to me. I didn’t have to be told; I was not surprised in the least. What I wanted from this book were guidelines showing me how I could improve my husband’s and my own end of life. Did the book do this? Well, it made me face my own situation and what lay ahead. As a result of reading this book I will be looking into what alternatives are available here in Sweden when we are no longer able to manage alone. My husband and I have discussed exactly how we see the future. It has made clear to us that we value independence and that we want to stay where we are as long as possible – even if such living may be less safe than living near a hospital. We plan on looking in to Assisted Care Facilities that offer a gradual increase of care as needs increase. Do they have queues? Are they expensive? Where are they located? The essential point is that you have to know what you are looking for and that will be different for each family. So, yes, I am glad I read the book. It made me evaluate what is important to me – nature and independence and a dog and pretty landscape. The book pushed me to do this.  Another issue the book pushes you to evaluate is how long you want to extend the years of your life even if that time is filled with pain and discomfort. This too is a personal decision. The book guides you in what sort of questions you should ask your doctor, but of course some questions are specific to the illness one is coping with. Some conclusions are drawn that may be true for many, but not for my husband and I. Generally, most seem to want more contact with family as they age. This has its difficult sides too, and the book mentions this only briefly. I think more attention could have been devoted to this topic. While funeral wishes are important to discuss at life’s end, I found it unnecessary that the author discussed the details of his father’s funeral in this book.Practically nothing is said about how the elderly no longer want to travel. I may add that if you want to travel do it when you are young and fit. I am thankful to have traveled earlier in my life. The book is primarily concerned with American facilities, and practically nothing is said about costs. The audiobook is narrated by Robert Petkoff. It is read at a good speed. When good nursing facilities were being discussed he tended to sound SO enthused, SO exuberant. Really, I found this a bit childish. It doesn’t distort the text, but exaggerates how wonderful it all is. I could have done without this. The book has made me more appreciative of what I have. It has pushed my husband and me to evaluate which qualities of life we deem most important. With a clearer understanding of our preferences we can more easily deal with what lies ahead."
161,0805095152,http://goodreads.com/user/show/730754-ken,4,"Anyone who is planning on dying some day should read this book. It can be jumpy at times, but overall, Gawande's a straight shooting, no-nonsense writer who gives the straight dope on nursing homes, assisted living, hospice, and the heart-rending decisions we are all forced into at our end-of-days. As many of his accounts deal with cancer cases, it's a bit of a downer, but it's medicine to be taken and there's no better way to illustrate his point than through real-life examples, including his own father, who developed a fatal tumor in his spinal cord. God save us all from ends like this, but sorry, we all don't get to die suddenly and peacefully in our sleep.Among topics Gawande tackles: the dearth of geriatricians in this country. So ironic. So American. But the money is not there for doctors dedicated to our fastest growing demographic. Oh. And the preventative-style approach, the in-the-moment treatments needed to keep the elderly happy? Often not paid for by insurance companies, either.He also gets into nursing home/assisted living situations, focusing on the story of an upstate NY facility where a maverick doctor/director decided to introduce parakeets and live plants in every room as well as two cats and two dogs who had the run of the place. The nurses were thrown by this -- one refused to pick up a doggy mistake on the floor because that wasn't what she got a nursing license for -- but eventually everyone saw the seismic shift this simple yet dramatic change had on the previously-listless residents. The ""inmates"" (what they felt like, previously) started to perk up, tell people about the personalities of their parakeets, take a hand in caring for both plants and birds. Meanwhile, they became entranced with the wandering dogs and cats. Those patients who were ambulatory surprised the nurses by stepping up and volunteering to walk the dogs. The director had kids visit, too, providing training to middle schoolers on how to talk even with people with Alzheimer's. The young people's two or three visits a week became events to look forward to for the elderly residents, who, between pets and children, suddenly discovered purpose and felt more like human beings, more like they used to when they were living alone.There are other variations here, too, like assisted living purposely designed in pods of smaller units, created to look more like homes and less like institutions. Chief among the changes? Allowing people some privacy -- their own rooms. Giving them more leeway on what to do, when to eat. The schedules work around the people vs. vice versa.But the bulk of the book focuses on decisions and consequences. There are no definitive moves to make once a fatal disease begins its course, but Gawande shows that it's spinning a bit out of control in too many cases. The money being spent to prolong lives, often to make those lives so much more miserable just because people refuse to accept the oldest fact of life -- death -- is truly a scary thing. Modern medicine may be many things, but it is no match for Death, who remains undefeated. Still, there is a measure of victory to be had. For many people, that may mean a shorter but higher quality amount of time with family and friends. And, paradoxically, Gawande points to studies showing that many people who choose hospice care actually live longer than those who take the harsh and risky treatment road. They have less pain. They are happier. Together, these effects lead to slightly longer days with those they love. So, if you think hospice is a white flag, think again. It's not as simple as all that. Nor is this book. It's food for thought. Not that it will get any easier for you, the reader, when such choices visit you or your loved ones (and they will), but at least you'll have a better sense of balance and perspective. Can we ask for any more than that?"
162,0805095152,http://goodreads.com/user/show/275498-jim,5,"This is a brilliantly written book, and I was super-impressed with the genius of the good Dr Gawande right up to the point where he drank water out of the Ganges...I wouldn't do that at gunpoint! But while I might question the doc's wisdom in choice of beverages, I have to say he wrote a darn fine book.All of the occupants of this globe have a single thing in common...we will all die. Hopefully, we enjoy a long life and peaceful old age before our expiry date and, thanks to modern medicine and the care of good physicians, this is getting to be the reality for more people. This presents us with another problem: caring for a growing population of oldsters who require care as they ease their way into the hereafter. Families are getting smaller, so the progeny that would have cared for ailing seniors in the past are absent, or already employed. Expensive medical treatments are being employed to attempt to extend the lives of oldsters who would have slipped away without treatment, but at what cost? Frequently the result of this practice is that the medical treatment gives the patient an agonized existence suffering from side effects.Dr Gawande believes that, in most cases, if given a choice between having some quality time with loved ones or a possibly longer painful and befuddled existence under medical care, most people will choose the quality time even though it may be shorter. And here's another point to consider: Gawande has determined that 63% of doctors overestimate the amount of time a patient has to live, and that the better the doctor knows the patient, the more likely he/she will be to overestimate the patient's remaining time.Of interest to me was the fact that he basically confirmed an old homily my Granny used to toss out from time to time: ""A son is a son 'til he gets him a wife, but a daughter's a daughter for all of her life"". Here's what Dr Gawande had to say about the matter (from P. 79):  ""your chances of avoiding the nursing home are directly related to the number of children you have, and, according to what little research has been done, having at least one daughter seems to be crucial to the amount of help you will receive.""Naturally, one cannot always expect that sons and daughters will be able to care for them. Dr Gawande is firmly on the side of those who consult a palliative care specialist (From P.177):  ""The result; those who saw a palliative care specialist stopped chemotherapy sooner, entered hospice far earlier, experienced less suffering at the end of their lives - and they lived 25 percent longer. In other words, our decision making in medicine has failed so spectacularly that we have reached the point of actually inflicting harm on patients rather than confronting the subject of mortality.""This could have been a boring book...it wasn't. Dr Gawande has the gift of imparting information without making you feel like you are being tutored. A very interesting read, particularly for those of us who are around the last curve and racing toward the finish line."

The difficulty of what to do with the aging population is an interesting and highly debatable (if not slightly depressing) topic. Gawande shares real life client stories, including his own family. This made this book relatable, who hasn't watched an elder age and eventually pass away. The best story was the one with the home that brought in dogs, cats, birds and plants. I just loved reading about the after effects of bringing life and small responsibilities in for the elderly residents. Innovating for this demographic brought hope to this challenging time in our history and while the topic is dark, this perspective shone a tiny light of hope for the future.Would highly recommend."
165,0805095152,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6041973-josh,4,"As I sit here at work, basically doing nothing but typing this review and speaking to my fiancé on Microsoft Lync, I am drinking a cup of coffee and wondering about my mortality.  Yes, I admit, I usually think of it more than once a day, sometimes twice a day, but never 4.5 times a day because that’s actually impossible.When reading Gawande’s ‘Being Mortal’, I found myself not questioning my own life, but many others; he exposed a sense of compassion in this misanthropic heart and how the geriatric community are treated in their final days.  His views on how doctors tend to be either vague or as he puts it, ‘Mr. Informative’, (saying too much about the disease and focusing more on it than the actual patient and their well-being) is a unique perspective from a doctor that actually cares for his patients.  Now, I’m not saying that doctors, as a whole do not, but the way it seems (from my knowledgeable perspective), they go in and out of doors seeing people like paying consumers instead of human beings and making it more of a business than actually trying to treat a person, much less about their well-being.The majority of the book takes us through first-hand accounts from the author; a multitude of case studies, that state interesting statistics about subjects such as: how people in their 50’s-90’s are leaning more towards living independently; how people with a terminal illness find themselves to want to die, rather than live out their days because of the guilt on how embarrassing and burdensome they may be to loved ones; how palliative care has helped many people in having a better life at home rather than being stuck with needles and prolonging their inevitable death in a place they hate to be (somewhat contradictory, yet for good reason, many that go through palliative care or hospice tend to live slightly longer than if they were laid up inside a hospital due to the quality of care towards the patient and not the disease); and how it takes courage to let go when no other option is available.His insight on these subjects is based on a close, personal relationship.  He saw how his own father dealt with terminal cancer for many years, but also used the methods of care listed above and it ended up being the right call; his father lived a lot longer than if he would’ve had extremely intrusive surgery and only had mild suffering, but always in a conscious state knowing what was being done to him, enjoying things before his final breath.Overall, I found much of the information helpful on drawing my own opinions on the matter and opened my eyes to other aspects.Many may find this book depressing because it deals with a subject that we cannot control ultimately, but with understanding and acceptance, we can manage the best we can."
166,0805095152,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7392004-quo,5,"I suspect that what makes some teachers revered is not just a mastery of the subject they mean to impart but that they also have retained an elemental sense of being a learner as well. One of the facets that impressed me most about Atul Gawande's Being Mortal: Medicine & What Matters in the End is that the author conveys the importance of the essential dialogue between doctor & patient by asking himself how he would like to be treated if he were the patient and not the medical specialist. To suggest that this is an important book is almost to diminish it, for Dr. Gawande involves the reader not just in reviewing a series of case studies & other background detail on how each of us attempts to deal with our own mortality but also causes something very personal to take place, the rare sensation of being spoken to directly in a meaningful, compassionate manner. For, as people become aware of the finitude of their life, they do not ask for much. They do not seek riches, they do not seek more power. They ask only to be permitted, insofar as possible, to keep shaping the story of their life in the world--to make choices & to sustain connections to others according to their own priorities.I found Being Mortal a treasure in many gradually unfolding ways. For example, little gerontological training occurs as a component part of medical school, so much so that many doctors feel they are often unable to offer treatment as much as the lure of hope. Dr. Gawande comments thatThere is almost always a long trail of possibility, however slim. However, we have built a multi-trillion dollar edifice for dispensing the medical equivalent of lottery tickets, while having only a rudimentary system to prepare patients for the near certainty that those tickets will not win. Hope is not a plan.Thus, 63% of M.D.'s overestimate survival time, not wanting to trample a patient's hopes, while only 17% underestimate survival time. Interestingly, if a doctor knows a patient well, he or she is more likely to be overly optimistic, ""even to the point of engaging in fantasy about experimental drugs to cure a patient or to extend life in an unrealistic way."" There are many humorous anecdotes which serve to relieve, at least in part, the difficult task of considering one's own mortality in this book, one being Philip Roth's comment that ""Old age is not a battle, it's a massacre."" And the late Harvard scientist & gifted writer, Prof. Steven Jay Gould, wistfully observed that ""the medium isn't always the message"", preferring the more realistic view of death as the ultimate enemy and finding nothing reproachable about those who ""rage against the dying of the light"", borrowing words from Dylan Thomas. Gould lived an additional 20 years after his original diagnosis. Another funny inclusion occurs when General Custer is compared with General Robert E. Lee, with the latter knowing when the battle could not be won.Included among the meaningful case studies is the story of Karen Brown Wilson on the west coast who develops a model for extended care or assisted living as an alternative to conventional nursing homes, though her new paradigm is quickly absorbed into a corporate structure & radically changed. Also, Dr. Bill Thomas in upstate New York, a restless Harvard Med School grad decides to attempt a new model for nursing homes, concluding that ""what was missing was life itself."" He introduces pets aplenty, including dogs, cats, birds and also inserts plants in each room to help confront the 3 plagues of nursing home existence: boredom, loneliness & helplessness. And, in so doing, he alters the relationship of patient to nursing home. Lastly, Dr. Atul Gawande's own father, also a surgeon & born in India, deals with his own mortality and when afflicted with cancer, he attempts to reinvent his life in a meaningful way during his remaining days by performing community service as a Rotarian and extending his ministry to a school he founded in his native India. Ultimately, Atul Gawande concludes that our ultimate goal should not be a good death but a good life till the very end and that assisted living is far more difficult than assisted death. In spite of the notion that every life ends in an execution, so to speak, there are countless uplifting vignettes of people dealing with their own mortality in a positive manner & with great courage in Dr. Gawande's wonderful book, Being Mortal and also in a one hour television episode of ""Frontline"", available via the Internet."

“Death is the enemy. But the enemy has superior forces. Eventually, it wins. And in a war that you cannot win, you don’t want a general who fights to the point of total annihilation. You don’t want Custer. You want Robert E. Lee, someone who knows how to fight for territory that can be won and how to surrender it when it can’t, someone who understands that the damage is greatest if all you do is battle to the bitter end.”

 “We’ve been wrong about what our job is in medicine. We think our job is to ensure health and survival. But really it is larger than that. It is to enable well-being.” 
This is not an easy simple-read. It is a brain-storming perspective-changing book.In all our modern medical learning and practice we aim at making life last ""longer"", but we should make it feel ""better""We try to elongate the lives of the elder, or the ""life"" of their bodies/corpses. Using unjustified mechanical ventilation, Inotropic support, unjustified high-risk operations and the result is an end-of-life ""lived"" in hospitals.
 “A few conclusions become clear when we understand this: that our most cruel failure in how we treat the sick and the aged is the failure to recognize that they have priorities beyond merely being safe and living longer; that the chance to shape one’s story is essential to sustaining meaning in life; that we have the opportunity to refashion our institutions, our culture, and our conversations in ways that transform the possibilities for the last chapters of everyone’s lives.” 

 “I learned about a lot of things in medical school, but mortality wasn’t one of them. Although I was given a dry, leathery corpse to dissect in my first term, that was solely a way to learn about human anatomy. Our textbooks had almost nothing on aging or frailty or dying. How the process unfolds, how people experience the end of their lives, and how it affects those around them seemed beside the point. The way we saw it, and the way our professors saw it, the purpose of medical schooling was to teach how to save lives, not how to tend to their demise.” 
This book is about how can we make life worth-living when we are too frail, too fragile, vulnerable and dependent.Our societies confronts these circumstances by avoiding talking about them, we all deny death, deny talking about it until it is too late.We designed nurseries to control the elder, their safety and their privacy and to make their lives impervious to change . . And the result is a life supposed to be safe, but empty of everything they care about.
 “It is not death that the very old tell me they fear. It is what happens short of death—losing their hearing, their memory, their best friends, their way of life. As Felix put it to me, “Old age is a continuous series of losses.” Philip Roth put it more bitterly in his novel Everyman: “Old age is not a battle. Old age is a massacre.” 
in this book you learn how to listen to them, to acknowledge their fears and how to feel their hopes. You will learn that death is inevitable, that you should respect death, you should respect aging, you should talk about it, and above all you should truly ""live"" to the very end of your life.
 “The problem with medicine and the institutions it has spawned for the care of the sick and the old is not that they have had an incorrect view of what makes life significant. The problem is that they have had almost no view at all. Medicine’s focus is narrow. Medical professionals concentrate on repair of health, not sustenance of the soul. Yet—and this is the painful paradox—we have decided that they should be the ones who largely define how we live in our waning days.” 

 “Sometimes we can offer a cure, sometimes only a salve, sometimes not even that. But whatever we can offer, our interventions, and the risks and sacrifices they entail, are justified only if they serve the larger aims of a person’s life. When we forget that, the suffering we inflict can be barbaric. When we remember it the good we do can be breathtaking.” 

 “Our ultimate goal, after all, is not a good death but a good life to the very end.” 

 “Death, of course, is not a failure. Death is normal. Death may be the enemy, but it is also the natural order of things.”

Should we want them to? At what cost – not to society or to our wallets, but at what cost to our humanity and dignity? Atul Gawunde, a surgeon in Boston Massachusetts, explores the ways in which medicine (and specifically American medicine and American society) helps and hinders the aged, the infirm, and the dying. If you know anyone who will someday die … stop reading this review and read this book.As he did in his previous books, Gawunde gives clear information and asks probing questions. He does not necessarily try to give us THE answer, but he does propose some alternatives, ultimately leaving the final answer up to each and every one of us. Having helped both my parents face their mortal ends, I can tell you that my family members and I – brothers, sister-in-law, and husband – have had many discussions about these issues over the past several years. Some of the physicians we encountered were open to such frank discussion, but not all were. There are difficult issues, heart-wrenching dilemmas, and anxiety-producing situations. But they do not get less difficult, less anxiety-producing, or less heart-wrenching when we ignore them. Oliver Sacks wrote the following blurb: “We have come to medicalize aging, frailty, and death, treating them as if they were just one more clinical problem to overcome. However it is not only medicine that is needed in one’s declining years but life – a life with meaning, a life as rich and full as possible under the circumstances. Being Mortal is not only wise and deeply moving, it is an essential and insightful book for our times…” WHY are you still reading this review? Read the book … NOW! Think carefully about what you want, and then talk about it – to your family, your friends, your doctors. Encourage them to read the book, too. Robert Petkoff does a superb job reading the audio book. There is a bonus interview with the author at the end of the audio version. "
169,0805095152,http://goodreads.com/user/show/24882791-india-m-clamp,4,"“Is empathy and kindness standard in geriatric medicine?” Why did Dr. Gawande find it disconcerting how old/frail patients are being treated? Why are parents cared for---as if they were made of gold---better in India?Truly an arduous journey on a path laden with geriatric patients and a transformation from independence to its’ opposite. This imposing trudge into considerations, care and realities of mortality and “how hope is an elixir.” Most elegantly summarized. Gawande writes: “Being Mortal is about the struggle to cope with the strength of our biology. We think our job is to insure health and survival but it is to enable well-being.” This communicates the goal for all engaging in the practice of medicine. This book is not for shy, sensitive or frail as it's an honest and blatantly truthful aperçu of what is/was observed by Dr. Gawande in geriatric medicine today. Educational and somber. Must read for all physicians. Buy and keep Kleenex on stand-by."
170,0805095152,http://goodreads.com/user/show/10312986-lyn-elliott,5,"We all want to live independent lives but as we age we are likely to lose at least some elements of that independence. This is easy to acknowledge, not so easy to come to terms with and certainly not easy to prepare for.Gawande's book is essential reading for anyone who is ageing themselves, or for anyone caring for somebody who is ill or frail enough to be approaching a state of dependency. Reading this has helped me to be aware of the questions I need to ask myself and those I care about. You can't ever assume you know what someone else really wants to do with their lives as they become dependent, or as they near death.How can you live well till the end, avoiding medically institutionalised interactions, treatments and living space? I wish I had read this before my parents became frail and certainly well before their last illnesses. This was an unusual book club choice, but then it's a great group of women. Not a wimp amongst us. "
171,0805095152,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2375838-cheryl,5,"There is a long phase in the first parts of our lives where, if we are lucky enough to have avoided critical disease or injury, we are blithely unaware of the effects of aging and of the inevitability of death. It seems so far ahead in the future as to be imaginary. Like imagining what a trillion dollars is like. You know that is a real thing, but still…it seems impossible to know what it really is. The other day I said to my teenage daughter, “Just imagine, in only forty years from now you will be standing in the kitchen with your partner and asking the same questions I’m asking now, like “When can we retire and go do what we really want?” “ She snorted. “Forty years? That’s ages from now!” And I’m saying, “no, forty years isn’t long at all! You will be planning your retirement!”She doesn’t really believe it.I sort of wish I had that back again. Those days of childhood, adolescence, young adulthood, where we never gave a thought to retirement, to aging, to death. Later on in life, we end up sometimes dwelling too much on those things, as if to make up for our inattention earlier. Nowadays, I sometimes feel hyper-aware of the universality of disease, the effects of aging, and shuffling off the mortal coil. It is unavoidable - I stare at it through the microscope daily as a pathologist. I often wonder which of those diseases that we hand out like playing cards will be the one dealt to me. “There’s no escaping the tragedy of life., which is that we are all aging from the day we are born… This experiment of making mortality a medical experience is just decades old. And the evidence is it is failing.”“Our reluctance to honestly examine the experience of aging and dying has increased the harm we inflict on people and denied them the basic comforts they most need.”The chapters of the book follow the course of our lives, and are richly illustrated with examples from Gawande’s own family and from his medical practice. Their stories are woven through the book, providing compelling and touching portraits. They are us. We are independent beings who are increasingly living longer and living independently longer.But ‘Things Fall Apart.’ “The culprit is just the accumulated crumbling of one’s bodily systems while medicine carries out its maintenance measures and patch jobs""“Human beings fail the way all complex systems fail: randomly and gradually…as the defects in a complex system increase, the time comes when just one more defect is enough to impair the whole, resulting in the condition known as frailty. It happens to power plants, cars, and large organizations. And it happens to us: eventually, one too many joints are damaged, one too many arteries calcify. There are no more backups. We wear down until we can’t wear down anymore.”So gradually, as the losses accumulate, we become Dependent. We need increasing amounts of Assistance, often in the form of retirement or nursing homes. These tend to provide an institutionalized life — that is not a good life, it’s just as good as can be got in the circumstances. But that robs us of our autonomy and our ability to make choices and to shape the story of our life in the world. “Whatever the limits and travails we face, we want to retain the autonomy—the freedom—to be the authors of our lives. This is the very marrow of being human” New models of care are evolving though, so people like 94 year old Lou are “…still able to live in a way that made him feel that he still had a place in this world.” I found this chapter particularly encouraging. The chapters on Letting Go and Hard Conversations are thoughtful, valuable discussions not only for clinical physicians, nurses and other members of the health care team, but also for anyone — patient, family, friend — who has reached that place where the end of life is in sight. “Technological society has forgotten what scholars call the “dying role” and its importance to people as life approaches its end. People want to share memories, pass on wisdoms and keepsakes, settle relationships, establish their legacies, make peace with God, and ensure that those who are left behind will be okay. They want to end their stories on their own terms.”Finally, Courage. “At least two kinds of courage are required in aging and sickness. The first is the courage to confront the reality of mortality—the courage to seek out the truth of what is to be feared and what is to be hoped.” We need the courage to act on the truth we find. One has to decide whether one’s fears or one’s hopes are what should matter most.This was a profoundly enriching book. It should be required reading for all health care professionals who work with seriously ill patients, and for those who work with the aged, and for those who run our health care systems, and for those who have aging/ill parents/relatives, and for those who are embarking on those final passages, and in some ways especially for those who haven’t yet reached those phases, so that they will be better prepared. It is intelligent, rational, touching, and warmly profound. It is a classic. "
172,0805095152,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4146473-connie,5," I read this a while ago, and it is a book that comes up quite often in conversation, and one that I highly recommend. For medical students, Dr's, nurses, anyone who works in medicine, anyone with aging parents and quite frankly anyone who is aging. Pretty much everyone I know. When talking about it I realized that though I remember it well and recommend it I had never written a review. So here you go. One of the first chapters tells the story of the author when he was shadowing a family practitioner. An elderly woman came in with her main complaint of heart issues. She also commented on poor balance and the Dr noted weight loss. The young writer was confused when the Dr. asked her if she ate alone. More confusion when the physician commented on her pretty manicure, which the patient proudly said she did herself. When the doctor asked her to remove her shoes, the young student was even more perplexed. Came to be that the older physician realized she could not trim her toenails, and they were hurting in her shoes, causing her to change her gait...and at a risk for losing her balance and falling. Another concern was her weight loss, as she did not eat well due to eating alone. She was much frailer and he worried a fall may result in a broken hip or worse. He recommended a podiatrist and that her family try to eat several meals with her throughout the week. He told the young student that he could give medicine for the heart....but a fall with a break would cause much distress and change in her quality of life. This is the basis of this book. Physicians need to learn to look at the whole person, not just the complaint. So often we see a ""specialist"" whose focus is on what they specialize in, and they miss the other signs. Believe me, I have seen this happen. Yet I have also seen those who look at the big picture and those folks are the ones I would want to care for me. We are often so busy trying to live longer. Yet sometimes, or often it is the ""quality"" not the ""quantity"" of our lives that matter. This author delves into this issue with first hand knowledge of patients he has treated as well as his own family members. He admits how hard it is to step back and not always have to ""fix"" everything, but learn to listen to what is important to his patient. We can all learn this lesson. How do we picture the end of our lives? What do we really need to do to achieve that?  This is a book that makes you think about aging, aging in place and aging well. It makes you think about maintaining dignity. I know I thought of this often with family members who were facing the end of life, and I often had to stop and listen to what it was that was important to them, not to me. I only hope that someone allows me that same choice."
173,0805095152,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7958239-elizabeth-theiss,5,"When is it time to stop fighting disease and death, and work instead on the best quality of life possible? Gawande has given us a wise and thoughtful discussion of how to approach the question, one I found helpful and convincing.As always Gawande uses stories to demonstrate the problems attendant to the medicalization of death. Doctors are trained to treat death as the enemy, not death as the inevitable. In an effort to forestall the inevitable, doctors' use every available tool from invasive surgeries to brutal successive chemo therapies that leave patients, that is, people, lingering in pain. As in The Checklist Manifesto, Gawande's solution is simple, a short set of questions that doctors should ask patients nearing the end of their lives. The conversation centers around what is most important to the person; what immediate goals are central; and what trade-offs between length of life and quality of life a person is willing to make. Gawande's ideas about nursing homes as places to avoid are spot on as well. His description of these ""homes"" driven by staff's needs for cookie cutter treatment of residents From assembly line pill dispensing to early morning shower times are downright depressing. We just sprang my husband from a month in a nursing home and it was exactly as described. But alternatives do exist, some better than others. The key seems to be finding a place that allows individual autonomy and provides support for quality of life. The one element ignored here is the cost of this kind of support; it is out of the reach of most people who need it and not supported by Medicare, despite the fact that it is less expensive than a traditional nursing home. My father was fortunate to live out the last two years of his life in a truly wonderful care center with a home-like environment, a small number of house mates, and home cooked meals each night. Gawande made me think we should just tear down the old ones and start over.I have spent a good deal of time thinking about these questions and problems as I helped my father through Alzheimer's and my spouse through 23 years of Parkinson's disease. Gawande has it exactly right and I'm hoping Being Mortal is a best seller so doctors and everyone else benefits from his perspective on what a good life and a good death means."
174,0805095152,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1608124-dana-stabenow,5,"I give this book five stars not because I loved it but because it is what I would call a necessary read, and I mean necessary for everyone, young, old, medical professional and laity alike. It's about That Conversation, what Gawande calls in one chapter ""Hard Conversations."" The subject is how we want to live out the end of our life.Gawande is a surgeon and one of the best parts of this book is that he is learning how to have this conversation himself. He's learning how to do it as a medical professional with his patients, and he's not shy about telling us where and how he has screwed up. He is also learning how to do it as a son to his father, also a surgeon, who has been diagnosed with a rare spinal tumor.The difficulty, he writes, is that in the last fifty years we have learned how to prolong life.As recently as 1945, most deaths occurred in the home. By the 1980s, just 17 percent did...Across not just the United States but also the entire industrialized world, the experience of advanced aging and death has shifted to hospitals and nursing homes...You don't have to spend much time with the elderly or those with terminal illness to see how often medicine fails the people it is supposed to help...Our reluctance to honestly examine the experience of aging and dying has increased the harm we inflict on people and denied them the basic comforts they most need.Later he writes You'd think people would have rebelled. You'd think we would have burned the nursing homes to the ground.But we haven't, and new discoveries and better medical practice mean that citizens of industrialized nations are living longer, healthier lives. ""A life,"" Gawande writes, ""designed to be safe but empty of anything they care about."" The trick now is to make sure our aging populations are not just safe, or even--heresy! sacrilege!--not safe at all, but living a life that achieves quality of life, not just quantity. The good news is, things are changing. (He doesn't say so but you know it has everything to do with the Boomers, a generation now making decisions for their parents, and who will soon be making those decisions--or not--for themselves.) Keren Brown Wilson built the first assisted living facility in Oregon in 1980, and when that concept became bastardized people like Dr. Tom Wilson revolutionized an assisted living facility with two dogs, four cats, 100 parakeets and child care for employees that brought children back into the lives of the inmates (using that word deliberately, as Gawande does himself). Researchers studied the effects of this program over two years, comparing a variety of measures for Chase's residents with those of residents at another nursing home nearby. Their study found that the number of prescriptions required per resident fell to half that of the control nursing home. Psychotropic drugs for agitation, like Haldol, decreased in particular. The total drug costs fell to just 38 percent of the comparison facility. Deaths fell 15 percent.From inmates locked away from life, warehoused until they died, Dr. Wilson's patients became once again members of a community. And as Gawande goes on to say, this experiment and others like it are beginning all across the nation.There is also Hospice, which organization Gawande's father chooses to help him through the end of his life with palliative care. For Hospice, it's all about making the end of each individual story as valuable to them as is physically possible for them. It's impossible to say enough good things about Hospice and Gawande doesn't stint them here. (Full disclosure: I already support Hospice and this book is making me double that support this year.) I know it sounds a little macabre, but this is the one book you really should read. Make a teenager read it and they will understand that much more about what Grandma is going through. Make a Millennial read it and he'll understand in spades how important that retirement plan is and how they should start one now. Make your doctor read it and she'll see how important first asking those essential questions is, ""What do you want? What is most important to you?"" instead of automatically reaching for the scalpel or the drugs. ""Death,"" writes Gawandeis normal. Death may be the enemy, but it is also the natural order of things. I knew these truths abstractly, but I didn't know them concretely--that they could be truths not just for everyone but also for this person right in front of me, for this person I was responsible for.Me, either. Now I feel like I do. Read this book, and recommend it to everyone you know. It is very frank, very well written, and actually? Kind of hopeful.****See also on Vox, ""2015 is the year America started having a sane conversation about death,"" http://www.vox.com/2015/12/16/1011744...."
175,0805095152,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3897817-morgan-blackledge,5,"This is a heart wrenchingly moving and important book. It speaks directly to our cultures strained and distant relationship to aging, the elderly, death and dying. Rarely if ever have I heard a medical clinician speak with such vulnerability and humility about the limits of modern medicine.French cultural theorist and urbanist Paul Virilio observed, with every invention or technical advance, an equally powerful disaster is co-created, for example, when we invented the locomotive, we simultaneously invented the train wreck.In a sense, Being Mortal is Dr. Atul Gawande's analogous observation about the incredible benefits of advanced medicine and the unprecedented opportunities for prolonged suffering and denial it affords us. I'm so grateful to be alive in this time, and science and technology have everything to do with that. Ordinary people have never had as much freedom to pursue knowledge or self expression as we currently enjoy.Advanced medicine is central to the high standard of living we currently have. It prolongs our lives and reduces suffering in many ways that we completely take for granted. But in a real sense, our faith in technology and medical advances has lulled us to sleep on some of life's most important and philosophical, psychological, and spiritual issues. Those of impermanence, suffering, loss and mortality.Our culture does a phenomenal job of keeping death and suffering out of plain sight. This affords the individuals facing these challenges the privacy and professional care that most people chose if given the option.This represents a real advance. But the equally powerful disaster that accompanies this advance is not trivial. The fact that most of us now live the majority of our lives insulated from the reality of death and dying means that we are quite likely to be utterly naive and under developed in this important existential domain.Frankly speaking, these are difficult and unsightly truths most of us would rather defer encountering. In the short term we enjoy the bliss that ignorance affords, but in the long term we suffer the numerous negative consequences that accompany the unexamined life.This book is attempting to address this issue by presenting us with a sober but empathetic and even optimistic view of the end of the road. Highly recommended, five stars."

178,0805095152,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4342402-tl,5,"See Caroline's review here:https://www.goodreads.com/review/show... (her review convinced me to pick this up)----She says it all beautifully so I will add my thoughts here (this'll be fairly short mostly cause my head hurts right now).This book brings up topics most of us don't think about when we are young. It seems too far away to contemplate so we put it out of our minds. Sure, we may talk about it time to time with our loved ones but how many of give it serious thought until something happens, let alone what questions to ask?The subject matter is a bit weighty in here but never felt dry or boring. There's feeling and passion  here. Gawande transports you into what he is talking about, like you are sitting with him at his kitchen table. The personal stories and histories he shares throughout the book were in turns touching and very informative. Of the former, a few had me tearing up and wanting to hug them all. The latter fascinated me, as I didn't know how those things all came about (one of those ""it has always been around"" that you just don't explore further) .I agreed with him on alot of the things he said and it got me thinking about my wishes on the future as well. Hopefully this will help with the hard conversation in the future (even though we wish we could live forever).This is an important book that should be on the bookshelves of everyone, in my humble opinion. Highly recommended.(Excuse any errors, typing on my phone)Narrator: Five starsBonus interview with the author was a nice touch."
179,0805095152,http://goodreads.com/user/show/28602001-emma,5,"An incredible book, but one that has the potential to cause considerable distress.‘Being Mortal’ is a book that addresses the experience of dying in modern society and questions whether we are getting it right. Chapters 1-5 focus primarily on mortality and the diverse nature of the end of life care provided for the elderly. Chapters 6-8 deal more specifically with how those with serious or terminal illnesses, and their families, cope with the process of dying. In these later chapters, the stories related by Gawande are frequently those in which the suffering and death of individuals is caused by cancer, including that of his own father. Though dying is an event that eventually comes to us all, it is a subject that is inherently difficult to address. In talking about our mortality, each person must confront not only the idea of their own death, but that of those who matter to them. It is entirely understandable that people choose to avoid discussing it. Yet Gawande’s book shows why it is important for everybody to stop putting aside the conversation about dying; that, in fact, refusing to tackle death until it is right upon you can lead to much greater pain and suffering. It is at this point when medical intervention takes over, often at the expense of compassion. Medical professionals would do well to read this book as part of their training and development, if only to understand how important honest communication can be to patient outcomes. They are only human, and as such, may feel as awkward about such matters as the rest of us, but they have a duty to provide accurate/truthful information about an individual’s illnesses/conditions so that they can have realistic expectations. Gawande argues that instead of defaulting to the most aggressive form of medical intervention, it is more important to talk to the individual about their goals, what is most important to them, what they can and can’t live with, what their fears and concerns are, what trade offs they are willing to make. Through discussion, a better path can be found for those who may be in pain or who are coming to the end of their life. Such conversations are necessarily incredibly difficult but Gawande highlights the benefits of having a plan put together by the individual, their family, and the medical professionals in collaboration; it is this honest dialogue that will allow an individual to manage their illness and the end of their life in a way that suits their needs. Gawande’s argument is empowering, it promotes the active role of the individual as the centre of their care and what happens to them. Within each chapter, Gawande often addresses what has happened in the past, what is happening now (including in different parts of the world), how people are trying to change things, and what the focus for the future should be. This plan means that the book is not depressing; it highlights the failures but injects positivity by showing ways in which things are being improved, or can/should be improved. At no point does Gawande fall into pessimism, he believes that while the majority of systems and institutions may not be meeting the needs of individuals right now, there is a chance that more of them will do so in the future. The book is his way of showing the difference between what is, and what should be, including examples of people and places that are getting it right. Importantly, Gawande is not prescriptive. He does not say ‘this is THE way to do things’, instead he shows how different solutions are being implemented. The variety of solutions reflect the multitude of differing ways people want and need to approach their ill health, old age, and death.       ‘Being Mortal’ is incredibly difficult to review. Given that I agree with Gawande, it would be easy to say that everyone should read this book. Yet in saying that, it feels like I am telling people that they need to deal with the idea of their death as soon as possible and, if they are currently unwell, that they should open a dialogue with their doctor to plan how they want it to proceed. It sounds more challenging when phrased this way, and is it not truly understandable that someone may not want to deal with the idea of their death by calmly talking through the steps? At the same time, I fundamentally believe Gawande’s argument that honest communication is the way forward for those who are living with terminal illness. Perhaps this is because I would rather make my own decisions while I can, and not leave them for others, who may have to guess what I might want in emergency situations if I hadn’t made my thoughts clear. The role of friends and family as support network seems intrinsically opposed to making these hard choices, the love and hope with which these decisions are made might not be compatible with the path I would want. Neither, perhaps, would the medical intervention. In modern society, people have become a medical problem to be solved, they must be ‘made safe’, increasingly separated from the rest of society and even from themselves, thereby removing any chance at individuality or choice. The problem is exacerbated by the disconnection between what medicine can do and what it should do. Gawande treats the grave and emotive subject matter with respect and conviction. At the end of someone’s life, or as they cope with ill health, he wants people to be able to have choices, to focus on what’s important to the , and to be supported in those goals by everyone around them. This is what I will hope for. "

It is challenging, emotional, difficult ... and a spectacular journey along a path we will all follow. As we face the inevitable, Gawande gives us a framework within which to consider the options we may have, the choices we might want to make, and the medical and/or other assistance we may or may not desire. His thoughtful discussion of the people he has accompanied through their dying days, including his father, provides much to stimulate our own thoughts. The central theme is that these decisions should be, to the maximum possible extent, the patient's, with family and medical input, and not the other way around. In Gawande's experience that process, difficult and uncertain as it may be, yields the best results for all those involved."
181,0805095152,http://goodreads.com/user/show/10770371-dan,5,"Being Mortal by Atul GawandeGawande, as a surgeon, steps us through the reality of life’s waning moments. There is a heavy focus on cancer and old age and decisions around hospice care. Not easy subject matter but very useful information. I didn’t get choked up until the end of the book when the author takes us through the last few months of his father’s life as he battled cancer. The US is different from nearly all other countries in the world in how we deal with the elderly. As Americans we don’t live with aging parents and by extension a significant percentage of the elderly are put into retirement homes when they can no longer maintain independence. Gawande points out that our bodies are like machines and quite literally wear out. Most end of life situations spend a great deal of time on pain management and medications and often in the waning days, an inability to digest food.Some interesting facts. “By the age of sixty, people in an industrialized country like the United States have lost, on average, a third of their teeth. After eighty-five, almost 40 percent have no teeth at all.”Philip Roth said “Old age is not a battle. Old age is a massacre.”Gawande also discusses Do Not Resuscitate directives. There is part of a chapter where he recalls interning at a Boston area hospital. On one night he forgets that a patient had signed a DNR. When the patient goes into cardiac arrest, it sets in motion the CPR team to come revive the patient. When Gawande realizes his mistake and tries to call it off he is pushed aside. When the revival effort fails he is tongue lashed by the CPR team. The author feels very strongly about the value of hospice care. Almost everyone, if given the choice, would choose to die at home versus the hospital but the latter situation is still the norm. Sometimes because others have to make the medical decisions when the elderly become incapacitated. 4.5 stars. The writing here is easy to follow and the stories are quite compelling. There is also a lot of practical advice. The book was published in 2014. Highly recommended."
182,0805095152,http://goodreads.com/user/show/8079403-max,5,"This is an important book, whether you are approaching old age or family or friends you care about are. It set my mind spinning thinking how I would deal with the situations Gawande describes. Coming face to face with one’s decline and death is at least depressing and can be terrifying. Gawande points out that the medical profession and most of our institutions are not designed to deal with the human problem. He identifies a number of changes that could be made at a policy level that would improve things. But the fundamental problem is knowing ourselves and communicating our wishes or helping loved ones to reflect and do the same. Gawande points to helpful experiences with hospice care, but we must first make that decision. My notes follow.Gawande explains how growing old has changed and how we in developed countries have adjusted or failed to adjust to it. As the twentieth century wore on medicine made great advances and people’s life spans increased significantly. At the beginning of the century people would stay relatively healthy as they aged until they met a devastating disease, say the flu or cancer or heart disease. These would usually kill people rather quickly and they would die in their homes near friends and family. Now modern medicine fixes most of these problems, at least temporarily, so as people age their health ratchets down step by step. Eventually many of us will be unable to care for ourselves while the doctors keep us alive. There are in home services available and assisted living facilities for those who can afford them. But for the average person without significant savings this is a serious financial as well as personal dilemma and too often ends with a person’s final days spent in an impersonal nursing home.Both medical care for the elderly and institutional care suffer from the same problem – task orientation rather than people orientation. Doctors are trained to fix your issue and keep you alive, not evaluate the impact on your overall quality of life. Similarly institutions for the elderly are designed to meet set goals: To keep you safe, ensure you get your medications, get you fed, keep you clean, etc. The staff is rated on these things and focus on them, but they create an environment their residents typically hate. And of course many institutions don’t meet even basic standards. So the modern way of growing old often means becoming disabled enough to have to leave your home with little choice but to share a room with a stranger in an institutional environment. Gawande paints a grim picture of our future, but he also points to people trying to change things. These people are focused more on care than treatment. The woman who pioneered assisted living was looking for an alternative to the nursing home, not a stepping stone as it too often is. Others have tried to change the focus of nursing homes to enrich the lives of the residents through measures that allow more autonomy to the residents and less regimentation. The design of nursing homes can make them seem more like real homes and less like institutions. The more residents can participate, have choices, have outside interests, the better they will feel and do. Efficiency and safety have to be balanced against their effect on the patient’s quality of life. Throughout life we take reasonable chances to get more out of living. Why should that stop when time becomes short, when it is most precious?Gawande discusses terminal illness and the inevitable decision of whether to stop treatment. Doctors tend not to be helpful. They give choices of your treatment options. That is their job. But today there is hospice and palliative care. When is this a reasonable choice? The decision is personal. Doctors and family can’t really make it which is why drawing out the feelings of the patient is so important. From Gawande’s examples there is clearly a point in which treatment does more harm than good. We all want to die with some dignity and as little pain as possible. We all would rather die in a bed where we can say goodbye to friends and family rather than on a respirator in an ICU. But it is difficult to give up hope that the next procedure might work or buy us significant time. The decision is a tradeoff to achieve some quality of life at the end. Gawande talks about his own father’s case. His father, also a doctor, had terminal cancer and was facing paralysis. It took what Gawande calls the hard conversation to make the decision to accept hospice and the inevitable. In a testimony to the notion that the most sophisticated doctor may not be the best choice to initiate this conversation, Gawande’s father’s feelings were skillfully drawn out by a small town nurse practitioner from the local hospice. She was interested in him, his problems as he saw them, not in the disease and its treatment."
183,0805095152,http://goodreads.com/user/show/9049915-james-barker,5,"It is commonly phrased that we battle illness. But this remarkable book by Atul Gawande points out that it is an ill-thought battle and, dare I say it, an ill-fought one.For the last three years of my wonderful mother’s life I was her carer. Coping with the advanced stages of multiple sclerosis she was mostly restricted to her bed (which was in fact a hospital bed delivered to our family home along with all the other paraphernalia of sickness), permanently catheterised, unable to walk or do anything for herself. Mom also had severe dementia and often mistook me for my recently-deceased Dad. As an immersive carer I managed a team of women who assisted me in the day with my mother’s personal care. The rest of the time I sat with her, or fed her, or tried to unblock her catheter (while going out of my mind), or sang with her. Naturally, the last activity was the most enjoyable. Despite her dementia, Mom had a seemingly inexhaustible trove of perfectly-remembered lyrics in her head. We sang Doris Day songs, the Bellamy Brothers, the Beautiful South, the Beatles, Tori Amos, the Hollies, Cyndi Lauper, the Mama and Papas, Simon and Garfunkel, ABBA, songs from musicals. Even new songs she had only heard once we tackled together. Somehow she remembered these lyrics too.But 16 months before Mom passed away she developed septicaemia and was rushed into hospital. Her organs were shutting down, her pulse was weak and fading fast. We were told her quality of life was so bad, her disability so extreme, that the hospital was to offer no treatment- it would be kinder to let her go.We didn’t. I won’t go into the whys and wherefores of that decision but at least one of my sisters- who had driven in terror the 150 miles from where she lived- thought that letting go would be an idea we should not entertain and I wavered, full of love for this extraordinary woman who had been the life and soul of any party when I was growing up, rock and rolling on the dance floor, full of fast wit and laughter that was infectious in its affirmation of life. The doctor in charge asked me for one piece of evidence that suggested my mother had any quality of life at all. We sing every day- we sing together all the time, I said. So he treated her and somehow, over 7 long and painful weeks, she became well enough to be sent back home and into my care.But what did this ‘well enough’ mean? Mom was no longer capable of swallowing so had had a peg inserted into her stomach. I was trained in the art of its upkeep- everyday the wound needed to be cleaned and the peg rotated 360 degrees (otherwise it would fuse to her skin). Any strength Mom had had in her arms had gone. To all intents and purposes she was incapable of moving anything but her head (a fraction), her eyes and mouth. But by and large Mom slept, in a virtual coma that meant our daily songs felt like a golden time remembered and grieved from the perspective of a new time of horrors. Three days after returning home and in a fever caused by kidney stones that were trying to be passed (another tier of Hell) Mom whispered to me, “I have had enough.”But of course it didn’t end there. Mom stayed in a limbo of pain and half-consciousness for well over another year. She would emit blood-curdling screams when being cleaned, when being moved, but she did not sing. Fed a noxious mixture through a machine, one of the few joys she had had left (sucking on a piece of chocolate or enjoying slow mouthfuls of a home-cooked dinner) had gone. It struck me sitting beside her that we had consigned her to an exit that was barbarous and devoid of love. All I could do was ensure she was as comfortable as possible and that, on the occasions she was awake, she could see that I was there, smiling at her and telling her I loved her more than the world.When the end time came we were told on three separate occasions that today was the day. But a little woman of 5’2”, ranked a Zero by hospital doctors when her ability was assessed, she defied every professional speculation and breathed on another day, then another, then another. When she died in November 2012, a few weeks shy of her 68th birthday, I have truly never seen such peace on a face.In the last year of her life Mom had been well enough on a handful of occasions to wake and smile at me and sing with me. One of these occasions I captured on video. We sit together, smiling, singing ‘Zip A Dee Doo Dah,’ (my oh my what a wonderful day) and she tells me she loves me. An exquisite moment that I am glad I captured. But was it really worth the 16 months of Hell she went through?Atul Gawande’s book is all about acceptance of our mortality. But it is about much more than that. Modern medicine has it wrong, he says. It is about preserving life at all costs- battle for a year through procedure after procedure rather than enjoy your remaining months of life at the best possible quality. Yes, it turns out the emergency room where my mother ended up in 2011 made the right call and we did not. But, by and large, if you have a life-limiting prognosis with a disease such as cancer you will be offered all sorts of treatments to extend that life at the detriment of its quality.But this is also a book about the way the elderly are treated in the industry of care homes and sheltered housing. With all meaning to life removed, with all responsibility removed, people become shells of their former selves, depressed and longing for the death that the (questionable) care they are receiving is preventing. Visionary projects from the 1970s- with more pets in care homes, with pairs of birds in every room for residents to have a vested interest in looking after, with children of staff visiting, filling the emptiness with the joy of activity, of noise- show that it is possible for care homes to be places of life rather than death. But it takes more effort to achieve this, more resources. More determination to give the elderly a life worth enjoying. And so, of course, such ideas largely fall by the wayside, because in a capitalist world the elderly are a drain on life, on resources... which is frankly sickening.I cannot stress enough how important this book is. It was, at times, a painful read for me, and that will be the case for anyone who has lost someone in a medicalised nightmare of end-time. But you owe it to yourself to understand what best befits you when your time comes. You owe it to yourself to choose your own ending. This book arms you with the knowledge to make the right decision, however painful that is.As for my mother.. after 3 touch and go trips to the hospital in the last year of her life I spoke to my sisters and told them it all came down to what we felt Mom would prefer- to die at home or have more and more (hopeless) treatment at hospital, where it was inevitable that one day she would happen to die. We agreed that just as my father had passed away at home, surrounded by people who loved him, our mother deserved the same. It was the best decision we made. She passed on in her home of 40 years held by those she loved and surrounded by their voices. She died in peace."
184,0805095152,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6468566-jennifer,2,"2.5 stars. Gawande has about three major points in this book, all of which were made in a news magazine article he wrote for the Atlantic: 1, We should have tough conversations with those in our lives about their vision for their end-of-life; 2, Doctors should also have these conversations with their patients; and 3, If we have these conversations, we can shift medicine and end-of-life care away from a stave-off-death model and towards a model that promotes humanity, autonomy, and dignity for the dying (and thus no longer need institutional nursing homes). I do not disagree, but the book itself is heavy on anecdotes and light on actual research or policy analysis.My major stylistic critique is that Gawande buries his three points in pages of anecdotes about patients and memories of his own father's decline and death. I'm not being unsympathetic to the suffering of these colorful characters (and Gawande's own personal suffering), but I found the anecdotes long-winded, distracting, and ultimately boring. Gawande intended them to have emotional impact for the reader, but for me, the stories smacked of filling pages for the pure commercial gain of selling a book. My major substantive critique is that Gawande spends too little time on policy, instead championing the heroism of individual doctors, caregivers, and entrepreneurs-- as if the system can be saved by some brave individuals. He is far too sanguine about the difficulty of changing institutions at the macro-level. Yes, Gawande mentions that these alternative living arrangements and alternative therapeutic approaches save money in the long run, but most of the initiatives Gawande covers were developed by private entrepreneurs, not governments (though some government funds may have been made available in the form of grants). Dramatic policy change would be needed to scale and fund these initiatives at the state or federal level, and I do not see the current vested interests in the healthcare lobby supporting these changes (nor does Gawande provide a path for fighting for policy change, besides mentioning the cost-effectiveness argument). The one scale-able initiative that Gawande discusses, Hospice, already exists-- but Gawande ignores that Hospice's ranks are often filled with low-skilled, under-paid, and over-worked caregivers who are hardly in the position to give the attentive, individualized care that Gawande received for his father. Gawande is also too sanguine about the role of socioeconomic class, which is perhaps why his friends and his patients receive such excellent care. He is wrapped in a bubble of privilege -- access to the top surgeons and the most committed nurses. True, some of the alternative homes that Gawande mentions do take Medicaid, but these homes are so few that they have waitlists that are hundreds of names long. The type of ""better death"" that Gawande argues for so eloquently is available only to the wealthiest or the most educated (those empowered to fight the system and search for better options). Without a serious treatment of the nexus between healthcare policy, quality of life, and socioeconomic status, this book seems to me squarely in the realm of theory, not practice. "
185,0805095152,http://goodreads.com/user/show/929238-hbalikov,5,"This is an excellent book. It is also the most important book that I have read in the past year.Dr. Gawande is that rare physician who can write well and write well for the layman. There is nothing glamorous about growing old. There is nothing glamorous in taking care of those who are growing old. As to the former, Gawande, makes it clear as he describes the way our bodies decline and breakdown over time. As to the later, it helps to explain both why very few doctors are attracted to gerontology and why those who aren't are not particularly adept at dealing with those who are at or near the end of their lives. This book is about ""what matters in the end,"" but it is also about Gawande's journey as a physician and surgeon. ""I never expected that among the most meaningful experiences I'd have as a doctor --- and, really, as a human being --- would come from helping others deal with what medicine cannot do as well as what it can.""Atul Gawande is meticulous in describing how we wear down and wear out. ""There is, he told me, 'no single, common cellular mechanism to the aging process.'....The process is gradual and unrelenting."" And, how many of us believe that we can put that aside for the present. ""People naturally prefer to avoid the subject of their decrepitude."" Yet, it colors many things that we do and many decisions that we have to make. In his own learning process, Gawande shares his experiences, and his encounters with doctors, other care givers and physicians. ""The job of any doctor, Bludau later told me, is to support quality of life, by which he meant two things: as much freedom from the ravages of disease as possible and the retention of enough function for active engagement in the world. Most doctors treat disease and figure that the rest will take care of itself.""He exposes a lot of the ""nursing home approach"" as insensitive with facilities that may come to resemble an asylum (in the worst sense). He explores the question, ""what makes life worth living when we are old and frail and unable to care for ourselves,"" is its many facets. There are: basic needs for survival; need for love and belonging; desire for growth (""the opportunity to attain personal goals, to master knowledge and skills, and to recognized and rewarded for our achievements); and, perhaps, ""self-fulfillment through pursuit or moral ideals and creativity for their own sake."" He points out that ""our driving motivations in life, instead of remaining constant, change hugely over time...""I learned a lot about how we often treat those who cannot care entirely for themselves and how attitudes and venues are changing. When doctors are just about ""tinkering"" with the seriously ill, a lot is ignored. Particularly, that those people ""have priorities (perhaps poorly expressed or not discussed) besides prolonging their lives. Surveys find that their top concerns include avoiding suffering, strengthening relationships with family and friends, being mentally alert, not being a burden to others, and achieving a sense that their life is complete.""I wish I had had this book to read before I found myself with friends and family members who were seriously ill or dying. Gawande describes how both amateur and professional caregivers can be sensitive to these issues. And, how they can give the ill and dying the opportunity to reflect on their own desires. One of those, for many, is that they would rather spend their remaining days at home instead of in an institution. There is a very illuminating section on hospice and how this should be explored far earlier than it currently is. Not necessarily invoking hospice care earlier, but being aware of what if can offer and, if desired, getting it going in time to make a difference with quality of life.""(Though), no one ever really has control. Physics and biology and accident ultimately have their way in our lives. But the point is that we are not helpless either. Courage is the strength to recognize BOTH realities. We have room to act, to shape our stories, though as time goes on it is within narrower and narrower confines. A few conclusions become clear when we understand this: that our most cruel failure in how we treat the sick and the aged is the failure to recognize that they have priorities beyond merely being safe and living longer; that the chance to shape one's story is essential to sustaining meaning in life; that we have the opportunity to refashion our institutions, our culture, and our conversations in ways that transform the possibilities for the last chapters of everyone's lives."""
186,0805095152,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1067741-susan,5,"If you have aging/elderly parents whose care you might someday be involved in, or expect to care for someone with a terminal condition, you cannot afford to miss this book. In his effortlessly lucid prose, Gawande comes to terms with the medical establishment's failure in providing end-of-life care. Too often, doctors work to fix what's broken in the service of extending life, without considering how quality of life is compromised, inflicting even more suffering as a result. He extols the value of hospice and palliative care, whose aim is not to give up on patients, but to provide as many good days as possible in the inevitable slide to death. He advocates asking difficult questions with patients and loved ones to determine what can bring meaning and value to them, even in the harsh narrowing of life's possibilities brought on by failing bodies and minds. He does not exempt himself from this critique -- instead he offers personal stories, iike those of his father and his daughter's piano teacher, to show how he came to understand the necessity of these important discussions and the possibilities they offer. It's moving, and timely, and despite the less-than-cheerful subject matter, never a burden to read (a testament to his writerly skill). I can't recommend this book highly enough to anyone who will face these issues -- and we all most likely will, in some form."
187,0805095152,http://goodreads.com/user/show/47188780-kathleen,5,"•	This is an important book for all who have elderly parents that are struggling with end-of-life health issues. Dr. Gawande personalizes the key issues through individual case histories, but he backs up his arguments with solid statistics. First, our society does not have enough gerontologists to serve our aging population, and our medical schools are cutting back on training new ones. More importantly, medical doctors tend to want to solve medical problems. And often, that results in them not recognizing, or even asking, what is important to their patient’s quality of life. The elderly want to live in ‘a home’, not an institution. They want to feel in control of their lives as much as possible. Safety is less of a concern to them than independence. Privacy is important too. They tend to want their own space, with furniture from their own home. They want to be able to turn on the television when and at what volume they want. These needs are not compatible with institutional long-term care facilities. So, new options are being explored—particularly in the United States. Highly recommend."

 This right here is the theme of Atul Gawande's Being Mortal: Medicine and What Matters in the End. This incredible piece of medical/science nonfiction starts out by introducing historical and cultural norms for caring for our elders and how this has significantly shifted in many societies. Mr. Gawande does not pass judgement but presents the observations and facts so we the reader may have an objective view which starts a journey of perspective. And when we view the world from another perspective, self-examination takes place, thus change. I absolutely loved this book. Many books I have been reading lately have been all about timing it seems. Last year, I watched both my grandfathers die (within 3 days of each other) and this year I am really beginning to take note of my parents and in-law's escalating aging. I guess chronic diseases, strokes, and fickle organs will do that to you. Like many self-centered Americans, I have been looking at the process in terms of what it means for me. How will my life change as they become more and more dependent on me? This book. This book! My perspective and priorities are forever altered. It is about me, after all I am living my life, but it is also about them. They want to be the author of their own life just as much as I do and if I'm lucky, they will live long enough to require assistance with that. They didn't ask for these complications and they fear the loss of independence far more than I could ever begin to imagine. The true terror: that no one will care.Mr. Gawande stresses that end of life conversations are crucial and surprisingly liberating, not only as a son or daughter but as a medical provider. There is a sense of control even in the midst of very uncontrollable circumstances. Questions need to be asked and once answers are decided upon, fear and anxiety of all parties involved can relax a bit. Your wishes will be respected in terms of what a quality life means to you. In a world of nursing homes that might as well be classified as prisons, knowing that someone listens and cares about what you want (despite the options and risks) is priceless. Mr. Gawande draws from his personal experience with his father in this respect and I found these parts to be incredibly raw and emotional. I strongly recommend this book. But if you don't read it, please remember these questions for your loved ones: 

“Whenever serious sickness or injury strikes and your body or mind breaks down, the vital questions are the same: What is your understanding of the situation and its potential outcomes? What are your fears and what are your hopes? What are the trade-offs you are willing to make and not willing to make? And what is the course of action that best serves this understanding?”

 Ask questions, advocate as needed, and enjoy this short life with the people you love ♥My favorite quote:""This is what it means to have autonomy -- you may not control life's circumstances, but getting to be the author of your life means getting to control what you do with them.”"
189,0805095152,http://goodreads.com/user/show/83445-lisa-vegan,5,"This book is excellent. It’s accessible and always interesting. It’s one of those books that probably everybody should read. I’m thinking every physician should read it upon graduating from medical school or during their residency. I think that it’s an important book.I do disagree with him at times, though overall think what he says is spot on.The parts where I disagree are in two major areas: The main one is his reluctance about supporting widespread assisted suicide because he says in those places, palliative hospice care isn’t as advanced an offering. However, even with hospice, I’ve witnessed horrible suffering, unbearable suffering, and it seems rare that people have none of that in their last days and weeks. I think both assisted suicide and competent hospice should always be options. I think not all hospices care works very well at all, though I know that some does. The other place I disagree is his contention that genetics isn’t as crucial to longevity as I think it is, especially in those families where so many live to over 100 and, I know by knowing them, that they often do not take at all good care of themselves, living in a way where others without their genes would die at much younger ages and with more infirmities before their deaths. The gist of what he says about quality of life when aged or with a terminal illness I agree with wholeheartedly though. A lot of what he says about that and examples he gives, makes the book fun to read. I really appreciated the several very personal stories, including his father’s story. So, not only do I not want to live until end stage cancer or ALS, etc. which I’ve always known, but I have no desire to get so old or sick that I can’t take care of myself – with my situation I wouldn’t end up at one of the good places and even those wouldn’t be great for me. These are issues I’ve thought about since about age 12, and I will do anything I can to avoid physical pain, nausea, shortness of breath, and other forms of suffering. Great book for getting readers to think about what they want when they’re elderly or have a life threatening illness, and also for having conversations about their wishes, and encouraging others in their lives to also share their wishes.The best thing about the book, and I wish 100% of medical people would get on board, is the weighing of what is worth it and not worth it to patients, and facing what medicine can’t do as well as what it can do. Not lying! Not evading! Not giving false hope! Allowing patients to take the lead with their own lives! Advocating that conversations should be had with the ill/elderly and doctors shouldn’t assume they know what should be done without knowing the patients’ goals and wishes for themselves. Early in the book, a death mentioned sounded exactly like my mother in 1964-1965 – I have to read that book! Books leading to other books…I'm still laughing about the 100 loose birds!!!"
190,0805095152,http://goodreads.com/user/show/632247-chrissie,3,"Before reading: I am reading this not because I want to but because I feel I ought to. Is it going to make me feel all horrible? I can accept this if it constructively explains what you can do to ""improve"" the end of life. In conclusion: I am glad I read the book, but it wasn’t particularly fun. There are many examples given of particular people, their illnesses and the difficulties they had, one being the author’s father. I didn’t understand all the medical terms used. Examples are given to illustrate the author’s conclusions on how medical care of the aging should be altered. The author, who is himself a surgeon, shows new, better alternatives and how they came to be. He does this by naming pioneers of better nursing homes, assisted care units and hospice development. For a person in the medical field I think this book is essential because it shows how medical changes need to be and can be implemented…., but I am not employed in the medical field and the historical developments, although interesting, were a bit extraneous for me. From my point of view, these sections could have been shortened, even if they do show the direction the author is supporting. One can ask, “Who is this book for?”In my family we have had several deaths in the past years. So the weaknesses coupled to end of life medical care, nursing homes and hospices were not new to me. I didn’t have to be told; I was not surprised in the least. What I wanted from this book were guidelines showing me how I could improve my husband’s and my own end of life. Did the book do this? Well, it made me face my own situation and what lay ahead. As a result of reading this book I will be looking into what alternatives are available here in Sweden when we are no longer able to manage alone. My husband and I have discussed exactly how we see the future. It has made clear to us that we value independence and that we want to stay where we are as long as possible – even if such living may be less safe than living near a hospital. We plan on looking in to Assisted Care Facilities that offer a gradual increase of care as needs increase. Do they have queues? Are they expensive? Where are they located? The essential point is that you have to know what you are looking for and that will be different for each family. So, yes, I am glad I read the book. It made me evaluate what is important to me – nature and independence and a dog and pretty landscape. The book pushed me to do this.  Another issue the book pushes you to evaluate is how long you want to extend the years of your life even if that time is filled with pain and discomfort. This too is a personal decision. The book guides you in what sort of questions you should ask your doctor, but of course some questions are specific to the illness one is coping with. Some conclusions are drawn that may be true for many, but not for my husband and I. Generally, most seem to want more contact with family as they age. This has its difficult sides too, and the book mentions this only briefly. I think more attention could have been devoted to this topic. While funeral wishes are important to discuss at life’s end, I found it unnecessary that the author discussed the details of his father’s funeral in this book.Practically nothing is said about how the elderly no longer want to travel. I may add that if you want to travel do it when you are young and fit. I am thankful to have traveled earlier in my life. The book is primarily concerned with American facilities, and practically nothing is said about costs. The audiobook is narrated by Robert Petkoff. It is read at a good speed. When good nursing facilities were being discussed he tended to sound SO enthused, SO exuberant. Really, I found this a bit childish. It doesn’t distort the text, but exaggerates how wonderful it all is. I could have done without this. The book has made me more appreciative of what I have. It has pushed my husband and me to evaluate which qualities of life we deem most important. With a clearer understanding of our preferences we can more easily deal with what lies ahead."
191,0805095152,http://goodreads.com/user/show/730754-ken,4,"Anyone who is planning on dying some day should read this book. It can be jumpy at times, but overall, Gawande's a straight shooting, no-nonsense writer who gives the straight dope on nursing homes, assisted living, hospice, and the heart-rending decisions we are all forced into at our end-of-days. As many of his accounts deal with cancer cases, it's a bit of a downer, but it's medicine to be taken and there's no better way to illustrate his point than through real-life examples, including his own father, who developed a fatal tumor in his spinal cord. God save us all from ends like this, but sorry, we all don't get to die suddenly and peacefully in our sleep.Among topics Gawande tackles: the dearth of geriatricians in this country. So ironic. So American. But the money is not there for doctors dedicated to our fastest growing demographic. Oh. And the preventative-style approach, the in-the-moment treatments needed to keep the elderly happy? Often not paid for by insurance companies, either.He also gets into nursing home/assisted living situations, focusing on the story of an upstate NY facility where a maverick doctor/director decided to introduce parakeets and live plants in every room as well as two cats and two dogs who had the run of the place. The nurses were thrown by this -- one refused to pick up a doggy mistake on the floor because that wasn't what she got a nursing license for -- but eventually everyone saw the seismic shift this simple yet dramatic change had on the previously-listless residents. The ""inmates"" (what they felt like, previously) started to perk up, tell people about the personalities of their parakeets, take a hand in caring for both plants and birds. Meanwhile, they became entranced with the wandering dogs and cats. Those patients who were ambulatory surprised the nurses by stepping up and volunteering to walk the dogs. The director had kids visit, too, providing training to middle schoolers on how to talk even with people with Alzheimer's. The young people's two or three visits a week became events to look forward to for the elderly residents, who, between pets and children, suddenly discovered purpose and felt more like human beings, more like they used to when they were living alone.There are other variations here, too, like assisted living purposely designed in pods of smaller units, created to look more like homes and less like institutions. Chief among the changes? Allowing people some privacy -- their own rooms. Giving them more leeway on what to do, when to eat. The schedules work around the people vs. vice versa.But the bulk of the book focuses on decisions and consequences. There are no definitive moves to make once a fatal disease begins its course, but Gawande shows that it's spinning a bit out of control in too many cases. The money being spent to prolong lives, often to make those lives so much more miserable just because people refuse to accept the oldest fact of life -- death -- is truly a scary thing. Modern medicine may be many things, but it is no match for Death, who remains undefeated. Still, there is a measure of victory to be had. For many people, that may mean a shorter but higher quality amount of time with family and friends. And, paradoxically, Gawande points to studies showing that many people who choose hospice care actually live longer than those who take the harsh and risky treatment road. They have less pain. They are happier. Together, these effects lead to slightly longer days with those they love. So, if you think hospice is a white flag, think again. It's not as simple as all that. Nor is this book. It's food for thought. Not that it will get any easier for you, the reader, when such choices visit you or your loved ones (and they will), but at least you'll have a better sense of balance and perspective. Can we ask for any more than that?"
192,0805095152,http://goodreads.com/user/show/275498-jim,5,"This is a brilliantly written book, and I was super-impressed with the genius of the good Dr Gawande right up to the point where he drank water out of the Ganges...I wouldn't do that at gunpoint! But while I might question the doc's wisdom in choice of beverages, I have to say he wrote a darn fine book.All of the occupants of this globe have a single thing in common...we will all die. Hopefully, we enjoy a long life and peaceful old age before our expiry date and, thanks to modern medicine and the care of good physicians, this is getting to be the reality for more people. This presents us with another problem: caring for a growing population of oldsters who require care as they ease their way into the hereafter. Families are getting smaller, so the progeny that would have cared for ailing seniors in the past are absent, or already employed. Expensive medical treatments are being employed to attempt to extend the lives of oldsters who would have slipped away without treatment, but at what cost? Frequently the result of this practice is that the medical treatment gives the patient an agonized existence suffering from side effects.Dr Gawande believes that, in most cases, if given a choice between having some quality time with loved ones or a possibly longer painful and befuddled existence under medical care, most people will choose the quality time even though it may be shorter. And here's another point to consider: Gawande has determined that 63% of doctors overestimate the amount of time a patient has to live, and that the better the doctor knows the patient, the more likely he/she will be to overestimate the patient's remaining time.Of interest to me was the fact that he basically confirmed an old homily my Granny used to toss out from time to time: ""A son is a son 'til he gets him a wife, but a daughter's a daughter for all of her life"". Here's what Dr Gawande had to say about the matter (from P. 79):  ""your chances of avoiding the nursing home are directly related to the number of children you have, and, according to what little research has been done, having at least one daughter seems to be crucial to the amount of help you will receive.""Naturally, one cannot always expect that sons and daughters will be able to care for them. Dr Gawande is firmly on the side of those who consult a palliative care specialist (From P.177):  ""The result; those who saw a palliative care specialist stopped chemotherapy sooner, entered hospice far earlier, experienced less suffering at the end of their lives - and they lived 25 percent longer. In other words, our decision making in medicine has failed so spectacularly that we have reached the point of actually inflicting harm on patients rather than confronting the subject of mortality.""This could have been a boring book...it wasn't. Dr Gawande has the gift of imparting information without making you feel like you are being tutored. A very interesting read, particularly for those of us who are around the last curve and racing toward the finish line."

194,0805095152,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5550397-britany,4,"Atul Gawande illustrates life as you age and how families must cope with aging parents.I appreciated learning about a topic that I knew little about previously. The difficulty of what to do with the aging population is an interesting and highly debatable (if not slightly depressing) topic. Gawande shares real life client stories, including his own family. This made this book relatable, who hasn't watched an elder age and eventually pass away. The best story was the one with the home that brought in dogs, cats, birds and plants. I just loved reading about the after effects of bringing life and small responsibilities in for the elderly residents. Innovating for this demographic brought hope to this challenging time in our history and while the topic is dark, this perspective shone a tiny light of hope for the future.Would highly recommend."
195,0805095152,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6041973-josh,4,"As I sit here at work, basically doing nothing but typing this review and speaking to my fiancé on Microsoft Lync, I am drinking a cup of coffee and wondering about my mortality.  Yes, I admit, I usually think of it more than once a day, sometimes twice a day, but never 4.5 times a day because that’s actually impossible.When reading Gawande’s ‘Being Mortal’, I found myself not questioning my own life, but many others; he exposed a sense of compassion in this misanthropic heart and how the geriatric community are treated in their final days.  His views on how doctors tend to be either vague or as he puts it, ‘Mr. Informative’, (saying too much about the disease and focusing more on it than the actual patient and their well-being) is a unique perspective from a doctor that actually cares for his patients.  Now, I’m not saying that doctors, as a whole do not, but the way it seems (from my knowledgeable perspective), they go in and out of doors seeing people like paying consumers instead of human beings and making it more of a business than actually trying to treat a person, much less about their well-being.The majority of the book takes us through first-hand accounts from the author; a multitude of case studies, that state interesting statistics about subjects such as: how people in their 50’s-90’s are leaning more towards living independently; how people with a terminal illness find themselves to want to die, rather than live out their days because of the guilt on how embarrassing and burdensome they may be to loved ones; how palliative care has helped many people in having a better life at home rather than being stuck with needles and prolonging their inevitable death in a place they hate to be (somewhat contradictory, yet for good reason, many that go through palliative care or hospice tend to live slightly longer than if they were laid up inside a hospital due to the quality of care towards the patient and not the disease); and how it takes courage to let go when no other option is available.His insight on these subjects is based on a close, personal relationship.  He saw how his own father dealt with terminal cancer for many years, but also used the methods of care listed above and it ended up being the right call; his father lived a lot longer than if he would’ve had extremely intrusive surgery and only had mild suffering, but always in a conscious state knowing what was being done to him, enjoying things before his final breath.Overall, I found much of the information helpful on drawing my own opinions on the matter and opened my eyes to other aspects.Many may find this book depressing because it deals with a subject that we cannot control ultimately, but with understanding and acceptance, we can manage the best we can."
196,0805095152,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7392004-quo,5,"I suspect that what makes some teachers revered is not just a mastery of the subject they mean to impart but that they also have retained an elemental sense of being a learner as well. One of the facets that impressed me most about Atul Gawande's Being Mortal: Medicine & What Matters in the End is that the author conveys the importance of the essential dialogue between doctor & patient by asking himself how he would like to be treated if he were the patient and not the medical specialist. To suggest that this is an important book is almost to diminish it, for Dr. Gawande involves the reader not just in reviewing a series of case studies & other background detail on how each of us attempts to deal with our own mortality but also causes something very personal to take place, the rare sensation of being spoken to directly in a meaningful, compassionate manner. For, as people become aware of the finitude of their life, they do not ask for much. They do not seek riches, they do not seek more power. They ask only to be permitted, insofar as possible, to keep shaping the story of their life in the world--to make choices & to sustain connections to others according to their own priorities.I found Being Mortal a treasure in many gradually unfolding ways. For example, little gerontological training occurs as a component part of medical school, so much so that many doctors feel they are often unable to offer treatment as much as the lure of hope. Dr. Gawande comments thatThere is almost always a long trail of possibility, however slim. However, we have built a multi-trillion dollar edifice for dispensing the medical equivalent of lottery tickets, while having only a rudimentary system to prepare patients for the near certainty that those tickets will not win. Hope is not a plan.Thus, 63% of M.D.'s overestimate survival time, not wanting to trample a patient's hopes, while only 17% underestimate survival time. Interestingly, if a doctor knows a patient well, he or she is more likely to be overly optimistic, ""even to the point of engaging in fantasy about experimental drugs to cure a patient or to extend life in an unrealistic way."" There are many humorous anecdotes which serve to relieve, at least in part, the difficult task of considering one's own mortality in this book, one being Philip Roth's comment that ""Old age is not a battle, it's a massacre."" And the late Harvard scientist & gifted writer, Prof. Steven Jay Gould, wistfully observed that ""the medium isn't always the message"", preferring the more realistic view of death as the ultimate enemy and finding nothing reproachable about those who ""rage against the dying of the light"", borrowing words from Dylan Thomas. Gould lived an additional 20 years after his original diagnosis. Another funny inclusion occurs when General Custer is compared with General Robert E. Lee, with the latter knowing when the battle could not be won.Included among the meaningful case studies is the story of Karen Brown Wilson on the west coast who develops a model for extended care or assisted living as an alternative to conventional nursing homes, though her new paradigm is quickly absorbed into a corporate structure & radically changed. Also, Dr. Bill Thomas in upstate New York, a restless Harvard Med School grad decides to attempt a new model for nursing homes, concluding that ""what was missing was life itself."" He introduces pets aplenty, including dogs, cats, birds and also inserts plants in each room to help confront the 3 plagues of nursing home existence: boredom, loneliness & helplessness. And, in so doing, he alters the relationship of patient to nursing home. Lastly, Dr. Atul Gawande's own father, also a surgeon & born in India, deals with his own mortality and when afflicted with cancer, he attempts to reinvent his life in a meaningful way during his remaining days by performing community service as a Rotarian and extending his ministry to a school he founded in his native India. Ultimately, Atul Gawande concludes that our ultimate goal should not be a good death but a good life till the very end and that assisted living is far more difficult than assisted death. In spite of the notion that every life ends in an execution, so to speak, there are countless uplifting vignettes of people dealing with their own mortality in a positive manner & with great courage in Dr. Gawande's wonderful book, Being Mortal and also in a one hour television episode of ""Frontline"", available via the Internet."

“Death is the enemy. But the enemy has superior forces. Eventually, it wins. And in a war that you cannot win, you don’t want a general who fights to the point of total annihilation. You don’t want Custer. You want Robert E. Lee, someone who knows how to fight for territory that can be won and how to surrender it when it can’t, someone who understands that the damage is greatest if all you do is battle to the bitter end.”

 “We’ve been wrong about what our job is in medicine. We think our job is to ensure health and survival. But really it is larger than that. It is to enable well-being.” 
This is not an easy simple-read. It is a brain-storming perspective-changing book.In all our modern medical learning and practice we aim at making life last ""longer"", but we should make it feel ""better""We try to elongate the lives of the elder, or the ""life"" of their bodies/corpses. Using unjustified mechanical ventilation, Inotropic support, unjustified high-risk operations and the result is an end-of-life ""lived"" in hospitals.
 “A few conclusions become clear when we understand this: that our most cruel failure in how we treat the sick and the aged is the failure to recognize that they have priorities beyond merely being safe and living longer; that the chance to shape one’s story is essential to sustaining meaning in life; that we have the opportunity to refashion our institutions, our culture, and our conversations in ways that transform the possibilities for the last chapters of everyone’s lives.” 

 “I learned about a lot of things in medical school, but mortality wasn’t one of them. Although I was given a dry, leathery corpse to dissect in my first term, that was solely a way to learn about human anatomy. Our textbooks had almost nothing on aging or frailty or dying. How the process unfolds, how people experience the end of their lives, and how it affects those around them seemed beside the point. The way we saw it, and the way our professors saw it, the purpose of medical schooling was to teach how to save lives, not how to tend to their demise.” 
This book is about how can we make life worth-living when we are too frail, too fragile, vulnerable and dependent.Our societies confronts these circumstances by avoiding talking about them, we all deny death, deny talking about it until it is too late.We designed nurseries to control the elder, their safety and their privacy and to make their lives impervious to change . . And the result is a life supposed to be safe, but empty of everything they care about.
 “It is not death that the very old tell me they fear. It is what happens short of death—losing their hearing, their memory, their best friends, their way of life. As Felix put it to me, “Old age is a continuous series of losses.” Philip Roth put it more bitterly in his novel Everyman: “Old age is not a battle. Old age is a massacre.” 
in this book you learn how to listen to them, to acknowledge their fears and how to feel their hopes. You will learn that death is inevitable, that you should respect death, you should respect aging, you should talk about it, and above all you should truly ""live"" to the very end of your life.
 “The problem with medicine and the institutions it has spawned for the care of the sick and the old is not that they have had an incorrect view of what makes life significant. The problem is that they have had almost no view at all. Medicine’s focus is narrow. Medical professionals concentrate on repair of health, not sustenance of the soul. Yet—and this is the painful paradox—we have decided that they should be the ones who largely define how we live in our waning days.” 

 “Sometimes we can offer a cure, sometimes only a salve, sometimes not even that. But whatever we can offer, our interventions, and the risks and sacrifices they entail, are justified only if they serve the larger aims of a person’s life. When we forget that, the suffering we inflict can be barbaric. When we remember it the good we do can be breathtaking.” 

 “Our ultimate goal, after all, is not a good death but a good life to the very end.” 

 “Death, of course, is not a failure. Death is normal. Death may be the enemy, but it is also the natural order of things.”

Should we want them to? At what cost – not to society or to our wallets, but at what cost to our humanity and dignity? Atul Gawunde, a surgeon in Boston Massachusetts, explores the ways in which medicine (and specifically American medicine and American society) helps and hinders the aged, the infirm, and the dying. If you know anyone who will someday die … stop reading this review and read this book.As he did in his previous books, Gawunde gives clear information and asks probing questions. He does not necessarily try to give us THE answer, but he does propose some alternatives, ultimately leaving the final answer up to each and every one of us. Having helped both my parents face their mortal ends, I can tell you that my family members and I – brothers, sister-in-law, and husband – have had many discussions about these issues over the past several years. Some of the physicians we encountered were open to such frank discussion, but not all were. There are difficult issues, heart-wrenching dilemmas, and anxiety-producing situations. But they do not get less difficult, less anxiety-producing, or less heart-wrenching when we ignore them. Oliver Sacks wrote the following blurb: “We have come to medicalize aging, frailty, and death, treating them as if they were just one more clinical problem to overcome. However it is not only medicine that is needed in one’s declining years but life – a life with meaning, a life as rich and full as possible under the circumstances. Being Mortal is not only wise and deeply moving, it is an essential and insightful book for our times…” WHY are you still reading this review? Read the book … NOW! Think carefully about what you want, and then talk about it – to your family, your friends, your doctors. Encourage them to read the book, too. Robert Petkoff does a superb job reading the audio book. There is a bonus interview with the author at the end of the audio version. "
199,0805095152,http://goodreads.com/user/show/24882791-india-m-clamp,4,"“Is empathy and kindness standard in geriatric medicine?” Why did Dr. Gawande find it disconcerting how old/frail patients are being treated? Why are parents cared for---as if they were made of gold---better in India?Truly an arduous journey on a path laden with geriatric patients and a transformation from independence to its’ opposite. This imposing trudge into considerations, care and realities of mortality and “how hope is an elixir.” Most elegantly summarized. Gawande writes: “Being Mortal is about the struggle to cope with the strength of our biology. We think our job is to insure health and survival but it is to enable well-being.” This communicates the goal for all engaging in the practice of medicine. This book is not for shy, sensitive or frail as it's an honest and blatantly truthful aperçu of what is/was observed by Dr. Gawande in geriatric medicine today. Educational and somber. Must read for all physicians. Buy and keep Kleenex on stand-by."
200,0805095152,http://goodreads.com/user/show/10312986-lyn-elliott,5,"We all want to live independent lives but as we age we are likely to lose at least some elements of that independence. This is easy to acknowledge, not so easy to come to terms with and certainly not easy to prepare for.Gawande's book is essential reading for anyone who is ageing themselves, or for anyone caring for somebody who is ill or frail enough to be approaching a state of dependency. Reading this has helped me to be aware of the questions I need to ask myself and those I care about. You can't ever assume you know what someone else really wants to do with their lives as they become dependent, or as they near death.How can you live well till the end, avoiding medically institutionalised interactions, treatments and living space? I wish I had read this before my parents became frail and certainly well before their last illnesses. This was an unusual book club choice, but then it's a great group of women. Not a wimp amongst us. "
201,0805095152,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2375838-cheryl,5,"There is a long phase in the first parts of our lives where, if we are lucky enough to have avoided critical disease or injury, we are blithely unaware of the effects of aging and of the inevitability of death. It seems so far ahead in the future as to be imaginary. Like imagining what a trillion dollars is like. You know that is a real thing, but still…it seems impossible to know what it really is. The other day I said to my teenage daughter, “Just imagine, in only forty years from now you will be standing in the kitchen with your partner and asking the same questions I’m asking now, like “When can we retire and go do what we really want?” “ She snorted. “Forty years? That’s ages from now!” And I’m saying, “no, forty years isn’t long at all! You will be planning your retirement!”She doesn’t really believe it.I sort of wish I had that back again. Those days of childhood, adolescence, young adulthood, where we never gave a thought to retirement, to aging, to death. Later on in life, we end up sometimes dwelling too much on those things, as if to make up for our inattention earlier. Nowadays, I sometimes feel hyper-aware of the universality of disease, the effects of aging, and shuffling off the mortal coil. It is unavoidable - I stare at it through the microscope daily as a pathologist. I often wonder which of those diseases that we hand out like playing cards will be the one dealt to me. “There’s no escaping the tragedy of life., which is that we are all aging from the day we are born… This experiment of making mortality a medical experience is just decades old. And the evidence is it is failing.”“Our reluctance to honestly examine the experience of aging and dying has increased the harm we inflict on people and denied them the basic comforts they most need.”The chapters of the book follow the course of our lives, and are richly illustrated with examples from Gawande’s own family and from his medical practice. Their stories are woven through the book, providing compelling and touching portraits. They are us. We are independent beings who are increasingly living longer and living independently longer.But ‘Things Fall Apart.’ “The culprit is just the accumulated crumbling of one’s bodily systems while medicine carries out its maintenance measures and patch jobs""“Human beings fail the way all complex systems fail: randomly and gradually…as the defects in a complex system increase, the time comes when just one more defect is enough to impair the whole, resulting in the condition known as frailty. It happens to power plants, cars, and large organizations. And it happens to us: eventually, one too many joints are damaged, one too many arteries calcify. There are no more backups. We wear down until we can’t wear down anymore.”So gradually, as the losses accumulate, we become Dependent. We need increasing amounts of Assistance, often in the form of retirement or nursing homes. These tend to provide an institutionalized life — that is not a good life, it’s just as good as can be got in the circumstances. But that robs us of our autonomy and our ability to make choices and to shape the story of our life in the world. “Whatever the limits and travails we face, we want to retain the autonomy—the freedom—to be the authors of our lives. This is the very marrow of being human” New models of care are evolving though, so people like 94 year old Lou are “…still able to live in a way that made him feel that he still had a place in this world.” I found this chapter particularly encouraging. The chapters on Letting Go and Hard Conversations are thoughtful, valuable discussions not only for clinical physicians, nurses and other members of the health care team, but also for anyone — patient, family, friend — who has reached that place where the end of life is in sight. “Technological society has forgotten what scholars call the “dying role” and its importance to people as life approaches its end. People want to share memories, pass on wisdoms and keepsakes, settle relationships, establish their legacies, make peace with God, and ensure that those who are left behind will be okay. They want to end their stories on their own terms.”Finally, Courage. “At least two kinds of courage are required in aging and sickness. The first is the courage to confront the reality of mortality—the courage to seek out the truth of what is to be feared and what is to be hoped.” We need the courage to act on the truth we find. One has to decide whether one’s fears or one’s hopes are what should matter most.This was a profoundly enriching book. It should be required reading for all health care professionals who work with seriously ill patients, and for those who work with the aged, and for those who run our health care systems, and for those who have aging/ill parents/relatives, and for those who are embarking on those final passages, and in some ways especially for those who haven’t yet reached those phases, so that they will be better prepared. It is intelligent, rational, touching, and warmly profound. It is a classic. "
202,0805095152,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4146473-connie,5," I read this a while ago, and it is a book that comes up quite often in conversation, and one that I highly recommend. For medical students, Dr's, nurses, anyone who works in medicine, anyone with aging parents and quite frankly anyone who is aging. Pretty much everyone I know. When talking about it I realized that though I remember it well and recommend it I had never written a review. So here you go. One of the first chapters tells the story of the author when he was shadowing a family practitioner. An elderly woman came in with her main complaint of heart issues. She also commented on poor balance and the Dr noted weight loss. The young writer was confused when the Dr. asked her if she ate alone. More confusion when the physician commented on her pretty manicure, which the patient proudly said she did herself. When the doctor asked her to remove her shoes, the young student was even more perplexed. Came to be that the older physician realized she could not trim her toenails, and they were hurting in her shoes, causing her to change her gait...and at a risk for losing her balance and falling. Another concern was her weight loss, as she did not eat well due to eating alone. She was much frailer and he worried a fall may result in a broken hip or worse. He recommended a podiatrist and that her family try to eat several meals with her throughout the week. He told the young student that he could give medicine for the heart....but a fall with a break would cause much distress and change in her quality of life. This is the basis of this book. Physicians need to learn to look at the whole person, not just the complaint. So often we see a ""specialist"" whose focus is on what they specialize in, and they miss the other signs. Believe me, I have seen this happen. Yet I have also seen those who look at the big picture and those folks are the ones I would want to care for me. We are often so busy trying to live longer. Yet sometimes, or often it is the ""quality"" not the ""quantity"" of our lives that matter. This author delves into this issue with first hand knowledge of patients he has treated as well as his own family members. He admits how hard it is to step back and not always have to ""fix"" everything, but learn to listen to what is important to his patient. We can all learn this lesson. How do we picture the end of our lives? What do we really need to do to achieve that?  This is a book that makes you think about aging, aging in place and aging well. It makes you think about maintaining dignity. I know I thought of this often with family members who were facing the end of life, and I often had to stop and listen to what it was that was important to them, not to me. I only hope that someone allows me that same choice."
203,0805095152,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7958239-elizabeth-theiss,5,"When is it time to stop fighting disease and death, and work instead on the best quality of life possible? Gawande has given us a wise and thoughtful discussion of how to approach the question, one I found helpful and convincing.As always Gawande uses stories to demonstrate the problems attendant to the medicalization of death. Doctors are trained to treat death as the enemy, not death as the inevitable. In an effort to forestall the inevitable, doctors' use every available tool from invasive surgeries to brutal successive chemo therapies that leave patients, that is, people, lingering in pain. As in The Checklist Manifesto, Gawande's solution is simple, a short set of questions that doctors should ask patients nearing the end of their lives. The conversation centers around what is most important to the person; what immediate goals are central; and what trade-offs between length of life and quality of life a person is willing to make. Gawande's ideas about nursing homes as places to avoid are spot on as well. His description of these ""homes"" driven by staff's needs for cookie cutter treatment of residents From assembly line pill dispensing to early morning shower times are downright depressing. We just sprang my husband from a month in a nursing home and it was exactly as described. But alternatives do exist, some better than others. The key seems to be finding a place that allows individual autonomy and provides support for quality of life. The one element ignored here is the cost of this kind of support; it is out of the reach of most people who need it and not supported by Medicare, despite the fact that it is less expensive than a traditional nursing home. My father was fortunate to live out the last two years of his life in a truly wonderful care center with a home-like environment, a small number of house mates, and home cooked meals each night. Gawande made me think we should just tear down the old ones and start over.I have spent a good deal of time thinking about these questions and problems as I helped my father through Alzheimer's and my spouse through 23 years of Parkinson's disease. Gawande has it exactly right and I'm hoping Being Mortal is a best seller so doctors and everyone else benefits from his perspective on what a good life and a good death means."
204,0805095152,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1608124-dana-stabenow,5,"I give this book five stars not because I loved it but because it is what I would call a necessary read, and I mean necessary for everyone, young, old, medical professional and laity alike. It's about That Conversation, what Gawande calls in one chapter ""Hard Conversations."" The subject is how we want to live out the end of our life.Gawande is a surgeon and one of the best parts of this book is that he is learning how to have this conversation himself. He's learning how to do it as a medical professional with his patients, and he's not shy about telling us where and how he has screwed up. He is also learning how to do it as a son to his father, also a surgeon, who has been diagnosed with a rare spinal tumor.The difficulty, he writes, is that in the last fifty years we have learned how to prolong life.As recently as 1945, most deaths occurred in the home. By the 1980s, just 17 percent did...Across not just the United States but also the entire industrialized world, the experience of advanced aging and death has shifted to hospitals and nursing homes...You don't have to spend much time with the elderly or those with terminal illness to see how often medicine fails the people it is supposed to help...Our reluctance to honestly examine the experience of aging and dying has increased the harm we inflict on people and denied them the basic comforts they most need.Later he writes You'd think people would have rebelled. You'd think we would have burned the nursing homes to the ground.But we haven't, and new discoveries and better medical practice mean that citizens of industrialized nations are living longer, healthier lives. ""A life,"" Gawande writes, ""designed to be safe but empty of anything they care about."" The trick now is to make sure our aging populations are not just safe, or even--heresy! sacrilege!--not safe at all, but living a life that achieves quality of life, not just quantity. The good news is, things are changing. (He doesn't say so but you know it has everything to do with the Boomers, a generation now making decisions for their parents, and who will soon be making those decisions--or not--for themselves.) Keren Brown Wilson built the first assisted living facility in Oregon in 1980, and when that concept became bastardized people like Dr. Tom Wilson revolutionized an assisted living facility with two dogs, four cats, 100 parakeets and child care for employees that brought children back into the lives of the inmates (using that word deliberately, as Gawande does himself). Researchers studied the effects of this program over two years, comparing a variety of measures for Chase's residents with those of residents at another nursing home nearby. Their study found that the number of prescriptions required per resident fell to half that of the control nursing home. Psychotropic drugs for agitation, like Haldol, decreased in particular. The total drug costs fell to just 38 percent of the comparison facility. Deaths fell 15 percent.From inmates locked away from life, warehoused until they died, Dr. Wilson's patients became once again members of a community. And as Gawande goes on to say, this experiment and others like it are beginning all across the nation.There is also Hospice, which organization Gawande's father chooses to help him through the end of his life with palliative care. For Hospice, it's all about making the end of each individual story as valuable to them as is physically possible for them. It's impossible to say enough good things about Hospice and Gawande doesn't stint them here. (Full disclosure: I already support Hospice and this book is making me double that support this year.) I know it sounds a little macabre, but this is the one book you really should read. Make a teenager read it and they will understand that much more about what Grandma is going through. Make a Millennial read it and he'll understand in spades how important that retirement plan is and how they should start one now. Make your doctor read it and she'll see how important first asking those essential questions is, ""What do you want? What is most important to you?"" instead of automatically reaching for the scalpel or the drugs. ""Death,"" writes Gawandeis normal. Death may be the enemy, but it is also the natural order of things. I knew these truths abstractly, but I didn't know them concretely--that they could be truths not just for everyone but also for this person right in front of me, for this person I was responsible for.Me, either. Now I feel like I do. Read this book, and recommend it to everyone you know. It is very frank, very well written, and actually? Kind of hopeful.****See also on Vox, ""2015 is the year America started having a sane conversation about death,"" http://www.vox.com/2015/12/16/1011744...."
205,0805095152,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3897817-morgan-blackledge,5,"This is a heart wrenchingly moving and important book. It speaks directly to our cultures strained and distant relationship to aging, the elderly, death and dying. Rarely if ever have I heard a medical clinician speak with such vulnerability and humility about the limits of modern medicine.French cultural theorist and urbanist Paul Virilio observed, with every invention or technical advance, an equally powerful disaster is co-created, for example, when we invented the locomotive, we simultaneously invented the train wreck.In a sense, Being Mortal is Dr. Atul Gawande's analogous observation about the incredible benefits of advanced medicine and the unprecedented opportunities for prolonged suffering and denial it affords us. I'm so grateful to be alive in this time, and science and technology have everything to do with that. Ordinary people have never had as much freedom to pursue knowledge or self expression as we currently enjoy.Advanced medicine is central to the high standard of living we currently have. It prolongs our lives and reduces suffering in many ways that we completely take for granted. But in a real sense, our faith in technology and medical advances has lulled us to sleep on some of life's most important and philosophical, psychological, and spiritual issues. Those of impermanence, suffering, loss and mortality.Our culture does a phenomenal job of keeping death and suffering out of plain sight. This affords the individuals facing these challenges the privacy and professional care that most people chose if given the option.This represents a real advance. But the equally powerful disaster that accompanies this advance is not trivial. The fact that most of us now live the majority of our lives insulated from the reality of death and dying means that we are quite likely to be utterly naive and under developed in this important existential domain.Frankly speaking, these are difficult and unsightly truths most of us would rather defer encountering. In the short term we enjoy the bliss that ignorance affords, but in the long term we suffer the numerous negative consequences that accompany the unexamined life.This book is attempting to address this issue by presenting us with a sober but empathetic and even optimistic view of the end of the road. Highly recommended, five stars."

208,0805095152,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4342402-tl,5,"See Caroline's review here:https://www.goodreads.com/review/show... (her review convinced me to pick this up)----She says it all beautifully so I will add my thoughts here (this'll be fairly short mostly cause my head hurts right now).This book brings up topics most of us don't think about when we are young. It seems too far away to contemplate so we put it out of our minds. Sure, we may talk about it time to time with our loved ones but how many of give it serious thought until something happens, let alone what questions to ask?The subject matter is a bit weighty in here but never felt dry or boring. There's feeling and passion  here. Gawande transports you into what he is talking about, like you are sitting with him at his kitchen table. The personal stories and histories he shares throughout the book were in turns touching and very informative. Of the former, a few had me tearing up and wanting to hug them all. The latter fascinated me, as I didn't know how those things all came about (one of those ""it has always been around"" that you just don't explore further) .I agreed with him on alot of the things he said and it got me thinking about my wishes on the future as well. Hopefully this will help with the hard conversation in the future (even though we wish we could live forever).This is an important book that should be on the bookshelves of everyone, in my humble opinion. Highly recommended.(Excuse any errors, typing on my phone)Narrator: Five starsBonus interview with the author was a nice touch."
209,0805095152,http://goodreads.com/user/show/28602001-emma,5,"An incredible book, but one that has the potential to cause considerable distress.‘Being Mortal’ is a book that addresses the experience of dying in modern society and questions whether we are getting it right. Chapters 1-5 focus primarily on mortality and the diverse nature of the end of life care provided for the elderly. Chapters 6-8 deal more specifically with how those with serious or terminal illnesses, and their families, cope with the process of dying. In these later chapters, the stories related by Gawande are frequently those in which the suffering and death of individuals is caused by cancer, including that of his own father. Though dying is an event that eventually comes to us all, it is a subject that is inherently difficult to address. In talking about our mortality, each person must confront not only the idea of their own death, but that of those who matter to them. It is entirely understandable that people choose to avoid discussing it. Yet Gawande’s book shows why it is important for everybody to stop putting aside the conversation about dying; that, in fact, refusing to tackle death until it is right upon you can lead to much greater pain and suffering. It is at this point when medical intervention takes over, often at the expense of compassion. Medical professionals would do well to read this book as part of their training and development, if only to understand how important honest communication can be to patient outcomes. They are only human, and as such, may feel as awkward about such matters as the rest of us, but they have a duty to provide accurate/truthful information about an individual’s illnesses/conditions so that they can have realistic expectations. Gawande argues that instead of defaulting to the most aggressive form of medical intervention, it is more important to talk to the individual about their goals, what is most important to them, what they can and can’t live with, what their fears and concerns are, what trade offs they are willing to make. Through discussion, a better path can be found for those who may be in pain or who are coming to the end of their life. Such conversations are necessarily incredibly difficult but Gawande highlights the benefits of having a plan put together by the individual, their family, and the medical professionals in collaboration; it is this honest dialogue that will allow an individual to manage their illness and the end of their life in a way that suits their needs. Gawande’s argument is empowering, it promotes the active role of the individual as the centre of their care and what happens to them. Within each chapter, Gawande often addresses what has happened in the past, what is happening now (including in different parts of the world), how people are trying to change things, and what the focus for the future should be. This plan means that the book is not depressing; it highlights the failures but injects positivity by showing ways in which things are being improved, or can/should be improved. At no point does Gawande fall into pessimism, he believes that while the majority of systems and institutions may not be meeting the needs of individuals right now, there is a chance that more of them will do so in the future. The book is his way of showing the difference between what is, and what should be, including examples of people and places that are getting it right. Importantly, Gawande is not prescriptive. He does not say ‘this is THE way to do things’, instead he shows how different solutions are being implemented. The variety of solutions reflect the multitude of differing ways people want and need to approach their ill health, old age, and death.       ‘Being Mortal’ is incredibly difficult to review. Given that I agree with Gawande, it would be easy to say that everyone should read this book. Yet in saying that, it feels like I am telling people that they need to deal with the idea of their death as soon as possible and, if they are currently unwell, that they should open a dialogue with their doctor to plan how they want it to proceed. It sounds more challenging when phrased this way, and is it not truly understandable that someone may not want to deal with the idea of their death by calmly talking through the steps? At the same time, I fundamentally believe Gawande’s argument that honest communication is the way forward for those who are living with terminal illness. Perhaps this is because I would rather make my own decisions while I can, and not leave them for others, who may have to guess what I might want in emergency situations if I hadn’t made my thoughts clear. The role of friends and family as support network seems intrinsically opposed to making these hard choices, the love and hope with which these decisions are made might not be compatible with the path I would want. Neither, perhaps, would the medical intervention. In modern society, people have become a medical problem to be solved, they must be ‘made safe’, increasingly separated from the rest of society and even from themselves, thereby removing any chance at individuality or choice. The problem is exacerbated by the disconnection between what medicine can do and what it should do. Gawande treats the grave and emotive subject matter with respect and conviction. At the end of someone’s life, or as they cope with ill health, he wants people to be able to have choices, to focus on what’s important to the , and to be supported in those goals by everyone around them. This is what I will hope for. "
210,0805095152,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2231715-lewis-weinstein,5,"This book is not pleasant to read. It is challenging, emotional, difficult ... and a spectacular journey along a path we will all follow. As we face the inevitable, Gawande gives us a framework within which to consider the options we may have, the choices we might want to make, and the medical and/or other assistance we may or may not desire. His thoughtful discussion of the people he has accompanied through their dying days, including his father, provides much to stimulate our own thoughts. The central theme is that these decisions should be, to the maximum possible extent, the patient's, with family and medical input, and not the other way around. In Gawande's experience that process, difficult and uncertain as it may be, yields the best results for all those involved."
211,0805095152,http://goodreads.com/user/show/10770371-dan,5,"Being Mortal by Atul GawandeGawande, as a surgeon, steps us through the reality of life’s waning moments. There is a heavy focus on cancer and old age and decisions around hospice care. Not easy subject matter but very useful information. I didn’t get choked up until the end of the book when the author takes us through the last few months of his father’s life as he battled cancer. The US is different from nearly all other countries in the world in how we deal with the elderly. As Americans we don’t live with aging parents and by extension a significant percentage of the elderly are put into retirement homes when they can no longer maintain independence. Gawande points out that our bodies are like machines and quite literally wear out. Most end of life situations spend a great deal of time on pain management and medications and often in the waning days, an inability to digest food.Some interesting facts. “By the age of sixty, people in an industrialized country like the United States have lost, on average, a third of their teeth. After eighty-five, almost 40 percent have no teeth at all.”Philip Roth said “Old age is not a battle. Old age is a massacre.”Gawande also discusses Do Not Resuscitate directives. There is part of a chapter where he recalls interning at a Boston area hospital. On one night he forgets that a patient had signed a DNR. When the patient goes into cardiac arrest, it sets in motion the CPR team to come revive the patient. When Gawande realizes his mistake and tries to call it off he is pushed aside. When the revival effort fails he is tongue lashed by the CPR team. The author feels very strongly about the value of hospice care. Almost everyone, if given the choice, would choose to die at home versus the hospital but the latter situation is still the norm. Sometimes because others have to make the medical decisions when the elderly become incapacitated. 4.5 stars. The writing here is easy to follow and the stories are quite compelling. There is also a lot of practical advice. The book was published in 2014. Highly recommended."
212,0805095152,http://goodreads.com/user/show/8079403-max,5,"This is an important book, whether you are approaching old age or family or friends you care about are. It set my mind spinning thinking how I would deal with the situations Gawande describes. Coming face to face with one’s decline and death is at least depressing and can be terrifying. Gawande points out that the medical profession and most of our institutions are not designed to deal with the human problem. He identifies a number of changes that could be made at a policy level that would improve things. But the fundamental problem is knowing ourselves and communicating our wishes or helping loved ones to reflect and do the same. Gawande points to helpful experiences with hospice care, but we must first make that decision. My notes follow.Gawande explains how growing old has changed and how we in developed countries have adjusted or failed to adjust to it. As the twentieth century wore on medicine made great advances and people’s life spans increased significantly. At the beginning of the century people would stay relatively healthy as they aged until they met a devastating disease, say the flu or cancer or heart disease. These would usually kill people rather quickly and they would die in their homes near friends and family. Now modern medicine fixes most of these problems, at least temporarily, so as people age their health ratchets down step by step. Eventually many of us will be unable to care for ourselves while the doctors keep us alive. There are in home services available and assisted living facilities for those who can afford them. But for the average person without significant savings this is a serious financial as well as personal dilemma and too often ends with a person’s final days spent in an impersonal nursing home.Both medical care for the elderly and institutional care suffer from the same problem – task orientation rather than people orientation. Doctors are trained to fix your issue and keep you alive, not evaluate the impact on your overall quality of life. Similarly institutions for the elderly are designed to meet set goals: To keep you safe, ensure you get your medications, get you fed, keep you clean, etc. The staff is rated on these things and focus on them, but they create an environment their residents typically hate. And of course many institutions don’t meet even basic standards. So the modern way of growing old often means becoming disabled enough to have to leave your home with little choice but to share a room with a stranger in an institutional environment. Gawande paints a grim picture of our future, but he also points to people trying to change things. These people are focused more on care than treatment. The woman who pioneered assisted living was looking for an alternative to the nursing home, not a stepping stone as it too often is. Others have tried to change the focus of nursing homes to enrich the lives of the residents through measures that allow more autonomy to the residents and less regimentation. The design of nursing homes can make them seem more like real homes and less like institutions. The more residents can participate, have choices, have outside interests, the better they will feel and do. Efficiency and safety have to be balanced against their effect on the patient’s quality of life. Throughout life we take reasonable chances to get more out of living. Why should that stop when time becomes short, when it is most precious?Gawande discusses terminal illness and the inevitable decision of whether to stop treatment. Doctors tend not to be helpful. They give choices of your treatment options. That is their job. But today there is hospice and palliative care. When is this a reasonable choice? The decision is personal. Doctors and family can’t really make it which is why drawing out the feelings of the patient is so important. From Gawande’s examples there is clearly a point in which treatment does more harm than good. We all want to die with some dignity and as little pain as possible. We all would rather die in a bed where we can say goodbye to friends and family rather than on a respirator in an ICU. But it is difficult to give up hope that the next procedure might work or buy us significant time. The decision is a tradeoff to achieve some quality of life at the end. Gawande talks about his own father’s case. His father, also a doctor, had terminal cancer and was facing paralysis. It took what Gawande calls the hard conversation to make the decision to accept hospice and the inevitable. In a testimony to the notion that the most sophisticated doctor may not be the best choice to initiate this conversation, Gawande’s father’s feelings were skillfully drawn out by a small town nurse practitioner from the local hospice. She was interested in him, his problems as he saw them, not in the disease and its treatment."
213,0805095152,http://goodreads.com/user/show/9049915-james-barker,5,"It is commonly phrased that we battle illness. But this remarkable book by Atul Gawande points out that it is an ill-thought battle and, dare I say it, an ill-fought one.For the last three years of my wonderful mother’s life I was her carer. Coping with the advanced stages of multiple sclerosis she was mostly restricted to her bed (which was in fact a hospital bed delivered to our family home along with all the other paraphernalia of sickness), permanently catheterised, unable to walk or do anything for herself. Mom also had severe dementia and often mistook me for my recently-deceased Dad. As an immersive carer I managed a team of women who assisted me in the day with my mother’s personal care. The rest of the time I sat with her, or fed her, or tried to unblock her catheter (while going out of my mind), or sang with her. Naturally, the last activity was the most enjoyable. Despite her dementia, Mom had a seemingly inexhaustible trove of perfectly-remembered lyrics in her head. We sang Doris Day songs, the Bellamy Brothers, the Beautiful South, the Beatles, Tori Amos, the Hollies, Cyndi Lauper, the Mama and Papas, Simon and Garfunkel, ABBA, songs from musicals. Even new songs she had only heard once we tackled together. Somehow she remembered these lyrics too.But 16 months before Mom passed away she developed septicaemia and was rushed into hospital. Her organs were shutting down, her pulse was weak and fading fast. We were told her quality of life was so bad, her disability so extreme, that the hospital was to offer no treatment- it would be kinder to let her go.We didn’t. I won’t go into the whys and wherefores of that decision but at least one of my sisters- who had driven in terror the 150 miles from where she lived- thought that letting go would be an idea we should not entertain and I wavered, full of love for this extraordinary woman who had been the life and soul of any party when I was growing up, rock and rolling on the dance floor, full of fast wit and laughter that was infectious in its affirmation of life. The doctor in charge asked me for one piece of evidence that suggested my mother had any quality of life at all. We sing every day- we sing together all the time, I said. So he treated her and somehow, over 7 long and painful weeks, she became well enough to be sent back home and into my care.But what did this ‘well enough’ mean? Mom was no longer capable of swallowing so had had a peg inserted into her stomach. I was trained in the art of its upkeep- everyday the wound needed to be cleaned and the peg rotated 360 degrees (otherwise it would fuse to her skin). Any strength Mom had had in her arms had gone. To all intents and purposes she was incapable of moving anything but her head (a fraction), her eyes and mouth. But by and large Mom slept, in a virtual coma that meant our daily songs felt like a golden time remembered and grieved from the perspective of a new time of horrors. Three days after returning home and in a fever caused by kidney stones that were trying to be passed (another tier of Hell) Mom whispered to me, “I have had enough.”But of course it didn’t end there. Mom stayed in a limbo of pain and half-consciousness for well over another year. She would emit blood-curdling screams when being cleaned, when being moved, but she did not sing. Fed a noxious mixture through a machine, one of the few joys she had had left (sucking on a piece of chocolate or enjoying slow mouthfuls of a home-cooked dinner) had gone. It struck me sitting beside her that we had consigned her to an exit that was barbarous and devoid of love. All I could do was ensure she was as comfortable as possible and that, on the occasions she was awake, she could see that I was there, smiling at her and telling her I loved her more than the world.When the end time came we were told on three separate occasions that today was the day. But a little woman of 5’2”, ranked a Zero by hospital doctors when her ability was assessed, she defied every professional speculation and breathed on another day, then another, then another. When she died in November 2012, a few weeks shy of her 68th birthday, I have truly never seen such peace on a face.In the last year of her life Mom had been well enough on a handful of occasions to wake and smile at me and sing with me. One of these occasions I captured on video. We sit together, smiling, singing ‘Zip A Dee Doo Dah,’ (my oh my what a wonderful day) and she tells me she loves me. An exquisite moment that I am glad I captured. But was it really worth the 16 months of Hell she went through?Atul Gawande’s book is all about acceptance of our mortality. But it is about much more than that. Modern medicine has it wrong, he says. It is about preserving life at all costs- battle for a year through procedure after procedure rather than enjoy your remaining months of life at the best possible quality. Yes, it turns out the emergency room where my mother ended up in 2011 made the right call and we did not. But, by and large, if you have a life-limiting prognosis with a disease such as cancer you will be offered all sorts of treatments to extend that life at the detriment of its quality.But this is also a book about the way the elderly are treated in the industry of care homes and sheltered housing. With all meaning to life removed, with all responsibility removed, people become shells of their former selves, depressed and longing for the death that the (questionable) care they are receiving is preventing. Visionary projects from the 1970s- with more pets in care homes, with pairs of birds in every room for residents to have a vested interest in looking after, with children of staff visiting, filling the emptiness with the joy of activity, of noise- show that it is possible for care homes to be places of life rather than death. But it takes more effort to achieve this, more resources. More determination to give the elderly a life worth enjoying. And so, of course, such ideas largely fall by the wayside, because in a capitalist world the elderly are a drain on life, on resources... which is frankly sickening.I cannot stress enough how important this book is. It was, at times, a painful read for me, and that will be the case for anyone who has lost someone in a medicalised nightmare of end-time. But you owe it to yourself to understand what best befits you when your time comes. You owe it to yourself to choose your own ending. This book arms you with the knowledge to make the right decision, however painful that is.As for my mother.. after 3 touch and go trips to the hospital in the last year of her life I spoke to my sisters and told them it all came down to what we felt Mom would prefer- to die at home or have more and more (hopeless) treatment at hospital, where it was inevitable that one day she would happen to die. We agreed that just as my father had passed away at home, surrounded by people who loved him, our mother deserved the same. It was the best decision we made. She passed on in her home of 40 years held by those she loved and surrounded by their voices. She died in peace."
214,0805095152,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6468566-jennifer,2,"2.5 stars. Gawande has about three major points in this book, all of which were made in a news magazine article he wrote for the Atlantic: 1, We should have tough conversations with those in our lives about their vision for their end-of-life; 2, Doctors should also have these conversations with their patients; and 3, If we have these conversations, we can shift medicine and end-of-life care away from a stave-off-death model and towards a model that promotes humanity, autonomy, and dignity for the dying (and thus no longer need institutional nursing homes). I do not disagree, but the book itself is heavy on anecdotes and light on actual research or policy analysis.My major stylistic critique is that Gawande buries his three points in pages of anecdotes about patients and memories of his own father's decline and death. I'm not being unsympathetic to the suffering of these colorful characters (and Gawande's own personal suffering), but I found the anecdotes long-winded, distracting, and ultimately boring. Gawande intended them to have emotional impact for the reader, but for me, the stories smacked of filling pages for the pure commercial gain of selling a book. My major substantive critique is that Gawande spends too little time on policy, instead championing the heroism of individual doctors, caregivers, and entrepreneurs-- as if the system can be saved by some brave individuals. He is far too sanguine about the difficulty of changing institutions at the macro-level. Yes, Gawande mentions that these alternative living arrangements and alternative therapeutic approaches save money in the long run, but most of the initiatives Gawande covers were developed by private entrepreneurs, not governments (though some government funds may have been made available in the form of grants). Dramatic policy change would be needed to scale and fund these initiatives at the state or federal level, and I do not see the current vested interests in the healthcare lobby supporting these changes (nor does Gawande provide a path for fighting for policy change, besides mentioning the cost-effectiveness argument). The one scale-able initiative that Gawande discusses, Hospice, already exists-- but Gawande ignores that Hospice's ranks are often filled with low-skilled, under-paid, and over-worked caregivers who are hardly in the position to give the attentive, individualized care that Gawande received for his father. Gawande is also too sanguine about the role of socioeconomic class, which is perhaps why his friends and his patients receive such excellent care. He is wrapped in a bubble of privilege -- access to the top surgeons and the most committed nurses. True, some of the alternative homes that Gawande mentions do take Medicaid, but these homes are so few that they have waitlists that are hundreds of names long. The type of ""better death"" that Gawande argues for so eloquently is available only to the wealthiest or the most educated (those empowered to fight the system and search for better options). Without a serious treatment of the nexus between healthcare policy, quality of life, and socioeconomic status, this book seems to me squarely in the realm of theory, not practice. "
215,0805095152,http://goodreads.com/user/show/929238-hbalikov,5,"This is an excellent book. It is also the most important book that I have read in the past year.Dr. Gawande is that rare physician who can write well and write well for the layman. There is nothing glamorous about growing old. There is nothing glamorous in taking care of those who are growing old. As to the former, Gawande, makes it clear as he describes the way our bodies decline and breakdown over time. As to the later, it helps to explain both why very few doctors are attracted to gerontology and why those who aren't are not particularly adept at dealing with those who are at or near the end of their lives. This book is about ""what matters in the end,"" but it is also about Gawande's journey as a physician and surgeon. ""I never expected that among the most meaningful experiences I'd have as a doctor --- and, really, as a human being --- would come from helping others deal with what medicine cannot do as well as what it can.""Atul Gawande is meticulous in describing how we wear down and wear out. ""There is, he told me, 'no single, common cellular mechanism to the aging process.'....The process is gradual and unrelenting."" And, how many of us believe that we can put that aside for the present. ""People naturally prefer to avoid the subject of their decrepitude."" Yet, it colors many things that we do and many decisions that we have to make. In his own learning process, Gawande shares his experiences, and his encounters with doctors, other care givers and physicians. ""The job of any doctor, Bludau later told me, is to support quality of life, by which he meant two things: as much freedom from the ravages of disease as possible and the retention of enough function for active engagement in the world. Most doctors treat disease and figure that the rest will take care of itself.""He exposes a lot of the ""nursing home approach"" as insensitive with facilities that may come to resemble an asylum (in the worst sense). He explores the question, ""what makes life worth living when we are old and frail and unable to care for ourselves,"" is its many facets. There are: basic needs for survival; need for love and belonging; desire for growth (""the opportunity to attain personal goals, to master knowledge and skills, and to recognized and rewarded for our achievements); and, perhaps, ""self-fulfillment through pursuit or moral ideals and creativity for their own sake."" He points out that ""our driving motivations in life, instead of remaining constant, change hugely over time...""I learned a lot about how we often treat those who cannot care entirely for themselves and how attitudes and venues are changing. When doctors are just about ""tinkering"" with the seriously ill, a lot is ignored. Particularly, that those people ""have priorities (perhaps poorly expressed or not discussed) besides prolonging their lives. Surveys find that their top concerns include avoiding suffering, strengthening relationships with family and friends, being mentally alert, not being a burden to others, and achieving a sense that their life is complete.""I wish I had had this book to read before I found myself with friends and family members who were seriously ill or dying. Gawande describes how both amateur and professional caregivers can be sensitive to these issues. And, how they can give the ill and dying the opportunity to reflect on their own desires. One of those, for many, is that they would rather spend their remaining days at home instead of in an institution. There is a very illuminating section on hospice and how this should be explored far earlier than it currently is. Not necessarily invoking hospice care earlier, but being aware of what if can offer and, if desired, getting it going in time to make a difference with quality of life.""(Though), no one ever really has control. Physics and biology and accident ultimately have their way in our lives. But the point is that we are not helpless either. Courage is the strength to recognize BOTH realities. We have room to act, to shape our stories, though as time goes on it is within narrower and narrower confines. A few conclusions become clear when we understand this: that our most cruel failure in how we treat the sick and the aged is the failure to recognize that they have priorities beyond merely being safe and living longer; that the chance to shape one's story is essential to sustaining meaning in life; that we have the opportunity to refashion our institutions, our culture, and our conversations in ways that transform the possibilities for the last chapters of everyone's lives."""

In his effortlessly lucid prose, Gawande comes to terms with the medical establishment's failure in providing end-of-life care. Too often, doctors work to fix what's broken in the service of extending life, without considering how quality of life is compromised, inflicting even more suffering as a result. He extols the value of hospice and palliative care, whose aim is not to give up on patients, but to provide as many good days as possible in the inevitable slide to death. He advocates asking difficult questions with patients and loved ones to determine what can bring meaning and value to them, even in the harsh narrowing of life's possibilities brought on by failing bodies and minds. He does not exempt himself from this critique -- instead he offers personal stories, iike those of his father and his daughter's piano teacher, to show how he came to understand the necessity of these important discussions and the possibilities they offer. It's moving, and timely, and despite the less-than-cheerful subject matter, never a burden to read (a testament to his writerly skill). I can't recommend this book highly enough to anyone who will face these issues -- and we all most likely will, in some form."
217,0805095152,http://goodreads.com/user/show/47188780-kathleen,5,"•	This is an important book for all who have elderly parents that are struggling with end-of-life health issues. Dr. Gawande personalizes the key issues through individual case histories, but he backs up his arguments with solid statistics. First, our society does not have enough gerontologists to serve our aging population, and our medical schools are cutting back on training new ones. More importantly, medical doctors tend to want to solve medical problems. And often, that results in them not recognizing, or even asking, what is important to their patient’s quality of life. The elderly want to live in ‘a home’, not an institution. They want to feel in control of their lives as much as possible. Safety is less of a concern to them than independence. Privacy is important too. They tend to want their own space, with furniture from their own home. They want to be able to turn on the television when and at what volume they want. These needs are not compatible with institutional long-term care facilities. So, new options are being explored—particularly in the United States. Highly recommend."

“A few conclusions become clear when we understand this: that our most cruel failure in how we treat the sick and the aged is the failure to recognize that they have priorities beyond merely being safe and living longer; that the chance to shape one’s story is essential to sustaining meaning in life; that we have the opportunity to refashion our institutions, our culture, and our conversations in ways that transform the possibilities for the last chapters of everyone’s lives.”

 This right here is the theme of Atul Gawande's Being Mortal: Medicine and What Matters in the End. This incredible piece of medical/science nonfiction starts out by introducing historical and cultural norms for caring for our elders and how this has significantly shifted in many societies. Mr. Gawande does not pass judgement but presents the observations and facts so we the reader may have an objective view which starts a journey of perspective. And when we view the world from another perspective, self-examination takes place, thus change. I absolutely loved this book. Many books I have been reading lately have been all about timing it seems. Last year, I watched both my grandfathers die (within 3 days of each other) and this year I am really beginning to take note of my parents and in-law's escalating aging. I guess chronic diseases, strokes, and fickle organs will do that to you. Like many self-centered Americans, I have been looking at the process in terms of what it means for me. How will my life change as they become more and more dependent on me? This book. This book! My perspective and priorities are forever altered. It is about me, after all I am living my life, but it is also about them. They want to be the author of their own life just as much as I do and if I'm lucky, they will live long enough to require assistance with that. They didn't ask for these complications and they fear the loss of independence far more than I could ever begin to imagine. The true terror: that no one will care.Mr. Gawande stresses that end of life conversations are crucial and surprisingly liberating, not only as a son or daughter but as a medical provider. There is a sense of control even in the midst of very uncontrollable circumstances. Questions need to be asked and once answers are decided upon, fear and anxiety of all parties involved can relax a bit. Your wishes will be respected in terms of what a quality life means to you. In a world of nursing homes that might as well be classified as prisons, knowing that someone listens and cares about what you want (despite the options and risks) is priceless. Mr. Gawande draws from his personal experience with his father in this respect and I found these parts to be incredibly raw and emotional. I strongly recommend this book. But if you don't read it, please remember these questions for your loved ones: 

“Whenever serious sickness or injury strikes and your body or mind breaks down, the vital questions are the same: What is your understanding of the situation and its potential outcomes? What are your fears and what are your hopes? What are the trade-offs you are willing to make and not willing to make? And what is the course of action that best serves this understanding?”

 Ask questions, advocate as needed, and enjoy this short life with the people you love ♥My favorite quote:""This is what it means to have autonomy -- you may not control life's circumstances, but getting to be the author of your life means getting to control what you do with them.”"
219,0805095152,http://goodreads.com/user/show/83445-lisa-vegan,5,"This book is excellent. It’s accessible and always interesting. It’s one of those books that probably everybody should read. I’m thinking every physician should read it upon graduating from medical school or during their residency. I think that it’s an important book.I do disagree with him at times, though overall think what he says is spot on.The parts where I disagree are in two major areas: The main one is his reluctance about supporting widespread assisted suicide because he says in those places, palliative hospice care isn’t as advanced an offering. However, even with hospice, I’ve witnessed horrible suffering, unbearable suffering, and it seems rare that people have none of that in their last days and weeks. I think both assisted suicide and competent hospice should always be options. I think not all hospices care works very well at all, though I know that some does. The other place I disagree is his contention that genetics isn’t as crucial to longevity as I think it is, especially in those families where so many live to over 100 and, I know by knowing them, that they often do not take at all good care of themselves, living in a way where others without their genes would die at much younger ages and with more infirmities before their deaths. The gist of what he says about quality of life when aged or with a terminal illness I agree with wholeheartedly though. A lot of what he says about that and examples he gives, makes the book fun to read. I really appreciated the several very personal stories, including his father’s story. So, not only do I not want to live until end stage cancer or ALS, etc. which I’ve always known, but I have no desire to get so old or sick that I can’t take care of myself – with my situation I wouldn’t end up at one of the good places and even those wouldn’t be great for me. These are issues I’ve thought about since about age 12, and I will do anything I can to avoid physical pain, nausea, shortness of breath, and other forms of suffering. Great book for getting readers to think about what they want when they’re elderly or have a life threatening illness, and also for having conversations about their wishes, and encouraging others in their lives to also share their wishes.The best thing about the book, and I wish 100% of medical people would get on board, is the weighing of what is worth it and not worth it to patients, and facing what medicine can’t do as well as what it can do. Not lying! Not evading! Not giving false hope! Allowing patients to take the lead with their own lives! Advocating that conversations should be had with the ill/elderly and doctors shouldn’t assume they know what should be done without knowing the patients’ goals and wishes for themselves. Early in the book, a death mentioned sounded exactly like my mother in 1964-1965 – I have to read that book! Books leading to other books…I'm still laughing about the 100 loose birds!!!"
220,0805095152,http://goodreads.com/user/show/632247-chrissie,3,"Before reading: I am reading this not because I want to but because I feel I ought to. Is it going to make me feel all horrible? I can accept this if it constructively explains what you can do to ""improve"" the end of life. In conclusion: I am glad I read the book, but it wasn’t particularly fun. There are many examples given of particular people, their illnesses and the difficulties they had, one being the author’s father. I didn’t understand all the medical terms used. Examples are given to illustrate the author’s conclusions on how medical care of the aging should be altered. The author, who is himself a surgeon, shows new, better alternatives and how they came to be. He does this by naming pioneers of better nursing homes, assisted care units and hospice development. For a person in the medical field I think this book is essential because it shows how medical changes need to be and can be implemented…., but I am not employed in the medical field and the historical developments, although interesting, were a bit extraneous for me. From my point of view, these sections could have been shortened, even if they do show the direction the author is supporting. One can ask, “Who is this book for?”In my family we have had several deaths in the past years. So the weaknesses coupled to end of life medical care, nursing homes and hospices were not new to me. I didn’t have to be told; I was not surprised in the least. What I wanted from this book were guidelines showing me how I could improve my husband’s and my own end of life. Did the book do this? Well, it made me face my own situation and what lay ahead. As a result of reading this book I will be looking into what alternatives are available here in Sweden when we are no longer able to manage alone. My husband and I have discussed exactly how we see the future. It has made clear to us that we value independence and that we want to stay where we are as long as possible – even if such living may be less safe than living near a hospital. We plan on looking in to Assisted Care Facilities that offer a gradual increase of care as needs increase. Do they have queues? Are they expensive? Where are they located? The essential point is that you have to know what you are looking for and that will be different for each family. So, yes, I am glad I read the book. It made me evaluate what is important to me – nature and independence and a dog and pretty landscape. The book pushed me to do this.  Another issue the book pushes you to evaluate is how long you want to extend the years of your life even if that time is filled with pain and discomfort. This too is a personal decision. The book guides you in what sort of questions you should ask your doctor, but of course some questions are specific to the illness one is coping with. Some conclusions are drawn that may be true for many, but not for my husband and I. Generally, most seem to want more contact with family as they age. This has its difficult sides too, and the book mentions this only briefly. I think more attention could have been devoted to this topic. While funeral wishes are important to discuss at life’s end, I found it unnecessary that the author discussed the details of his father’s funeral in this book.Practically nothing is said about how the elderly no longer want to travel. I may add that if you want to travel do it when you are young and fit. I am thankful to have traveled earlier in my life. The book is primarily concerned with American facilities, and practically nothing is said about costs. The audiobook is narrated by Robert Petkoff. It is read at a good speed. When good nursing facilities were being discussed he tended to sound SO enthused, SO exuberant. Really, I found this a bit childish. It doesn’t distort the text, but exaggerates how wonderful it all is. I could have done without this. The book has made me more appreciative of what I have. It has pushed my husband and me to evaluate which qualities of life we deem most important. With a clearer understanding of our preferences we can more easily deal with what lies ahead."
221,0805095152,http://goodreads.com/user/show/730754-ken,4,"Anyone who is planning on dying some day should read this book. It can be jumpy at times, but overall, Gawande's a straight shooting, no-nonsense writer who gives the straight dope on nursing homes, assisted living, hospice, and the heart-rending decisions we are all forced into at our end-of-days. As many of his accounts deal with cancer cases, it's a bit of a downer, but it's medicine to be taken and there's no better way to illustrate his point than through real-life examples, including his own father, who developed a fatal tumor in his spinal cord. God save us all from ends like this, but sorry, we all don't get to die suddenly and peacefully in our sleep.Among topics Gawande tackles: the dearth of geriatricians in this country. So ironic. So American. But the money is not there for doctors dedicated to our fastest growing demographic. Oh. And the preventative-style approach, the in-the-moment treatments needed to keep the elderly happy? Often not paid for by insurance companies, either.He also gets into nursing home/assisted living situations, focusing on the story of an upstate NY facility where a maverick doctor/director decided to introduce parakeets and live plants in every room as well as two cats and two dogs who had the run of the place. The nurses were thrown by this -- one refused to pick up a doggy mistake on the floor because that wasn't what she got a nursing license for -- but eventually everyone saw the seismic shift this simple yet dramatic change had on the previously-listless residents. The ""inmates"" (what they felt like, previously) started to perk up, tell people about the personalities of their parakeets, take a hand in caring for both plants and birds. Meanwhile, they became entranced with the wandering dogs and cats. Those patients who were ambulatory surprised the nurses by stepping up and volunteering to walk the dogs. The director had kids visit, too, providing training to middle schoolers on how to talk even with people with Alzheimer's. The young people's two or three visits a week became events to look forward to for the elderly residents, who, between pets and children, suddenly discovered purpose and felt more like human beings, more like they used to when they were living alone.There are other variations here, too, like assisted living purposely designed in pods of smaller units, created to look more like homes and less like institutions. Chief among the changes? Allowing people some privacy -- their own rooms. Giving them more leeway on what to do, when to eat. The schedules work around the people vs. vice versa.But the bulk of the book focuses on decisions and consequences. There are no definitive moves to make once a fatal disease begins its course, but Gawande shows that it's spinning a bit out of control in too many cases. The money being spent to prolong lives, often to make those lives so much more miserable just because people refuse to accept the oldest fact of life -- death -- is truly a scary thing. Modern medicine may be many things, but it is no match for Death, who remains undefeated. Still, there is a measure of victory to be had. For many people, that may mean a shorter but higher quality amount of time with family and friends. And, paradoxically, Gawande points to studies showing that many people who choose hospice care actually live longer than those who take the harsh and risky treatment road. They have less pain. They are happier. Together, these effects lead to slightly longer days with those they love. So, if you think hospice is a white flag, think again. It's not as simple as all that. Nor is this book. It's food for thought. Not that it will get any easier for you, the reader, when such choices visit you or your loved ones (and they will), but at least you'll have a better sense of balance and perspective. Can we ask for any more than that?"
222,0805095152,http://goodreads.com/user/show/275498-jim,5,"This is a brilliantly written book, and I was super-impressed with the genius of the good Dr Gawande right up to the point where he drank water out of the Ganges...I wouldn't do that at gunpoint! But while I might question the doc's wisdom in choice of beverages, I have to say he wrote a darn fine book.All of the occupants of this globe have a single thing in common...we will all die. Hopefully, we enjoy a long life and peaceful old age before our expiry date and, thanks to modern medicine and the care of good physicians, this is getting to be the reality for more people. This presents us with another problem: caring for a growing population of oldsters who require care as they ease their way into the hereafter. Families are getting smaller, so the progeny that would have cared for ailing seniors in the past are absent, or already employed. Expensive medical treatments are being employed to attempt to extend the lives of oldsters who would have slipped away without treatment, but at what cost? Frequently the result of this practice is that the medical treatment gives the patient an agonized existence suffering from side effects.Dr Gawande believes that, in most cases, if given a choice between having some quality time with loved ones or a possibly longer painful and befuddled existence under medical care, most people will choose the quality time even though it may be shorter. And here's another point to consider: Gawande has determined that 63% of doctors overestimate the amount of time a patient has to live, and that the better the doctor knows the patient, the more likely he/she will be to overestimate the patient's remaining time.Of interest to me was the fact that he basically confirmed an old homily my Granny used to toss out from time to time: ""A son is a son 'til he gets him a wife, but a daughter's a daughter for all of her life"". Here's what Dr Gawande had to say about the matter (from P. 79):  ""your chances of avoiding the nursing home are directly related to the number of children you have, and, according to what little research has been done, having at least one daughter seems to be crucial to the amount of help you will receive.""Naturally, one cannot always expect that sons and daughters will be able to care for them. Dr Gawande is firmly on the side of those who consult a palliative care specialist (From P.177):  ""The result; those who saw a palliative care specialist stopped chemotherapy sooner, entered hospice far earlier, experienced less suffering at the end of their lives - and they lived 25 percent longer. In other words, our decision making in medicine has failed so spectacularly that we have reached the point of actually inflicting harm on patients rather than confronting the subject of mortality.""This could have been a boring book...it wasn't. Dr Gawande has the gift of imparting information without making you feel like you are being tutored. A very interesting read, particularly for those of us who are around the last curve and racing toward the finish line."

224,0805095152,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5550397-britany,4,"Atul Gawande illustrates life as you age and how families must cope with aging parents.I appreciated learning about a topic that I knew little about previously. The difficulty of what to do with the aging population is an interesting and highly debatable (if not slightly depressing) topic. Gawande shares real life client stories, including his own family. This made this book relatable, who hasn't watched an elder age and eventually pass away. The best story was the one with the home that brought in dogs, cats, birds and plants. I just loved reading about the after effects of bringing life and small responsibilities in for the elderly residents. Innovating for this demographic brought hope to this challenging time in our history and while the topic is dark, this perspective shone a tiny light of hope for the future.Would highly recommend."
225,0805095152,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6041973-josh,4,"As I sit here at work, basically doing nothing but typing this review and speaking to my fiancé on Microsoft Lync, I am drinking a cup of coffee and wondering about my mortality.  Yes, I admit, I usually think of it more than once a day, sometimes twice a day, but never 4.5 times a day because that’s actually impossible.When reading Gawande’s ‘Being Mortal’, I found myself not questioning my own life, but many others; he exposed a sense of compassion in this misanthropic heart and how the geriatric community are treated in their final days.  His views on how doctors tend to be either vague or as he puts it, ‘Mr. Informative’, (saying too much about the disease and focusing more on it than the actual patient and their well-being) is a unique perspective from a doctor that actually cares for his patients.  Now, I’m not saying that doctors, as a whole do not, but the way it seems (from my knowledgeable perspective), they go in and out of doors seeing people like paying consumers instead of human beings and making it more of a business than actually trying to treat a person, much less about their well-being.The majority of the book takes us through first-hand accounts from the author; a multitude of case studies, that state interesting statistics about subjects such as: how people in their 50’s-90’s are leaning more towards living independently; how people with a terminal illness find themselves to want to die, rather than live out their days because of the guilt on how embarrassing and burdensome they may be to loved ones; how palliative care has helped many people in having a better life at home rather than being stuck with needles and prolonging their inevitable death in a place they hate to be (somewhat contradictory, yet for good reason, many that go through palliative care or hospice tend to live slightly longer than if they were laid up inside a hospital due to the quality of care towards the patient and not the disease); and how it takes courage to let go when no other option is available.His insight on these subjects is based on a close, personal relationship.  He saw how his own father dealt with terminal cancer for many years, but also used the methods of care listed above and it ended up being the right call; his father lived a lot longer than if he would’ve had extremely intrusive surgery and only had mild suffering, but always in a conscious state knowing what was being done to him, enjoying things before his final breath.Overall, I found much of the information helpful on drawing my own opinions on the matter and opened my eyes to other aspects.Many may find this book depressing because it deals with a subject that we cannot control ultimately, but with understanding and acceptance, we can manage the best we can."
226,0805095152,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7392004-quo,5,"I suspect that what makes some teachers revered is not just a mastery of the subject they mean to impart but that they also have retained an elemental sense of being a learner as well. One of the facets that impressed me most about Atul Gawande's Being Mortal: Medicine & What Matters in the End is that the author conveys the importance of the essential dialogue between doctor & patient by asking himself how he would like to be treated if he were the patient and not the medical specialist. To suggest that this is an important book is almost to diminish it, for Dr. Gawande involves the reader not just in reviewing a series of case studies & other background detail on how each of us attempts to deal with our own mortality but also causes something very personal to take place, the rare sensation of being spoken to directly in a meaningful, compassionate manner. For, as people become aware of the finitude of their life, they do not ask for much. They do not seek riches, they do not seek more power. They ask only to be permitted, insofar as possible, to keep shaping the story of their life in the world--to make choices & to sustain connections to others according to their own priorities.I found Being Mortal a treasure in many gradually unfolding ways. For example, little gerontological training occurs as a component part of medical school, so much so that many doctors feel they are often unable to offer treatment as much as the lure of hope. Dr. Gawande comments thatThere is almost always a long trail of possibility, however slim. However, we have built a multi-trillion dollar edifice for dispensing the medical equivalent of lottery tickets, while having only a rudimentary system to prepare patients for the near certainty that those tickets will not win. Hope is not a plan.Thus, 63% of M.D.'s overestimate survival time, not wanting to trample a patient's hopes, while only 17% underestimate survival time. Interestingly, if a doctor knows a patient well, he or she is more likely to be overly optimistic, ""even to the point of engaging in fantasy about experimental drugs to cure a patient or to extend life in an unrealistic way."" There are many humorous anecdotes which serve to relieve, at least in part, the difficult task of considering one's own mortality in this book, one being Philip Roth's comment that ""Old age is not a battle, it's a massacre."" And the late Harvard scientist & gifted writer, Prof. Steven Jay Gould, wistfully observed that ""the medium isn't always the message"", preferring the more realistic view of death as the ultimate enemy and finding nothing reproachable about those who ""rage against the dying of the light"", borrowing words from Dylan Thomas. Gould lived an additional 20 years after his original diagnosis. Another funny inclusion occurs when General Custer is compared with General Robert E. Lee, with the latter knowing when the battle could not be won.Included among the meaningful case studies is the story of Karen Brown Wilson on the west coast who develops a model for extended care or assisted living as an alternative to conventional nursing homes, though her new paradigm is quickly absorbed into a corporate structure & radically changed. Also, Dr. Bill Thomas in upstate New York, a restless Harvard Med School grad decides to attempt a new model for nursing homes, concluding that ""what was missing was life itself."" He introduces pets aplenty, including dogs, cats, birds and also inserts plants in each room to help confront the 3 plagues of nursing home existence: boredom, loneliness & helplessness. And, in so doing, he alters the relationship of patient to nursing home. Lastly, Dr. Atul Gawande's own father, also a surgeon & born in India, deals with his own mortality and when afflicted with cancer, he attempts to reinvent his life in a meaningful way during his remaining days by performing community service as a Rotarian and extending his ministry to a school he founded in his native India. Ultimately, Atul Gawande concludes that our ultimate goal should not be a good death but a good life till the very end and that assisted living is far more difficult than assisted death. In spite of the notion that every life ends in an execution, so to speak, there are countless uplifting vignettes of people dealing with their own mortality in a positive manner & with great courage in Dr. Gawande's wonderful book, Being Mortal and also in a one hour television episode of ""Frontline"", available via the Internet."

“Death is the enemy. But the enemy has superior forces. Eventually, it wins. And in a war that you cannot win, you don’t want a general who fights to the point of total annihilation. You don’t want Custer. You want Robert E. Lee, someone who knows how to fight for territory that can be won and how to surrender it when it can’t, someone who understands that the damage is greatest if all you do is battle to the bitter end.”

 “We’ve been wrong about what our job is in medicine. We think our job is to ensure health and survival. But really it is larger than that. It is to enable well-being.” 
This is not an easy simple-read. It is a brain-storming perspective-changing book.In all our modern medical learning and practice we aim at making life last ""longer"", but we should make it feel ""better""We try to elongate the lives of the elder, or the ""life"" of their bodies/corpses. Using unjustified mechanical ventilation, Inotropic support, unjustified high-risk operations and the result is an end-of-life ""lived"" in hospitals.
 “A few conclusions become clear when we understand this: that our most cruel failure in how we treat the sick and the aged is the failure to recognize that they have priorities beyond merely being safe and living longer; that the chance to shape one’s story is essential to sustaining meaning in life; that we have the opportunity to refashion our institutions, our culture, and our conversations in ways that transform the possibilities for the last chapters of everyone’s lives.” 

 “I learned about a lot of things in medical school, but mortality wasn’t one of them. Although I was given a dry, leathery corpse to dissect in my first term, that was solely a way to learn about human anatomy. Our textbooks had almost nothing on aging or frailty or dying. How the process unfolds, how people experience the end of their lives, and how it affects those around them seemed beside the point. The way we saw it, and the way our professors saw it, the purpose of medical schooling was to teach how to save lives, not how to tend to their demise.” 
This book is about how can we make life worth-living when we are too frail, too fragile, vulnerable and dependent.Our societies confronts these circumstances by avoiding talking about them, we all deny death, deny talking about it until it is too late.We designed nurseries to control the elder, their safety and their privacy and to make their lives impervious to change . . And the result is a life supposed to be safe, but empty of everything they care about.
 “It is not death that the very old tell me they fear. It is what happens short of death—losing their hearing, their memory, their best friends, their way of life. As Felix put it to me, “Old age is a continuous series of losses.” Philip Roth put it more bitterly in his novel Everyman: “Old age is not a battle. Old age is a massacre.” 
in this book you learn how to listen to them, to acknowledge their fears and how to feel their hopes. You will learn that death is inevitable, that you should respect death, you should respect aging, you should talk about it, and above all you should truly ""live"" to the very end of your life.
 “The problem with medicine and the institutions it has spawned for the care of the sick and the old is not that they have had an incorrect view of what makes life significant. The problem is that they have had almost no view at all. Medicine’s focus is narrow. Medical professionals concentrate on repair of health, not sustenance of the soul. Yet—and this is the painful paradox—we have decided that they should be the ones who largely define how we live in our waning days.” 

 “Sometimes we can offer a cure, sometimes only a salve, sometimes not even that. But whatever we can offer, our interventions, and the risks and sacrifices they entail, are justified only if they serve the larger aims of a person’s life. When we forget that, the suffering we inflict can be barbaric. When we remember it the good we do can be breathtaking.” 

 “Our ultimate goal, after all, is not a good death but a good life to the very end.” 

 “Death, of course, is not a failure. Death is normal. Death may be the enemy, but it is also the natural order of things.”

Should we want them to? At what cost – not to society or to our wallets, but at what cost to our humanity and dignity? Atul Gawunde, a surgeon in Boston Massachusetts, explores the ways in which medicine (and specifically American medicine and American society) helps and hinders the aged, the infirm, and the dying. If you know anyone who will someday die … stop reading this review and read this book.As he did in his previous books, Gawunde gives clear information and asks probing questions. He does not necessarily try to give us THE answer, but he does propose some alternatives, ultimately leaving the final answer up to each and every one of us. Having helped both my parents face their mortal ends, I can tell you that my family members and I – brothers, sister-in-law, and husband – have had many discussions about these issues over the past several years. Some of the physicians we encountered were open to such frank discussion, but not all were. There are difficult issues, heart-wrenching dilemmas, and anxiety-producing situations. But they do not get less difficult, less anxiety-producing, or less heart-wrenching when we ignore them. Oliver Sacks wrote the following blurb: “We have come to medicalize aging, frailty, and death, treating them as if they were just one more clinical problem to overcome. However it is not only medicine that is needed in one’s declining years but life – a life with meaning, a life as rich and full as possible under the circumstances. Being Mortal is not only wise and deeply moving, it is an essential and insightful book for our times…” WHY are you still reading this review? Read the book … NOW! Think carefully about what you want, and then talk about it – to your family, your friends, your doctors. Encourage them to read the book, too. Robert Petkoff does a superb job reading the audio book. There is a bonus interview with the author at the end of the audio version. "
229,0805095152,http://goodreads.com/user/show/24882791-india-m-clamp,4,"“Is empathy and kindness standard in geriatric medicine?” Why did Dr. Gawande find it disconcerting how old/frail patients are being treated? Why are parents cared for---as if they were made of gold---better in India?Truly an arduous journey on a path laden with geriatric patients and a transformation from independence to its’ opposite. This imposing trudge into considerations, care and realities of mortality and “how hope is an elixir.” Most elegantly summarized. Gawande writes: “Being Mortal is about the struggle to cope with the strength of our biology. We think our job is to insure health and survival but it is to enable well-being.” This communicates the goal for all engaging in the practice of medicine. This book is not for shy, sensitive or frail as it's an honest and blatantly truthful aperçu of what is/was observed by Dr. Gawande in geriatric medicine today. Educational and somber. Must read for all physicians. Buy and keep Kleenex on stand-by."
230,0805095152,http://goodreads.com/user/show/10312986-lyn-elliott,5,"We all want to live independent lives but as we age we are likely to lose at least some elements of that independence. This is easy to acknowledge, not so easy to come to terms with and certainly not easy to prepare for.Gawande's book is essential reading for anyone who is ageing themselves, or for anyone caring for somebody who is ill or frail enough to be approaching a state of dependency. Reading this has helped me to be aware of the questions I need to ask myself and those I care about. You can't ever assume you know what someone else really wants to do with their lives as they become dependent, or as they near death.How can you live well till the end, avoiding medically institutionalised interactions, treatments and living space? I wish I had read this before my parents became frail and certainly well before their last illnesses. This was an unusual book club choice, but then it's a great group of women. Not a wimp amongst us. "
231,0805095152,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2375838-cheryl,5,"There is a long phase in the first parts of our lives where, if we are lucky enough to have avoided critical disease or injury, we are blithely unaware of the effects of aging and of the inevitability of death. It seems so far ahead in the future as to be imaginary. Like imagining what a trillion dollars is like. You know that is a real thing, but still…it seems impossible to know what it really is. The other day I said to my teenage daughter, “Just imagine, in only forty years from now you will be standing in the kitchen with your partner and asking the same questions I’m asking now, like “When can we retire and go do what we really want?” “ She snorted. “Forty years? That’s ages from now!” And I’m saying, “no, forty years isn’t long at all! You will be planning your retirement!”She doesn’t really believe it.I sort of wish I had that back again. Those days of childhood, adolescence, young adulthood, where we never gave a thought to retirement, to aging, to death. Later on in life, we end up sometimes dwelling too much on those things, as if to make up for our inattention earlier. Nowadays, I sometimes feel hyper-aware of the universality of disease, the effects of aging, and shuffling off the mortal coil. It is unavoidable - I stare at it through the microscope daily as a pathologist. I often wonder which of those diseases that we hand out like playing cards will be the one dealt to me. “There’s no escaping the tragedy of life., which is that we are all aging from the day we are born… This experiment of making mortality a medical experience is just decades old. And the evidence is it is failing.”“Our reluctance to honestly examine the experience of aging and dying has increased the harm we inflict on people and denied them the basic comforts they most need.”The chapters of the book follow the course of our lives, and are richly illustrated with examples from Gawande’s own family and from his medical practice. Their stories are woven through the book, providing compelling and touching portraits. They are us. We are independent beings who are increasingly living longer and living independently longer.But ‘Things Fall Apart.’ “The culprit is just the accumulated crumbling of one’s bodily systems while medicine carries out its maintenance measures and patch jobs""“Human beings fail the way all complex systems fail: randomly and gradually…as the defects in a complex system increase, the time comes when just one more defect is enough to impair the whole, resulting in the condition known as frailty. It happens to power plants, cars, and large organizations. And it happens to us: eventually, one too many joints are damaged, one too many arteries calcify. There are no more backups. We wear down until we can’t wear down anymore.”So gradually, as the losses accumulate, we become Dependent. We need increasing amounts of Assistance, often in the form of retirement or nursing homes. These tend to provide an institutionalized life — that is not a good life, it’s just as good as can be got in the circumstances. But that robs us of our autonomy and our ability to make choices and to shape the story of our life in the world. “Whatever the limits and travails we face, we want to retain the autonomy—the freedom—to be the authors of our lives. This is the very marrow of being human” New models of care are evolving though, so people like 94 year old Lou are “…still able to live in a way that made him feel that he still had a place in this world.” I found this chapter particularly encouraging. The chapters on Letting Go and Hard Conversations are thoughtful, valuable discussions not only for clinical physicians, nurses and other members of the health care team, but also for anyone — patient, family, friend — who has reached that place where the end of life is in sight. “Technological society has forgotten what scholars call the “dying role” and its importance to people as life approaches its end. People want to share memories, pass on wisdoms and keepsakes, settle relationships, establish their legacies, make peace with God, and ensure that those who are left behind will be okay. They want to end their stories on their own terms.”Finally, Courage. “At least two kinds of courage are required in aging and sickness. The first is the courage to confront the reality of mortality—the courage to seek out the truth of what is to be feared and what is to be hoped.” We need the courage to act on the truth we find. One has to decide whether one’s fears or one’s hopes are what should matter most.This was a profoundly enriching book. It should be required reading for all health care professionals who work with seriously ill patients, and for those who work with the aged, and for those who run our health care systems, and for those who have aging/ill parents/relatives, and for those who are embarking on those final passages, and in some ways especially for those who haven’t yet reached those phases, so that they will be better prepared. It is intelligent, rational, touching, and warmly profound. It is a classic. "
232,0805095152,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4146473-connie,5," I read this a while ago, and it is a book that comes up quite often in conversation, and one that I highly recommend. For medical students, Dr's, nurses, anyone who works in medicine, anyone with aging parents and quite frankly anyone who is aging. Pretty much everyone I know. When talking about it I realized that though I remember it well and recommend it I had never written a review. So here you go. One of the first chapters tells the story of the author when he was shadowing a family practitioner. An elderly woman came in with her main complaint of heart issues. She also commented on poor balance and the Dr noted weight loss. The young writer was confused when the Dr. asked her if she ate alone. More confusion when the physician commented on her pretty manicure, which the patient proudly said she did herself. When the doctor asked her to remove her shoes, the young student was even more perplexed. Came to be that the older physician realized she could not trim her toenails, and they were hurting in her shoes, causing her to change her gait...and at a risk for losing her balance and falling. Another concern was her weight loss, as she did not eat well due to eating alone. She was much frailer and he worried a fall may result in a broken hip or worse. He recommended a podiatrist and that her family try to eat several meals with her throughout the week. He told the young student that he could give medicine for the heart....but a fall with a break would cause much distress and change in her quality of life. This is the basis of this book. Physicians need to learn to look at the whole person, not just the complaint. So often we see a ""specialist"" whose focus is on what they specialize in, and they miss the other signs. Believe me, I have seen this happen. Yet I have also seen those who look at the big picture and those folks are the ones I would want to care for me. We are often so busy trying to live longer. Yet sometimes, or often it is the ""quality"" not the ""quantity"" of our lives that matter. This author delves into this issue with first hand knowledge of patients he has treated as well as his own family members. He admits how hard it is to step back and not always have to ""fix"" everything, but learn to listen to what is important to his patient. We can all learn this lesson. How do we picture the end of our lives? What do we really need to do to achieve that?  This is a book that makes you think about aging, aging in place and aging well. It makes you think about maintaining dignity. I know I thought of this often with family members who were facing the end of life, and I often had to stop and listen to what it was that was important to them, not to me. I only hope that someone allows me that same choice."
233,0805095152,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7958239-elizabeth-theiss,5,"When is it time to stop fighting disease and death, and work instead on the best quality of life possible? Gawande has given us a wise and thoughtful discussion of how to approach the question, one I found helpful and convincing.As always Gawande uses stories to demonstrate the problems attendant to the medicalization of death. Doctors are trained to treat death as the enemy, not death as the inevitable. In an effort to forestall the inevitable, doctors' use every available tool from invasive surgeries to brutal successive chemo therapies that leave patients, that is, people, lingering in pain. As in The Checklist Manifesto, Gawande's solution is simple, a short set of questions that doctors should ask patients nearing the end of their lives. The conversation centers around what is most important to the person; what immediate goals are central; and what trade-offs between length of life and quality of life a person is willing to make. Gawande's ideas about nursing homes as places to avoid are spot on as well. His description of these ""homes"" driven by staff's needs for cookie cutter treatment of residents From assembly line pill dispensing to early morning shower times are downright depressing. We just sprang my husband from a month in a nursing home and it was exactly as described. But alternatives do exist, some better than others. The key seems to be finding a place that allows individual autonomy and provides support for quality of life. The one element ignored here is the cost of this kind of support; it is out of the reach of most people who need it and not supported by Medicare, despite the fact that it is less expensive than a traditional nursing home. My father was fortunate to live out the last two years of his life in a truly wonderful care center with a home-like environment, a small number of house mates, and home cooked meals each night. Gawande made me think we should just tear down the old ones and start over.I have spent a good deal of time thinking about these questions and problems as I helped my father through Alzheimer's and my spouse through 23 years of Parkinson's disease. Gawande has it exactly right and I'm hoping Being Mortal is a best seller so doctors and everyone else benefits from his perspective on what a good life and a good death means."
234,0805095152,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1608124-dana-stabenow,5,"I give this book five stars not because I loved it but because it is what I would call a necessary read, and I mean necessary for everyone, young, old, medical professional and laity alike. It's about That Conversation, what Gawande calls in one chapter ""Hard Conversations."" The subject is how we want to live out the end of our life.Gawande is a surgeon and one of the best parts of this book is that he is learning how to have this conversation himself. He's learning how to do it as a medical professional with his patients, and he's not shy about telling us where and how he has screwed up. He is also learning how to do it as a son to his father, also a surgeon, who has been diagnosed with a rare spinal tumor.The difficulty, he writes, is that in the last fifty years we have learned how to prolong life.As recently as 1945, most deaths occurred in the home. By the 1980s, just 17 percent did...Across not just the United States but also the entire industrialized world, the experience of advanced aging and death has shifted to hospitals and nursing homes...You don't have to spend much time with the elderly or those with terminal illness to see how often medicine fails the people it is supposed to help...Our reluctance to honestly examine the experience of aging and dying has increased the harm we inflict on people and denied them the basic comforts they most need.Later he writes You'd think people would have rebelled. You'd think we would have burned the nursing homes to the ground.But we haven't, and new discoveries and better medical practice mean that citizens of industrialized nations are living longer, healthier lives. ""A life,"" Gawande writes, ""designed to be safe but empty of anything they care about."" The trick now is to make sure our aging populations are not just safe, or even--heresy! sacrilege!--not safe at all, but living a life that achieves quality of life, not just quantity. The good news is, things are changing. (He doesn't say so but you know it has everything to do with the Boomers, a generation now making decisions for their parents, and who will soon be making those decisions--or not--for themselves.) Keren Brown Wilson built the first assisted living facility in Oregon in 1980, and when that concept became bastardized people like Dr. Tom Wilson revolutionized an assisted living facility with two dogs, four cats, 100 parakeets and child care for employees that brought children back into the lives of the inmates (using that word deliberately, as Gawande does himself). Researchers studied the effects of this program over two years, comparing a variety of measures for Chase's residents with those of residents at another nursing home nearby. Their study found that the number of prescriptions required per resident fell to half that of the control nursing home. Psychotropic drugs for agitation, like Haldol, decreased in particular. The total drug costs fell to just 38 percent of the comparison facility. Deaths fell 15 percent.From inmates locked away from life, warehoused until they died, Dr. Wilson's patients became once again members of a community. And as Gawande goes on to say, this experiment and others like it are beginning all across the nation.There is also Hospice, which organization Gawande's father chooses to help him through the end of his life with palliative care. For Hospice, it's all about making the end of each individual story as valuable to them as is physically possible for them. It's impossible to say enough good things about Hospice and Gawande doesn't stint them here. (Full disclosure: I already support Hospice and this book is making me double that support this year.) I know it sounds a little macabre, but this is the one book you really should read. Make a teenager read it and they will understand that much more about what Grandma is going through. Make a Millennial read it and he'll understand in spades how important that retirement plan is and how they should start one now. Make your doctor read it and she'll see how important first asking those essential questions is, ""What do you want? What is most important to you?"" instead of automatically reaching for the scalpel or the drugs. ""Death,"" writes Gawandeis normal. Death may be the enemy, but it is also the natural order of things. I knew these truths abstractly, but I didn't know them concretely--that they could be truths not just for everyone but also for this person right in front of me, for this person I was responsible for.Me, either. Now I feel like I do. Read this book, and recommend it to everyone you know. It is very frank, very well written, and actually? Kind of hopeful.****See also on Vox, ""2015 is the year America started having a sane conversation about death,"" http://www.vox.com/2015/12/16/1011744...."
235,0805095152,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3897817-morgan-blackledge,5,"This is a heart wrenchingly moving and important book. It speaks directly to our cultures strained and distant relationship to aging, the elderly, death and dying. Rarely if ever have I heard a medical clinician speak with such vulnerability and humility about the limits of modern medicine.French cultural theorist and urbanist Paul Virilio observed, with every invention or technical advance, an equally powerful disaster is co-created, for example, when we invented the locomotive, we simultaneously invented the train wreck.In a sense, Being Mortal is Dr. Atul Gawande's analogous observation about the incredible benefits of advanced medicine and the unprecedented opportunities for prolonged suffering and denial it affords us. I'm so grateful to be alive in this time, and science and technology have everything to do with that. Ordinary people have never had as much freedom to pursue knowledge or self expression as we currently enjoy.Advanced medicine is central to the high standard of living we currently have. It prolongs our lives and reduces suffering in many ways that we completely take for granted. But in a real sense, our faith in technology and medical advances has lulled us to sleep on some of life's most important and philosophical, psychological, and spiritual issues. Those of impermanence, suffering, loss and mortality.Our culture does a phenomenal job of keeping death and suffering out of plain sight. This affords the individuals facing these challenges the privacy and professional care that most people chose if given the option.This represents a real advance. But the equally powerful disaster that accompanies this advance is not trivial. The fact that most of us now live the majority of our lives insulated from the reality of death and dying means that we are quite likely to be utterly naive and under developed in this important existential domain.Frankly speaking, these are difficult and unsightly truths most of us would rather defer encountering. In the short term we enjoy the bliss that ignorance affords, but in the long term we suffer the numerous negative consequences that accompany the unexamined life.This book is attempting to address this issue by presenting us with a sober but empathetic and even optimistic view of the end of the road. Highly recommended, five stars."

238,0805095152,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4342402-tl,5,"See Caroline's review here:https://www.goodreads.com/review/show... (her review convinced me to pick this up)----She says it all beautifully so I will add my thoughts here (this'll be fairly short mostly cause my head hurts right now).This book brings up topics most of us don't think about when we are young. It seems too far away to contemplate so we put it out of our minds. Sure, we may talk about it time to time with our loved ones but how many of give it serious thought until something happens, let alone what questions to ask?The subject matter is a bit weighty in here but never felt dry or boring. There's feeling and passion  here. Gawande transports you into what he is talking about, like you are sitting with him at his kitchen table. The personal stories and histories he shares throughout the book were in turns touching and very informative. Of the former, a few had me tearing up and wanting to hug them all. The latter fascinated me, as I didn't know how those things all came about (one of those ""it has always been around"" that you just don't explore further) .I agreed with him on alot of the things he said and it got me thinking about my wishes on the future as well. Hopefully this will help with the hard conversation in the future (even though we wish we could live forever).This is an important book that should be on the bookshelves of everyone, in my humble opinion. Highly recommended.(Excuse any errors, typing on my phone)Narrator: Five starsBonus interview with the author was a nice touch."
239,0805095152,http://goodreads.com/user/show/28602001-emma,5,"An incredible book, but one that has the potential to cause considerable distress.‘Being Mortal’ is a book that addresses the experience of dying in modern society and questions whether we are getting it right. Chapters 1-5 focus primarily on mortality and the diverse nature of the end of life care provided for the elderly. Chapters 6-8 deal more specifically with how those with serious or terminal illnesses, and their families, cope with the process of dying. In these later chapters, the stories related by Gawande are frequently those in which the suffering and death of individuals is caused by cancer, including that of his own father. Though dying is an event that eventually comes to us all, it is a subject that is inherently difficult to address. In talking about our mortality, each person must confront not only the idea of their own death, but that of those who matter to them. It is entirely understandable that people choose to avoid discussing it. Yet Gawande’s book shows why it is important for everybody to stop putting aside the conversation about dying; that, in fact, refusing to tackle death until it is right upon you can lead to much greater pain and suffering. It is at this point when medical intervention takes over, often at the expense of compassion. Medical professionals would do well to read this book as part of their training and development, if only to understand how important honest communication can be to patient outcomes. They are only human, and as such, may feel as awkward about such matters as the rest of us, but they have a duty to provide accurate/truthful information about an individual’s illnesses/conditions so that they can have realistic expectations. Gawande argues that instead of defaulting to the most aggressive form of medical intervention, it is more important to talk to the individual about their goals, what is most important to them, what they can and can’t live with, what their fears and concerns are, what trade offs they are willing to make. Through discussion, a better path can be found for those who may be in pain or who are coming to the end of their life. Such conversations are necessarily incredibly difficult but Gawande highlights the benefits of having a plan put together by the individual, their family, and the medical professionals in collaboration; it is this honest dialogue that will allow an individual to manage their illness and the end of their life in a way that suits their needs. Gawande’s argument is empowering, it promotes the active role of the individual as the centre of their care and what happens to them. Within each chapter, Gawande often addresses what has happened in the past, what is happening now (including in different parts of the world), how people are trying to change things, and what the focus for the future should be. This plan means that the book is not depressing; it highlights the failures but injects positivity by showing ways in which things are being improved, or can/should be improved. At no point does Gawande fall into pessimism, he believes that while the majority of systems and institutions may not be meeting the needs of individuals right now, there is a chance that more of them will do so in the future. The book is his way of showing the difference between what is, and what should be, including examples of people and places that are getting it right. Importantly, Gawande is not prescriptive. He does not say ‘this is THE way to do things’, instead he shows how different solutions are being implemented. The variety of solutions reflect the multitude of differing ways people want and need to approach their ill health, old age, and death.       ‘Being Mortal’ is incredibly difficult to review. Given that I agree with Gawande, it would be easy to say that everyone should read this book. Yet in saying that, it feels like I am telling people that they need to deal with the idea of their death as soon as possible and, if they are currently unwell, that they should open a dialogue with their doctor to plan how they want it to proceed. It sounds more challenging when phrased this way, and is it not truly understandable that someone may not want to deal with the idea of their death by calmly talking through the steps? At the same time, I fundamentally believe Gawande’s argument that honest communication is the way forward for those who are living with terminal illness. Perhaps this is because I would rather make my own decisions while I can, and not leave them for others, who may have to guess what I might want in emergency situations if I hadn’t made my thoughts clear. The role of friends and family as support network seems intrinsically opposed to making these hard choices, the love and hope with which these decisions are made might not be compatible with the path I would want. Neither, perhaps, would the medical intervention. In modern society, people have become a medical problem to be solved, they must be ‘made safe’, increasingly separated from the rest of society and even from themselves, thereby removing any chance at individuality or choice. The problem is exacerbated by the disconnection between what medicine can do and what it should do. Gawande treats the grave and emotive subject matter with respect and conviction. At the end of someone’s life, or as they cope with ill health, he wants people to be able to have choices, to focus on what’s important to the , and to be supported in those goals by everyone around them. This is what I will hope for. "
240,0805095152,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2231715-lewis-weinstein,5,"This book is not pleasant to read. It is challenging, emotional, difficult ... and a spectacular journey along a path we will all follow. As we face the inevitable, Gawande gives us a framework within which to consider the options we may have, the choices we might want to make, and the medical and/or other assistance we may or may not desire. His thoughtful discussion of the people he has accompanied through their dying days, including his father, provides much to stimulate our own thoughts. The central theme is that these decisions should be, to the maximum possible extent, the patient's, with family and medical input, and not the other way around. In Gawande's experience that process, difficult and uncertain as it may be, yields the best results for all those involved."
241,0805095152,http://goodreads.com/user/show/10770371-dan,5,"Being Mortal by Atul GawandeGawande, as a surgeon, steps us through the reality of life’s waning moments. There is a heavy focus on cancer and old age and decisions around hospice care. Not easy subject matter but very useful information. I didn’t get choked up until the end of the book when the author takes us through the last few months of his father’s life as he battled cancer. The US is different from nearly all other countries in the world in how we deal with the elderly. As Americans we don’t live with aging parents and by extension a significant percentage of the elderly are put into retirement homes when they can no longer maintain independence. Gawande points out that our bodies are like machines and quite literally wear out. Most end of life situations spend a great deal of time on pain management and medications and often in the waning days, an inability to digest food.Some interesting facts. “By the age of sixty, people in an industrialized country like the United States have lost, on average, a third of their teeth. After eighty-five, almost 40 percent have no teeth at all.”Philip Roth said “Old age is not a battle. Old age is a massacre.”Gawande also discusses Do Not Resuscitate directives. There is part of a chapter where he recalls interning at a Boston area hospital. On one night he forgets that a patient had signed a DNR. When the patient goes into cardiac arrest, it sets in motion the CPR team to come revive the patient. When Gawande realizes his mistake and tries to call it off he is pushed aside. When the revival effort fails he is tongue lashed by the CPR team. The author feels very strongly about the value of hospice care. Almost everyone, if given the choice, would choose to die at home versus the hospital but the latter situation is still the norm. Sometimes because others have to make the medical decisions when the elderly become incapacitated. 4.5 stars. The writing here is easy to follow and the stories are quite compelling. There is also a lot of practical advice. The book was published in 2014. Highly recommended."
242,0805095152,http://goodreads.com/user/show/8079403-max,5,"This is an important book, whether you are approaching old age or family or friends you care about are. It set my mind spinning thinking how I would deal with the situations Gawande describes. Coming face to face with one’s decline and death is at least depressing and can be terrifying. Gawande points out that the medical profession and most of our institutions are not designed to deal with the human problem. He identifies a number of changes that could be made at a policy level that would improve things. But the fundamental problem is knowing ourselves and communicating our wishes or helping loved ones to reflect and do the same. Gawande points to helpful experiences with hospice care, but we must first make that decision. My notes follow.Gawande explains how growing old has changed and how we in developed countries have adjusted or failed to adjust to it. As the twentieth century wore on medicine made great advances and people’s life spans increased significantly. At the beginning of the century people would stay relatively healthy as they aged until they met a devastating disease, say the flu or cancer or heart disease. These would usually kill people rather quickly and they would die in their homes near friends and family. Now modern medicine fixes most of these problems, at least temporarily, so as people age their health ratchets down step by step. Eventually many of us will be unable to care for ourselves while the doctors keep us alive. There are in home services available and assisted living facilities for those who can afford them. But for the average person without significant savings this is a serious financial as well as personal dilemma and too often ends with a person’s final days spent in an impersonal nursing home.Both medical care for the elderly and institutional care suffer from the same problem – task orientation rather than people orientation. Doctors are trained to fix your issue and keep you alive, not evaluate the impact on your overall quality of life. Similarly institutions for the elderly are designed to meet set goals: To keep you safe, ensure you get your medications, get you fed, keep you clean, etc. The staff is rated on these things and focus on them, but they create an environment their residents typically hate. And of course many institutions don’t meet even basic standards. So the modern way of growing old often means becoming disabled enough to have to leave your home with little choice but to share a room with a stranger in an institutional environment. Gawande paints a grim picture of our future, but he also points to people trying to change things. These people are focused more on care than treatment. The woman who pioneered assisted living was looking for an alternative to the nursing home, not a stepping stone as it too often is. Others have tried to change the focus of nursing homes to enrich the lives of the residents through measures that allow more autonomy to the residents and less regimentation. The design of nursing homes can make them seem more like real homes and less like institutions. The more residents can participate, have choices, have outside interests, the better they will feel and do. Efficiency and safety have to be balanced against their effect on the patient’s quality of life. Throughout life we take reasonable chances to get more out of living. Why should that stop when time becomes short, when it is most precious?Gawande discusses terminal illness and the inevitable decision of whether to stop treatment. Doctors tend not to be helpful. They give choices of your treatment options. That is their job. But today there is hospice and palliative care. When is this a reasonable choice? The decision is personal. Doctors and family can’t really make it which is why drawing out the feelings of the patient is so important. From Gawande’s examples there is clearly a point in which treatment does more harm than good. We all want to die with some dignity and as little pain as possible. We all would rather die in a bed where we can say goodbye to friends and family rather than on a respirator in an ICU. But it is difficult to give up hope that the next procedure might work or buy us significant time. The decision is a tradeoff to achieve some quality of life at the end. Gawande talks about his own father’s case. His father, also a doctor, had terminal cancer and was facing paralysis. It took what Gawande calls the hard conversation to make the decision to accept hospice and the inevitable. In a testimony to the notion that the most sophisticated doctor may not be the best choice to initiate this conversation, Gawande’s father’s feelings were skillfully drawn out by a small town nurse practitioner from the local hospice. She was interested in him, his problems as he saw them, not in the disease and its treatment."

But this remarkable book by Atul Gawande points out that it is an ill-thought battle and, dare I say it, an ill-fought one.For the last three years of my wonderful mother’s life I was her carer. Coping with the advanced stages of multiple sclerosis she was mostly restricted to her bed (which was in fact a hospital bed delivered to our family home along with all the other paraphernalia of sickness), permanently catheterised, unable to walk or do anything for herself. Mom also had severe dementia and often mistook me for my recently-deceased Dad. As an immersive carer I managed a team of women who assisted me in the day with my mother’s personal care. The rest of the time I sat with her, or fed her, or tried to unblock her catheter (while going out of my mind), or sang with her. Naturally, the last activity was the most enjoyable. Despite her dementia, Mom had a seemingly inexhaustible trove of perfectly-remembered lyrics in her head. We sang Doris Day songs, the Bellamy Brothers, the Beautiful South, the Beatles, Tori Amos, the Hollies, Cyndi Lauper, the Mama and Papas, Simon and Garfunkel, ABBA, songs from musicals. Even new songs she had only heard once we tackled together. Somehow she remembered these lyrics too.But 16 months before Mom passed away she developed septicaemia and was rushed into hospital. Her organs were shutting down, her pulse was weak and fading fast. We were told her quality of life was so bad, her disability so extreme, that the hospital was to offer no treatment- it would be kinder to let her go.We didn’t. I won’t go into the whys and wherefores of that decision but at least one of my sisters- who had driven in terror the 150 miles from where she lived- thought that letting go would be an idea we should not entertain and I wavered, full of love for this extraordinary woman who had been the life and soul of any party when I was growing up, rock and rolling on the dance floor, full of fast wit and laughter that was infectious in its affirmation of life. The doctor in charge asked me for one piece of evidence that suggested my mother had any quality of life at all. We sing every day- we sing together all the time, I said. So he treated her and somehow, over 7 long and painful weeks, she became well enough to be sent back home and into my care.But what did this ‘well enough’ mean? Mom was no longer capable of swallowing so had had a peg inserted into her stomach. I was trained in the art of its upkeep- everyday the wound needed to be cleaned and the peg rotated 360 degrees (otherwise it would fuse to her skin). Any strength Mom had had in her arms had gone. To all intents and purposes she was incapable of moving anything but her head (a fraction), her eyes and mouth. But by and large Mom slept, in a virtual coma that meant our daily songs felt like a golden time remembered and grieved from the perspective of a new time of horrors. Three days after returning home and in a fever caused by kidney stones that were trying to be passed (another tier of Hell) Mom whispered to me, “I have had enough.”But of course it didn’t end there. Mom stayed in a limbo of pain and half-consciousness for well over another year. She would emit blood-curdling screams when being cleaned, when being moved, but she did not sing. Fed a noxious mixture through a machine, one of the few joys she had had left (sucking on a piece of chocolate or enjoying slow mouthfuls of a home-cooked dinner) had gone. It struck me sitting beside her that we had consigned her to an exit that was barbarous and devoid of love. All I could do was ensure she was as comfortable as possible and that, on the occasions she was awake, she could see that I was there, smiling at her and telling her I loved her more than the world.When the end time came we were told on three separate occasions that today was the day. But a little woman of 5’2”, ranked a Zero by hospital doctors when her ability was assessed, she defied every professional speculation and breathed on another day, then another, then another. When she died in November 2012, a few weeks shy of her 68th birthday, I have truly never seen such peace on a face.In the last year of her life Mom had been well enough on a handful of occasions to wake and smile at me and sing with me. One of these occasions I captured on video. We sit together, smiling, singing ‘Zip A Dee Doo Dah,’ (my oh my what a wonderful day) and she tells me she loves me. An exquisite moment that I am glad I captured. But was it really worth the 16 months of Hell she went through?Atul Gawande’s book is all about acceptance of our mortality. But it is about much more than that. Modern medicine has it wrong, he says. It is about preserving life at all costs- battle for a year through procedure after procedure rather than enjoy your remaining months of life at the best possible quality. Yes, it turns out the emergency room where my mother ended up in 2011 made the right call and we did not. But, by and large, if you have a life-limiting prognosis with a disease such as cancer you will be offered all sorts of treatments to extend that life at the detriment of its quality.But this is also a book about the way the elderly are treated in the industry of care homes and sheltered housing. With all meaning to life removed, with all responsibility removed, people become shells of their former selves, depressed and longing for the death that the (questionable) care they are receiving is preventing. Visionary projects from the 1970s- with more pets in care homes, with pairs of birds in every room for residents to have a vested interest in looking after, with children of staff visiting, filling the emptiness with the joy of activity, of noise- show that it is possible for care homes to be places of life rather than death. But it takes more effort to achieve this, more resources. More determination to give the elderly a life worth enjoying. And so, of course, such ideas largely fall by the wayside, because in a capitalist world the elderly are a drain on life, on resources... which is frankly sickening.I cannot stress enough how important this book is. It was, at times, a painful read for me, and that will be the case for anyone who has lost someone in a medicalised nightmare of end-time. But you owe it to yourself to understand what best befits you when your time comes. You owe it to yourself to choose your own ending. This book arms you with the knowledge to make the right decision, however painful that is.As for my mother.. after 3 touch and go trips to the hospital in the last year of her life I spoke to my sisters and told them it all came down to what we felt Mom would prefer- to die at home or have more and more (hopeless) treatment at hospital, where it was inevitable that one day she would happen to die. We agreed that just as my father had passed away at home, surrounded by people who loved him, our mother deserved the same. It was the best decision we made. She passed on in her home of 40 years held by those she loved and surrounded by their voices. She died in peace."
244,0805095152,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6468566-jennifer,2,"2.5 stars. Gawande has about three major points in this book, all of which were made in a news magazine article he wrote for the Atlantic: 1, We should have tough conversations with those in our lives about their vision for their end-of-life; 2, Doctors should also have these conversations with their patients; and 3, If we have these conversations, we can shift medicine and end-of-life care away from a stave-off-death model and towards a model that promotes humanity, autonomy, and dignity for the dying (and thus no longer need institutional nursing homes). I do not disagree, but the book itself is heavy on anecdotes and light on actual research or policy analysis.My major stylistic critique is that Gawande buries his three points in pages of anecdotes about patients and memories of his own father's decline and death. I'm not being unsympathetic to the suffering of these colorful characters (and Gawande's own personal suffering), but I found the anecdotes long-winded, distracting, and ultimately boring. Gawande intended them to have emotional impact for the reader, but for me, the stories smacked of filling pages for the pure commercial gain of selling a book. My major substantive critique is that Gawande spends too little time on policy, instead championing the heroism of individual doctors, caregivers, and entrepreneurs-- as if the system can be saved by some brave individuals. He is far too sanguine about the difficulty of changing institutions at the macro-level. Yes, Gawande mentions that these alternative living arrangements and alternative therapeutic approaches save money in the long run, but most of the initiatives Gawande covers were developed by private entrepreneurs, not governments (though some government funds may have been made available in the form of grants). Dramatic policy change would be needed to scale and fund these initiatives at the state or federal level, and I do not see the current vested interests in the healthcare lobby supporting these changes (nor does Gawande provide a path for fighting for policy change, besides mentioning the cost-effectiveness argument). The one scale-able initiative that Gawande discusses, Hospice, already exists-- but Gawande ignores that Hospice's ranks are often filled with low-skilled, under-paid, and over-worked caregivers who are hardly in the position to give the attentive, individualized care that Gawande received for his father. Gawande is also too sanguine about the role of socioeconomic class, which is perhaps why his friends and his patients receive such excellent care. He is wrapped in a bubble of privilege -- access to the top surgeons and the most committed nurses. True, some of the alternative homes that Gawande mentions do take Medicaid, but these homes are so few that they have waitlists that are hundreds of names long. The type of ""better death"" that Gawande argues for so eloquently is available only to the wealthiest or the most educated (those empowered to fight the system and search for better options). Without a serious treatment of the nexus between healthcare policy, quality of life, and socioeconomic status, this book seems to me squarely in the realm of theory, not practice. "
245,0805095152,http://goodreads.com/user/show/929238-hbalikov,5,"This is an excellent book. It is also the most important book that I have read in the past year.Dr. Gawande is that rare physician who can write well and write well for the layman. There is nothing glamorous about growing old. There is nothing glamorous in taking care of those who are growing old. As to the former, Gawande, makes it clear as he describes the way our bodies decline and breakdown over time. As to the later, it helps to explain both why very few doctors are attracted to gerontology and why those who aren't are not particularly adept at dealing with those who are at or near the end of their lives. This book is about ""what matters in the end,"" but it is also about Gawande's journey as a physician and surgeon. ""I never expected that among the most meaningful experiences I'd have as a doctor --- and, really, as a human being --- would come from helping others deal with what medicine cannot do as well as what it can.""Atul Gawande is meticulous in describing how we wear down and wear out. ""There is, he told me, 'no single, common cellular mechanism to the aging process.'....The process is gradual and unrelenting."" And, how many of us believe that we can put that aside for the present. ""People naturally prefer to avoid the subject of their decrepitude."" Yet, it colors many things that we do and many decisions that we have to make. In his own learning process, Gawande shares his experiences, and his encounters with doctors, other care givers and physicians. ""The job of any doctor, Bludau later told me, is to support quality of life, by which he meant two things: as much freedom from the ravages of disease as possible and the retention of enough function for active engagement in the world. Most doctors treat disease and figure that the rest will take care of itself.""He exposes a lot of the ""nursing home approach"" as insensitive with facilities that may come to resemble an asylum (in the worst sense). He explores the question, ""what makes life worth living when we are old and frail and unable to care for ourselves,"" is its many facets. There are: basic needs for survival; need for love and belonging; desire for growth (""the opportunity to attain personal goals, to master knowledge and skills, and to recognized and rewarded for our achievements); and, perhaps, ""self-fulfillment through pursuit or moral ideals and creativity for their own sake."" He points out that ""our driving motivations in life, instead of remaining constant, change hugely over time...""I learned a lot about how we often treat those who cannot care entirely for themselves and how attitudes and venues are changing. When doctors are just about ""tinkering"" with the seriously ill, a lot is ignored. Particularly, that those people ""have priorities (perhaps poorly expressed or not discussed) besides prolonging their lives. Surveys find that their top concerns include avoiding suffering, strengthening relationships with family and friends, being mentally alert, not being a burden to others, and achieving a sense that their life is complete.""I wish I had had this book to read before I found myself with friends and family members who were seriously ill or dying. Gawande describes how both amateur and professional caregivers can be sensitive to these issues. And, how they can give the ill and dying the opportunity to reflect on their own desires. One of those, for many, is that they would rather spend their remaining days at home instead of in an institution. There is a very illuminating section on hospice and how this should be explored far earlier than it currently is. Not necessarily invoking hospice care earlier, but being aware of what if can offer and, if desired, getting it going in time to make a difference with quality of life.""(Though), no one ever really has control. Physics and biology and accident ultimately have their way in our lives. But the point is that we are not helpless either. Courage is the strength to recognize BOTH realities. We have room to act, to shape our stories, though as time goes on it is within narrower and narrower confines. A few conclusions become clear when we understand this: that our most cruel failure in how we treat the sick and the aged is the failure to recognize that they have priorities beyond merely being safe and living longer; that the chance to shape one's story is essential to sustaining meaning in life; that we have the opportunity to refashion our institutions, our culture, and our conversations in ways that transform the possibilities for the last chapters of everyone's lives."""
246,0805095152,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1067741-susan,5,"If you have aging/elderly parents whose care you might someday be involved in, or expect to care for someone with a terminal condition, you cannot afford to miss this book. In his effortlessly lucid prose, Gawande comes to terms with the medical establishment's failure in providing end-of-life care. Too often, doctors work to fix what's broken in the service of extending life, without considering how quality of life is compromised, inflicting even more suffering as a result. He extols the value of hospice and palliative care, whose aim is not to give up on patients, but to provide as many good days as possible in the inevitable slide to death. He advocates asking difficult questions with patients and loved ones to determine what can bring meaning and value to them, even in the harsh narrowing of life's possibilities brought on by failing bodies and minds. He does not exempt himself from this critique -- instead he offers personal stories, iike those of his father and his daughter's piano teacher, to show how he came to understand the necessity of these important discussions and the possibilities they offer. It's moving, and timely, and despite the less-than-cheerful subject matter, never a burden to read (a testament to his writerly skill). I can't recommend this book highly enough to anyone who will face these issues -- and we all most likely will, in some form."
247,0805095152,http://goodreads.com/user/show/47188780-kathleen,5,"•	This is an important book for all who have elderly parents that are struggling with end-of-life health issues. Dr. Gawande personalizes the key issues through individual case histories, but he backs up his arguments with solid statistics. First, our society does not have enough gerontologists to serve our aging population, and our medical schools are cutting back on training new ones. More importantly, medical doctors tend to want to solve medical problems. And often, that results in them not recognizing, or even asking, what is important to their patient’s quality of life. The elderly want to live in ‘a home’, not an institution. They want to feel in control of their lives as much as possible. Safety is less of a concern to them than independence. Privacy is important too. They tend to want their own space, with furniture from their own home. They want to be able to turn on the television when and at what volume they want. These needs are not compatible with institutional long-term care facilities. So, new options are being explored—particularly in the United States. Highly recommend."

“A few conclusions become clear when we understand this: that our most cruel failure in how we treat the sick and the aged is the failure to recognize that they have priorities beyond merely being safe and living longer; that the chance to shape one’s story is essential to sustaining meaning in life; that we have the opportunity to refashion our institutions, our culture, and our conversations in ways that transform the possibilities for the last chapters of everyone’s lives.”

 This right here is the theme of Atul Gawande's Being Mortal: Medicine and What Matters in the End. This incredible piece of medical/science nonfiction starts out by introducing historical and cultural norms for caring for our elders and how this has significantly shifted in many societies. Mr. Gawande does not pass judgement but presents the observations and facts so we the reader may have an objective view which starts a journey of perspective. And when we view the world from another perspective, self-examination takes place, thus change. I absolutely loved this book. Many books I have been reading lately have been all about timing it seems. Last year, I watched both my grandfathers die (within 3 days of each other) and this year I am really beginning to take note of my parents and in-law's escalating aging. I guess chronic diseases, strokes, and fickle organs will do that to you. Like many self-centered Americans, I have been looking at the process in terms of what it means for me. How will my life change as they become more and more dependent on me? This book. This book! My perspective and priorities are forever altered. It is about me, after all I am living my life, but it is also about them. They want to be the author of their own life just as much as I do and if I'm lucky, they will live long enough to require assistance with that. They didn't ask for these complications and they fear the loss of independence far more than I could ever begin to imagine. The true terror: that no one will care.Mr. Gawande stresses that end of life conversations are crucial and surprisingly liberating, not only as a son or daughter but as a medical provider. There is a sense of control even in the midst of very uncontrollable circumstances. Questions need to be asked and once answers are decided upon, fear and anxiety of all parties involved can relax a bit. Your wishes will be respected in terms of what a quality life means to you. In a world of nursing homes that might as well be classified as prisons, knowing that someone listens and cares about what you want (despite the options and risks) is priceless. Mr. Gawande draws from his personal experience with his father in this respect and I found these parts to be incredibly raw and emotional. I strongly recommend this book. But if you don't read it, please remember these questions for your loved ones: 

“Whenever serious sickness or injury strikes and your body or mind breaks down, the vital questions are the same: What is your understanding of the situation and its potential outcomes? What are your fears and what are your hopes? What are the trade-offs you are willing to make and not willing to make? And what is the course of action that best serves this understanding?”

 Ask questions, advocate as needed, and enjoy this short life with the people you love ♥My favorite quote:""This is what it means to have autonomy -- you may not control life's circumstances, but getting to be the author of your life means getting to control what you do with them.”"
249,0805095152,http://goodreads.com/user/show/83445-lisa-vegan,5,"This book is excellent. It’s accessible and always interesting. It’s one of those books that probably everybody should read. I’m thinking every physician should read it upon graduating from medical school or during their residency. I think that it’s an important book.I do disagree with him at times, though overall think what he says is spot on.The parts where I disagree are in two major areas: The main one is his reluctance about supporting widespread assisted suicide because he says in those places, palliative hospice care isn’t as advanced an offering. However, even with hospice, I’ve witnessed horrible suffering, unbearable suffering, and it seems rare that people have none of that in their last days and weeks. I think both assisted suicide and competent hospice should always be options. I think not all hospices care works very well at all, though I know that some does. The other place I disagree is his contention that genetics isn’t as crucial to longevity as I think it is, especially in those families where so many live to over 100 and, I know by knowing them, that they often do not take at all good care of themselves, living in a way where others without their genes would die at much younger ages and with more infirmities before their deaths. The gist of what he says about quality of life when aged or with a terminal illness I agree with wholeheartedly though. A lot of what he says about that and examples he gives, makes the book fun to read. I really appreciated the several very personal stories, including his father’s story. So, not only do I not want to live until end stage cancer or ALS, etc. which I’ve always known, but I have no desire to get so old or sick that I can’t take care of myself – with my situation I wouldn’t end up at one of the good places and even those wouldn’t be great for me. These are issues I’ve thought about since about age 12, and I will do anything I can to avoid physical pain, nausea, shortness of breath, and other forms of suffering. Great book for getting readers to think about what they want when they’re elderly or have a life threatening illness, and also for having conversations about their wishes, and encouraging others in their lives to also share their wishes.The best thing about the book, and I wish 100% of medical people would get on board, is the weighing of what is worth it and not worth it to patients, and facing what medicine can’t do as well as what it can do. Not lying! Not evading! Not giving false hope! Allowing patients to take the lead with their own lives! Advocating that conversations should be had with the ill/elderly and doctors shouldn’t assume they know what should be done without knowing the patients’ goals and wishes for themselves. Early in the book, a death mentioned sounded exactly like my mother in 1964-1965 – I have to read that book! Books leading to other books…I'm still laughing about the 100 loose birds!!!"
250,0805095152,http://goodreads.com/user/show/632247-chrissie,3,"Before reading: I am reading this not because I want to but because I feel I ought to. Is it going to make me feel all horrible? I can accept this if it constructively explains what you can do to ""improve"" the end of life. In conclusion: I am glad I read the book, but it wasn’t particularly fun. There are many examples given of particular people, their illnesses and the difficulties they had, one being the author’s father. I didn’t understand all the medical terms used. Examples are given to illustrate the author’s conclusions on how medical care of the aging should be altered. The author, who is himself a surgeon, shows new, better alternatives and how they came to be. He does this by naming pioneers of better nursing homes, assisted care units and hospice development. For a person in the medical field I think this book is essential because it shows how medical changes need to be and can be implemented…., but I am not employed in the medical field and the historical developments, although interesting, were a bit extraneous for me. From my point of view, these sections could have been shortened, even if they do show the direction the author is supporting. One can ask, “Who is this book for?”In my family we have had several deaths in the past years. So the weaknesses coupled to end of life medical care, nursing homes and hospices were not new to me. I didn’t have to be told; I was not surprised in the least. What I wanted from this book were guidelines showing me how I could improve my husband’s and my own end of life. Did the book do this? Well, it made me face my own situation and what lay ahead. As a result of reading this book I will be looking into what alternatives are available here in Sweden when we are no longer able to manage alone. My husband and I have discussed exactly how we see the future. It has made clear to us that we value independence and that we want to stay where we are as long as possible – even if such living may be less safe than living near a hospital. We plan on looking in to Assisted Care Facilities that offer a gradual increase of care as needs increase. Do they have queues? Are they expensive? Where are they located? The essential point is that you have to know what you are looking for and that will be different for each family. So, yes, I am glad I read the book. It made me evaluate what is important to me – nature and independence and a dog and pretty landscape. The book pushed me to do this.  Another issue the book pushes you to evaluate is how long you want to extend the years of your life even if that time is filled with pain and discomfort. This too is a personal decision. The book guides you in what sort of questions you should ask your doctor, but of course some questions are specific to the illness one is coping with. Some conclusions are drawn that may be true for many, but not for my husband and I. Generally, most seem to want more contact with family as they age. This has its difficult sides too, and the book mentions this only briefly. I think more attention could have been devoted to this topic. While funeral wishes are important to discuss at life’s end, I found it unnecessary that the author discussed the details of his father’s funeral in this book.Practically nothing is said about how the elderly no longer want to travel. I may add that if you want to travel do it when you are young and fit. I am thankful to have traveled earlier in my life. The book is primarily concerned with American facilities, and practically nothing is said about costs. The audiobook is narrated by Robert Petkoff. It is read at a good speed. When good nursing facilities were being discussed he tended to sound SO enthused, SO exuberant. Really, I found this a bit childish. It doesn’t distort the text, but exaggerates how wonderful it all is. I could have done without this. The book has made me more appreciative of what I have. It has pushed my husband and me to evaluate which qualities of life we deem most important. With a clearer understanding of our preferences we can more easily deal with what lies ahead."
251,0805095152,http://goodreads.com/user/show/730754-ken,4,"Anyone who is planning on dying some day should read this book. It can be jumpy at times, but overall, Gawande's a straight shooting, no-nonsense writer who gives the straight dope on nursing homes, assisted living, hospice, and the heart-rending decisions we are all forced into at our end-of-days. As many of his accounts deal with cancer cases, it's a bit of a downer, but it's medicine to be taken and there's no better way to illustrate his point than through real-life examples, including his own father, who developed a fatal tumor in his spinal cord. God save us all from ends like this, but sorry, we all don't get to die suddenly and peacefully in our sleep.Among topics Gawande tackles: the dearth of geriatricians in this country. So ironic. So American. But the money is not there for doctors dedicated to our fastest growing demographic. Oh. And the preventative-style approach, the in-the-moment treatments needed to keep the elderly happy? Often not paid for by insurance companies, either.He also gets into nursing home/assisted living situations, focusing on the story of an upstate NY facility where a maverick doctor/director decided to introduce parakeets and live plants in every room as well as two cats and two dogs who had the run of the place. The nurses were thrown by this -- one refused to pick up a doggy mistake on the floor because that wasn't what she got a nursing license for -- but eventually everyone saw the seismic shift this simple yet dramatic change had on the previously-listless residents. The ""inmates"" (what they felt like, previously) started to perk up, tell people about the personalities of their parakeets, take a hand in caring for both plants and birds. Meanwhile, they became entranced with the wandering dogs and cats. Those patients who were ambulatory surprised the nurses by stepping up and volunteering to walk the dogs. The director had kids visit, too, providing training to middle schoolers on how to talk even with people with Alzheimer's. The young people's two or three visits a week became events to look forward to for the elderly residents, who, between pets and children, suddenly discovered purpose and felt more like human beings, more like they used to when they were living alone.There are other variations here, too, like assisted living purposely designed in pods of smaller units, created to look more like homes and less like institutions. Chief among the changes? Allowing people some privacy -- their own rooms. Giving them more leeway on what to do, when to eat. The schedules work around the people vs. vice versa.But the bulk of the book focuses on decisions and consequences. There are no definitive moves to make once a fatal disease begins its course, but Gawande shows that it's spinning a bit out of control in too many cases. The money being spent to prolong lives, often to make those lives so much more miserable just because people refuse to accept the oldest fact of life -- death -- is truly a scary thing. Modern medicine may be many things, but it is no match for Death, who remains undefeated. Still, there is a measure of victory to be had. For many people, that may mean a shorter but higher quality amount of time with family and friends. And, paradoxically, Gawande points to studies showing that many people who choose hospice care actually live longer than those who take the harsh and risky treatment road. They have less pain. They are happier. Together, these effects lead to slightly longer days with those they love. So, if you think hospice is a white flag, think again. It's not as simple as all that. Nor is this book. It's food for thought. Not that it will get any easier for you, the reader, when such choices visit you or your loved ones (and they will), but at least you'll have a better sense of balance and perspective. Can we ask for any more than that?"
252,0805095152,http://goodreads.com/user/show/275498-jim,5,"This is a brilliantly written book, and I was super-impressed with the genius of the good Dr Gawande right up to the point where he drank water out of the Ganges...I wouldn't do that at gunpoint! But while I might question the doc's wisdom in choice of beverages, I have to say he wrote a darn fine book.All of the occupants of this globe have a single thing in common...we will all die. Hopefully, we enjoy a long life and peaceful old age before our expiry date and, thanks to modern medicine and the care of good physicians, this is getting to be the reality for more people. This presents us with another problem: caring for a growing population of oldsters who require care as they ease their way into the hereafter. Families are getting smaller, so the progeny that would have cared for ailing seniors in the past are absent, or already employed. Expensive medical treatments are being employed to attempt to extend the lives of oldsters who would have slipped away without treatment, but at what cost? Frequently the result of this practice is that the medical treatment gives the patient an agonized existence suffering from side effects.Dr Gawande believes that, in most cases, if given a choice between having some quality time with loved ones or a possibly longer painful and befuddled existence under medical care, most people will choose the quality time even though it may be shorter. And here's another point to consider: Gawande has determined that 63% of doctors overestimate the amount of time a patient has to live, and that the better the doctor knows the patient, the more likely he/she will be to overestimate the patient's remaining time.Of interest to me was the fact that he basically confirmed an old homily my Granny used to toss out from time to time: ""A son is a son 'til he gets him a wife, but a daughter's a daughter for all of her life"". Here's what Dr Gawande had to say about the matter (from P. 79):  ""your chances of avoiding the nursing home are directly related to the number of children you have, and, according to what little research has been done, having at least one daughter seems to be crucial to the amount of help you will receive.""Naturally, one cannot always expect that sons and daughters will be able to care for them. Dr Gawande is firmly on the side of those who consult a palliative care specialist (From P.177):  ""The result; those who saw a palliative care specialist stopped chemotherapy sooner, entered hospice far earlier, experienced less suffering at the end of their lives - and they lived 25 percent longer. In other words, our decision making in medicine has failed so spectacularly that we have reached the point of actually inflicting harm on patients rather than confronting the subject of mortality.""This could have been a boring book...it wasn't. Dr Gawande has the gift of imparting information without making you feel like you are being tutored. A very interesting read, particularly for those of us who are around the last curve and racing toward the finish line."

254,0805095152,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5550397-britany,4,"Atul Gawande illustrates life as you age and how families must cope with aging parents.I appreciated learning about a topic that I knew little about previously. The difficulty of what to do with the aging population is an interesting and highly debatable (if not slightly depressing) topic. Gawande shares real life client stories, including his own family. This made this book relatable, who hasn't watched an elder age and eventually pass away. The best story was the one with the home that brought in dogs, cats, birds and plants. I just loved reading about the after effects of bringing life and small responsibilities in for the elderly residents. Innovating for this demographic brought hope to this challenging time in our history and while the topic is dark, this perspective shone a tiny light of hope for the future.Would highly recommend."
255,0805095152,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6041973-josh,4,"As I sit here at work, basically doing nothing but typing this review and speaking to my fiancé on Microsoft Lync, I am drinking a cup of coffee and wondering about my mortality.  Yes, I admit, I usually think of it more than once a day, sometimes twice a day, but never 4.5 times a day because that’s actually impossible.When reading Gawande’s ‘Being Mortal’, I found myself not questioning my own life, but many others; he exposed a sense of compassion in this misanthropic heart and how the geriatric community are treated in their final days.  His views on how doctors tend to be either vague or as he puts it, ‘Mr. Informative’, (saying too much about the disease and focusing more on it than the actual patient and their well-being) is a unique perspective from a doctor that actually cares for his patients.  Now, I’m not saying that doctors, as a whole do not, but the way it seems (from my knowledgeable perspective), they go in and out of doors seeing people like paying consumers instead of human beings and making it more of a business than actually trying to treat a person, much less about their well-being.The majority of the book takes us through first-hand accounts from the author; a multitude of case studies, that state interesting statistics about subjects such as: how people in their 50’s-90’s are leaning more towards living independently; how people with a terminal illness find themselves to want to die, rather than live out their days because of the guilt on how embarrassing and burdensome they may be to loved ones; how palliative care has helped many people in having a better life at home rather than being stuck with needles and prolonging their inevitable death in a place they hate to be (somewhat contradictory, yet for good reason, many that go through palliative care or hospice tend to live slightly longer than if they were laid up inside a hospital due to the quality of care towards the patient and not the disease); and how it takes courage to let go when no other option is available.His insight on these subjects is based on a close, personal relationship.  He saw how his own father dealt with terminal cancer for many years, but also used the methods of care listed above and it ended up being the right call; his father lived a lot longer than if he would’ve had extremely intrusive surgery and only had mild suffering, but always in a conscious state knowing what was being done to him, enjoying things before his final breath.Overall, I found much of the information helpful on drawing my own opinions on the matter and opened my eyes to other aspects.Many may find this book depressing because it deals with a subject that we cannot control ultimately, but with understanding and acceptance, we can manage the best we can."
256,0805095152,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7392004-quo,5,"I suspect that what makes some teachers revered is not just a mastery of the subject they mean to impart but that they also have retained an elemental sense of being a learner as well. One of the facets that impressed me most about Atul Gawande's Being Mortal: Medicine & What Matters in the End is that the author conveys the importance of the essential dialogue between doctor & patient by asking himself how he would like to be treated if he were the patient and not the medical specialist. To suggest that this is an important book is almost to diminish it, for Dr. Gawande involves the reader not just in reviewing a series of case studies & other background detail on how each of us attempts to deal with our own mortality but also causes something very personal to take place, the rare sensation of being spoken to directly in a meaningful, compassionate manner. For, as people become aware of the finitude of their life, they do not ask for much. They do not seek riches, they do not seek more power. They ask only to be permitted, insofar as possible, to keep shaping the story of their life in the world--to make choices & to sustain connections to others according to their own priorities.I found Being Mortal a treasure in many gradually unfolding ways. For example, little gerontological training occurs as a component part of medical school, so much so that many doctors feel they are often unable to offer treatment as much as the lure of hope. Dr. Gawande comments thatThere is almost always a long trail of possibility, however slim. However, we have built a multi-trillion dollar edifice for dispensing the medical equivalent of lottery tickets, while having only a rudimentary system to prepare patients for the near certainty that those tickets will not win. Hope is not a plan.Thus, 63% of M.D.'s overestimate survival time, not wanting to trample a patient's hopes, while only 17% underestimate survival time. Interestingly, if a doctor knows a patient well, he or she is more likely to be overly optimistic, ""even to the point of engaging in fantasy about experimental drugs to cure a patient or to extend life in an unrealistic way."" There are many humorous anecdotes which serve to relieve, at least in part, the difficult task of considering one's own mortality in this book, one being Philip Roth's comment that ""Old age is not a battle, it's a massacre."" And the late Harvard scientist & gifted writer, Prof. Steven Jay Gould, wistfully observed that ""the medium isn't always the message"", preferring the more realistic view of death as the ultimate enemy and finding nothing reproachable about those who ""rage against the dying of the light"", borrowing words from Dylan Thomas. Gould lived an additional 20 years after his original diagnosis. Another funny inclusion occurs when General Custer is compared with General Robert E. Lee, with the latter knowing when the battle could not be won.Included among the meaningful case studies is the story of Karen Brown Wilson on the west coast who develops a model for extended care or assisted living as an alternative to conventional nursing homes, though her new paradigm is quickly absorbed into a corporate structure & radically changed. Also, Dr. Bill Thomas in upstate New York, a restless Harvard Med School grad decides to attempt a new model for nursing homes, concluding that ""what was missing was life itself."" He introduces pets aplenty, including dogs, cats, birds and also inserts plants in each room to help confront the 3 plagues of nursing home existence: boredom, loneliness & helplessness. And, in so doing, he alters the relationship of patient to nursing home. Lastly, Dr. Atul Gawande's own father, also a surgeon & born in India, deals with his own mortality and when afflicted with cancer, he attempts to reinvent his life in a meaningful way during his remaining days by performing community service as a Rotarian and extending his ministry to a school he founded in his native India. Ultimately, Atul Gawande concludes that our ultimate goal should not be a good death but a good life till the very end and that assisted living is far more difficult than assisted death. In spite of the notion that every life ends in an execution, so to speak, there are countless uplifting vignettes of people dealing with their own mortality in a positive manner & with great courage in Dr. Gawande's wonderful book, Being Mortal and also in a one hour television episode of ""Frontline"", available via the Internet."

“Death is the enemy. But the enemy has superior forces. Eventually, it wins. And in a war that you cannot win, you don’t want a general who fights to the point of total annihilation. You don’t want Custer. You want Robert E. Lee, someone who knows how to fight for territory that can be won and how to surrender it when it can’t, someone who understands that the damage is greatest if all you do is battle to the bitter end.”

 “We’ve been wrong about what our job is in medicine. We think our job is to ensure health and survival. But really it is larger than that. It is to enable well-being.” 
This is not an easy simple-read. It is a brain-storming perspective-changing book.In all our modern medical learning and practice we aim at making life last ""longer"", but we should make it feel ""better""We try to elongate the lives of the elder, or the ""life"" of their bodies/corpses. Using unjustified mechanical ventilation, Inotropic support, unjustified high-risk operations and the result is an end-of-life ""lived"" in hospitals.
 “A few conclusions become clear when we understand this: that our most cruel failure in how we treat the sick and the aged is the failure to recognize that they have priorities beyond merely being safe and living longer; that the chance to shape one’s story is essential to sustaining meaning in life; that we have the opportunity to refashion our institutions, our culture, and our conversations in ways that transform the possibilities for the last chapters of everyone’s lives.” 

 “I learned about a lot of things in medical school, but mortality wasn’t one of them. Although I was given a dry, leathery corpse to dissect in my first term, that was solely a way to learn about human anatomy. Our textbooks had almost nothing on aging or frailty or dying. How the process unfolds, how people experience the end of their lives, and how it affects those around them seemed beside the point. The way we saw it, and the way our professors saw it, the purpose of medical schooling was to teach how to save lives, not how to tend to their demise.” 
This book is about how can we make life worth-living when we are too frail, too fragile, vulnerable and dependent.Our societies confronts these circumstances by avoiding talking about them, we all deny death, deny talking about it until it is too late.We designed nurseries to control the elder, their safety and their privacy and to make their lives impervious to change . . And the result is a life supposed to be safe, but empty of everything they care about.
 “It is not death that the very old tell me they fear. It is what happens short of death—losing their hearing, their memory, their best friends, their way of life. As Felix put it to me, “Old age is a continuous series of losses.” Philip Roth put it more bitterly in his novel Everyman: “Old age is not a battle. Old age is a massacre.” 
in this book you learn how to listen to them, to acknowledge their fears and how to feel their hopes. You will learn that death is inevitable, that you should respect death, you should respect aging, you should talk about it, and above all you should truly ""live"" to the very end of your life.
 “The problem with medicine and the institutions it has spawned for the care of the sick and the old is not that they have had an incorrect view of what makes life significant. The problem is that they have had almost no view at all. Medicine’s focus is narrow. Medical professionals concentrate on repair of health, not sustenance of the soul. Yet—and this is the painful paradox—we have decided that they should be the ones who largely define how we live in our waning days.” 

 “Sometimes we can offer a cure, sometimes only a salve, sometimes not even that. But whatever we can offer, our interventions, and the risks and sacrifices they entail, are justified only if they serve the larger aims of a person’s life. When we forget that, the suffering we inflict can be barbaric. When we remember it the good we do can be breathtaking.” 

 “Our ultimate goal, after all, is not a good death but a good life to the very end.” 

 “Death, of course, is not a failure. Death is normal. Death may be the enemy, but it is also the natural order of things.”

Should we want them to? At what cost – not to society or to our wallets, but at what cost to our humanity and dignity? Atul Gawunde, a surgeon in Boston Massachusetts, explores the ways in which medicine (and specifically American medicine and American society) helps and hinders the aged, the infirm, and the dying. If you know anyone who will someday die … stop reading this review and read this book.As he did in his previous books, Gawunde gives clear information and asks probing questions. He does not necessarily try to give us THE answer, but he does propose some alternatives, ultimately leaving the final answer up to each and every one of us. Having helped both my parents face their mortal ends, I can tell you that my family members and I – brothers, sister-in-law, and husband – have had many discussions about these issues over the past several years. Some of the physicians we encountered were open to such frank discussion, but not all were. There are difficult issues, heart-wrenching dilemmas, and anxiety-producing situations. But they do not get less difficult, less anxiety-producing, or less heart-wrenching when we ignore them. Oliver Sacks wrote the following blurb: “We have come to medicalize aging, frailty, and death, treating them as if they were just one more clinical problem to overcome. However it is not only medicine that is needed in one’s declining years but life – a life with meaning, a life as rich and full as possible under the circumstances. Being Mortal is not only wise and deeply moving, it is an essential and insightful book for our times…” WHY are you still reading this review? Read the book … NOW! Think carefully about what you want, and then talk about it – to your family, your friends, your doctors. Encourage them to read the book, too. Robert Petkoff does a superb job reading the audio book. There is a bonus interview with the author at the end of the audio version. "
259,0805095152,http://goodreads.com/user/show/24882791-india-m-clamp,4,"“Is empathy and kindness standard in geriatric medicine?” Why did Dr. Gawande find it disconcerting how old/frail patients are being treated? Why are parents cared for---as if they were made of gold---better in India?Truly an arduous journey on a path laden with geriatric patients and a transformation from independence to its’ opposite. This imposing trudge into considerations, care and realities of mortality and “how hope is an elixir.” Most elegantly summarized. Gawande writes: “Being Mortal is about the struggle to cope with the strength of our biology. We think our job is to insure health and survival but it is to enable well-being.” This communicates the goal for all engaging in the practice of medicine. This book is not for shy, sensitive or frail as it's an honest and blatantly truthful aperçu of what is/was observed by Dr. Gawande in geriatric medicine today. Educational and somber. Must read for all physicians. Buy and keep Kleenex on stand-by."
260,0805095152,http://goodreads.com/user/show/10312986-lyn-elliott,5,"We all want to live independent lives but as we age we are likely to lose at least some elements of that independence. This is easy to acknowledge, not so easy to come to terms with and certainly not easy to prepare for.Gawande's book is essential reading for anyone who is ageing themselves, or for anyone caring for somebody who is ill or frail enough to be approaching a state of dependency. Reading this has helped me to be aware of the questions I need to ask myself and those I care about. You can't ever assume you know what someone else really wants to do with their lives as they become dependent, or as they near death.How can you live well till the end, avoiding medically institutionalised interactions, treatments and living space? I wish I had read this before my parents became frail and certainly well before their last illnesses. This was an unusual book club choice, but then it's a great group of women. Not a wimp amongst us. "
261,0805095152,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2375838-cheryl,5,"There is a long phase in the first parts of our lives where, if we are lucky enough to have avoided critical disease or injury, we are blithely unaware of the effects of aging and of the inevitability of death. It seems so far ahead in the future as to be imaginary. Like imagining what a trillion dollars is like. You know that is a real thing, but still…it seems impossible to know what it really is. The other day I said to my teenage daughter, “Just imagine, in only forty years from now you will be standing in the kitchen with your partner and asking the same questions I’m asking now, like “When can we retire and go do what we really want?” “ She snorted. “Forty years? That’s ages from now!” And I’m saying, “no, forty years isn’t long at all! You will be planning your retirement!”She doesn’t really believe it.I sort of wish I had that back again. Those days of childhood, adolescence, young adulthood, where we never gave a thought to retirement, to aging, to death. Later on in life, we end up sometimes dwelling too much on those things, as if to make up for our inattention earlier. Nowadays, I sometimes feel hyper-aware of the universality of disease, the effects of aging, and shuffling off the mortal coil. It is unavoidable - I stare at it through the microscope daily as a pathologist. I often wonder which of those diseases that we hand out like playing cards will be the one dealt to me. “There’s no escaping the tragedy of life., which is that we are all aging from the day we are born… This experiment of making mortality a medical experience is just decades old. And the evidence is it is failing.”“Our reluctance to honestly examine the experience of aging and dying has increased the harm we inflict on people and denied them the basic comforts they most need.”The chapters of the book follow the course of our lives, and are richly illustrated with examples from Gawande’s own family and from his medical practice. Their stories are woven through the book, providing compelling and touching portraits. They are us. We are independent beings who are increasingly living longer and living independently longer.But ‘Things Fall Apart.’ “The culprit is just the accumulated crumbling of one’s bodily systems while medicine carries out its maintenance measures and patch jobs""“Human beings fail the way all complex systems fail: randomly and gradually…as the defects in a complex system increase, the time comes when just one more defect is enough to impair the whole, resulting in the condition known as frailty. It happens to power plants, cars, and large organizations. And it happens to us: eventually, one too many joints are damaged, one too many arteries calcify. There are no more backups. We wear down until we can’t wear down anymore.”So gradually, as the losses accumulate, we become Dependent. We need increasing amounts of Assistance, often in the form of retirement or nursing homes. These tend to provide an institutionalized life — that is not a good life, it’s just as good as can be got in the circumstances. But that robs us of our autonomy and our ability to make choices and to shape the story of our life in the world. “Whatever the limits and travails we face, we want to retain the autonomy—the freedom—to be the authors of our lives. This is the very marrow of being human” New models of care are evolving though, so people like 94 year old Lou are “…still able to live in a way that made him feel that he still had a place in this world.” I found this chapter particularly encouraging. The chapters on Letting Go and Hard Conversations are thoughtful, valuable discussions not only for clinical physicians, nurses and other members of the health care team, but also for anyone — patient, family, friend — who has reached that place where the end of life is in sight. “Technological society has forgotten what scholars call the “dying role” and its importance to people as life approaches its end. People want to share memories, pass on wisdoms and keepsakes, settle relationships, establish their legacies, make peace with God, and ensure that those who are left behind will be okay. They want to end their stories on their own terms.”Finally, Courage. “At least two kinds of courage are required in aging and sickness. The first is the courage to confront the reality of mortality—the courage to seek out the truth of what is to be feared and what is to be hoped.” We need the courage to act on the truth we find. One has to decide whether one’s fears or one’s hopes are what should matter most.This was a profoundly enriching book. It should be required reading for all health care professionals who work with seriously ill patients, and for those who work with the aged, and for those who run our health care systems, and for those who have aging/ill parents/relatives, and for those who are embarking on those final passages, and in some ways especially for those who haven’t yet reached those phases, so that they will be better prepared. It is intelligent, rational, touching, and warmly profound. It is a classic. "
262,0805095152,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4146473-connie,5," I read this a while ago, and it is a book that comes up quite often in conversation, and one that I highly recommend. For medical students, Dr's, nurses, anyone who works in medicine, anyone with aging parents and quite frankly anyone who is aging. Pretty much everyone I know. When talking about it I realized that though I remember it well and recommend it I had never written a review. So here you go. One of the first chapters tells the story of the author when he was shadowing a family practitioner. An elderly woman came in with her main complaint of heart issues. She also commented on poor balance and the Dr noted weight loss. The young writer was confused when the Dr. asked her if she ate alone. More confusion when the physician commented on her pretty manicure, which the patient proudly said she did herself. When the doctor asked her to remove her shoes, the young student was even more perplexed. Came to be that the older physician realized she could not trim her toenails, and they were hurting in her shoes, causing her to change her gait...and at a risk for losing her balance and falling. Another concern was her weight loss, as she did not eat well due to eating alone. She was much frailer and he worried a fall may result in a broken hip or worse. He recommended a podiatrist and that her family try to eat several meals with her throughout the week. He told the young student that he could give medicine for the heart....but a fall with a break would cause much distress and change in her quality of life. This is the basis of this book. Physicians need to learn to look at the whole person, not just the complaint. So often we see a ""specialist"" whose focus is on what they specialize in, and they miss the other signs. Believe me, I have seen this happen. Yet I have also seen those who look at the big picture and those folks are the ones I would want to care for me. We are often so busy trying to live longer. Yet sometimes, or often it is the ""quality"" not the ""quantity"" of our lives that matter. This author delves into this issue with first hand knowledge of patients he has treated as well as his own family members. He admits how hard it is to step back and not always have to ""fix"" everything, but learn to listen to what is important to his patient. We can all learn this lesson. How do we picture the end of our lives? What do we really need to do to achieve that?  This is a book that makes you think about aging, aging in place and aging well. It makes you think about maintaining dignity. I know I thought of this often with family members who were facing the end of life, and I often had to stop and listen to what it was that was important to them, not to me. I only hope that someone allows me that same choice."
263,0805095152,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7958239-elizabeth-theiss,5,"When is it time to stop fighting disease and death, and work instead on the best quality of life possible? Gawande has given us a wise and thoughtful discussion of how to approach the question, one I found helpful and convincing.As always Gawande uses stories to demonstrate the problems attendant to the medicalization of death. Doctors are trained to treat death as the enemy, not death as the inevitable. In an effort to forestall the inevitable, doctors' use every available tool from invasive surgeries to brutal successive chemo therapies that leave patients, that is, people, lingering in pain. As in The Checklist Manifesto, Gawande's solution is simple, a short set of questions that doctors should ask patients nearing the end of their lives. The conversation centers around what is most important to the person; what immediate goals are central; and what trade-offs between length of life and quality of life a person is willing to make. Gawande's ideas about nursing homes as places to avoid are spot on as well. His description of these ""homes"" driven by staff's needs for cookie cutter treatment of residents From assembly line pill dispensing to early morning shower times are downright depressing. We just sprang my husband from a month in a nursing home and it was exactly as described. But alternatives do exist, some better than others. The key seems to be finding a place that allows individual autonomy and provides support for quality of life. The one element ignored here is the cost of this kind of support; it is out of the reach of most people who need it and not supported by Medicare, despite the fact that it is less expensive than a traditional nursing home. My father was fortunate to live out the last two years of his life in a truly wonderful care center with a home-like environment, a small number of house mates, and home cooked meals each night. Gawande made me think we should just tear down the old ones and start over.I have spent a good deal of time thinking about these questions and problems as I helped my father through Alzheimer's and my spouse through 23 years of Parkinson's disease. Gawande has it exactly right and I'm hoping Being Mortal is a best seller so doctors and everyone else benefits from his perspective on what a good life and a good death means."
264,0805095152,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1608124-dana-stabenow,5,"I give this book five stars not because I loved it but because it is what I would call a necessary read, and I mean necessary for everyone, young, old, medical professional and laity alike. It's about That Conversation, what Gawande calls in one chapter ""Hard Conversations."" The subject is how we want to live out the end of our life.Gawande is a surgeon and one of the best parts of this book is that he is learning how to have this conversation himself. He's learning how to do it as a medical professional with his patients, and he's not shy about telling us where and how he has screwed up. He is also learning how to do it as a son to his father, also a surgeon, who has been diagnosed with a rare spinal tumor.The difficulty, he writes, is that in the last fifty years we have learned how to prolong life.As recently as 1945, most deaths occurred in the home. By the 1980s, just 17 percent did...Across not just the United States but also the entire industrialized world, the experience of advanced aging and death has shifted to hospitals and nursing homes...You don't have to spend much time with the elderly or those with terminal illness to see how often medicine fails the people it is supposed to help...Our reluctance to honestly examine the experience of aging and dying has increased the harm we inflict on people and denied them the basic comforts they most need.Later he writes You'd think people would have rebelled. You'd think we would have burned the nursing homes to the ground.But we haven't, and new discoveries and better medical practice mean that citizens of industrialized nations are living longer, healthier lives. ""A life,"" Gawande writes, ""designed to be safe but empty of anything they care about."" The trick now is to make sure our aging populations are not just safe, or even--heresy! sacrilege!--not safe at all, but living a life that achieves quality of life, not just quantity. The good news is, things are changing. (He doesn't say so but you know it has everything to do with the Boomers, a generation now making decisions for their parents, and who will soon be making those decisions--or not--for themselves.) Keren Brown Wilson built the first assisted living facility in Oregon in 1980, and when that concept became bastardized people like Dr. Tom Wilson revolutionized an assisted living facility with two dogs, four cats, 100 parakeets and child care for employees that brought children back into the lives of the inmates (using that word deliberately, as Gawande does himself). Researchers studied the effects of this program over two years, comparing a variety of measures for Chase's residents with those of residents at another nursing home nearby. Their study found that the number of prescriptions required per resident fell to half that of the control nursing home. Psychotropic drugs for agitation, like Haldol, decreased in particular. The total drug costs fell to just 38 percent of the comparison facility. Deaths fell 15 percent.From inmates locked away from life, warehoused until they died, Dr. Wilson's patients became once again members of a community. And as Gawande goes on to say, this experiment and others like it are beginning all across the nation.There is also Hospice, which organization Gawande's father chooses to help him through the end of his life with palliative care. For Hospice, it's all about making the end of each individual story as valuable to them as is physically possible for them. It's impossible to say enough good things about Hospice and Gawande doesn't stint them here. (Full disclosure: I already support Hospice and this book is making me double that support this year.) I know it sounds a little macabre, but this is the one book you really should read. Make a teenager read it and they will understand that much more about what Grandma is going through. Make a Millennial read it and he'll understand in spades how important that retirement plan is and how they should start one now. Make your doctor read it and she'll see how important first asking those essential questions is, ""What do you want? What is most important to you?"" instead of automatically reaching for the scalpel or the drugs. ""Death,"" writes Gawandeis normal. Death may be the enemy, but it is also the natural order of things. I knew these truths abstractly, but I didn't know them concretely--that they could be truths not just for everyone but also for this person right in front of me, for this person I was responsible for.Me, either. Now I feel like I do. Read this book, and recommend it to everyone you know. It is very frank, very well written, and actually? Kind of hopeful.****See also on Vox, ""2015 is the year America started having a sane conversation about death,"" http://www.vox.com/2015/12/16/1011744...."
265,0805095152,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3897817-morgan-blackledge,5,"This is a heart wrenchingly moving and important book. It speaks directly to our cultures strained and distant relationship to aging, the elderly, death and dying. Rarely if ever have I heard a medical clinician speak with such vulnerability and humility about the limits of modern medicine.French cultural theorist and urbanist Paul Virilio observed, with every invention or technical advance, an equally powerful disaster is co-created, for example, when we invented the locomotive, we simultaneously invented the train wreck.In a sense, Being Mortal is Dr. Atul Gawande's analogous observation about the incredible benefits of advanced medicine and the unprecedented opportunities for prolonged suffering and denial it affords us. I'm so grateful to be alive in this time, and science and technology have everything to do with that. Ordinary people have never had as much freedom to pursue knowledge or self expression as we currently enjoy.Advanced medicine is central to the high standard of living we currently have. It prolongs our lives and reduces suffering in many ways that we completely take for granted. But in a real sense, our faith in technology and medical advances has lulled us to sleep on some of life's most important and philosophical, psychological, and spiritual issues. Those of impermanence, suffering, loss and mortality.Our culture does a phenomenal job of keeping death and suffering out of plain sight. This affords the individuals facing these challenges the privacy and professional care that most people chose if given the option.This represents a real advance. But the equally powerful disaster that accompanies this advance is not trivial. The fact that most of us now live the majority of our lives insulated from the reality of death and dying means that we are quite likely to be utterly naive and under developed in this important existential domain.Frankly speaking, these are difficult and unsightly truths most of us would rather defer encountering. In the short term we enjoy the bliss that ignorance affords, but in the long term we suffer the numerous negative consequences that accompany the unexamined life.This book is attempting to address this issue by presenting us with a sober but empathetic and even optimistic view of the end of the road. Highly recommended, five stars."

268,0805095152,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4342402-tl,5,"See Caroline's review here:https://www.goodreads.com/review/show... (her review convinced me to pick this up)----She says it all beautifully so I will add my thoughts here (this'll be fairly short mostly cause my head hurts right now).This book brings up topics most of us don't think about when we are young. It seems too far away to contemplate so we put it out of our minds. Sure, we may talk about it time to time with our loved ones but how many of give it serious thought until something happens, let alone what questions to ask?The subject matter is a bit weighty in here but never felt dry or boring. There's feeling and passion  here. Gawande transports you into what he is talking about, like you are sitting with him at his kitchen table. The personal stories and histories he shares throughout the book were in turns touching and very informative. Of the former, a few had me tearing up and wanting to hug them all. The latter fascinated me, as I didn't know how those things all came about (one of those ""it has always been around"" that you just don't explore further) .I agreed with him on alot of the things he said and it got me thinking about my wishes on the future as well. Hopefully this will help with the hard conversation in the future (even though we wish we could live forever).This is an important book that should be on the bookshelves of everyone, in my humble opinion. Highly recommended.(Excuse any errors, typing on my phone)Narrator: Five starsBonus interview with the author was a nice touch."
269,0805095152,http://goodreads.com/user/show/28602001-emma,5,"An incredible book, but one that has the potential to cause considerable distress.‘Being Mortal’ is a book that addresses the experience of dying in modern society and questions whether we are getting it right. Chapters 1-5 focus primarily on mortality and the diverse nature of the end of life care provided for the elderly. Chapters 6-8 deal more specifically with how those with serious or terminal illnesses, and their families, cope with the process of dying. In these later chapters, the stories related by Gawande are frequently those in which the suffering and death of individuals is caused by cancer, including that of his own father. Though dying is an event that eventually comes to us all, it is a subject that is inherently difficult to address. In talking about our mortality, each person must confront not only the idea of their own death, but that of those who matter to them. It is entirely understandable that people choose to avoid discussing it. Yet Gawande’s book shows why it is important for everybody to stop putting aside the conversation about dying; that, in fact, refusing to tackle death until it is right upon you can lead to much greater pain and suffering. It is at this point when medical intervention takes over, often at the expense of compassion. Medical professionals would do well to read this book as part of their training and development, if only to understand how important honest communication can be to patient outcomes. They are only human, and as such, may feel as awkward about such matters as the rest of us, but they have a duty to provide accurate/truthful information about an individual’s illnesses/conditions so that they can have realistic expectations. Gawande argues that instead of defaulting to the most aggressive form of medical intervention, it is more important to talk to the individual about their goals, what is most important to them, what they can and can’t live with, what their fears and concerns are, what trade offs they are willing to make. Through discussion, a better path can be found for those who may be in pain or who are coming to the end of their life. Such conversations are necessarily incredibly difficult but Gawande highlights the benefits of having a plan put together by the individual, their family, and the medical professionals in collaboration; it is this honest dialogue that will allow an individual to manage their illness and the end of their life in a way that suits their needs. Gawande’s argument is empowering, it promotes the active role of the individual as the centre of their care and what happens to them. Within each chapter, Gawande often addresses what has happened in the past, what is happening now (including in different parts of the world), how people are trying to change things, and what the focus for the future should be. This plan means that the book is not depressing; it highlights the failures but injects positivity by showing ways in which things are being improved, or can/should be improved. At no point does Gawande fall into pessimism, he believes that while the majority of systems and institutions may not be meeting the needs of individuals right now, there is a chance that more of them will do so in the future. The book is his way of showing the difference between what is, and what should be, including examples of people and places that are getting it right. Importantly, Gawande is not prescriptive. He does not say ‘this is THE way to do things’, instead he shows how different solutions are being implemented. The variety of solutions reflect the multitude of differing ways people want and need to approach their ill health, old age, and death.       ‘Being Mortal’ is incredibly difficult to review. Given that I agree with Gawande, it would be easy to say that everyone should read this book. Yet in saying that, it feels like I am telling people that they need to deal with the idea of their death as soon as possible and, if they are currently unwell, that they should open a dialogue with their doctor to plan how they want it to proceed. It sounds more challenging when phrased this way, and is it not truly understandable that someone may not want to deal with the idea of their death by calmly talking through the steps? At the same time, I fundamentally believe Gawande’s argument that honest communication is the way forward for those who are living with terminal illness. Perhaps this is because I would rather make my own decisions while I can, and not leave them for others, who may have to guess what I might want in emergency situations if I hadn’t made my thoughts clear. The role of friends and family as support network seems intrinsically opposed to making these hard choices, the love and hope with which these decisions are made might not be compatible with the path I would want. Neither, perhaps, would the medical intervention. In modern society, people have become a medical problem to be solved, they must be ‘made safe’, increasingly separated from the rest of society and even from themselves, thereby removing any chance at individuality or choice. The problem is exacerbated by the disconnection between what medicine can do and what it should do. Gawande treats the grave and emotive subject matter with respect and conviction. At the end of someone’s life, or as they cope with ill health, he wants people to be able to have choices, to focus on what’s important to the , and to be supported in those goals by everyone around them. This is what I will hope for. "
270,0805095152,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2231715-lewis-weinstein,5,"This book is not pleasant to read. It is challenging, emotional, difficult ... and a spectacular journey along a path we will all follow. As we face the inevitable, Gawande gives us a framework within which to consider the options we may have, the choices we might want to make, and the medical and/or other assistance we may or may not desire. His thoughtful discussion of the people he has accompanied through their dying days, including his father, provides much to stimulate our own thoughts. The central theme is that these decisions should be, to the maximum possible extent, the patient's, with family and medical input, and not the other way around. In Gawande's experience that process, difficult and uncertain as it may be, yields the best results for all those involved."
271,0805095152,http://goodreads.com/user/show/10770371-dan,5,"Being Mortal by Atul GawandeGawande, as a surgeon, steps us through the reality of life’s waning moments. There is a heavy focus on cancer and old age and decisions around hospice care. Not easy subject matter but very useful information. I didn’t get choked up until the end of the book when the author takes us through the last few months of his father’s life as he battled cancer. The US is different from nearly all other countries in the world in how we deal with the elderly. As Americans we don’t live with aging parents and by extension a significant percentage of the elderly are put into retirement homes when they can no longer maintain independence. Gawande points out that our bodies are like machines and quite literally wear out. Most end of life situations spend a great deal of time on pain management and medications and often in the waning days, an inability to digest food.Some interesting facts. “By the age of sixty, people in an industrialized country like the United States have lost, on average, a third of their teeth. After eighty-five, almost 40 percent have no teeth at all.”Philip Roth said “Old age is not a battle. Old age is a massacre.”Gawande also discusses Do Not Resuscitate directives. There is part of a chapter where he recalls interning at a Boston area hospital. On one night he forgets that a patient had signed a DNR. When the patient goes into cardiac arrest, it sets in motion the CPR team to come revive the patient. When Gawande realizes his mistake and tries to call it off he is pushed aside. When the revival effort fails he is tongue lashed by the CPR team. The author feels very strongly about the value of hospice care. Almost everyone, if given the choice, would choose to die at home versus the hospital but the latter situation is still the norm. Sometimes because others have to make the medical decisions when the elderly become incapacitated. 4.5 stars. The writing here is easy to follow and the stories are quite compelling. There is also a lot of practical advice. The book was published in 2014. Highly recommended."
272,0805095152,http://goodreads.com/user/show/8079403-max,5,"This is an important book, whether you are approaching old age or family or friends you care about are. It set my mind spinning thinking how I would deal with the situations Gawande describes. Coming face to face with one’s decline and death is at least depressing and can be terrifying. Gawande points out that the medical profession and most of our institutions are not designed to deal with the human problem. He identifies a number of changes that could be made at a policy level that would improve things. But the fundamental problem is knowing ourselves and communicating our wishes or helping loved ones to reflect and do the same. Gawande points to helpful experiences with hospice care, but we must first make that decision. My notes follow.Gawande explains how growing old has changed and how we in developed countries have adjusted or failed to adjust to it. As the twentieth century wore on medicine made great advances and people’s life spans increased significantly. At the beginning of the century people would stay relatively healthy as they aged until they met a devastating disease, say the flu or cancer or heart disease. These would usually kill people rather quickly and they would die in their homes near friends and family. Now modern medicine fixes most of these problems, at least temporarily, so as people age their health ratchets down step by step. Eventually many of us will be unable to care for ourselves while the doctors keep us alive. There are in home services available and assisted living facilities for those who can afford them. But for the average person without significant savings this is a serious financial as well as personal dilemma and too often ends with a person’s final days spent in an impersonal nursing home.Both medical care for the elderly and institutional care suffer from the same problem – task orientation rather than people orientation. Doctors are trained to fix your issue and keep you alive, not evaluate the impact on your overall quality of life. Similarly institutions for the elderly are designed to meet set goals: To keep you safe, ensure you get your medications, get you fed, keep you clean, etc. The staff is rated on these things and focus on them, but they create an environment their residents typically hate. And of course many institutions don’t meet even basic standards. So the modern way of growing old often means becoming disabled enough to have to leave your home with little choice but to share a room with a stranger in an institutional environment. Gawande paints a grim picture of our future, but he also points to people trying to change things. These people are focused more on care than treatment. The woman who pioneered assisted living was looking for an alternative to the nursing home, not a stepping stone as it too often is. Others have tried to change the focus of nursing homes to enrich the lives of the residents through measures that allow more autonomy to the residents and less regimentation. The design of nursing homes can make them seem more like real homes and less like institutions. The more residents can participate, have choices, have outside interests, the better they will feel and do. Efficiency and safety have to be balanced against their effect on the patient’s quality of life. Throughout life we take reasonable chances to get more out of living. Why should that stop when time becomes short, when it is most precious?Gawande discusses terminal illness and the inevitable decision of whether to stop treatment. Doctors tend not to be helpful. They give choices of your treatment options. That is their job. But today there is hospice and palliative care. When is this a reasonable choice? The decision is personal. Doctors and family can’t really make it which is why drawing out the feelings of the patient is so important. From Gawande’s examples there is clearly a point in which treatment does more harm than good. We all want to die with some dignity and as little pain as possible. We all would rather die in a bed where we can say goodbye to friends and family rather than on a respirator in an ICU. But it is difficult to give up hope that the next procedure might work or buy us significant time. The decision is a tradeoff to achieve some quality of life at the end. Gawande talks about his own father’s case. His father, also a doctor, had terminal cancer and was facing paralysis. It took what Gawande calls the hard conversation to make the decision to accept hospice and the inevitable. In a testimony to the notion that the most sophisticated doctor may not be the best choice to initiate this conversation, Gawande’s father’s feelings were skillfully drawn out by a small town nurse practitioner from the local hospice. She was interested in him, his problems as he saw them, not in the disease and its treatment."
273,0805095152,http://goodreads.com/user/show/9049915-james-barker,5,"It is commonly phrased that we battle illness. But this remarkable book by Atul Gawande points out that it is an ill-thought battle and, dare I say it, an ill-fought one.For the last three years of my wonderful mother’s life I was her carer. Coping with the advanced stages of multiple sclerosis she was mostly restricted to her bed (which was in fact a hospital bed delivered to our family home along with all the other paraphernalia of sickness), permanently catheterised, unable to walk or do anything for herself. Mom also had severe dementia and often mistook me for my recently-deceased Dad. As an immersive carer I managed a team of women who assisted me in the day with my mother’s personal care. The rest of the time I sat with her, or fed her, or tried to unblock her catheter (while going out of my mind), or sang with her. Naturally, the last activity was the most enjoyable. Despite her dementia, Mom had a seemingly inexhaustible trove of perfectly-remembered lyrics in her head. We sang Doris Day songs, the Bellamy Brothers, the Beautiful South, the Beatles, Tori Amos, the Hollies, Cyndi Lauper, the Mama and Papas, Simon and Garfunkel, ABBA, songs from musicals. Even new songs she had only heard once we tackled together. Somehow she remembered these lyrics too.But 16 months before Mom passed away she developed septicaemia and was rushed into hospital. Her organs were shutting down, her pulse was weak and fading fast. We were told her quality of life was so bad, her disability so extreme, that the hospital was to offer no treatment- it would be kinder to let her go.We didn’t. I won’t go into the whys and wherefores of that decision but at least one of my sisters- who had driven in terror the 150 miles from where she lived- thought that letting go would be an idea we should not entertain and I wavered, full of love for this extraordinary woman who had been the life and soul of any party when I was growing up, rock and rolling on the dance floor, full of fast wit and laughter that was infectious in its affirmation of life. The doctor in charge asked me for one piece of evidence that suggested my mother had any quality of life at all. We sing every day- we sing together all the time, I said. So he treated her and somehow, over 7 long and painful weeks, she became well enough to be sent back home and into my care.But what did this ‘well enough’ mean? Mom was no longer capable of swallowing so had had a peg inserted into her stomach. I was trained in the art of its upkeep- everyday the wound needed to be cleaned and the peg rotated 360 degrees (otherwise it would fuse to her skin). Any strength Mom had had in her arms had gone. To all intents and purposes she was incapable of moving anything but her head (a fraction), her eyes and mouth. But by and large Mom slept, in a virtual coma that meant our daily songs felt like a golden time remembered and grieved from the perspective of a new time of horrors. Three days after returning home and in a fever caused by kidney stones that were trying to be passed (another tier of Hell) Mom whispered to me, “I have had enough.”But of course it didn’t end there. Mom stayed in a limbo of pain and half-consciousness for well over another year. She would emit blood-curdling screams when being cleaned, when being moved, but she did not sing. Fed a noxious mixture through a machine, one of the few joys she had had left (sucking on a piece of chocolate or enjoying slow mouthfuls of a home-cooked dinner) had gone. It struck me sitting beside her that we had consigned her to an exit that was barbarous and devoid of love. All I could do was ensure she was as comfortable as possible and that, on the occasions she was awake, she could see that I was there, smiling at her and telling her I loved her more than the world.When the end time came we were told on three separate occasions that today was the day. But a little woman of 5’2”, ranked a Zero by hospital doctors when her ability was assessed, she defied every professional speculation and breathed on another day, then another, then another. When she died in November 2012, a few weeks shy of her 68th birthday, I have truly never seen such peace on a face.In the last year of her life Mom had been well enough on a handful of occasions to wake and smile at me and sing with me. One of these occasions I captured on video. We sit together, smiling, singing ‘Zip A Dee Doo Dah,’ (my oh my what a wonderful day) and she tells me she loves me. An exquisite moment that I am glad I captured. But was it really worth the 16 months of Hell she went through?Atul Gawande’s book is all about acceptance of our mortality. But it is about much more than that. Modern medicine has it wrong, he says. It is about preserving life at all costs- battle for a year through procedure after procedure rather than enjoy your remaining months of life at the best possible quality. Yes, it turns out the emergency room where my mother ended up in 2011 made the right call and we did not. But, by and large, if you have a life-limiting prognosis with a disease such as cancer you will be offered all sorts of treatments to extend that life at the detriment of its quality.But this is also a book about the way the elderly are treated in the industry of care homes and sheltered housing. With all meaning to life removed, with all responsibility removed, people become shells of their former selves, depressed and longing for the death that the (questionable) care they are receiving is preventing. Visionary projects from the 1970s- with more pets in care homes, with pairs of birds in every room for residents to have a vested interest in looking after, with children of staff visiting, filling the emptiness with the joy of activity, of noise- show that it is possible for care homes to be places of life rather than death. But it takes more effort to achieve this, more resources. More determination to give the elderly a life worth enjoying. And so, of course, such ideas largely fall by the wayside, because in a capitalist world the elderly are a drain on life, on resources... which is frankly sickening.I cannot stress enough how important this book is. It was, at times, a painful read for me, and that will be the case for anyone who has lost someone in a medicalised nightmare of end-time. But you owe it to yourself to understand what best befits you when your time comes. You owe it to yourself to choose your own ending. This book arms you with the knowledge to make the right decision, however painful that is.As for my mother.. after 3 touch and go trips to the hospital in the last year of her life I spoke to my sisters and told them it all came down to what we felt Mom would prefer- to die at home or have more and more (hopeless) treatment at hospital, where it was inevitable that one day she would happen to die. We agreed that just as my father had passed away at home, surrounded by people who loved him, our mother deserved the same. It was the best decision we made. She passed on in her home of 40 years held by those she loved and surrounded by their voices. She died in peace."
274,0805095152,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6468566-jennifer,2,"2.5 stars. Gawande has about three major points in this book, all of which were made in a news magazine article he wrote for the Atlantic: 1, We should have tough conversations with those in our lives about their vision for their end-of-life; 2, Doctors should also have these conversations with their patients; and 3, If we have these conversations, we can shift medicine and end-of-life care away from a stave-off-death model and towards a model that promotes humanity, autonomy, and dignity for the dying (and thus no longer need institutional nursing homes). I do not disagree, but the book itself is heavy on anecdotes and light on actual research or policy analysis.My major stylistic critique is that Gawande buries his three points in pages of anecdotes about patients and memories of his own father's decline and death. I'm not being unsympathetic to the suffering of these colorful characters (and Gawande's own personal suffering), but I found the anecdotes long-winded, distracting, and ultimately boring. Gawande intended them to have emotional impact for the reader, but for me, the stories smacked of filling pages for the pure commercial gain of selling a book. My major substantive critique is that Gawande spends too little time on policy, instead championing the heroism of individual doctors, caregivers, and entrepreneurs-- as if the system can be saved by some brave individuals. He is far too sanguine about the difficulty of changing institutions at the macro-level. Yes, Gawande mentions that these alternative living arrangements and alternative therapeutic approaches save money in the long run, but most of the initiatives Gawande covers were developed by private entrepreneurs, not governments (though some government funds may have been made available in the form of grants). Dramatic policy change would be needed to scale and fund these initiatives at the state or federal level, and I do not see the current vested interests in the healthcare lobby supporting these changes (nor does Gawande provide a path for fighting for policy change, besides mentioning the cost-effectiveness argument). The one scale-able initiative that Gawande discusses, Hospice, already exists-- but Gawande ignores that Hospice's ranks are often filled with low-skilled, under-paid, and over-worked caregivers who are hardly in the position to give the attentive, individualized care that Gawande received for his father. Gawande is also too sanguine about the role of socioeconomic class, which is perhaps why his friends and his patients receive such excellent care. He is wrapped in a bubble of privilege -- access to the top surgeons and the most committed nurses. True, some of the alternative homes that Gawande mentions do take Medicaid, but these homes are so few that they have waitlists that are hundreds of names long. The type of ""better death"" that Gawande argues for so eloquently is available only to the wealthiest or the most educated (those empowered to fight the system and search for better options). Without a serious treatment of the nexus between healthcare policy, quality of life, and socioeconomic status, this book seems to me squarely in the realm of theory, not practice. "
275,0805095152,http://goodreads.com/user/show/929238-hbalikov,5,"This is an excellent book. It is also the most important book that I have read in the past year.Dr. Gawande is that rare physician who can write well and write well for the layman. There is nothing glamorous about growing old. There is nothing glamorous in taking care of those who are growing old. As to the former, Gawande, makes it clear as he describes the way our bodies decline and breakdown over time. As to the later, it helps to explain both why very few doctors are attracted to gerontology and why those who aren't are not particularly adept at dealing with those who are at or near the end of their lives. This book is about ""what matters in the end,"" but it is also about Gawande's journey as a physician and surgeon. ""I never expected that among the most meaningful experiences I'd have as a doctor --- and, really, as a human being --- would come from helping others deal with what medicine cannot do as well as what it can.""Atul Gawande is meticulous in describing how we wear down and wear out. ""There is, he told me, 'no single, common cellular mechanism to the aging process.'....The process is gradual and unrelenting."" And, how many of us believe that we can put that aside for the present. ""People naturally prefer to avoid the subject of their decrepitude."" Yet, it colors many things that we do and many decisions that we have to make. In his own learning process, Gawande shares his experiences, and his encounters with doctors, other care givers and physicians. ""The job of any doctor, Bludau later told me, is to support quality of life, by which he meant two things: as much freedom from the ravages of disease as possible and the retention of enough function for active engagement in the world. Most doctors treat disease and figure that the rest will take care of itself.""He exposes a lot of the ""nursing home approach"" as insensitive with facilities that may come to resemble an asylum (in the worst sense). He explores the question, ""what makes life worth living when we are old and frail and unable to care for ourselves,"" is its many facets. There are: basic needs for survival; need for love and belonging; desire for growth (""the opportunity to attain personal goals, to master knowledge and skills, and to recognized and rewarded for our achievements); and, perhaps, ""self-fulfillment through pursuit or moral ideals and creativity for their own sake."" He points out that ""our driving motivations in life, instead of remaining constant, change hugely over time...""I learned a lot about how we often treat those who cannot care entirely for themselves and how attitudes and venues are changing. When doctors are just about ""tinkering"" with the seriously ill, a lot is ignored. Particularly, that those people ""have priorities (perhaps poorly expressed or not discussed) besides prolonging their lives. Surveys find that their top concerns include avoiding suffering, strengthening relationships with family and friends, being mentally alert, not being a burden to others, and achieving a sense that their life is complete.""I wish I had had this book to read before I found myself with friends and family members who were seriously ill or dying. Gawande describes how both amateur and professional caregivers can be sensitive to these issues. And, how they can give the ill and dying the opportunity to reflect on their own desires. One of those, for many, is that they would rather spend their remaining days at home instead of in an institution. There is a very illuminating section on hospice and how this should be explored far earlier than it currently is. Not necessarily invoking hospice care earlier, but being aware of what if can offer and, if desired, getting it going in time to make a difference with quality of life.""(Though), no one ever really has control. Physics and biology and accident ultimately have their way in our lives. But the point is that we are not helpless either. Courage is the strength to recognize BOTH realities. We have room to act, to shape our stories, though as time goes on it is within narrower and narrower confines. A few conclusions become clear when we understand this: that our most cruel failure in how we treat the sick and the aged is the failure to recognize that they have priorities beyond merely being safe and living longer; that the chance to shape one's story is essential to sustaining meaning in life; that we have the opportunity to refashion our institutions, our culture, and our conversations in ways that transform the possibilities for the last chapters of everyone's lives."""
276,0805095152,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1067741-susan,5,"If you have aging/elderly parents whose care you might someday be involved in, or expect to care for someone with a terminal condition, you cannot afford to miss this book. In his effortlessly lucid prose, Gawande comes to terms with the medical establishment's failure in providing end-of-life care. Too often, doctors work to fix what's broken in the service of extending life, without considering how quality of life is compromised, inflicting even more suffering as a result. He extols the value of hospice and palliative care, whose aim is not to give up on patients, but to provide as many good days as possible in the inevitable slide to death. He advocates asking difficult questions with patients and loved ones to determine what can bring meaning and value to them, even in the harsh narrowing of life's possibilities brought on by failing bodies and minds. He does not exempt himself from this critique -- instead he offers personal stories, iike those of his father and his daughter's piano teacher, to show how he came to understand the necessity of these important discussions and the possibilities they offer. It's moving, and timely, and despite the less-than-cheerful subject matter, never a burden to read (a testament to his writerly skill). I can't recommend this book highly enough to anyone who will face these issues -- and we all most likely will, in some form."
277,0805095152,http://goodreads.com/user/show/47188780-kathleen,5,"•	This is an important book for all who have elderly parents that are struggling with end-of-life health issues. Dr. Gawande personalizes the key issues through individual case histories, but he backs up his arguments with solid statistics. First, our society does not have enough gerontologists to serve our aging population, and our medical schools are cutting back on training new ones. More importantly, medical doctors tend to want to solve medical problems. And often, that results in them not recognizing, or even asking, what is important to their patient’s quality of life. The elderly want to live in ‘a home’, not an institution. They want to feel in control of their lives as much as possible. Safety is less of a concern to them than independence. Privacy is important too. They tend to want their own space, with furniture from their own home. They want to be able to turn on the television when and at what volume they want. These needs are not compatible with institutional long-term care facilities. So, new options are being explored—particularly in the United States. Highly recommend."

 This right here is the theme of Atul Gawande's Being Mortal: Medicine and What Matters in the End. This incredible piece of medical/science nonfiction starts out by introducing historical and cultural norms for caring for our elders and how this has significantly shifted in many societies. Mr. Gawande does not pass judgement but presents the observations and facts so we the reader may have an objective view which starts a journey of perspective. And when we view the world from another perspective, self-examination takes place, thus change. I absolutely loved this book. Many books I have been reading lately have been all about timing it seems. Last year, I watched both my grandfathers die (within 3 days of each other) and this year I am really beginning to take note of my parents and in-law's escalating aging. I guess chronic diseases, strokes, and fickle organs will do that to you. Like many self-centered Americans, I have been looking at the process in terms of what it means for me. How will my life change as they become more and more dependent on me? This book. This book! My perspective and priorities are forever altered. It is about me, after all I am living my life, but it is also about them. They want to be the author of their own life just as much as I do and if I'm lucky, they will live long enough to require assistance with that. They didn't ask for these complications and they fear the loss of independence far more than I could ever begin to imagine. The true terror: that no one will care.Mr. Gawande stresses that end of life conversations are crucial and surprisingly liberating, not only as a son or daughter but as a medical provider. There is a sense of control even in the midst of very uncontrollable circumstances. Questions need to be asked and once answers are decided upon, fear and anxiety of all parties involved can relax a bit. Your wishes will be respected in terms of what a quality life means to you. In a world of nursing homes that might as well be classified as prisons, knowing that someone listens and cares about what you want (despite the options and risks) is priceless. Mr. Gawande draws from his personal experience with his father in this respect and I found these parts to be incredibly raw and emotional. I strongly recommend this book. But if you don't read it, please remember these questions for your loved ones: 

“Whenever serious sickness or injury strikes and your body or mind breaks down, the vital questions are the same: What is your understanding of the situation and its potential outcomes? What are your fears and what are your hopes? What are the trade-offs you are willing to make and not willing to make? And what is the course of action that best serves this understanding?”

 Ask questions, advocate as needed, and enjoy this short life with the people you love ♥My favorite quote:""This is what it means to have autonomy -- you may not control life's circumstances, but getting to be the author of your life means getting to control what you do with them.”"

I’m thinking every physician should read it upon graduating from medical school or during their residency. I think that it’s an important book.I do disagree with him at times, though overall think what he says is spot on.The parts where I disagree are in two major areas: The main one is his reluctance about supporting widespread assisted suicide because he says in those places, palliative hospice care isn’t as advanced an offering. However, even with hospice, I’ve witnessed horrible suffering, unbearable suffering, and it seems rare that people have none of that in their last days and weeks. I think both assisted suicide and competent hospice should always be options. I think not all hospices care works very well at all, though I know that some does. The other place I disagree is his contention that genetics isn’t as crucial to longevity as I think it is, especially in those families where so many live to over 100 and, I know by knowing them, that they often do not take at all good care of themselves, living in a way where others without their genes would die at much younger ages and with more infirmities before their deaths. The gist of what he says about quality of life when aged or with a terminal illness I agree with wholeheartedly though. A lot of what he says about that and examples he gives, makes the book fun to read. I really appreciated the several very personal stories, including his father’s story. So, not only do I not want to live until end stage cancer or ALS, etc. which I’ve always known, but I have no desire to get so old or sick that I can’t take care of myself – with my situation I wouldn’t end up at one of the good places and even those wouldn’t be great for me. These are issues I’ve thought about since about age 12, and I will do anything I can to avoid physical pain, nausea, shortness of breath, and other forms of suffering. Great book for getting readers to think about what they want when they’re elderly or have a life threatening illness, and also for having conversations about their wishes, and encouraging others in their lives to also share their wishes.The best thing about the book, and I wish 100% of medical people would get on board, is the weighing of what is worth it and not worth it to patients, and facing what medicine can’t do as well as what it can do. Not lying! Not evading! Not giving false hope! Allowing patients to take the lead with their own lives! Advocating that conversations should be had with the ill/elderly and doctors shouldn’t assume they know what should be done without knowing the patients’ goals and wishes for themselves. Early in the book, a death mentioned sounded exactly like my mother in 1964-1965 – I have to read that book! Books leading to other books…I'm still laughing about the 100 loose birds!!!"
280,0805095152,http://goodreads.com/user/show/632247-chrissie,3,"Before reading: I am reading this not because I want to but because I feel I ought to. Is it going to make me feel all horrible? I can accept this if it constructively explains what you can do to ""improve"" the end of life. In conclusion: I am glad I read the book, but it wasn’t particularly fun. There are many examples given of particular people, their illnesses and the difficulties they had, one being the author’s father. I didn’t understand all the medical terms used. Examples are given to illustrate the author’s conclusions on how medical care of the aging should be altered. The author, who is himself a surgeon, shows new, better alternatives and how they came to be. He does this by naming pioneers of better nursing homes, assisted care units and hospice development. For a person in the medical field I think this book is essential because it shows how medical changes need to be and can be implemented…., but I am not employed in the medical field and the historical developments, although interesting, were a bit extraneous for me. From my point of view, these sections could have been shortened, even if they do show the direction the author is supporting. One can ask, “Who is this book for?”In my family we have had several deaths in the past years. So the weaknesses coupled to end of life medical care, nursing homes and hospices were not new to me. I didn’t have to be told; I was not surprised in the least. What I wanted from this book were guidelines showing me how I could improve my husband’s and my own end of life. Did the book do this? Well, it made me face my own situation and what lay ahead. As a result of reading this book I will be looking into what alternatives are available here in Sweden when we are no longer able to manage alone. My husband and I have discussed exactly how we see the future. It has made clear to us that we value independence and that we want to stay where we are as long as possible – even if such living may be less safe than living near a hospital. We plan on looking in to Assisted Care Facilities that offer a gradual increase of care as needs increase. Do they have queues? Are they expensive? Where are they located? The essential point is that you have to know what you are looking for and that will be different for each family. So, yes, I am glad I read the book. It made me evaluate what is important to me – nature and independence and a dog and pretty landscape. The book pushed me to do this.  Another issue the book pushes you to evaluate is how long you want to extend the years of your life even if that time is filled with pain and discomfort. This too is a personal decision. The book guides you in what sort of questions you should ask your doctor, but of course some questions are specific to the illness one is coping with. Some conclusions are drawn that may be true for many, but not for my husband and I. Generally, most seem to want more contact with family as they age. This has its difficult sides too, and the book mentions this only briefly. I think more attention could have been devoted to this topic. While funeral wishes are important to discuss at life’s end, I found it unnecessary that the author discussed the details of his father’s funeral in this book.Practically nothing is said about how the elderly no longer want to travel. I may add that if you want to travel do it when you are young and fit. I am thankful to have traveled earlier in my life. The book is primarily concerned with American facilities, and practically nothing is said about costs. The audiobook is narrated by Robert Petkoff. It is read at a good speed. When good nursing facilities were being discussed he tended to sound SO enthused, SO exuberant. Really, I found this a bit childish. It doesn’t distort the text, but exaggerates how wonderful it all is. I could have done without this. The book has made me more appreciative of what I have. It has pushed my husband and me to evaluate which qualities of life we deem most important. With a clearer understanding of our preferences we can more easily deal with what lies ahead."
281,0805095152,http://goodreads.com/user/show/730754-ken,4,"Anyone who is planning on dying some day should read this book. It can be jumpy at times, but overall, Gawande's a straight shooting, no-nonsense writer who gives the straight dope on nursing homes, assisted living, hospice, and the heart-rending decisions we are all forced into at our end-of-days. As many of his accounts deal with cancer cases, it's a bit of a downer, but it's medicine to be taken and there's no better way to illustrate his point than through real-life examples, including his own father, who developed a fatal tumor in his spinal cord. God save us all from ends like this, but sorry, we all don't get to die suddenly and peacefully in our sleep.Among topics Gawande tackles: the dearth of geriatricians in this country. So ironic. So American. But the money is not there for doctors dedicated to our fastest growing demographic. Oh. And the preventative-style approach, the in-the-moment treatments needed to keep the elderly happy? Often not paid for by insurance companies, either.He also gets into nursing home/assisted living situations, focusing on the story of an upstate NY facility where a maverick doctor/director decided to introduce parakeets and live plants in every room as well as two cats and two dogs who had the run of the place. The nurses were thrown by this -- one refused to pick up a doggy mistake on the floor because that wasn't what she got a nursing license for -- but eventually everyone saw the seismic shift this simple yet dramatic change had on the previously-listless residents. The ""inmates"" (what they felt like, previously) started to perk up, tell people about the personalities of their parakeets, take a hand in caring for both plants and birds. Meanwhile, they became entranced with the wandering dogs and cats. Those patients who were ambulatory surprised the nurses by stepping up and volunteering to walk the dogs. The director had kids visit, too, providing training to middle schoolers on how to talk even with people with Alzheimer's. The young people's two or three visits a week became events to look forward to for the elderly residents, who, between pets and children, suddenly discovered purpose and felt more like human beings, more like they used to when they were living alone.There are other variations here, too, like assisted living purposely designed in pods of smaller units, created to look more like homes and less like institutions. Chief among the changes? Allowing people some privacy -- their own rooms. Giving them more leeway on what to do, when to eat. The schedules work around the people vs. vice versa.But the bulk of the book focuses on decisions and consequences. There are no definitive moves to make once a fatal disease begins its course, but Gawande shows that it's spinning a bit out of control in too many cases. The money being spent to prolong lives, often to make those lives so much more miserable just because people refuse to accept the oldest fact of life -- death -- is truly a scary thing. Modern medicine may be many things, but it is no match for Death, who remains undefeated. Still, there is a measure of victory to be had. For many people, that may mean a shorter but higher quality amount of time with family and friends. And, paradoxically, Gawande points to studies showing that many people who choose hospice care actually live longer than those who take the harsh and risky treatment road. They have less pain. They are happier. Together, these effects lead to slightly longer days with those they love. So, if you think hospice is a white flag, think again. It's not as simple as all that. Nor is this book. It's food for thought. Not that it will get any easier for you, the reader, when such choices visit you or your loved ones (and they will), but at least you'll have a better sense of balance and perspective. Can we ask for any more than that?"
282,0805095152,http://goodreads.com/user/show/275498-jim,5,"This is a brilliantly written book, and I was super-impressed with the genius of the good Dr Gawande right up to the point where he drank water out of the Ganges...I wouldn't do that at gunpoint! But while I might question the doc's wisdom in choice of beverages, I have to say he wrote a darn fine book.All of the occupants of this globe have a single thing in common...we will all die. Hopefully, we enjoy a long life and peaceful old age before our expiry date and, thanks to modern medicine and the care of good physicians, this is getting to be the reality for more people. This presents us with another problem: caring for a growing population of oldsters who require care as they ease their way into the hereafter. Families are getting smaller, so the progeny that would have cared for ailing seniors in the past are absent, or already employed. Expensive medical treatments are being employed to attempt to extend the lives of oldsters who would have slipped away without treatment, but at what cost? Frequently the result of this practice is that the medical treatment gives the patient an agonized existence suffering from side effects.Dr Gawande believes that, in most cases, if given a choice between having some quality time with loved ones or a possibly longer painful and befuddled existence under medical care, most people will choose the quality time even though it may be shorter. And here's another point to consider: Gawande has determined that 63% of doctors overestimate the amount of time a patient has to live, and that the better the doctor knows the patient, the more likely he/she will be to overestimate the patient's remaining time.Of interest to me was the fact that he basically confirmed an old homily my Granny used to toss out from time to time: ""A son is a son 'til he gets him a wife, but a daughter's a daughter for all of her life"". Here's what Dr Gawande had to say about the matter (from P. 79):  ""your chances of avoiding the nursing home are directly related to the number of children you have, and, according to what little research has been done, having at least one daughter seems to be crucial to the amount of help you will receive.""Naturally, one cannot always expect that sons and daughters will be able to care for them. Dr Gawande is firmly on the side of those who consult a palliative care specialist (From P.177):  ""The result; those who saw a palliative care specialist stopped chemotherapy sooner, entered hospice far earlier, experienced less suffering at the end of their lives - and they lived 25 percent longer. In other words, our decision making in medicine has failed so spectacularly that we have reached the point of actually inflicting harm on patients rather than confronting the subject of mortality.""This could have been a boring book...it wasn't. Dr Gawande has the gift of imparting information without making you feel like you are being tutored. A very interesting read, particularly for those of us who are around the last curve and racing toward the finish line."

284,0805095152,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5550397-britany,4,"Atul Gawande illustrates life as you age and how families must cope with aging parents.I appreciated learning about a topic that I knew little about previously. The difficulty of what to do with the aging population is an interesting and highly debatable (if not slightly depressing) topic. Gawande shares real life client stories, including his own family. This made this book relatable, who hasn't watched an elder age and eventually pass away. The best story was the one with the home that brought in dogs, cats, birds and plants. I just loved reading about the after effects of bringing life and small responsibilities in for the elderly residents. Innovating for this demographic brought hope to this challenging time in our history and while the topic is dark, this perspective shone a tiny light of hope for the future.Would highly recommend."
285,0805095152,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6041973-josh,4,"As I sit here at work, basically doing nothing but typing this review and speaking to my fiancé on Microsoft Lync, I am drinking a cup of coffee and wondering about my mortality.  Yes, I admit, I usually think of it more than once a day, sometimes twice a day, but never 4.5 times a day because that’s actually impossible.When reading Gawande’s ‘Being Mortal’, I found myself not questioning my own life, but many others; he exposed a sense of compassion in this misanthropic heart and how the geriatric community are treated in their final days.  His views on how doctors tend to be either vague or as he puts it, ‘Mr. Informative’, (saying too much about the disease and focusing more on it than the actual patient and their well-being) is a unique perspective from a doctor that actually cares for his patients.  Now, I’m not saying that doctors, as a whole do not, but the way it seems (from my knowledgeable perspective), they go in and out of doors seeing people like paying consumers instead of human beings and making it more of a business than actually trying to treat a person, much less about their well-being.The majority of the book takes us through first-hand accounts from the author; a multitude of case studies, that state interesting statistics about subjects such as: how people in their 50’s-90’s are leaning more towards living independently; how people with a terminal illness find themselves to want to die, rather than live out their days because of the guilt on how embarrassing and burdensome they may be to loved ones; how palliative care has helped many people in having a better life at home rather than being stuck with needles and prolonging their inevitable death in a place they hate to be (somewhat contradictory, yet for good reason, many that go through palliative care or hospice tend to live slightly longer than if they were laid up inside a hospital due to the quality of care towards the patient and not the disease); and how it takes courage to let go when no other option is available.His insight on these subjects is based on a close, personal relationship.  He saw how his own father dealt with terminal cancer for many years, but also used the methods of care listed above and it ended up being the right call; his father lived a lot longer than if he would’ve had extremely intrusive surgery and only had mild suffering, but always in a conscious state knowing what was being done to him, enjoying things before his final breath.Overall, I found much of the information helpful on drawing my own opinions on the matter and opened my eyes to other aspects.Many may find this book depressing because it deals with a subject that we cannot control ultimately, but with understanding and acceptance, we can manage the best we can."
286,0805095152,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7392004-quo,5,"I suspect that what makes some teachers revered is not just a mastery of the subject they mean to impart but that they also have retained an elemental sense of being a learner as well. One of the facets that impressed me most about Atul Gawande's Being Mortal: Medicine & What Matters in the End is that the author conveys the importance of the essential dialogue between doctor & patient by asking himself how he would like to be treated if he were the patient and not the medical specialist. To suggest that this is an important book is almost to diminish it, for Dr. Gawande involves the reader not just in reviewing a series of case studies & other background detail on how each of us attempts to deal with our own mortality but also causes something very personal to take place, the rare sensation of being spoken to directly in a meaningful, compassionate manner. For, as people become aware of the finitude of their life, they do not ask for much. They do not seek riches, they do not seek more power. They ask only to be permitted, insofar as possible, to keep shaping the story of their life in the world--to make choices & to sustain connections to others according to their own priorities.I found Being Mortal a treasure in many gradually unfolding ways. For example, little gerontological training occurs as a component part of medical school, so much so that many doctors feel they are often unable to offer treatment as much as the lure of hope. Dr. Gawande comments thatThere is almost always a long trail of possibility, however slim. However, we have built a multi-trillion dollar edifice for dispensing the medical equivalent of lottery tickets, while having only a rudimentary system to prepare patients for the near certainty that those tickets will not win. Hope is not a plan.Thus, 63% of M.D.'s overestimate survival time, not wanting to trample a patient's hopes, while only 17% underestimate survival time. Interestingly, if a doctor knows a patient well, he or she is more likely to be overly optimistic, ""even to the point of engaging in fantasy about experimental drugs to cure a patient or to extend life in an unrealistic way."" There are many humorous anecdotes which serve to relieve, at least in part, the difficult task of considering one's own mortality in this book, one being Philip Roth's comment that ""Old age is not a battle, it's a massacre."" And the late Harvard scientist & gifted writer, Prof. Steven Jay Gould, wistfully observed that ""the medium isn't always the message"", preferring the more realistic view of death as the ultimate enemy and finding nothing reproachable about those who ""rage against the dying of the light"", borrowing words from Dylan Thomas. Gould lived an additional 20 years after his original diagnosis. Another funny inclusion occurs when General Custer is compared with General Robert E. Lee, with the latter knowing when the battle could not be won.Included among the meaningful case studies is the story of Karen Brown Wilson on the west coast who develops a model for extended care or assisted living as an alternative to conventional nursing homes, though her new paradigm is quickly absorbed into a corporate structure & radically changed. Also, Dr. Bill Thomas in upstate New York, a restless Harvard Med School grad decides to attempt a new model for nursing homes, concluding that ""what was missing was life itself."" He introduces pets aplenty, including dogs, cats, birds and also inserts plants in each room to help confront the 3 plagues of nursing home existence: boredom, loneliness & helplessness. And, in so doing, he alters the relationship of patient to nursing home. Lastly, Dr. Atul Gawande's own father, also a surgeon & born in India, deals with his own mortality and when afflicted with cancer, he attempts to reinvent his life in a meaningful way during his remaining days by performing community service as a Rotarian and extending his ministry to a school he founded in his native India. Ultimately, Atul Gawande concludes that our ultimate goal should not be a good death but a good life till the very end and that assisted living is far more difficult than assisted death. In spite of the notion that every life ends in an execution, so to speak, there are countless uplifting vignettes of people dealing with their own mortality in a positive manner & with great courage in Dr. Gawande's wonderful book, Being Mortal and also in a one hour television episode of ""Frontline"", available via the Internet."

“Death is the enemy. But the enemy has superior forces. Eventually, it wins. And in a war that you cannot win, you don’t want a general who fights to the point of total annihilation. You don’t want Custer. You want Robert E. Lee, someone who knows how to fight for territory that can be won and how to surrender it when it can’t, someone who understands that the damage is greatest if all you do is battle to the bitter end.”

 “We’ve been wrong about what our job is in medicine. We think our job is to ensure health and survival. But really it is larger than that. It is to enable well-being.” 
This is not an easy simple-read. It is a brain-storming perspective-changing book.In all our modern medical learning and practice we aim at making life last ""longer"", but we should make it feel ""better""We try to elongate the lives of the elder, or the ""life"" of their bodies/corpses. Using unjustified mechanical ventilation, Inotropic support, unjustified high-risk operations and the result is an end-of-life ""lived"" in hospitals.
 “A few conclusions become clear when we understand this: that our most cruel failure in how we treat the sick and the aged is the failure to recognize that they have priorities beyond merely being safe and living longer; that the chance to shape one’s story is essential to sustaining meaning in life; that we have the opportunity to refashion our institutions, our culture, and our conversations in ways that transform the possibilities for the last chapters of everyone’s lives.” 

 “I learned about a lot of things in medical school, but mortality wasn’t one of them. Although I was given a dry, leathery corpse to dissect in my first term, that was solely a way to learn about human anatomy. Our textbooks had almost nothing on aging or frailty or dying. How the process unfolds, how people experience the end of their lives, and how it affects those around them seemed beside the point. The way we saw it, and the way our professors saw it, the purpose of medical schooling was to teach how to save lives, not how to tend to their demise.” 
This book is about how can we make life worth-living when we are too frail, too fragile, vulnerable and dependent.Our societies confronts these circumstances by avoiding talking about them, we all deny death, deny talking about it until it is too late.We designed nurseries to control the elder, their safety and their privacy and to make their lives impervious to change . . And the result is a life supposed to be safe, but empty of everything they care about.
 “It is not death that the very old tell me they fear. It is what happens short of death—losing their hearing, their memory, their best friends, their way of life. As Felix put it to me, “Old age is a continuous series of losses.” Philip Roth put it more bitterly in his novel Everyman: “Old age is not a battle. Old age is a massacre.” 
in this book you learn how to listen to them, to acknowledge their fears and how to feel their hopes. You will learn that death is inevitable, that you should respect death, you should respect aging, you should talk about it, and above all you should truly ""live"" to the very end of your life.
 “The problem with medicine and the institutions it has spawned for the care of the sick and the old is not that they have had an incorrect view of what makes life significant. The problem is that they have had almost no view at all. Medicine’s focus is narrow. Medical professionals concentrate on repair of health, not sustenance of the soul. Yet—and this is the painful paradox—we have decided that they should be the ones who largely define how we live in our waning days.” 

 “Sometimes we can offer a cure, sometimes only a salve, sometimes not even that. But whatever we can offer, our interventions, and the risks and sacrifices they entail, are justified only if they serve the larger aims of a person’s life. When we forget that, the suffering we inflict can be barbaric. When we remember it the good we do can be breathtaking.” 

 “Our ultimate goal, after all, is not a good death but a good life to the very end.” 

 “Death, of course, is not a failure. Death is normal. Death may be the enemy, but it is also the natural order of things.”

Should we want them to? At what cost – not to society or to our wallets, but at what cost to our humanity and dignity? Atul Gawunde, a surgeon in Boston Massachusetts, explores the ways in which medicine (and specifically American medicine and American society) helps and hinders the aged, the infirm, and the dying. If you know anyone who will someday die … stop reading this review and read this book.As he did in his previous books, Gawunde gives clear information and asks probing questions. He does not necessarily try to give us THE answer, but he does propose some alternatives, ultimately leaving the final answer up to each and every one of us. Having helped both my parents face their mortal ends, I can tell you that my family members and I – brothers, sister-in-law, and husband – have had many discussions about these issues over the past several years. Some of the physicians we encountered were open to such frank discussion, but not all were. There are difficult issues, heart-wrenching dilemmas, and anxiety-producing situations. But they do not get less difficult, less anxiety-producing, or less heart-wrenching when we ignore them. Oliver Sacks wrote the following blurb: “We have come to medicalize aging, frailty, and death, treating them as if they were just one more clinical problem to overcome. However it is not only medicine that is needed in one’s declining years but life – a life with meaning, a life as rich and full as possible under the circumstances. Being Mortal is not only wise and deeply moving, it is an essential and insightful book for our times…” WHY are you still reading this review? Read the book … NOW! Think carefully about what you want, and then talk about it – to your family, your friends, your doctors. Encourage them to read the book, too. Robert Petkoff does a superb job reading the audio book. There is a bonus interview with the author at the end of the audio version. "

Why are parents cared for---as if they were made of gold---better in India?Truly an arduous journey on a path laden with geriatric patients and a transformation from independence to its’ opposite. This imposing trudge into considerations, care and realities of mortality and “how hope is an elixir.” Most elegantly summarized. Gawande writes: “Being Mortal is about the struggle to cope with the strength of our biology. We think our job is to insure health and survival but it is to enable well-being.” This communicates the goal for all engaging in the practice of medicine. This book is not for shy, sensitive or frail as it's an honest and blatantly truthful aperçu of what is/was observed by Dr. Gawande in geriatric medicine today. Educational and somber. Must read for all physicians. Buy and keep Kleenex on stand-by."

This is easy to acknowledge, not so easy to come to terms with and certainly not easy to prepare for.Gawande's book is essential reading for anyone who is ageing themselves, or for anyone caring for somebody who is ill or frail enough to be approaching a state of dependency. Reading this has helped me to be aware of the questions I need to ask myself and those I care about. You can't ever assume you know what someone else really wants to do with their lives as they become dependent, or as they near death.How can you live well till the end, avoiding medically institutionalised interactions, treatments and living space? I wish I had read this before my parents became frail and certainly well before their last illnesses. This was an unusual book club choice, but then it's a great group of women.

291,0805095152,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2375838-cheryl,5,"There is a long phase in the first parts of our lives where, if we are lucky enough to have avoided critical disease or injury, we are blithely unaware of the effects of aging and of the inevitability of death. It seems so far ahead in the future as to be imaginary. Like imagining what a trillion dollars is like. You know that is a real thing, but still…it seems impossible to know what it really is. The other day I said to my teenage daughter, “Just imagine, in only forty years from now you will be standing in the kitchen with your partner and asking the same questions I’m asking now, like “When can we retire and go do what we really want?” “ She snorted. “Forty years? That’s ages from now!” And I’m saying, “no, forty years isn’t long at all! You will be planning your retirement!”She doesn’t really believe it.I sort of wish I had that back again. Those days of childhood, adolescence, young adulthood, where we never gave a thought to retirement, to aging, to death. Later on in life, we end up sometimes dwelling too much on those things, as if to make up for our inattention earlier. Nowadays, I sometimes feel hyper-aware of the universality of disease, the effects of aging, and shuffling off the mortal coil. It is unavoidable - I stare at it through the microscope daily as a pathologist. I often wonder which of those diseases that we hand out like playing cards will be the one dealt to me. “There’s no escaping the tragedy of life., which is that we are all aging from the day we are born… This experiment of making mortality a medical experience is just decades old. And the evidence is it is failing.”“Our reluctance to honestly examine the experience of aging and dying has increased the harm we inflict on people and denied them the basic comforts they most need.”The chapters of the book follow the course of our lives, and are richly illustrated with examples from Gawande’s own family and from his medical practice. Their stories are woven through the book, providing compelling and touching portraits. They are us. We are independent beings who are increasingly living longer and living independently longer.But ‘Things Fall Apart.’ “The culprit is just the accumulated crumbling of one’s bodily systems while medicine carries out its maintenance measures and patch jobs""“Human beings fail the way all complex systems fail: randomly and gradually…as the defects in a complex system increase, the time comes when just one more defect is enough to impair the whole, resulting in the condition known as frailty. It happens to power plants, cars, and large organizations. And it happens to us: eventually, one too many joints are damaged, one too many arteries calcify. There are no more backups. We wear down until we can’t wear down anymore.”So gradually, as the losses accumulate, we become Dependent. We need increasing amounts of Assistance, often in the form of retirement or nursing homes. These tend to provide an institutionalized life — that is not a good life, it’s just as good as can be got in the circumstances. But that robs us of our autonomy and our ability to make choices and to shape the story of our life in the world. “Whatever the limits and travails we face, we want to retain the autonomy—the freedom—to be the authors of our lives. This is the very marrow of being human” New models of care are evolving though, so people like 94 year old Lou are “…still able to live in a way that made him feel that he still had a place in this world.” I found this chapter particularly encouraging. The chapters on Letting Go and Hard Conversations are thoughtful, valuable discussions not only for clinical physicians, nurses and other members of the health care team, but also for anyone — patient, family, friend — who has reached that place where the end of life is in sight. “Technological society has forgotten what scholars call the “dying role” and its importance to people as life approaches its end. People want to share memories, pass on wisdoms and keepsakes, settle relationships, establish their legacies, make peace with God, and ensure that those who are left behind will be okay. They want to end their stories on their own terms.”Finally, Courage. “At least two kinds of courage are required in aging and sickness. The first is the courage to confront the reality of mortality—the courage to seek out the truth of what is to be feared and what is to be hoped.” We need the courage to act on the truth we find. One has to decide whether one’s fears or one’s hopes are what should matter most.This was a profoundly enriching book. It should be required reading for all health care professionals who work with seriously ill patients, and for those who work with the aged, and for those who run our health care systems, and for those who have aging/ill parents/relatives, and for those who are embarking on those final passages, and in some ways especially for those who haven’t yet reached those phases, so that they will be better prepared. It is intelligent, rational, touching, and warmly profound. It is a classic. "
292,0805095152,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4146473-connie,5," I read this a while ago, and it is a book that comes up quite often in conversation, and one that I highly recommend. For medical students, Dr's, nurses, anyone who works in medicine, anyone with aging parents and quite frankly anyone who is aging. Pretty much everyone I know. When talking about it I realized that though I remember it well and recommend it I had never written a review. So here you go. One of the first chapters tells the story of the author when he was shadowing a family practitioner. An elderly woman came in with her main complaint of heart issues. She also commented on poor balance and the Dr noted weight loss. The young writer was confused when the Dr. asked her if she ate alone. More confusion when the physician commented on her pretty manicure, which the patient proudly said she did herself. When the doctor asked her to remove her shoes, the young student was even more perplexed. Came to be that the older physician realized she could not trim her toenails, and they were hurting in her shoes, causing her to change her gait...and at a risk for losing her balance and falling. Another concern was her weight loss, as she did not eat well due to eating alone. She was much frailer and he worried a fall may result in a broken hip or worse. He recommended a podiatrist and that her family try to eat several meals with her throughout the week. He told the young student that he could give medicine for the heart....but a fall with a break would cause much distress and change in her quality of life. This is the basis of this book. Physicians need to learn to look at the whole person, not just the complaint. So often we see a ""specialist"" whose focus is on what they specialize in, and they miss the other signs. Believe me, I have seen this happen. Yet I have also seen those who look at the big picture and those folks are the ones I would want to care for me. We are often so busy trying to live longer. Yet sometimes, or often it is the ""quality"" not the ""quantity"" of our lives that matter. This author delves into this issue with first hand knowledge of patients he has treated as well as his own family members. He admits how hard it is to step back and not always have to ""fix"" everything, but learn to listen to what is important to his patient. We can all learn this lesson. How do we picture the end of our lives? What do we really need to do to achieve that?  This is a book that makes you think about aging, aging in place and aging well. It makes you think about maintaining dignity. I know I thought of this often with family members who were facing the end of life, and I often had to stop and listen to what it was that was important to them, not to me. I only hope that someone allows me that same choice."
293,0805095152,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7958239-elizabeth-theiss,5,"When is it time to stop fighting disease and death, and work instead on the best quality of life possible? Gawande has given us a wise and thoughtful discussion of how to approach the question, one I found helpful and convincing.As always Gawande uses stories to demonstrate the problems attendant to the medicalization of death. Doctors are trained to treat death as the enemy, not death as the inevitable. In an effort to forestall the inevitable, doctors' use every available tool from invasive surgeries to brutal successive chemo therapies that leave patients, that is, people, lingering in pain. As in The Checklist Manifesto, Gawande's solution is simple, a short set of questions that doctors should ask patients nearing the end of their lives. The conversation centers around what is most important to the person; what immediate goals are central; and what trade-offs between length of life and quality of life a person is willing to make. Gawande's ideas about nursing homes as places to avoid are spot on as well. His description of these ""homes"" driven by staff's needs for cookie cutter treatment of residents From assembly line pill dispensing to early morning shower times are downright depressing. We just sprang my husband from a month in a nursing home and it was exactly as described. But alternatives do exist, some better than others. The key seems to be finding a place that allows individual autonomy and provides support for quality of life. The one element ignored here is the cost of this kind of support; it is out of the reach of most people who need it and not supported by Medicare, despite the fact that it is less expensive than a traditional nursing home. My father was fortunate to live out the last two years of his life in a truly wonderful care center with a home-like environment, a small number of house mates, and home cooked meals each night. Gawande made me think we should just tear down the old ones and start over.I have spent a good deal of time thinking about these questions and problems as I helped my father through Alzheimer's and my spouse through 23 years of Parkinson's disease. Gawande has it exactly right and I'm hoping Being Mortal is a best seller so doctors and everyone else benefits from his perspective on what a good life and a good death means."
294,0805095152,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1608124-dana-stabenow,5,"I give this book five stars not because I loved it but because it is what I would call a necessary read, and I mean necessary for everyone, young, old, medical professional and laity alike. It's about That Conversation, what Gawande calls in one chapter ""Hard Conversations."" The subject is how we want to live out the end of our life.Gawande is a surgeon and one of the best parts of this book is that he is learning how to have this conversation himself. He's learning how to do it as a medical professional with his patients, and he's not shy about telling us where and how he has screwed up. He is also learning how to do it as a son to his father, also a surgeon, who has been diagnosed with a rare spinal tumor.The difficulty, he writes, is that in the last fifty years we have learned how to prolong life.As recently as 1945, most deaths occurred in the home. By the 1980s, just 17 percent did...Across not just the United States but also the entire industrialized world, the experience of advanced aging and death has shifted to hospitals and nursing homes...You don't have to spend much time with the elderly or those with terminal illness to see how often medicine fails the people it is supposed to help...Our reluctance to honestly examine the experience of aging and dying has increased the harm we inflict on people and denied them the basic comforts they most need.Later he writes You'd think people would have rebelled. You'd think we would have burned the nursing homes to the ground.But we haven't, and new discoveries and better medical practice mean that citizens of industrialized nations are living longer, healthier lives. ""A life,"" Gawande writes, ""designed to be safe but empty of anything they care about."" The trick now is to make sure our aging populations are not just safe, or even--heresy! sacrilege!--not safe at all, but living a life that achieves quality of life, not just quantity. The good news is, things are changing. (He doesn't say so but you know it has everything to do with the Boomers, a generation now making decisions for their parents, and who will soon be making those decisions--or not--for themselves.) Keren Brown Wilson built the first assisted living facility in Oregon in 1980, and when that concept became bastardized people like Dr. Tom Wilson revolutionized an assisted living facility with two dogs, four cats, 100 parakeets and child care for employees that brought children back into the lives of the inmates (using that word deliberately, as Gawande does himself). Researchers studied the effects of this program over two years, comparing a variety of measures for Chase's residents with those of residents at another nursing home nearby. Their study found that the number of prescriptions required per resident fell to half that of the control nursing home. Psychotropic drugs for agitation, like Haldol, decreased in particular. The total drug costs fell to just 38 percent of the comparison facility. Deaths fell 15 percent.From inmates locked away from life, warehoused until they died, Dr. Wilson's patients became once again members of a community. And as Gawande goes on to say, this experiment and others like it are beginning all across the nation.There is also Hospice, which organization Gawande's father chooses to help him through the end of his life with palliative care. For Hospice, it's all about making the end of each individual story as valuable to them as is physically possible for them. It's impossible to say enough good things about Hospice and Gawande doesn't stint them here. (Full disclosure: I already support Hospice and this book is making me double that support this year.) I know it sounds a little macabre, but this is the one book you really should read. Make a teenager read it and they will understand that much more about what Grandma is going through. Make a Millennial read it and he'll understand in spades how important that retirement plan is and how they should start one now. Make your doctor read it and she'll see how important first asking those essential questions is, ""What do you want? What is most important to you?"" instead of automatically reaching for the scalpel or the drugs. ""Death,"" writes Gawandeis normal. Death may be the enemy, but it is also the natural order of things. I knew these truths abstractly, but I didn't know them concretely--that they could be truths not just for everyone but also for this person right in front of me, for this person I was responsible for.Me, either. Now I feel like I do. Read this book, and recommend it to everyone you know. It is very frank, very well written, and actually? Kind of hopeful.****See also on Vox, ""2015 is the year America started having a sane conversation about death,"" http://www.vox.com/2015/12/16/1011744...."
295,0805095152,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3897817-morgan-blackledge,5,"This is a heart wrenchingly moving and important book. It speaks directly to our cultures strained and distant relationship to aging, the elderly, death and dying. Rarely if ever have I heard a medical clinician speak with such vulnerability and humility about the limits of modern medicine.French cultural theorist and urbanist Paul Virilio observed, with every invention or technical advance, an equally powerful disaster is co-created, for example, when we invented the locomotive, we simultaneously invented the train wreck.In a sense, Being Mortal is Dr. Atul Gawande's analogous observation about the incredible benefits of advanced medicine and the unprecedented opportunities for prolonged suffering and denial it affords us. I'm so grateful to be alive in this time, and science and technology have everything to do with that. Ordinary people have never had as much freedom to pursue knowledge or self expression as we currently enjoy.Advanced medicine is central to the high standard of living we currently have. It prolongs our lives and reduces suffering in many ways that we completely take for granted. But in a real sense, our faith in technology and medical advances has lulled us to sleep on some of life's most important and philosophical, psychological, and spiritual issues. Those of impermanence, suffering, loss and mortality.Our culture does a phenomenal job of keeping death and suffering out of plain sight. This affords the individuals facing these challenges the privacy and professional care that most people chose if given the option.This represents a real advance. But the equally powerful disaster that accompanies this advance is not trivial. The fact that most of us now live the majority of our lives insulated from the reality of death and dying means that we are quite likely to be utterly naive and under developed in this important existential domain.Frankly speaking, these are difficult and unsightly truths most of us would rather defer encountering. In the short term we enjoy the bliss that ignorance affords, but in the long term we suffer the numerous negative consequences that accompany the unexamined life.This book is attempting to address this issue by presenting us with a sober but empathetic and even optimistic view of the end of the road. Highly recommended, five stars."

298,0805095152,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4342402-tl,5,"See Caroline's review here:https://www.goodreads.com/review/show... (her review convinced me to pick this up)----She says it all beautifully so I will add my thoughts here (this'll be fairly short mostly cause my head hurts right now).This book brings up topics most of us don't think about when we are young. It seems too far away to contemplate so we put it out of our minds. Sure, we may talk about it time to time with our loved ones but how many of give it serious thought until something happens, let alone what questions to ask?The subject matter is a bit weighty in here but never felt dry or boring. There's feeling and passion  here. Gawande transports you into what he is talking about, like you are sitting with him at his kitchen table. The personal stories and histories he shares throughout the book were in turns touching and very informative. Of the former, a few had me tearing up and wanting to hug them all. The latter fascinated me, as I didn't know how those things all came about (one of those ""it has always been around"" that you just don't explore further) .I agreed with him on alot of the things he said and it got me thinking about my wishes on the future as well. Hopefully this will help with the hard conversation in the future (even though we wish we could live forever).This is an important book that should be on the bookshelves of everyone, in my humble opinion. Highly recommended.(Excuse any errors, typing on my phone)Narrator: Five starsBonus interview with the author was a nice touch."
299,0805095152,http://goodreads.com/user/show/28602001-emma,5,"An incredible book, but one that has the potential to cause considerable distress.‘Being Mortal’ is a book that addresses the experience of dying in modern society and questions whether we are getting it right. Chapters 1-5 focus primarily on mortality and the diverse nature of the end of life care provided for the elderly. Chapters 6-8 deal more specifically with how those with serious or terminal illnesses, and their families, cope with the process of dying. In these later chapters, the stories related by Gawande are frequently those in which the suffering and death of individuals is caused by cancer, including that of his own father. Though dying is an event that eventually comes to us all, it is a subject that is inherently difficult to address. In talking about our mortality, each person must confront not only the idea of their own death, but that of those who matter to them. It is entirely understandable that people choose to avoid discussing it. Yet Gawande’s book shows why it is important for everybody to stop putting aside the conversation about dying; that, in fact, refusing to tackle death until it is right upon you can lead to much greater pain and suffering. It is at this point when medical intervention takes over, often at the expense of compassion. Medical professionals would do well to read this book as part of their training and development, if only to understand how important honest communication can be to patient outcomes. They are only human, and as such, may feel as awkward about such matters as the rest of us, but they have a duty to provide accurate/truthful information about an individual’s illnesses/conditions so that they can have realistic expectations. Gawande argues that instead of defaulting to the most aggressive form of medical intervention, it is more important to talk to the individual about their goals, what is most important to them, what they can and can’t live with, what their fears and concerns are, what trade offs they are willing to make. Through discussion, a better path can be found for those who may be in pain or who are coming to the end of their life. Such conversations are necessarily incredibly difficult but Gawande highlights the benefits of having a plan put together by the individual, their family, and the medical professionals in collaboration; it is this honest dialogue that will allow an individual to manage their illness and the end of their life in a way that suits their needs. Gawande’s argument is empowering, it promotes the active role of the individual as the centre of their care and what happens to them. Within each chapter, Gawande often addresses what has happened in the past, what is happening now (including in different parts of the world), how people are trying to change things, and what the focus for the future should be. This plan means that the book is not depressing; it highlights the failures but injects positivity by showing ways in which things are being improved, or can/should be improved. At no point does Gawande fall into pessimism, he believes that while the majority of systems and institutions may not be meeting the needs of individuals right now, there is a chance that more of them will do so in the future. The book is his way of showing the difference between what is, and what should be, including examples of people and places that are getting it right. Importantly, Gawande is not prescriptive. He does not say ‘this is THE way to do things’, instead he shows how different solutions are being implemented. The variety of solutions reflect the multitude of differing ways people want and need to approach their ill health, old age, and death.       ‘Being Mortal’ is incredibly difficult to review. Given that I agree with Gawande, it would be easy to say that everyone should read this book. Yet in saying that, it feels like I am telling people that they need to deal with the idea of their death as soon as possible and, if they are currently unwell, that they should open a dialogue with their doctor to plan how they want it to proceed. It sounds more challenging when phrased this way, and is it not truly understandable that someone may not want to deal with the idea of their death by calmly talking through the steps? At the same time, I fundamentally believe Gawande’s argument that honest communication is the way forward for those who are living with terminal illness. Perhaps this is because I would rather make my own decisions while I can, and not leave them for others, who may have to guess what I might want in emergency situations if I hadn’t made my thoughts clear. The role of friends and family as support network seems intrinsically opposed to making these hard choices, the love and hope with which these decisions are made might not be compatible with the path I would want. Neither, perhaps, would the medical intervention. In modern society, people have become a medical problem to be solved, they must be ‘made safe’, increasingly separated from the rest of society and even from themselves, thereby removing any chance at individuality or choice. The problem is exacerbated by the disconnection between what medicine can do and what it should do. Gawande treats the grave and emotive subject matter with respect and conviction. At the end of someone’s life, or as they cope with ill health, he wants people to be able to have choices, to focus on what’s important to the , and to be supported in those goals by everyone around them. This is what I will hope for. "
