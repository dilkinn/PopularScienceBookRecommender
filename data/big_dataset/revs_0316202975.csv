0,0316202975,http://goodreads.com/user/show/50581-lydia-presley,4,"I'm going to be honest and tell you the entire reason I picked up The Violinist's Thumb by Sam Kean is not because I'm interested in biology or DNA or anything to do with science really - it's because the name Paganini drew me in.I've never been the type of girl to understand science. The closest I came was a low C in Biology 14 years ago when I attended the University of Wyoming. Ever since then I've operated under the assumption that magic sparkles course through my veins, that storks bring babies to deserving parents, and that my father gave me his caterpillar eyebrows as a way to torture me in my later years of life. Sound silly? Of course it does - that's because when I see science explained it looks as strange to me as reading a difficult piece of piano sheet music might to you (I say might here because I'm operating under the assumption that you don't play Rachmaninoff on a daily basis.)In spite of all these misgivings, the name of Paganini, the famous violinists who - folk lore states - sold his soul to the devil for his ability to play drew me in to this book. Random fact: Franz Liszt (also rumored to be demonic in places) studied Paganini's skill on the violin and translated it to the piano. He also was the first to play music memorized on the stage for a concert. I blame him for my many breakdowns. Anyway!So Paganini was the bait, but what hooked me about this book was just how accessible the science was. Seriously, it blew me away. In between serious chunks of letters and strands and things I know nothing about were anecdotal stories and historic lessons about names and things I had never known about. It opened up a whole new world to me and in the process, I like to think, I learned a little something more then I expected to.Fully enjoyable, well-researched and surprisingly fun - this book gave me really strange DNA dreams and made me feel a little bit like a smart person ... for a short while."
1,0316202975,http://goodreads.com/user/show/20955173-sean-gibson,4,"If Sam Kean had a bandwagon, I’d be on it. If he were stock, I’d buy him. If he were ice cream, I’d shove him into a waffle cone and…okay, well, now things are just getting weird. I’ve waxed poetic about my love of Kean before, and this is another delightful Kean production—though perhaps not quite as wonderful as others (particularly Caesar's Last Breath, which I think is his best work to date).Generally speaking, Kean’s books link a string of enlightening and often entertaining anecdotes together under a common theme, a formula The Violinist’s Thumb continues. Here, however, the anecdotes feel a bit less tightly connected. It’s more like a bunch of three-year-olds playing Pin-the-Tail on the Donkey at a birthday party. Like the sight of drunken midgets blindly wobbling toward a wall and trying to Velcro a superfluous appendage to a mule’s ass, it’s highly entertaining, and some of it hits the mark perfectly. At other times, however, the tail ends up on the nose, or maybe, in the case of the little funny kid who can’t pronounce R’s and always forgets which end of the spoon to hold, attached to the back of grandma’s homemade sweater. Still, it’s well worth a read, particularly for Kean’s nuanced discussion of the controversial implications of genetics research on race, sexuality, and other hot-button topics. His deft handling of measuring the potential benefits of such research against the need to be cautious in how—and how quickly—we interpret such results is a masterclass in compassionate rationalism and makes a compelling case for Kean to be appointed Secretary of Science Stuff.(Wait, that’s not a thing? Is it just because our current president thinks climate change is a Chinese hoax, or is it just normally not a thing? It’s normally not a thing? Well, that’s stupid. When I’m president, it will be a thing. And I will appoint Sam Kean as the Secretary of Science Stuff. Also, I will reverse the current administration’s stance that science, like pro-gay cakes and facts, are only for snowflake libtards, and I will insist that we actually use it as a basis for things like, I don’t know, environmental policy. Okay, I’m off the soapbox.)Feel free to join me on the bandwagon, folks. There’s plenty of room."
2,0316202975,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3659060-brenda,4,"What I learned from reading Sam Kean’s The Violinist’s Thumb and Other Lost Tales of Love, War, and Genius, as Written by Our Genetic Code (Little, Brown and Company, 2012):I should never eat polar bear liver—unless I want my skin to peel off from foot to head.My cats’ presence soothes me because the Toxoplasma gondii parasites they carry manufacture dopamine, which has a feel-good effect on the human brain.Whales and dolphins have hair (what Kean calls “a comb-over”). A Russian scientist (Il’ya Ivanovich Ivanov) recruited women to copulate with an orangutan named Tarzan. The scientist hoped to create a “humanzee.”Doctors enjoy diagnosing fictional characters: “Ebenezer Scrooge with OCD, Sherlock Holmes with autism, and Darth Vader with borderline personality disorder” (271).Fruit fly genes are cleverly and creatively named. Examples include: “groucho, smurf, fear of intimacy, lost in space, smellblind, faint sausage, tribble ([after] the multiplying fuzzballs on Star Trek), and tiggywinkle (after Mrs. Tiggy-winkle, a character from Beatrix Potter). The armadillo gene, when mutated, gives fruit flies a plated exoskeleton. The turnip gene makes flies stupid. Tudor leaves males (as with Henry VIII) childless. Cleopatra can kill flies when it interacts with another gene, asp. Cheap date leaves flies exceptionally tipsy after a sip of alcohol. Fruit fly sex especially seems to inspire clever names. Ken and Barbie mutants have no genetalia. Male coitus interruptus mutants spend just ten minutes having sex (the norm is twenty), while stuck mutants cannot physically disengage after coitus. As for females, dissatistfaction mutants never have sex at all—they spend all their energy shooing suitors away by snapping their wings. And thankfully, this whimsy with names has inspired the occasional zinger in other areas of genetics. A gene that gives mammals extra nipples earned the name scaramanga, after the James Bond villain with too many. A gene that removes blood cells from circulation in fish became the tasteful vlad tepes, after Vlad the Impaler, the historical inspiration for Dracula. The backronym for the ‘POK erythroid myeloid ontogenic’ gene in mice—pokemon—nearly provoked a lawsuit, since the pokemon gene (now known, sigh, as zbtb7) contributes to the spread of cancer, and the lawyers for the Pokémon media empire didn’t want their cute little pocket monsters confused with tumors.” (50-51)I quote extensively here to demonstrate the humor that might not be expected in a book on scientific history. When I taught at an engineering university, students frequently informed me that engineers weren’t supposed to be “creative.” Kean certainly refutes that belief so far as genetic engineers and researchers are concerned. After reading a number of other popular science/psychology books this summer, I found myself appreciating Kean’s organization. The content of each chapter seemed necessary—and I appreciated the coherence of his arrangement of anecdotes. I only occasionally had trouble following passages (the one on genetic algorithms, for example). Usually, I felt very focused—and never thought, “Oh, no, it’s another random case study,” a common enough reaction when I’m wending my way through best selling works of nonfiction. I recommend this book to my creative writing peers—both poets and fiction writers as I think they will find Kean’s approach to be both informative and inspirational. "
3,0316202975,http://goodreads.com/user/show/155663-david,4,"This is a very good, and entertaining survey of the history of genetics. I learned a great deal about DNA, how it works, and how scientists are trying to unravel its secrets.Every chapter contains some fascinating facts, histories, and insights. For example, Kean makes analogies between music, linguistics, and the structure of DNA. The frequency of various notes in classical music follows a power law. The frequency of words in literature also follows a power law. Note: Kean does not mention the term ""power law"", but he describes it in other words. He shows that at some level, DNA codes also follow a power law. He shows how palindromes do arise in DNA occasionally, and how they have affected X and Y chromosomes.Kean explains how various genetics researchers made discoveries, and influenced--or failed to influence--each other. Kean has a remarkable ability for bringing human interest stories to life. For example, he tells the story of Barbara McClintock, whose incredible observational skills with a microscope enabled her to discover ""jumping genes"" in 1951. Scientists dismissed her discovery, because she dared to question the stationary-gene dogma. Her reputation suffered badly. Decades later, as genetics progressed, she was vindicated and was awarded the Nobel Prize in 1983.I have two misgiving about this book. First, Kean frequently uses the word ""theory"" in the popular sense, rather than in the scientific sense. He should really have used the word ""hypothesis"", which is much more appropriate for a new idea that is still unproven. Second, Kean's writing is peppered with silly attempts at humor. He uses expressions like ""a bitter butter battle broke out"", ""Heck"", and ""... we also needed us some brains."" Such attempts at humor somehow seemed out of place, and put me off.Nevertheless, I recommend this book to anybody who would like to get a fascinating overview of genetics and its history."
4,0316202975,http://goodreads.com/user/show/8079403-max,4,"In Kean’s follow up to The Disappearing Spoon he keeps the same breezy form but switches his subject from chemistry to genetics. While we get more science history and anecdotal stories than pure science, we still learn much about how our genome works. Kean writes for the general reader. Using his tongue in cheek style, he delivers short vignettes of scientists and famous people with genetic peculiarities.The book begins with Darwin and Mendel and follows their ideas up through double helix discoverers Watson and Crick. I had read about these men’s accomplishments but little of what had happened in between. So I found particularly interesting descriptions of the scientists whose incremental advances set the stage for the discovery of DNA’s structure and function. Much of the book is tangential. For example we learn how DNA protects polar bears from overdosing on vitamin A from their diet of vitamin A rich seal meat. The vitamin A is stored in their liver. Kean gives us an account of arctic explorers who nearly died eating it. Even further afield he highlights the protozoan parasite Toxo which makes cysts in people’s brains. It can influence their emotions and even induce a love of cats. He tells us about an infected couple who took in hundreds of cats.Kean also digs into the seedier side of genetics. He brings up Ilya Ianovich Ivanov who convinced the Bolshevik regime in Russia that he could create humanzees. Perhaps Stalin envisioned slave humanzee armies. Fortunately his grisly experiments failed. We learn how DNA allows creatures like ligers and zonkeys but not humanzees. However most of us carry some Neanderthal DNA.There is much less diversity in the human genome than in most other species. Kean attributes this to population bottlenecks many thousands of years ago when our numbers were greatly reduced and our survival as a species was tenuous. Small populations lead understandably to more inbreeding and genetic similarity but also to faster evolution. It is much easier for a new trait to sweep through a small population.Genetics is a factor in many special abilities and talents. Regarding intelligence not much seems certain. There are too many forces at play. Kean highlights how genetic based physical oddities did contribute to two great musicians. Rachmaninoff because of his huge hands wrote music only he could play with ease. The great nineteenth century violinist Paganini had hands uniquely flexible and strong due to a genetic condition that affected the way his body made collagen. Kean describes the competition of the 1990’s to sequence the human genome. The amazing speed with which this was accomplished was due to brute force methods that leave us with a lot of data we are just beginning to understand. Adding to the complexity of the genome is epigenetics, the ramping up or down of gene expression through cellular princesses driven largely by non-coding DNA. Epigenetic factors influenced by the environment may even in some circumstances affect offspring. Lastly Kean looks at the future; DNA modification can have huge benefits but may just open Pandora’s Box."
5,0316202975,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5649720-rebecca,5,"Kean manages to cram enough information into this book to satisfy the armchair historian, biologist, or trivia aficionado, while somehow keeping it readable and entertaining.It's a rather monumental task, combining the history of science with the latest discoveries. He's pretty good about explaining without talking down. I think he assumed most of his readers would be like me--took bio in high school and have vaguely kept up with discoveries announced in the press, but have to shamefacedly admit that while we've heard of RNA, we can't really quite remember exactly what it does. He defines terms as he goes, assuming that you don't really remember or know a lot of this but that you're intelligent enough to keep up. I think I did, for the most part. There were so paragraphs that I'd definitely need to go back and reread, possibly with a reference, to fully understand, but he generally picks you again on the other side with enough of a layman's description that even if you didn't quite follow how all the proteins come together, you can still understand the overall implications by the end. And he does it without making you feel like a dolt, which is nice. Did I understand everything fully? No. Will I retain what I did get? Probably some of it, probably not all. But I think my overall understanding of where we stand at the moment is drastically improved.And all along, he illustrates the science with history. Stories about the scientists who made the discoveries, about famous cases from Paganini to Einstein, about weird discoveries in our own genome. (Did you know that an enormous amount of our DNA appears to have been stolen from bacteria and viruses? The placenta looks like it was reverse-engineered from the traits that retroviruses use to hide from immune systems. Without incorporating retrovirus DNA into our own, we never could have developed live birth.) He usually develops a sense of tension by introducing a story at the beginning of a chapter and leaving it at a cliffhanger to explain the science going on behind the case. He'll touch base with the chapter's story two or three times, using it to illustrate various facets of a discovery, before finally resolving the original story by the end of the chapter. It's a remarkably effective technique of breaking up the long explanations.Overall, it's a fascinating look about what we know about what makes our bodies work, and how we learned it."
6,0316202975,http://goodreads.com/user/show/10407443-ross-blocher,5,"Genes are at the heart of this book, and the author just happens to have parents named Gene and Jean (last name Kean), so this topic is in his... well, you get it. Sam Kean is one of my favorite authors, deftly explaining scientific concepts in the context of the fascinating figures who first brought them to our attention. The stories are full of the humor and foibles of real life, and that realistic treatment brings the people and situations to life all the more convincingly. Kean has a remarkable knack for finding fun anecdotes and interesting connections that reinforce concepts throughout his books. His enthusiasm is infectuous and bleeds out in the form of humor, copious end notes, additional notes and illustrations on his website, and in the case of this book: a hidden, acrostic message encoded in the... Chapters? Paragraphs? I've already spent a couple hours trying to decode it [and am likely over-thinking it], but figured I should write this review first, or who knows how long I'll be working this out?The Violinist's Thumb is about the history of genes and DNA: how we came to question the nature of inheritance, our first inklings of the structures involved, dalliances with fruit flies, sequencing genomes, encoding proteins, suffering mutations, puzzling over ""freaks"" and chimeras, swapping DNA with Neanderthals, detecting virus intrustions, all the way up to our current, improved-yet-incomplete understanding of what makes us us. As of 2012, anyhow. Having completed all four of Kean's books, I dub this the most challenging. The subject matter itself is incredibly dense, metaphorically as well as literally: six feet of DNA is crammed into every one of our cells, and the DNA from one body could travel from the sun to Pluto and almost return. Kean has to describe with words a lot of things that are hard to understand even with pictures, and there are a lot of moving parts (one again, literally) and competing, concurrent processes to consider when thinking about the complex actions of DNA, RNA, proteins, mutations, nutrients and drugs, bacteria, viruses and epigenetic factors. There are many passages I had to read multiple times just to understand well enough to procede - if you've had formal training in genetics, this will likely come much easier to you.Characters familiar and unfamiliar are represented. We of course learn a lot about Mendel and Darwin, but also about Friedrich Miescher and his efforts in a cold castle kitchen to extract dna from salmon sperm, never knowing exactly what he had accomplished. Thomas Hunt Morgan and the scientists in his lab bred gazillions of fruit flies in work that led to multiple Nobel Prizes, but Morgan he often took credit for ideas and never paid an essential contributor (he didn't pay the fruit flies, either). Watson and Crick are here, but so is Sister Miriam Michael Stimson, a nun who made their discovery possible (we also learn of the clergical error that led to her getting the name Michael, and that she contributed to the invention of Preparation H). Lynn Margulis's brilliant insight into endosymbionts is represented, as well as her other bold, unsubstantiated ideas. Barbra McClintock's skill with a microscope and identification of ""jumping genes"" is told in the light of the scientific scrutiny that drove her into seclusion, but later drew her back out as a science celebrity. We jump through history and learn of northern explorers dying (and nearly dying) at the razored-hands and nutrient-rich livers of polar bears (hint: you can over-do it with Vitamin A). Royal bloodlines and figures like Akhenaten, Tutankhamun, Henri Tolouse-Lautrec, Alexei Nikolaevich and the Hapsburgs teach us lessons about deleterious alleles. Soviet biologist Ilya Ivanovich Ivanov worked hard to breed humans and chimpanzees, and it might have worked if it weren't for those meddling political ideologies. The titular violinist is Niccolo Paganini, whose genetic condition gave him extraordinarily flexible and strong hands, but also led to his miserable bodily decline (with the help of mercury poisoning).All of these fascinating stories (and many more), combined with artful scientific explanations, do a fantastic job of fleshing out one's understanding of genes, DNA, and the science of what it takes to build a body. A highly recommended read."
7,0316202975,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5138895-etherealfire,5,"This book was really good and I can't believe how long it took me to finish it. But even though it is written in a way that makes it easy and engaging for anyone, I found that I had to take lots of time to absorb it. I'd leave it for days at a time and then not get very far. But it wasn't due to being boring or dry. Sam Kean is an engaging story teller and he made a complicated work very accessible!"
8,0316202975,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3357765-jimmy,5,"The author's parents were named Gene and Jean. That's right: Gene and Jean Kean. What else could their son do but write a book about genetics? And a fun book it is, with some fascinating stories. There is enough DNA in a human body to stretch from Pluto to the sun and back. There's enough DNA on earth to stretch across the known universe many, many times. Fruit fly genes have fun names, such as groucho, smurf, fear of intimacy, lost in space, smellblind, faint sausage, tribble (from the Star Trek episode), and tinman (if mutated, can prevent fruit flies from growing a heart). A mutant armadillo gene gives fruit flies a plated exoskeleton. The turnip gene makes flies stupid, like they just fell off the turnip truck. Tudor genes leave flies without progeny. When a cleopatra gene interacts with an asp gene, it can kill the fly. A cheap date gene leaves flies tipsy after a sip of alcohol. Ken and barby mutants have no genitalia. Male coitus interruptus gene mutants spend just ten minutes on sex when the norm is twenty. Stuck mutant genes cannot physically disengage after sex. Female dissatisfaction mutants have no sex at all. There are some fun names occasionally elsewhere also. A scaramanga gene, named after the James Bond villain, gives mammals extra nipples. The vlad tepes genes removes blood from fish. The pokemon gene almost provoked a lawsuit. The flour beetle's medea gene kills a female's progeny. If you ever think you had a bad day, just remember the story of Tsutoma Yamaguchi in August 1945. He survived two atomic explosions on that day. The whole story is pretty amazing, but I will never complain about my day again. He lived until the year 2010. The author points to the small hope in the fact that thousands of children of A-bomb survivors remained alive as he wrote the book. Zipf's Law states something like the biggest or most common item in each class was twice as big or common as the second item, which is twice as big as the third item, and so on. This seemed to apply with words that Mr. Zipf studied in great books. DNA may have Zipfian properties as well. Noam Chomsky stated ""Colorless green ideas sleep furiously"" to show that meaningless sentences are independent of syntax. So the sentence itself is actually not quite devoid of meaning. Like modern poetry. Computer software concluded that Shakespeare indeed did write The Two Noble Kinsmen. But that he did not write Pericles. Do we believe it? Without the kickstart of mitochondria, primitive life might never have developed into higher life, much less intelligent human beings. The first organic molecules appeared near volcanic vents on the ocean floor. Organics were also imported from space. Life starting up was surprisingly easy. It was mitochondria that solved the problem of energy consumption. They allowed cells to expand their DNA repertoire 200,000 times. Polar bear livers have astronomical amounts of vitamin A. That vitamin allows seals to survive in the cold. Polar bears need it to pack on blubber. Poisons accumulate as you move up the food chain. Polar bears needed to deal with it or starve. Evolution saved them. Some explorers learned the hard way not to eat the livers of polar creatures. Chimpanzees have short spines on their penises. In other words, they have . . . well . . . ahem . . . prickly pricks. Humans lost them many years ago, thus prolonging copulation because male sensations decreased, to say nothing of battered vaginas. The human line almost went extinct multiple times. A biologist named Ivanov in Stalinist Russia tried to unite human and chimpanzee genes. He failed when he jammed human sperm into chimp vaginas and not their uteruses. Artificial insemination was considered shameful by the church. A barren couple having sex would have someone listening in at the door and then charge in at the last moment with a batch of sperm to shove into the woman in an effort to trick her egg cells into believing it came from intercourse. Trofim Lysenko almost killed Soviet agriculture by only believing in environment factors and never in heredity. After Einstein died, Thomas Harvey pilfered his brain for further study. It actually weighed less than normal. Americans in WWII took parts of Mussolini's bran to study a dictator. Folding in a brain does usually indicate higher functioning. Lack of brain folds is devastating. The sneeze reflex can be inherited and often uncontrollable. I know a bit about that since I cannot sneeze once. It usually takes me about ten or so before I stop. The great violinist Niccolo Paganini refused communion and confession on his deathbed fearing it would hasten his demise. The Church refused him proper burial. It took a few months to finally get him into a private garden where he rested for 36 years before the Church forgave him and permitted burial. Toulouse-Lautrec had a genetic disorder that left him with rotting teeth, a swelling nose, and lips that flopped open and drooled. Thus he wore a stylish beard. He encouraged rumors to help his reputation with you know who. He had the nickname ""Tripod"" for you know what. But he was a bit of a ""dwarf."" So he hung out in bars and bordellos. And he gave the characters there a little bit of dignity. The temptations of the Moulin Rouge--casual sex, late nights, and ""strangling the parakeet,"" his euphemism for drinking himself stupid--took their toll on Toulouse-Lautrec's body. He used to keep liquor in a hollowed-out cane. It all eventually killed him. Charles Darwin was a wheezing wreck who disgusted even himself. He suffered from boils, fainting fits, heart flutters, numb fingers, insomnia, migraines, eczema, dizziness. He passed horrendous gas. Worst of all, he barfed all the time. He couldn't stop until he was dry heaving. He feared visiting the homes of others for fear of fouling up their privies. He even built his own hidden one. Darwin's favorite child died at age ten, thus ending any remnants of a religious faith. The great thing about Darwin is all that he accomplished under these conditions. A truly great man. The great Edward O. Wilson suggested there may be genetic roots to some social differences. He was blasted for it. Activists charged him onstage where he was in a wheelchair and threw ice water on him and shouting about genocide. Idiots. Some people thought of cloning Jesus himself by lifting DNA from the Shroud of Turin. Ridiculous, I know. But it brought out this great comment, ""You are trying to bring back the one person who is supposed to come back anyway."" There is a fucM gene in mice that can be changed to cause lesbians. I have never been able to figure out the Darwinian conundrum about homosexuality: It does not promote the species. No answers yet. Same with racial issues. Unfortunately, both are difficult to touch. Croesus once went to hear the oracle at Delphi: ""You will destroy a great empire."" Of course, it turned out to be his own. Our DNA is like an oracle. Do we want to listen? "
9,0316202975,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4763049-holly,3,"This got off to a bad start for me, when on page 33 Kean equated Darwinian natural selection and ""survival of the fittest."" (Herbert Spencer and/or ""social Darwinism"" were never mentioned.) Then, in an incendiary chapter on cats and toxoplasmosis (""toxo"") he never explains that a cat who has lived indoors all its life cannot carry/transmit the disease. Then .... what else? The tone was too cutesy and much of the material was too simplistic - glossing over opposing viewpoints, or assuming the reader's ignorance, or silly sentences like ""I don't want to get all eugenicky on you ...."" And he often went to pains not to use common terms such as ""punctuated equilibrium,"" or corpus callosum, or haplotype - as if these would scare off the reader. At least once Kean committed the unforgiveable sin of calling chimpanzees and gorillas ""monkeys.""The other problem with this book was that there were no endnotes, per sé. Several times I wanted to know where Kean was getting his information - and whom/what he was paraphrasing - but had nowhere to go. There is a Selected Bibliography - the list of books and papers Kean claims to have ""consulted while writing The Violinist's Thumb"" - but it is sketchy, extremely short, and fairly non-scholarly. There is also a post-text section titled ""Notes and Errata"" - but it gave no citations whatsoever. (Not to mention the word ""Errata"" - why is it called that when there is no list of mistakes or corrections?) But, by the final chapter I'd come to like the book more, if only because I admired how much trivia and how many interesting anecdotes were crammed into 358 pages. "
10,0316202975,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3409532-april-does-feral-sometimes,4,"'The Violinist's Thumb' is a perfect read for girding up one's loins for holiday dinners where lots of family members plan to attend. Not only are the stories the author relates of the foibles and craziness of world-famous scientists who were involved in historic and present studies that have impacted knowledge about DNA give one preparation for facing down your more ordinary intolerable relatives, the chapters which actually explain DNA may provide insight on why you can't stand some blood relations. Body smell which repels you might be due to MHC chemistry. Those siblings you have called 'Neanderthal' since you were teens might actually be one.Sam Kean provides ample evidence humans, and also scientists, are genetically amazing in how we duplicate, develop and express our DNA and connected processes. Perhaps our faith in civilization may be misplaced, since it is obvious, particularly from the way some of these scientists behave, that whether we are smart or stupid, civilization, affection and manners are abstract concepts (the famous 'scientific method' might be more personally offensive in action than is usually acknowledged - it looks to me like The Method is behind many of the murderous feuds and competition). But as these amazing discoveries about DNA are being revealed, some only in the last 20 years, it is clear how our biology works at the molecular level is fantastic. And hallelujah, we ordinary mortals now can see and read what these genuises are sussing out through pure intelligence, luck and cussedness. Seeing how the sausage is made, so-to-speak, might deflate our awe to a degree, but knowing these people put pants on one leg at a time (if they remembered to dress) helped me persevere trying to understand the microscopic functions they were able to measure, quantify and prove. It was never more true, as Kean shows, scientists are using logical provable observations and creative insights, building on the work of others, often in the face of withering contempt from their peers. If these tough guys can publish their guesses, explorations and conclusions in the face of public scorn, and sometimes public humiliation (twitter storms are minor breezes compared to hatreds between scientists), then I strangely feel more bold in trying to understand their science.I recommend this book as an amusing and illuminating general science read. If you must, skip the few chapters which are a little tough to get through (I watched youtube videos to help me) that describe very detailed, multi-step processes. The personal stories of the scientists, which occasionally led to their discoveries, or led, eventually, to the acceptance of their discoveries, are sometimes pathetic, sometimes terrible, sometimes hilarious. "
11,0316202975,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6100646-brian-clegg,4,"I was a great fan of Sam Kean’s The Disappearing Spoon, so it was excellent to see a followup in The Violinist’s Thumb. The violinist in question was Paganini who had a genetic disorder that enabled him to bend his thumb back far beyond the usual limit. And this is an indirect hint about the subject of the book – DNA and our genetic code.This is, without doubt, a very good book. A quote from New Scientist on the front compares Sam Kean’s writing to that of Bill Bryson – I think this delusional, and possibly a little unfair on Kean. I’d say he is, as a pure writer, better than Bryson, but lacks Bryson’s superb comic touch. Kean attempts humour, but it certainly isn’t up to Bryson – the comparison just doesn’t make sense. The good news is that once again Kean has brought an aspect of science alive with a ton of excellent anecdotes about the individuals involved, in this case in everything from studying the fruit flies that form the fingerprint on the cover of the book to cracking our genetic code in the Human Genome Project.Along the with, if, like me, you aren’t a biologist you will certainly learn plenty. It might seem trivial but the best thing I went away with was the realisation that in DNA’s base pairs it’s easy to remember that A goes with T and C with G, because the curved letters go together and the straight ones similarly. However, I simply didn’t enjoy it as much as Disappearing Spoon. That book was a page turner that I couldn’t wait to get back to – this was a bit of plough through experience.This is mostly not Kean’s fault (except for the fact the book is too long, but that might have been imposed on him). It’s the subject. It simply doesn’t have the variety that arose from looking at different elements – here you are on the same single subject throughout. And sometimes, because of this, the entertaining side stories weren’t helpful because I lost track of the theme they interrupted. I also found that because it is a single topic, I really wanted a lot more depth, but Kean continues to skip on, focussing on storytelling not content, telling us things without really explaining them. On a technical issue I would also say that Kean leaves epigenetics too late and should have integrated it more into the rest – as it stands its importance really doesn’t come across.Overall it’s an excellent book – highly readable and with lots of great stories. It’s just that Kean’s style isn’t quite as suited to this topic as it was to the elements, and so this title is rather overshadowed by its predecessor.Review first published on www.popularscience.co.uk and reproduced with permission"
12,0316202975,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3236194-caroline,4,"***NO SPOILERS***This is an intriguing but brainy read that requires not just an interest in biology but a good understanding of it. Readers should be prepared to harken back to biology class(es) to recall that A pairs with T, and C pairs with G on the DNA strand--and that’s one of the easier parts of this book. Nevertheless, the book contains enough concrete, easier-to-grasp ideas and information to keep the content from ever being dry. There’s also something to be said for Sam Kean’s engaging style. He has a talent for presenting the complex in an appealing way, and humorously at times too. In particular, the section about cat-hoarding is fascinating, as is the section explaining modern humans’ connection to Neanderthals. Recommended! "

14,0316202975,http://goodreads.com/user/show/841949-tracey,5,"As usual, the actual contents of this Netgalley book came as a bit of a surprise – really? I requested a book about DNA? How unusual. And it is, very; I like a book which will feed me good solid science which has been cut into easily digested pieces rather than either handed to me whole or reduced to baby food, but I haven't read one in some time. The fact that I was thinking of polar bear livers while typing that last sentence is an indication of how well this book has done its job.Do I now understand all there is to know about DNA and genetics?***Oh, sorry. I was laughing too hard to type there for a minute. Because – No: I'm still an idiot in the world of science. I am now able to parrot the fact of, say, A-T and C-G pairings, and I have a tenuous grasp on what it means, but for me the general feeling is much like I remember from high school science, when I learned that color wasn't what I thought it was and that water is part of everything, even the most solid and desiccated of objects, on a cellular level. Information like that fights with my worldview. I understand the words on a theoretical level, like phasers and tribbles. It's the practical science that escapes me. Which in no way is to detract from Mr. Kean's book. It's excellent. It's a joy. The fault, dear reader, lies not in my book but in myself, I'm sorry to say. But I do know a whole heck of a lot more than I did when I started, and – more importantly – I understand a whole heck of a lot more than I did when I started. As for what I still don't understand … well, Mr. Kean did not leave me feeling like the idiot I am, despite the fact that he explained as clearly and simply – and, often, humorously – as any human being could. And every page was painted with the wonder Mr. Kean obviously still finds in science. If all teachers managed to demonstrate this sense of wonder into their lessons, the world would be a smarter place.And in between and around the bits that refuse to compute, there was a tremendous amount of information I could happily wallow in. I had no idea of the gravity of the reasons behind keeping pregnant women away from kitty litter – and really, it is serious, don't go anywhere near it. It never occurred to me that there could be people who survived the bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki both, and no real concept of what that did to them. I never knew the quirky biographies of Darwin and Mendel, Thomas Hunt Morgan, Watson and Crick, or any of the other madmen that fills these pages. And of course the title condition, that which made Niccolò Paganini what he was, which allowed him speed and flexibility that led his listeners to believe he had traded in his soul for them – a beautiful piece of forensic diagnosis, and such fun to read. The humor never gets in the way of the learning, but – as with all the best teachers – facilitates it. It's wonderful.  Literally."

And the book is fascinating. I don't really have any science background to speak of, but I was pretty well able to follow the descriptions of the scientific information.How I found this book was through the author's blog on Slate found here, where he shared some of the stories from the book in a shortened format.

It was a fairly easy read, not requiring much science knowledge, and it was well written, with humor and a relaxed story-telling vibe. But I felt that it lacked a cohesive purpose. The author told a lot of stories about what genes can do and have done, and they were all interesting and enjoyable to read. But at the end of the book, I still felt that I didn't understand a lot about how genes work and how they fit into our biology. "
17,0316202975,http://goodreads.com/user/show/867629-justin,5,"Science!Kean’s newest nonfiction book traces the history of DNA, from humankind’s earliest attempts to understand how life develops through to the implications of working with the recently unzipped human genome. There’s plenty of hard science that introduces the structure and inner workings of chromosomes, but the book is definitely written for the layperson.Much like Mary Roach’s works, The Violinist’s Thumb is divided into thematic chapters that are composed of related vignettes that range from fascinating and tragic to offbeat and absurd. These vignettes tend to connect to and reference each other, due to the generally linear progression of scientific breakthroughs related to DNA. While the book doesn’t qualify as narrative nonfiction, I got a clear sense of a solid beginning, plenty of harrowing adventures in the middle, and an ambiguously open ending.The stories in each section range far and wide in their subject matter, from mystery illnesses and scientific scandals to frog sex and microscopic sculptures. In short, it delivered everything I want from science nonfiction: plenty of offbeat curiosities and humorous asides to give context to complex, genuinely interesting scientific information. Kean writes simply and offers plenty of casual (and occasional acerbic) editorials, which occasionally come off as one-liners but still keep the more data-driven sections from seeming too much like a textbook.There is enough simplification and use of weasel words to annoy readers who are already well-versed in the subject matter, but it’s absolutely perfect for someone like me: eternally interested in science, but not all that adept with the lingo or basic theory. After finishing this book, I’ve been casually perusing articles and videos on molecular biology, which says almost everything I need to about it. Thankfully, Kean includes a meaty reference list with plenty of suggestions for what to read next on the subject. As mentioned above, a few of the chapters may be a little hard to follow for people without a science background, but this is a must-read for anybody who has even a passing interest in what DNA is, how it works, and how our understanding of it has evolved and affected almost everything we do. There is more than enough compelling human drama in these pages to offset the strings of As, Cs, Gs, and Ts."
18,0316202975,http://goodreads.com/user/show/29931726-joel,5,"Reading Sam Kean is like eating popcorn. Tastes great, somewhat filling, and mildly nutritious, but somehow it leaves you feeling a bit empty. I’ve now read two of Kean’s books – The Disappearing Spoon and The Violinist’s Thumb, and I greatly enjoyed both. He covers lots of ground and makes it interesting and entertaining. In this book, he covers the history of DNA and genetics from the early 1800s until today and hits all the major and even the minor players – Lamarck, Cuvier, Darwin, Mendel, Miescher, de Vries, Hunt Morgan, and of course Watson and Crick, as well as a few other notables, while throwing in some fun anecdotes and making the science clear and fun at the same time. But having read other popular science histories–Thomas Hager comes to mind–I feel like Kean’s treatment is slightly superficial. If you were to ask me in six months from now to recount some of the things I learned from this book, I’d likely come up empty (just like if you’d ask me now about what I remember from The Disappearing Spoon). It also doesn’t help that he overdoes it on the clichés, references, and wordplay. The book just doesn’t seem “intelligent” enough. He does address some important philosophical questions, especially on the last chapter where he presents a very insightful discussion on genetics and racism, but overall, the tone of the book seems most appropriate for a bright high schooler. But who am I to complain? I really enjoyed myself reading it, and learned a great deal about a topic I didn’t know much about. It would be like complaining that they put too much butter in my popcorn. Yum!"

I've even worked in a lab with genetically modified mice, and isolated RNA sequences. However, in school, things like DNA are usually treated in a pretty abstract way, and it's easy to forget the human side of ""human DNA."" This book does give some educational overview, but its real strength is the stories it tells.After years in the world of the humanities and education, this book did serve to remind me of some things I hadn't thought of in a while, but what I loved about the book was how it contextualized everything in some very human stories. Not only do you get to hear about the stories behind the pioneers of DNA science, from Mendel and Darwin to more recent figures like Venter, but there are some fun and fascinating examples of the affects of different DNA-related changes in the human body, from Paganini to people who love cats way too much. If you don't know much about DNA, this will teach you some things, and for those who know the basics, it will refresh your memory while entertaining you."

21,0316202975,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3145939-ellie,5,"DNA. It’s in all of us but did you know it tells a story? Both of the human race and its own story of discovery. The Violinist’s Thumb is not only an introduction to the science of DNA but a trip through history from Mendel to the Human Genome Project and Neanderthals to crazy cat people.My knowledge of DNA comes from high school biology, Jurassic Park and numerous crime shows and books, so I’m by no means in a position to understand high-brow scientific tomes. Instead, Sam Kean manages to entertain and educate. The conversational tone dips into more technical territory now and then but just as you think it’s about to go over your head, it returns to an amusing anecdote. I fell I have a better understanding of how DNA works and how it’s shaped us as humans.I learned so many fascinating facts. That there could be a biological reason that otherwise sane people turn into crazy cat hoarders; toxoplasma gondii (a parasite caught from cats) will release dopamine into the brain when the infected individual smells cat pee. So cats make them happy. The case study here, were a couple that held the world record for most cats in one home; 689! I could go on all day about the things I picked up but I need to leave some for you to discover yourself.What is often left out of scientific history, are the people behind the discoveries. We may know all about Mendel’s peas but not that his research was destroyed because of his politics and not his science (I’m pretty sure his fellow monks were appreciative of his pea improvement). It’s also quite common for geneticists to try and explain historical figures through their genes, what does Einstein’s brain say about his genius? And there was a wonderful section about Toulouse-Lautrec, whilst his family’s inbreeding was tragic, his disadvantages probably led to his art. Just as a genetic condition blessed and blighted the title’s inspiration, virtuoso violinist, Niccolò Paganini.My only grumble was a couple of errors that should have been picked up by an editor. We cannot possibly be 8% not human and only 2% human; that just doesn’t add up. I know that the author meant 8% virus DNA and 2% unique to human DNA, but it wasn’t worded that way and for a scientist, maths should be important. There was another similar thing, where he stated “virtually all animals” and then excluded all mammals in the same sentence. Virtually all would imply mammals to most of us, would it not? There may have been other slip-ups but these were surrounded in paragraphs that included things I wanted to quote and realised they didn’t make sense when I looked more closely. The fact that I still think this a five star read, shows you how much I got out of it."
22,0316202975,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5208303-maxine,5,"Pretty much all of us know that DNA is what makes us, well, us. But few of us non-scientists really understand what that means. Through a bit of hard science, a little history, just a touch of humour, and some fascinating anecdotes, author San Kean sets out to rectify this in his marvelous book, The Violinist's Thumb. Kean explains in simple and rather poetic terms, for example, the difference between DNA and genes. ""DNA"", he tells us, ""is a thing - a chemical which sticks to your fingers"" while genes are ""like a story, with DNA as the language the story is written in"". And DNA does much more than colour our eyes blue or our hair black. As Kean points out, if it weren't for DNA, we would lack the imagination to even wonder about these things never mind try to discover why they are what they are. DNA is really the story of us, the story of our place in the universe, and, if it seems a little sad to think we are really just the sum of our genetic makeup, there is a whole lot more to the story than just our biology. It is, in fact, our DNA which makes us not only human but humane.In some wonderful anecdotes, Kean (whose own DNA has made him a born story teller) tells us about the unluckiest lucky man in the world, a Japanese man who survived the bombing of Hiroshima, only to head home to his family who lived in, you guessed it, Nagasaki. Yet, despite surviving two nuclear bombs, he went on to live a long and fruitful life. He also introduces us, thanks to DNA, to the mother of us all, the real Eve, who was a tiny woman who lived a hundred thousand years ago. And Kean also explains why, thanks to DNA, you should never eat the liver of a polar bear unless you are a seal.The Violinist's Thumb has to be the most fun I have ever had reading a book about science. Oh, and in case you are wondering, the thumb in the title belonged to Paganini, an 18th century violinist so talented many thought he had sold his soul to the devil. Turns out it was something which seems on the surface, somewhat less poetic but certainly more surprising and decidedly human - Paganini's incredible skill was due not to Satan but to a genetic disorder which would eventually shorten his life but which allowed him to bend his fingers and thumbs in amazing ways. When Shakespeare said ""fault lies not in our stars...but in ourselves"", he was more right than he could have possibly imagined even given his wonderful DNA."

The book included a range of humorous side stories that surrounded elemental discoveries/use/dangers. Stories such as the unfortunate Stan Jones who, through his own sloppy self-experimentation, ingested too much silver and turned blue, FOREVER. A real life Papa Smurf.... But the book was also filled with concepts such as quantum theory and high-level chemistry that I just could not grasp no matter how many times I re-read the sentences. This book focuses on DNA and how our blueprint defines and directs our traits. It runs in a similar vein as the Disappearing Spoon, however I could only hold out till Chapter 4. It contained just too much high-level science discussions and lingo than what I was prepared to decipher. I only have an interest, not an education, in medicine and biology and unfortunately the scientific explanations overshadowed the interesting trivia.I normally do not abandon books but sadly this one will go onto my very small DNF pile. Perhaps one day I will try again."

When I saw the title of this book, I felt pretty sure I wasn't going to like it, but many of my friends gave it high ratings. So, I thought I would give it a shot. Loved it!Just as he did with Disappearing Spoon, Kean brought a fresh perspective to an ordinary subject. Among my favorite aspects of this book were:- The names fruit fly scientists gave various genes, on example being the Cleopatra gene that, when mutated, kills other flies when it interacts with a gene named Asp.- Machiavellian microbes that turn humans into cat hoarders and ants into big berry-like creatures birds want to eat, all so microbes can make it into the guts of animals and mate.- Wonderful history of Barbara McClintock- How the human placenta came to be, how fetuses are really parasites, and how viruses are brilliant. -Einstein's brain- Painting chimps- Women who lust after rock (or violin) stars - And how genes proved and disproved myths of days gone byGreat read!

25,0316202975,http://goodreads.com/user/show/837451-sarah,3,"This book reads like a year's worth of blog posts bound between two covers. The snarky, hipster, ironic tone grows ever more grating. Use of words and phrases like ""natch,"" ""they threw up in their mouths,"" ""then, just for fun, his marriage fell apart"" are absolutely the way people of my age group would tell each other these stories in person, but when in the process of writing, editing, and publishing a book, it's time to grow up a bit, don't you think? It's an unfortunate distraction, since the stories are quite fascinating, and Kean has a definite gift for analogy: a critical one when explaining abstract concepts like genes and proteins. The science is very approachable. Basic, but this book is for you if you know nothing about DNA and can put up with irritating turns of phrase that may make you feel like a cranky old lady in a rocking chair telling the kids to stop saying ""like"" and ""awesome."""

27,0316202975,http://goodreads.com/user/show/8660033-aaron-thibeault,4,"*A full executive-style summary of this book is available here: http://newbooksinbrief.com/2012/08/01...In a sense the story of DNA has two strands. On the one hand, as the blueprint of all that lives and the mechanism of heredity, DNA tells the story of life (and the history of life), from the smallest, simplest microbe, to we human beings, who have managed to figure all of this out. Of course, there is still much about DNA that we don't know. But given that we didn't even know of its existence until a lowly Swiss physician and biologist named Friedrich Miescher stumbled upon it in the 1860's, you have to admit we've come a long way in such a short time. And this is just where the second strand of the story of DNA begins: the story of our unraveling the mystery. While perhaps not as grandiose as the story of life itself, this detective story is significant in its own right, for it has transformed how we understand all that lives--including ourselves. This is especially the case given that the latest chapters in this story have revealed not only our own genomic blueprint, but the (deeply daunting) fact that we have the power to change this blueprint and thus became the masters of our own future as a species. While each of the strands of the story of DNA could fill a book in their own right (if not several), the author Sam Kean has managed to weave the two together and fit them both in his new book `The Violinist's Thumb: And Other Lost Tales of Love, War and Genius, as Written by Our Genetic Code'. Kean's project may seem like a particularly tall task, but he manages to pull it off by way of focusing in on only the main (and/or juiciest) moments and characters throughout.Kean divides his tome into four parts. The first part explores the basics of DNA and heredity, and the earliest discoveries thereof. Here we are introduced to the aforementioned Miescher, as well as Gregor Mendel, who teased out the basic laws of heredity using his famed peas. We also learn of Thomas Hunt Morgan and his team of eccentric lab assistants who managed to marry Mendelism (genetics) with Darwinism (evolution by natural selection) to develop the theory of genetic evolution, which stands as the main pillar of modern biology. We also learn about genetic mutations and how these glitches are the key to evolution. Sadly, these glitches also have their downside, which we witness through the story of Tsutomu Yamaguchi, who had the terrible misfortune of being in the blast area of both of the nuclear bombs that the US dropped on Japan at the end of WWII.Part II of the book explores DNA's role in the beginnings and evolution of life. In particular, Kean focuses on the major leaps in evolution, from the first microbes, to microbes with complex internal specialization, to multi-celled organisms with specialized cells (which includes all plants and animals), to mammals, to primates, to us. All of this may sound very technical, but Kean manages to keep the story lively with tales of northern seafarers encountering angry polar bears (and learning that biting into their innards can be just as deadly as them biting into yours), and Soviet scientists embarking on a project to create humanzees (yes, that's a cross between a human and a chimpanzee).Part III of the book turns to human DNA in particular, and what sets us apart as a species. Here we learn how our DNA reveals that our species has passed through several genetic bottlenecks--meaning there have been numerous occasions where our numbers have dwindled to near-extinction levels, with the latest bottleneck occurring as little as 70,000 years ago. This has left us with far less genetic diversity than most other species, including our closest living relatives, the chimps (compared to whom we also have two less chromosomes). We also learn about some of the genes that have contributed to the evolution of our big brains--the one thing that separates us most as a species. Finally, we learn about the role that DNA plays in our peculiar attraction to art.The fourth and final part of the book gets into the intricacies of the structure of DNA, and how our unraveling these intricacies (through the work of Watson and Crick, and the Human Genome Project) has allowed us to manipulate life forms. While these discoveries have opened up enormous opportunities, they have also led to some very poignant questions about just how we should be using this knowledge--especially when it comes to ourselves and our own species. As our knowledge of DNA increases (currently at a rate that exceeds Moore's Law) these questions will only become more pressing moving forward.Given the remarkably wide range of his subject matter, Kean's work runs the risk of becoming as tangled and sprawling as a string of DNA. However, the author does manage to keep the sprawl to a minimum (for the most part). Also, the science does get a bit thorny at times (the odd visual would have helped), but again, Kean mostly succeeds in making some very complex science easy to understand; what's more, Kean's clever and very down to earth use of language adds some nice flavor to the dish. A full executive-style summary of the book is available here: http://newbooksinbrief.com/2012/08/01...A podcast discussion of the book is also available. "
28,0316202975,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7051008-elena,4,"I previously read Sam Kean's book The Disappearing Spoon. I love it! Now, I decided to read The Violinist's Thumb for the same reason I loved The Disappearing Spoon, and that's because I love Sam Kean's writing. He definitely has a talent for writing about science. There's something really special about the way he tells human stories, especially when it comes to science. I thoroughly enjoyed, both of his books, even though the second lacked a little bit in my expectations. Netherless, you have to read what I'm about to say about The Violinist's Thumb!Same Kean definitely has the human touch when it comes to science writing. He focuses on human stories, rather than the science elements he's trying to talk about. The Disappearing Spoon was definitely like that. The Violinist's Thumb on the other hand was a bit dry. He has this tendency to go on tangential discussions, especially when he was talking about Zipf's Law... you will see when you read the book. Even still, I have to say it's still a great book, but it is a little drier than The Disappearing Spoon.These are some of my favorite stories from the book. First and foremost, it's the story of how the title gained its existence, from the violinist Paganini whose thumb could bend at really bizarre angles due to a genetic condition he had. Tsutomu Yamaguchi is the one and only person who survived exposure to TWO nuclear blasts, Hiroshima and Nagasaki. I'm curious to know if anything will happen to his future offspring in the third or fourth generation. And, wow, what about the explorers who got sick from eating polar bear livers due to their inability to process vitamin A. Now that's a story you have to read about.The book is filled with little tid-bits you'll find interesting and often funny. Let's mention the little tid-bid that 1 gram of DNA is equivalent in information as 1 trillion CDs of information. A scientist I had already known about from before is Johannes Miescher actually discovered DNA in white blood cells from something so accessible it left an impression on me. In a a day and age where we have to get permission for everything we want to get an experiment on, Miescher studied the pus of freshly removed would dressings and came onto a revolutionary discovery. Now that's a scientist!Sam Kean also talks a little bit about future projects: Clonning and Genome Splicing Project. That's something I'll let you all read about in the book. The reason I bring it up is because Sam Kean brings these two topics up for discussion, two topics we've seemed to stopped talking about more or less...I love Sam Kean's writing, even if The Violinist's Thumb fell short of my expectations. The Disappearing Spoon is just really good!"
29,0316202975,http://goodreads.com/user/show/611031-kater-cheek,4,"Sam Kean's first book THE DISAPPEARING SPOON was my favorite book I read last year, so I was very excited to read this one, hoping that it would be chock full of the same behind-the-scenes science stories that so delighted me the first time.It's not a bad book. In fact, I'm hovering between ""liked it"" and ""really liked it"". It has a lot of amazing stories in it. The spurious theory that Stalin may have wanted to breed a half-human half-chimpanzee super-army? Nuns doing genetic research in full habits? Neanderthal genomes mixed in with modern European descendants? It's not just great stuff for reading, it's also great stuff for telling your friends when you need small talk.And yet, I didn't enjoy this as much as the first book. I found it was taking me a long time to finish it, even though I brought it with me on a vacation. That's a sign that I haven't been super-excited about reading it. For one thing, while THE DISAPPEARING SPOON didn't presuppose a deep understanding of chemistry (that I recall) there was more than one section in THE VIOLINIST'S THUMB that I couldn't understand because I didn't know enough of the science behind it.The first half of this book felt a little slow. The main draw of the first book were the fascinating end notes, and I was horribly disappointed when the first few chapters' end notes read like...well, like normal end notes instead of Terry Pratchett-quality end notes. They got better after a time, and by the time I got to the section where the sailors looking for the Northwest passage died from eating polar bear liver, I had determined to plunge on.The latter half of the book definitely picked up. Kean writes about the human genome splicing project and all the drama behind it. I loved the stories of inbred royals and the perils of having children by your first cousin when your family is already sickly. Especially fascinating was the section on the connection between microbes and human genes, and the way Kean manages to segue into cat-hoarding and cross-breeding wasps.I recommend this book for people who liked THE DISAPPEARING SPOON, which is to say, science fans who like lots of fascinating historical anecdotes, the dirty backstage gossip behind the shining spectacle of genealogy."

His other book reads well, is organized and very interesting. This book reads as if the author pulled information from lots of other sources and threw it together. The chapter headings in this book often have very little to do with the chapter material. The material is not the author's but instead he is continuously using other author's works. I felt like I was reading Reader's Digest versions of other books. If you are truly interested in genes, DNA, science then this is not a book you will enjoy.It is very sensationalists. There was one photo in there of an infant...born with a tail. That was just a totally bizarre photo included purely to appeal to ?something? I don't know what, but it was not to appeal to people interested in science. So disappointing. This is just one example of how this book completely lets the reader down. Instead of science and DNA as the focus the author's focus is on evolution. Nothing on the cover or description indicates that this book will be about evolution and DNA. It just was not the same quality of writing or information as his first book. Mr. Kean is obviously a skilled writer but I wish he had put the same effort into this book as the Disappearing Spoon. Wish it had been as good as his other book..."

For those who love biology Sam Kean incorporates an inundation of knowledge in this book. His writing never gets too long-winded or lackadaisical; his humor is refreshing but he maintains his ethos with a scholarly tone.However, it took me over two weeks to finish this book just because I couldn't keep an interest in the subject matter. I sped through certain chapters like the one on atavisms, though the passages about well-known scientists and brazen theories bored me. On an entirely objective level perhaps this book deserves a higher rating. But, because I rate subjectively and feel cheated out of the time I could've used to read other books, The Violinist's Thumb gets a three.Recommended for anyone who enjoys biology or wants a relatively easy introduction to the subject.

At first his slightly oddball humour and focus on the personal dramas of his subject's put me off. Then I realised that between the one-liners and gossip-columnesque recounting of scientist's lives was a mass of hard information. Complex information that typically the most bright struggle with, passed out in the easiest to understand genetics I've encountered.By recounting the history of the subject, through the personal and professional lives of the scientists in the field Kean informs, entertains and debates a topic that we should all be interested in.Kean manages to do all this while retaining a human touch to his work. Studying genetics, DNA, and such tends to freak people out. But, it is hard to imagine anyone reacting to this book with squeamishness.Highly recommended to anyone with any interest in people, biology, evolution, behaviour, well anyone with interests really."
33,0316202975,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1069092-brad,3,"Another fun Sam Kean book. Like his earlier book The Disappearing Spoon that tackled the periodic table, Kean explores DNA and genetics in his latest with a fun and lighthearted approach. The science here is targeted heavily toward the layperson and he does a fine job introducing genetics to the unfamiliar. And he had some really great stories: the guy who was victim to BOTH Hiroshima and Nagasaki; the vicious rivalries of the Human Genome Project. Also like the Disappearing Spoon his silliness has a tendency to get old and I found myself rolling my eyes on more than one occasion. But, to be fair, the book really wasn’t written for the likes of me; people who deal with this crap for a living. Instead, I think it will become one of my recommended reads to my freshman and sophomore undergrads when we talk us some Mendel. Fun and quick with some great stories. And you might learn a little science, too. . . "
34,0316202975,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3286826-aaronb,4,"I read this as a follow up to the Disappearing Spoon. It deals with DNA and genes, and I liked the way he delves into history and links it to scientific breakthroughs. The pieces on homosexuality and genetics were quite interesting, as was the (mostly unfulfilled) page-turning chase to complete the Human Genome Project by the two duelling factions of scientists. It brings to mind IBM's practice of throwing two project teams on a software problem ""if you want to get the work done really quickly"".The Hapsburg part about incest and the genetic problems it made visible by studying court artists' pictures of them was remarkable. Seam Kean has helped a wider audience to understand, esp. with regard to cloning, that your genes do not determine you, but are only one piece of a larger puzzle to understand our background and what makes us tick."
35,0316202975,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7318623-catbookmom,2,"Started this as a break from a series I'm deeply involved in reading, and found myself thinking about the video explaining dinosaur DNA that is part of the **Jurassic Park** movie. Some of this seems like very dumbed-down science and other parts are very detailed. I found myself skipping around, and certainly my eyes glazed over in some places, where the tech-speak was just too much to absorb. Some of the information about the huge advances in DNA research and analysis is just mind-boggling, things like the cost of a DNA analysis dropping from millions of dollars to almost pocket-change. "
36,0316202975,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3440334-fred-forbes,5,"Flip a coin one thousand times and you will get heads about half the time, tails the other half. That is probably the way most authors would express the thought. Sam Kean writes ""If you flip a dime a thousand times, you'll get approximately five hundred FDRs and 500 torches ..."" It is that type of clever, accessible writing that makes Kean such a joy to read. Make no mistake, the study of DNA and genetics can be challenging but when it is presented as he does, integrating it well into science, history and art it is much more a pleasure than a slog. Recommended to anyone with a bit of curious intellect - a pleasurable way to learn."
37,0316202975,http://goodreads.com/user/show/12541461-betseak,4,"'The Violinist's Thumb' is an excellent overview of the history of DNA and genetics research. As I read the book in its audio version, the scientific parts were somewhat difficult to follow. Nevertheless, they were pretty well illuminated and made accessible through numerous entertaining stories, some of which a bit creepy, like the one about the attempts to make 'humanzees' (a human-chimpanzee cross-breed), yet others…hmm… a bit gossipy, let's say, but in a good, enlightening way. Recommended."
38,0316202975,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3617921-david-schwan,5,"Fascinating book which covers the history of discoveries surrounding DNA and how DNA works. Many people have been involved in learning how DNA works. Very little coverage of Watson & Crick versus Linus Pauling which has been covered well elsewhere. Lot's of detail regarding the fruit fly experiments, and lot's of other more forgotten but important breakthroughs. "

In The Violinist’s Thumb: And Other Lost Tales of Love, War, and Genius, as Written by Our Genetic Code, he explores the wonders of the magical building block of life: DNA.There are genes to explain crazy cat ladies, why other people have no fingerprints, and why some people survive nuclear bombs. Genes illuminate everything from JFK’s bronze skin (it wasn’t a tan) to Einstein’s genius. They prove that Neanderthals and humans bred thousands of years more recently than any of us would feel comfortable thinking. They can even allow some people, because of the exceptional flexibility of their thumbs and fingers, to become truly singular violinists.Kean’s vibrant storytelling once again makes science entertaining, explaining human history and whimsy while showing how DNA will influence our species’ future."

42,0316202975,http://goodreads.com/user/show/974110-wendi-lau,5,"Interesting, FUNNY, so riveting, even all the end notes are worth reading. Mr. Kean has such surprising turns of phrase. He is a very good storyteller."
43,0316202975,http://goodreads.com/user/show/54953761-tamara-cassinat,4,"I really enjoy Sam Kean books. This one - since it dealt with biology and DNA, which I know little about, wasn’t as interesting to me as his other book “The Disappearing Spoon” which is about chemistry and the making of the periodic table. Still really cool. Really interesting. Would recommend it. "
44,0316202975,http://goodreads.com/user/show/41735508-noah-goats,4,"Kean writes with humor and humanity, and weaves the science of our genetic code around the interesting stories of real people. The result is a scientific page turner."
45,0316202975,http://goodreads.com/user/show/20022340-jennie-rosenblum,4,"Easy to read, even with all the scientific terminology. Enjoyable side stories of the people behind the science."
46,0316202975,http://goodreads.com/user/show/10132668-trasa,5,"A book that simultaneously manages to teach you about DNA and related subjects while giving really salacious stories about the people involved with the science during the last couple hundred years. Excellent science, research, writing and flow of the book."
47,0316202975,http://goodreads.com/user/show/37650802-kara,4,"Kean is a very talented science writer, and this book is extremely readable — I powered through it in a little more than three days. He takes complex topics, breaks them down, and explains them in a way that everyday readers can understand, no small feat when it comes to genetics. Kean also provides a good balance of anecdotes and transitions easily between stories and science (a switch that I have seen awkwardly and/or abruptly handled in a lot of nonfiction). Usually, genetics isn't a nonfiction subject that I'm compelled to read about, unlike (say) psychology, but I blew through book and found myself wanting to check out some of Kean's sources for more information. This is definitely a book for a generalist audience and not DNA buffs who want to get in the weeds, but seeing as how I am a generalist reader, that was just fine by me."
48,0316202975,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1842160-courtney-williams,5,"The book: The Violinist's ThumbThe author: Sam Kean, American science writer.The subject: An exploration of DNA: the stories of its discovery, how it affects our lives and how it will shape our future.Why I chose it: I've seen it recommended before on one ""good popular science"" list or another. Also, the cover and title.The rating: Five out of five starsWhat I thought of it: I really should have reviewed this book a few weeks ago when I read it... I know I loved it, but can't remember exactly what I wanted to say about it! Anyway, I'll review it as best I can regardless.I am a violinist (and violist) myself and happen to have type D brachydactyly, also known as club thumb. It's a harmless quirk of genetics – much like hitch-hiker's thumb, which I also have on both hands – that has nevertheless been associated with both royals and murderers. I joke with my boyfriend that I'd be the worst X-Man ever and my name would be Thumbs and my superpower would be THUMBS! (And then I wave my thumbs in his face. It's a really funny joke.)

My thumbs. Yes, I put them on Instagram.Sadly, unlike the violinist whose thumbs inspired the title of this book, Niccolò Paganini, my thumbs have not helped me become such an incredible musician that people believe I sold my soul to the Devil. In fact, my hands are quite small in general, which impedes my ability to play and, try as I might, I still can't stop locking my tiny right thumb when holding the bow, rather than bending it gracefully. Despite my genetics betraying me so utterly, in terms of playing the higher string instruments at least, I'm still very interested in the subject itself and the stories behind its development. This book was right up my street.As you can probably tell by the top star rating, I really enjoyed this book, both as a piece of science writing and a generally enjoyable read. I have very little in the way of biology knowledge – I stopped studying it after GCSE Double Science, though I've read a little about it – I found it to be just in-depth enough that I learned things, but didn't feel I was in over my head. As someone who is interested enough in the history of science to be considering doing a masters degree in it, I loved all the stories Kean relates and all the tangents he goes on. The one that most stuck with me was the man who was a survivor of both the Hiroshima and Nagasaki atomic bombings. The endnotes were brilliant too, even if I always hate having to flick back and forth (yes, I'm lazy). I enjoyed the casual language and irreverent humour as well; it could have easily come off as an insincere attempt to be approachable, but it really worked well and felt appropriate.I wouldn't recommend this book to you if you want a gentle and linear introduction to genetics as a science, with background included where necessary. However, if you like science history, learning about scientific personalities and tangents galore, give this a go. I enjoyed it a great deal.Just one more thing: I was incredibly (disproportionately) excited to figure out the ""easter egg"" that Kean hid in his book quite quickly. If you've still not got it, let me know and I can give you a hint ;-)"
49,0316202975,http://goodreads.com/user/show/11516573-delta,3,"This was an interesting read for me. I'm familiar with the science of genetics (although by no means an expert or even a novice), but I feel like this book is written for readers with more expertise or at least a higher level of knowledge of biology. Most of the book is written for the average lay-person, but there are sections that read like a college-level textbook. Overall, I found it interesting, but would probably not recommend unless you are really interested in the subject."
50,0316202975,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1444762-jill,4,"You may recognize the author’s name because of his previous bestselling book about the periodic table, The Disappearing Spoon. In this book, he tackles genetics, doing a fine job in explaining a very complex subject bit by bit, with clever analogies and a good deal of humor.There are loads of interesting tidbits:Of all the survivors of the World War II atomic bombing of Hiroshima and Nagasaki, some 150 were caught near both cities on both days! (Talk about a run of bad luck!)In the 1940’s and 1950’s, many female scientists were nuns, because, as Kean explains, Women at the time usually had to relinquish their careers upon marrying, while unmarried women...provoked suspicion or derision and sometimes earned such low pay they couldn’t make ends meet.”Humans share about 99% of our DNA with chimpanzees, making them our closest living relatives. But male chimps have something humans don’t: little bumps called spines on their penises. According to Kean, “this loss decreases male sensation during sex and thereby prolongs copulation, which scientists suspect helps humans pair-bond and stay monogamous.”Who knew?Kean explains why Arctic explorers can risk death by eating the liver of polar bears, or why some people who have one cat start getting more cats. He also talks about the phenomenon of epigenetics: how genes can, in fact, be influenced by the environment, with the effects actually passed on to progeny, much as theorized by the discredited Jean-Baptiste Lamarck. He even explains how why the beliefs of some religions couldn’t possibly be true: the genetic evidence tells a different story.Evaluation: This book is full of fascinating anecdotes, as well as a lot of science, which you can actually just scan if you prefer, without it detracting from the general thrust of the book. One big criticism: When I read a nonfiction book, I depend heavily on the index to help me refer back to ideas I just read 20 minutes ago but forgot already. The index in this book is extremely inadequate. Want to look up that bit about cats, for example? Well, you won’t find anything under “cat” or “feline”: unless you remember that the organism which is the culprit is called Toxoplasma gondii, you’re out of luck!Otherwise, it was a very entertaining read; once again Kean has succeeded in making science fun, which is absolutely a good thing!Rating: 3.5/5"
51,0316202975,http://goodreads.com/user/show/10762842-nicole-r,5,"I binged on new release contemporary fiction lately and, while it led me to many great books, it left me craving something nonfiction. Leah K's review earlier this month of The Violinist's Thumb made my decision of what to read to balance my “book diet” a no brainer.DNA. Amino acids. Genes. I likely lost most of you after “DNA”. DNA is the basis of all life. Just FOUR MEASLY “LETTERS” account for all of the diversity IN THE ENTIRE WORLD. Seriously. Mind blowing. But how much do we really know about the blueprint for life? I have a PhD in biology so I likely know more than the average Joe Schmo but I have just barely covered the tip of the iceberg.Sam Kean brilliantly escorts us through the just-deeper-than-the-basics of DNA. He explains: 	 • the physical structure of DNA and how this translates into amino acids and genes; 	 • how one species becomes two (or three or four or….) through different pressures on DNA; 	 • the evolution of human genes and how we have morphed from primate to Neanderthal to Homo sapiens but still have 99% the same DNA as the person sitting next to us, down the hall, or in Siberia; and 	 • what can (or can’t) genes teach us.Mr. Kean uses interesting stories, mini-bios of famous scientists, and humor to draw the reader in, make complicated concepts understandable, and – most importantly – entertain us. I learned a lot about the idiosyncrasies of names I hear all the time like Darwin, Watson and Crick, Mendel, and others. For example, I had NO IDEA that Darwin was actually an extremely sickly man following the Voyage of the Beagle and may have had a genetic predilection for his symptoms!Other fun facts: Tsutomu Yamaguchi is the only officially recognized person by the Japanese government to have survived both the Hiroshima AND Nagasaki bombings….and, then he lived to be 93 years old! There is a theory that the Toba supervolcanic eruption roughly 75,000 years ago is responsible for the near-extinction of humans, the genetic bottleneck that followed, and why humans are so genetically similar today. And, there is a similar supervolcano just building up steam under Wyoming!Seriously, this book was phenomenal. It was simple and clear enough that everyone could learn something but had enough interesting sidebars that even those well-versed in genetics would likely learn something new. Mr. Kean, you have a new fan and I plan on reading the Disappearing Spoon very soon!"
52,0316202975,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3837733-joan,5,"This was absolutely fascinating! The author writes in a very approachable manner, so that you can understand fairly complicated stuff without needing a scholarly biology background. He also does this with no hint of writing down to anyone. He gleefully shows how very human the scientists who study DNA and genetics are, as well as how human are their subjects, many of whom have genetic based diseases. He finishes with a cautionary note. He reminds his audience that DNA only works in probabilities, not in possibilities. In other words, the first time he had his genome sequenced, he told them he wanted no information on whether he is going to get Parkinson's or not. After reading and absorbing the information, he realized he was being silly. Potential is not necessarily doom. He got online and clicked to remove the note against getting that information. Hurray, he isn't going to get Parkinson's! Later, an update on what the information means came and he checked. Oops. He does have a potential to get Parkinson's. It didn't worry him the way it did when he started studying this field. He checked and found out he has a 20% increased chance of getting Parkinson''s. He can now realize that is fairly low percentage. BTW in case you are wondering, but don't want to read the book to find out, the violinist's thumb in the title, refers to Pagannini. He possibly had a genetic condition where his joints, including that thumb, were amazingly flexible.However, that same condition that made him possibly the greatest violinist of all time, also gave him great misery and likely an early death. He introduced the concept of epigenetics which was a new concept to me and apparently one of the really complicating factors in studying DNA. If you have any interest in genetics or the history of science, this is a must read! I'm really grateful to Rebecca for recommending this book and have checked out another book by this author. Expect a review on that book in several months!"
53,0316202975,http://goodreads.com/user/show/73003404-daniel,4,"I read this book due to my love of The Disappearing Spoon: And Other True Tales of Madness, Love, and the History of the World from the Periodic Table of the Elements, of which this is a spiritual sequel (review here - pretty much all of which applies), but while I enjoyed it, I did not find it to be as magical as the original, despite the nearly identical writing style and structure. The Violinist's Thumb was narrated differently for audiobook than The Disappearing Spoon, and I did consume portions of it via e-reader, but I don't think those discrepancies are responsible for my less-gushing enthusiasm.Instead, I think this is entirely down to subject matter. First, I think the physics and chemistry that formed the core of The Disappearing Spoon was likely more comfortable for the author, a former Physics student, than the biology at the heart of The Violinist's Thumb - a view reinforced by the former's earlier publication. Second, while there is a lot of ""unknown"" in physics and chemistry, our current understanding can explain a great deal of interesting real-world phenomena, whereas genetics seems to have a much more ambiguous causal relationship, which is harder to latch on to. Most importantly, though, I think I'm personally just less interested in genetics than I was in the material in The Disappearing Spoon. This book is still excellent though, like its predecessor, and anyone interested in heredity should definitely pick it up."
54,0316202975,http://goodreads.com/user/show/9958121-nicole,4,"I missed about a decade of, oh, everything going on in the world, due to childrearing and family responsibilities and constraints, so I pretty much had only the vaguest idea that the Human Genome Project was happening. This book is a great starting place for someone who knows only a little history of science and pretty much nothing about genetics.The cutesy language that other reviewers have found irksome delighted me. Sometimes his language, his references, are quite clever. I had to look up quite a few words, and I'm not talking about the scientific terms. Last night my son asked, ""How is it that every time you open that book you start laughing?"" The anecdotes and funny references (i.e. Roald Dahl and the Maginot Line) give the non-scientist hooks to hang a lot of technical information on, information that I would not have retained otherwise. Although I understand that he is writing for the average reader, not the scientist, I shared another reviewer's frustrations about citations. He often says something along the lines of ""one scientist commented that 'blah blah blah'"" but we never get to know who that person was. The endnotes were full of delicious little facts, and a few sources were cited or recommended there, but certainly a more detailed list of references would have been appropriate, and not distracting (if that was the concern) to the non-scientist, if tucked away at the end of the book. A cast of characters list would also have been helpful. That said, good starting place, clever and engaging. "
55,0316202975,http://goodreads.com/user/show/264570-bonnie,2,"I deserve a medal for not only making it through this complete obfuscation of a book, but presenting it at book club as well. Sentence after sentence and paragraph after paragraph refuting what the author's goal was for the book (if indeed I even understood that). Paragraphs with evidence based verbiage while including words like perhaps, somehow, but then refuted. I don't even have the energy to write a review on it.I'm glad I read it. I did learn something--just don't ask me what. I will add that the author lost his credence many times, but none more so than with this gem of inaccurate and untruthful reporting found in the notes in the back of the book: ""Mormons have traditionally believed--ever since Joseph Smith, just fourteen years old, copied down Jehovah's very words in 1820. . . ."" Joseph Smith was not 14 years old when he began translation of the Book of Mormon; using the word ""copying"" is an untruth, and Jehovah's very words are in the Book of Mormon, but only chapters 11-28 of 3rd Nephi (one of 15 or so books that make up the Book of Mormon). The rest is a history of two different people that left Jerusalem at two different times. I'd gotten to page 241 in this book before I found this cowardly note tucked into the back of the book. And if the author were off that much on this very small and insignificant portion of the book, one can only ask how much else irresponsible reporting of purported facts did he do?"
56,0316202975,http://goodreads.com/user/show/16013276-melissa-meinhard,3,"Overall this was a very interesting book but I had some major problems with the author's choice of language. He tried to make this more of an ""everyman's"" book instead of a straight science book and lost something in the compromise. In order to make the book seem more poetic he takes liberties with the science. The problems I had were when he was talking about the animals in the book; he often used the words ""monkeys"" and ""apes"" interchangeably as well as others like ""rats"" and ""mice"". I can see he was trying to not use the same words over and over again, and thought that some variety would make the book more enjoyable. For someone who is not a scientist, this would most likely go unnoticed. But if you are writing a book in order to educate people on something, they deserve to be given the correct information. I was so frustrated at some points that I had to put the book down and come back to it when i wasn't so annoyed.The thing that I enjoyed the most about this book was the acrostic that was challenged in the beginning of the book. If you can figure it out, the author wants you to email him your answer. A friend and I worked on it and got it all correct except for the final letter. That was the most fun I had had with a book in awhile. So it gets 3 stars--I liked it. Negative points for the abuse of science, but positive points for the fun and difficult acrostic."
57,0316202975,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2600140-rebecca,3,"The author writes about DNA from its discovery to how scientists learned to interpret it and interpret genes, infighting among scientists working to map the genome, ethical issues, etc. He illuminates the information with lots of fascinating anecdotes and stories of people and places affected by some aberration in DNA/genes in ways we wouldn't suspect.I'll admit that even in this work aimed at the general public, some of the science was above my head, and I yawned my way through the technical details. I got a lot more out of the examples and stories, such as why you should never eat polar bear liver. The author does a good job of choosing interesting happenings to explore in terms of genetics, and I did finally understand how genes could be mapped (well, sort of). The book was kind of a long slog, so I would only recommend it to those with a strong interest in science, and particularly DNA/genes.[As a side note, I forgot that I read this and picked it up again as an audiobook, and gave up pretty early on because I couldn't keep the thread of it in my head. Plus I thought the horrific details of Hiroshima and Nagasaki were unnecessary. They did cause gene damage and mutation, which is necessary to the subject of the book, but the gruesome descriptions of injuries felt gratuitous.]"
58,0316202975,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3486418-scott-collins,4,"Entertaining, balanced and nicely written romp through the history of genetics, filled with fascinating characters such as Ilya Ivanov, the Russian scientist who tried to breed humanzees by impregnating chimps with human sperm (and vice versa, which almost happened until African officials thought better of offering up their women for such an experiment). Some of the science can be a little befuddling without a firm rooting in biology (time to bone up those DNA bases from Life Science 101!), but every chapter contains connections and stories that the non-scientists among us (and maybe some scientists too?) have never heard before. Could Toulouse-Lautrec's heredity have influenced his art? Oh, yes, it could have. Kean has the story, and it's a beaut. Is Humane Genome guru Craig Venter an egomaniacal jerk? Um, maybe - but his story is probably more important to our times than that of, say, the past few presidential campaigns or even global warming, to cite some events that get much more daily attention. The book even ends with an intriguing and slightly scary prospective look at the future of gene research, which might even include - gulp - DNA computers. Old-hat stuff for science geeks, perhaps, but it's all pretty delectable for non-pros. "
59,0316202975,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2613351-linda-robinson,4,"DNA, when unwound, could reach to Pluto and back to Earth again. Kean tries to unwind most of this distance for us, and the journey is a little long. Kean writes like a fan of science, which is good, but releases a tendency to cover every sidebar story genetically connected to our code. We're reminded again of the classroom bully fights that are waged with any research, and the childish grip of some scientists on pet theories, and personal endeavor. I wonder where we would be if this sniping was replaced by cooperation in laboratories and classrooms? Kean gives credit thankfully to the women scientists who are always involved in breakthroughs, but are hidden behind the curtain of history and male science writers. Kudos, Kean! While anecdotes are interesting, too many is like a houseguest that overstays the welcome. The last chapters are the most interesting - if DNA/RNA, genetics and epigenetics are an enormously powerful computing system, when will technology make the leap from circuit boards to proteins? That journey is going on now."

This book, The Violinist's Thumb, took forever to come in at the library and I could hardly wait to read it. Well, it's difficult to even tell this is the same author. His other book reads well, is organized and very interesting. This book reads as if the author pulled information from lots of other sources and threw it together. The chapter headings in this book often have very little to do with the chapter material. The material is not the author's but instead he is continuously using other author's works. I felt like I was reading Reader's Digest versions of other books. If you are truly interested in genes, DNA, science then this is not a book you will enjoy.It is very sensationalists. There was one photo in there of an infant...born with a tail. That was just a totally bizarre photo included purely to appeal to ?something? I don't know what, but it was not to appeal to people interested in science. So disappointing. This is just one example of how this book completely lets the reader down. Instead of science and DNA as the focus the author's focus is on evolution. Nothing on the cover or description indicates that this book will be about evolution and DNA. It just was not the same quality of writing or information as his first book. Mr. Kean is obviously a skilled writer but I wish he had put the same effort into this book as the Disappearing Spoon. Wish it had been as good as his other book..."

Can you fathom that pheromones could make you fall in love?The Violinist's Thumb contains chapters on all of these topics - it combines shocking facts with biological premises with the history of DNA discovery. For those who love biology Sam Kean incorporates an inundation of knowledge in this book. His writing never gets too long-winded or lackadaisical; his humor is refreshing but he maintains his ethos with a scholarly tone.However, it took me over two weeks to finish this book just because I couldn't keep an interest in the subject matter. I sped through certain chapters like the one on atavisms, though the passages about well-known scientists and brazen theories bored me. On an entirely objective level perhaps this book deserves a higher rating. But, because I rate subjectively and feel cheated out of the time I could've used to read other books, The Violinist's Thumb gets a three.Recommended for anyone who enjoys biology or wants a relatively easy introduction to the subject. I used a chapter of this book for my AP Biology project and impressed my teacher, showing that The Violinist's Thumb is accessible to a wide variety of ages and knowledge levels.*review cross-posted on my blog, the quiet voice."

Complex information that typically the most bright struggle with, passed out in the easiest to understand genetics I've encountered.By recounting the history of the subject, through the personal and professional lives of the scientists in the field Kean informs, entertains and debates a topic that we should all be interested in.Kean manages to do all this while retaining a human touch to his work. Studying genetics, DNA, and such tends to freak people out. But, it is hard to imagine anyone reacting to this book with squeamishness.Highly recommended to anyone with any interest in people, biology, evolution, behaviour, well anyone with interests really."
63,0316202975,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1069092-brad,3,"Another fun Sam Kean book. Like his earlier book The Disappearing Spoon that tackled the periodic table, Kean explores DNA and genetics in his latest with a fun and lighthearted approach. The science here is targeted heavily toward the layperson and he does a fine job introducing genetics to the unfamiliar. And he had some really great stories: the guy who was victim to BOTH Hiroshima and Nagasaki; the vicious rivalries of the Human Genome Project. Also like the Disappearing Spoon his silliness has a tendency to get old and I found myself rolling my eyes on more than one occasion. But, to be fair, the book really wasn’t written for the likes of me; people who deal with this crap for a living. Instead, I think it will become one of my recommended reads to my freshman and sophomore undergrads when we talk us some Mendel. Fun and quick with some great stories. And you might learn a little science, too. . . "
64,0316202975,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3286826-aaronb,4,"I read this as a follow up to the Disappearing Spoon. It deals with DNA and genes, and I liked the way he delves into history and links it to scientific breakthroughs. The pieces on homosexuality and genetics were quite interesting, as was the (mostly unfulfilled) page-turning chase to complete the Human Genome Project by the two duelling factions of scientists. It brings to mind IBM's practice of throwing two project teams on a software problem ""if you want to get the work done really quickly"".The Hapsburg part about incest and the genetic problems it made visible by studying court artists' pictures of them was remarkable. Seam Kean has helped a wider audience to understand, esp. with regard to cloning, that your genes do not determine you, but are only one piece of a larger puzzle to understand our background and what makes us tick."
65,0316202975,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7318623-catbookmom,2,"Started this as a break from a series I'm deeply involved in reading, and found myself thinking about the video explaining dinosaur DNA that is part of the **Jurassic Park** movie. Some of this seems like very dumbed-down science and other parts are very detailed. I found myself skipping around, and certainly my eyes glazed over in some places, where the tech-speak was just too much to absorb. Some of the information about the huge advances in DNA research and analysis is just mind-boggling, things like the cost of a DNA analysis dropping from millions of dollars to almost pocket-change. "
66,0316202975,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3440334-fred-forbes,5,"Flip a coin one thousand times and you will get heads about half the time, tails the other half. That is probably the way most authors would express the thought. Sam Kean writes ""If you flip a dime a thousand times, you'll get approximately five hundred FDRs and 500 torches ..."" It is that type of clever, accessible writing that makes Kean such a joy to read. Make no mistake, the study of DNA and genetics can be challenging but when it is presented as he does, integrating it well into science, history and art it is much more a pleasure than a slog. Recommended to anyone with a bit of curious intellect - a pleasurable way to learn."

As I read the book in its audio version, the scientific parts were somewhat difficult to follow. Nevertheless, they were pretty well illuminated and made accessible through numerous entertaining stories, some of which a bit creepy, like the one about the attempts to make 'humanzees' (a human-chimpanzee cross-breed), yet others…hmm… a bit gossipy, let's say, but in a good, enlightening way. Recommended."
68,0316202975,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3617921-david-schwan,5,"Fascinating book which covers the history of discoveries surrounding DNA and how DNA works. Many people have been involved in learning how DNA works. Very little coverage of Watson & Crick versus Linus Pauling which has been covered well elsewhere. Lot's of detail regarding the fruit fly experiments, and lot's of other more forgotten but important breakthroughs. "

In The Violinist’s Thumb: And Other Lost Tales of Love, War, and Genius, as Written by Our Genetic Code, he explores the wonders of the magical building block of life: DNA.There are genes to explain crazy cat ladies, why other people have no fingerprints, and why some people survive nuclear bombs. Genes illuminate everything from JFK’s bronze skin (it wasn’t a tan) to Einstein’s genius. They prove that Neanderthals and humans bred thousands of years more recently than any of us would feel comfortable thinking. They can even allow some people, because of the exceptional flexibility of their thumbs and fingers, to become truly singular violinists.Kean’s vibrant storytelling once again makes science entertaining, explaining human history and whimsy while showing how DNA will influence our species’ future."

72,0316202975,http://goodreads.com/user/show/974110-wendi-lau,5,"Interesting, FUNNY, so riveting, even all the end notes are worth reading. Mr. Kean has such surprising turns of phrase. He is a very good storyteller."
73,0316202975,http://goodreads.com/user/show/54953761-tamara-cassinat,4,"I really enjoy Sam Kean books. This one - since it dealt with biology and DNA, which I know little about, wasn’t as interesting to me as his other book “The Disappearing Spoon” which is about chemistry and the making of the periodic table. Still really cool. Really interesting. Would recommend it. "
74,0316202975,http://goodreads.com/user/show/41735508-noah-goats,4,"Kean writes with humor and humanity, and weaves the science of our genetic code around the interesting stories of real people. The result is a scientific page turner."
75,0316202975,http://goodreads.com/user/show/20022340-jennie-rosenblum,4,"Easy to read, even with all the scientific terminology. Enjoyable side stories of the people behind the science."
76,0316202975,http://goodreads.com/user/show/10132668-trasa,5,"A book that simultaneously manages to teach you about DNA and related subjects while giving really salacious stories about the people involved with the science during the last couple hundred years. Excellent science, research, writing and flow of the book."
77,0316202975,http://goodreads.com/user/show/37650802-kara,4,"Kean is a very talented science writer, and this book is extremely readable — I powered through it in a little more than three days. He takes complex topics, breaks them down, and explains them in a way that everyday readers can understand, no small feat when it comes to genetics. Kean also provides a good balance of anecdotes and transitions easily between stories and science (a switch that I have seen awkwardly and/or abruptly handled in a lot of nonfiction). Usually, genetics isn't a nonfiction subject that I'm compelled to read about, unlike (say) psychology, but I blew through book and found myself wanting to check out some of Kean's sources for more information. This is definitely a book for a generalist audience and not DNA buffs who want to get in the weeds, but seeing as how I am a generalist reader, that was just fine by me."
78,0316202975,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1842160-courtney-williams,5,"The book: The Violinist's ThumbThe author: Sam Kean, American science writer.The subject: An exploration of DNA: the stories of its discovery, how it affects our lives and how it will shape our future.Why I chose it: I've seen it recommended before on one ""good popular science"" list or another. Also, the cover and title.The rating: Five out of five starsWhat I thought of it: I really should have reviewed this book a few weeks ago when I read it... I know I loved it, but can't remember exactly what I wanted to say about it! Anyway, I'll review it as best I can regardless.I am a violinist (and violist) myself and happen to have type D brachydactyly, also known as club thumb. It's a harmless quirk of genetics – much like hitch-hiker's thumb, which I also have on both hands – that has nevertheless been associated with both royals and murderers. I joke with my boyfriend that I'd be the worst X-Man ever and my name would be Thumbs and my superpower would be THUMBS! (And then I wave my thumbs in his face. It's a really funny joke.)

My thumbs. Yes, I put them on Instagram.Sadly, unlike the violinist whose thumbs inspired the title of this book, Niccolò Paganini, my thumbs have not helped me become such an incredible musician that people believe I sold my soul to the Devil. In fact, my hands are quite small in general, which impedes my ability to play and, try as I might, I still can't stop locking my tiny right thumb when holding the bow, rather than bending it gracefully. Despite my genetics betraying me so utterly, in terms of playing the higher string instruments at least, I'm still very interested in the subject itself and the stories behind its development. This book was right up my street.As you can probably tell by the top star rating, I really enjoyed this book, both as a piece of science writing and a generally enjoyable read. I have very little in the way of biology knowledge – I stopped studying it after GCSE Double Science, though I've read a little about it – I found it to be just in-depth enough that I learned things, but didn't feel I was in over my head. As someone who is interested enough in the history of science to be considering doing a masters degree in it, I loved all the stories Kean relates and all the tangents he goes on. The one that most stuck with me was the man who was a survivor of both the Hiroshima and Nagasaki atomic bombings. The endnotes were brilliant too, even if I always hate having to flick back and forth (yes, I'm lazy). I enjoyed the casual language and irreverent humour as well; it could have easily come off as an insincere attempt to be approachable, but it really worked well and felt appropriate.I wouldn't recommend this book to you if you want a gentle and linear introduction to genetics as a science, with background included where necessary. However, if you like science history, learning about scientific personalities and tangents galore, give this a go. I enjoyed it a great deal.Just one more thing: I was incredibly (disproportionately) excited to figure out the ""easter egg"" that Kean hid in his book quite quickly. If you've still not got it, let me know and I can give you a hint ;-)"
79,0316202975,http://goodreads.com/user/show/11516573-delta,3,"This was an interesting read for me. I'm familiar with the science of genetics (although by no means an expert or even a novice), but I feel like this book is written for readers with more expertise or at least a higher level of knowledge of biology. Most of the book is written for the average lay-person, but there are sections that read like a college-level textbook. Overall, I found it interesting, but would probably not recommend unless you are really interested in the subject."
80,0316202975,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1444762-jill,4,"You may recognize the author’s name because of his previous bestselling book about the periodic table, The Disappearing Spoon. In this book, he tackles genetics, doing a fine job in explaining a very complex subject bit by bit, with clever analogies and a good deal of humor.There are loads of interesting tidbits:Of all the survivors of the World War II atomic bombing of Hiroshima and Nagasaki, some 150 were caught near both cities on both days! (Talk about a run of bad luck!)In the 1940’s and 1950’s, many female scientists were nuns, because, as Kean explains, Women at the time usually had to relinquish their careers upon marrying, while unmarried women...provoked suspicion or derision and sometimes earned such low pay they couldn’t make ends meet.”Humans share about 99% of our DNA with chimpanzees, making them our closest living relatives. But male chimps have something humans don’t: little bumps called spines on their penises. According to Kean, “this loss decreases male sensation during sex and thereby prolongs copulation, which scientists suspect helps humans pair-bond and stay monogamous.”Who knew?Kean explains why Arctic explorers can risk death by eating the liver of polar bears, or why some people who have one cat start getting more cats. He also talks about the phenomenon of epigenetics: how genes can, in fact, be influenced by the environment, with the effects actually passed on to progeny, much as theorized by the discredited Jean-Baptiste Lamarck. He even explains how why the beliefs of some religions couldn’t possibly be true: the genetic evidence tells a different story.Evaluation: This book is full of fascinating anecdotes, as well as a lot of science, which you can actually just scan if you prefer, without it detracting from the general thrust of the book. One big criticism: When I read a nonfiction book, I depend heavily on the index to help me refer back to ideas I just read 20 minutes ago but forgot already. The index in this book is extremely inadequate. Want to look up that bit about cats, for example? Well, you won’t find anything under “cat” or “feline”: unless you remember that the organism which is the culprit is called Toxoplasma gondii, you’re out of luck!Otherwise, it was a very entertaining read; once again Kean has succeeded in making science fun, which is absolutely a good thing!Rating: 3.5/5"
81,0316202975,http://goodreads.com/user/show/10762842-nicole-r,5,"I binged on new release contemporary fiction lately and, while it led me to many great books, it left me craving something nonfiction. Leah K's review earlier this month of The Violinist's Thumb made my decision of what to read to balance my “book diet” a no brainer.DNA. Amino acids. Genes. I likely lost most of you after “DNA”. DNA is the basis of all life. Just FOUR MEASLY “LETTERS” account for all of the diversity IN THE ENTIRE WORLD. Seriously. Mind blowing. But how much do we really know about the blueprint for life? I have a PhD in biology so I likely know more than the average Joe Schmo but I have just barely covered the tip of the iceberg.Sam Kean brilliantly escorts us through the just-deeper-than-the-basics of DNA. He explains: 	 • the physical structure of DNA and how this translates into amino acids and genes; 	 • how one species becomes two (or three or four or….) through different pressures on DNA; 	 • the evolution of human genes and how we have morphed from primate to Neanderthal to Homo sapiens but still have 99% the same DNA as the person sitting next to us, down the hall, or in Siberia; and 	 • what can (or can’t) genes teach us.Mr. Kean uses interesting stories, mini-bios of famous scientists, and humor to draw the reader in, make complicated concepts understandable, and – most importantly – entertain us. I learned a lot about the idiosyncrasies of names I hear all the time like Darwin, Watson and Crick, Mendel, and others. For example, I had NO IDEA that Darwin was actually an extremely sickly man following the Voyage of the Beagle and may have had a genetic predilection for his symptoms!Other fun facts: Tsutomu Yamaguchi is the only officially recognized person by the Japanese government to have survived both the Hiroshima AND Nagasaki bombings….and, then he lived to be 93 years old! There is a theory that the Toba supervolcanic eruption roughly 75,000 years ago is responsible for the near-extinction of humans, the genetic bottleneck that followed, and why humans are so genetically similar today. And, there is a similar supervolcano just building up steam under Wyoming!Seriously, this book was phenomenal. It was simple and clear enough that everyone could learn something but had enough interesting sidebars that even those well-versed in genetics would likely learn something new. Mr. Kean, you have a new fan and I plan on reading the Disappearing Spoon very soon!"
82,0316202975,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3837733-joan,5,"This was absolutely fascinating! The author writes in a very approachable manner, so that you can understand fairly complicated stuff without needing a scholarly biology background. He also does this with no hint of writing down to anyone. He gleefully shows how very human the scientists who study DNA and genetics are, as well as how human are their subjects, many of whom have genetic based diseases. He finishes with a cautionary note. He reminds his audience that DNA only works in probabilities, not in possibilities. In other words, the first time he had his genome sequenced, he told them he wanted no information on whether he is going to get Parkinson's or not. After reading and absorbing the information, he realized he was being silly. Potential is not necessarily doom. He got online and clicked to remove the note against getting that information. Hurray, he isn't going to get Parkinson's! Later, an update on what the information means came and he checked. Oops. He does have a potential to get Parkinson's. It didn't worry him the way it did when he started studying this field. He checked and found out he has a 20% increased chance of getting Parkinson''s. He can now realize that is fairly low percentage. BTW in case you are wondering, but don't want to read the book to find out, the violinist's thumb in the title, refers to Pagannini. He possibly had a genetic condition where his joints, including that thumb, were amazingly flexible.However, that same condition that made him possibly the greatest violinist of all time, also gave him great misery and likely an early death. He introduced the concept of epigenetics which was a new concept to me and apparently one of the really complicating factors in studying DNA. If you have any interest in genetics or the history of science, this is a must read! I'm really grateful to Rebecca for recommending this book and have checked out another book by this author. Expect a review on that book in several months!"
83,0316202975,http://goodreads.com/user/show/73003404-daniel,4,"I read this book due to my love of The Disappearing Spoon: And Other True Tales of Madness, Love, and the History of the World from the Periodic Table of the Elements, of which this is a spiritual sequel (review here - pretty much all of which applies), but while I enjoyed it, I did not find it to be as magical as the original, despite the nearly identical writing style and structure. The Violinist's Thumb was narrated differently for audiobook than The Disappearing Spoon, and I did consume portions of it via e-reader, but I don't think those discrepancies are responsible for my less-gushing enthusiasm.Instead, I think this is entirely down to subject matter. First, I think the physics and chemistry that formed the core of The Disappearing Spoon was likely more comfortable for the author, a former Physics student, than the biology at the heart of The Violinist's Thumb - a view reinforced by the former's earlier publication. Second, while there is a lot of ""unknown"" in physics and chemistry, our current understanding can explain a great deal of interesting real-world phenomena, whereas genetics seems to have a much more ambiguous causal relationship, which is harder to latch on to. Most importantly, though, I think I'm personally just less interested in genetics than I was in the material in The Disappearing Spoon. This book is still excellent though, like its predecessor, and anyone interested in heredity should definitely pick it up."

This book is a great starting place for someone who knows only a little history of science and pretty much nothing about genetics.The cutesy language that other reviewers have found irksome delighted me. Sometimes his language, his references, are quite clever. I had to look up quite a few words, and I'm not talking about the scientific terms. Last night my son asked, ""How is it that every time you open that book you start laughing?"" The anecdotes and funny references (i.e. Roald Dahl and the Maginot Line) give the non-scientist hooks to hang a lot of technical information on, information that I would not have retained otherwise. Although I understand that he is writing for the average reader, not the scientist, I shared another reviewer's frustrations about citations. He often says something along the lines of ""one scientist commented that 'blah blah blah'"" but we never get to know who that person was. The endnotes were full of delicious little facts, and a few sources were cited or recommended there, but certainly a more detailed list of references would have been appropriate, and not distracting (if that was the concern) to the non-scientist, if tucked away at the end of the book. A cast of characters list would also have been helpful. That said, good starting place, clever and engaging. "
85,0316202975,http://goodreads.com/user/show/264570-bonnie,2,"I deserve a medal for not only making it through this complete obfuscation of a book, but presenting it at book club as well. Sentence after sentence and paragraph after paragraph refuting what the author's goal was for the book (if indeed I even understood that). Paragraphs with evidence based verbiage while including words like perhaps, somehow, but then refuted. I don't even have the energy to write a review on it.I'm glad I read it. I did learn something--just don't ask me what. I will add that the author lost his credence many times, but none more so than with this gem of inaccurate and untruthful reporting found in the notes in the back of the book: ""Mormons have traditionally believed--ever since Joseph Smith, just fourteen years old, copied down Jehovah's very words in 1820. . . ."" Joseph Smith was not 14 years old when he began translation of the Book of Mormon; using the word ""copying"" is an untruth, and Jehovah's very words are in the Book of Mormon, but only chapters 11-28 of 3rd Nephi (one of 15 or so books that make up the Book of Mormon). The rest is a history of two different people that left Jerusalem at two different times. I'd gotten to page 241 in this book before I found this cowardly note tucked into the back of the book. And if the author were off that much on this very small and insignificant portion of the book, one can only ask how much else irresponsible reporting of purported facts did he do?"
86,0316202975,http://goodreads.com/user/show/16013276-melissa-meinhard,3,"Overall this was a very interesting book but I had some major problems with the author's choice of language. He tried to make this more of an ""everyman's"" book instead of a straight science book and lost something in the compromise. In order to make the book seem more poetic he takes liberties with the science. The problems I had were when he was talking about the animals in the book; he often used the words ""monkeys"" and ""apes"" interchangeably as well as others like ""rats"" and ""mice"". I can see he was trying to not use the same words over and over again, and thought that some variety would make the book more enjoyable. For someone who is not a scientist, this would most likely go unnoticed. But if you are writing a book in order to educate people on something, they deserve to be given the correct information. I was so frustrated at some points that I had to put the book down and come back to it when i wasn't so annoyed.The thing that I enjoyed the most about this book was the acrostic that was challenged in the beginning of the book. If you can figure it out, the author wants you to email him your answer. A friend and I worked on it and got it all correct except for the final letter. That was the most fun I had had with a book in awhile. So it gets 3 stars--I liked it. Negative points for the abuse of science, but positive points for the fun and difficult acrostic."
87,0316202975,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2600140-rebecca,3,"The author writes about DNA from its discovery to how scientists learned to interpret it and interpret genes, infighting among scientists working to map the genome, ethical issues, etc. He illuminates the information with lots of fascinating anecdotes and stories of people and places affected by some aberration in DNA/genes in ways we wouldn't suspect.I'll admit that even in this work aimed at the general public, some of the science was above my head, and I yawned my way through the technical details. I got a lot more out of the examples and stories, such as why you should never eat polar bear liver. The author does a good job of choosing interesting happenings to explore in terms of genetics, and I did finally understand how genes could be mapped (well, sort of). The book was kind of a long slog, so I would only recommend it to those with a strong interest in science, and particularly DNA/genes.[As a side note, I forgot that I read this and picked it up again as an audiobook, and gave up pretty early on because I couldn't keep the thread of it in my head. Plus I thought the horrific details of Hiroshima and Nagasaki were unnecessary. They did cause gene damage and mutation, which is necessary to the subject of the book, but the gruesome descriptions of injuries felt gratuitous.]"
88,0316202975,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3486418-scott-collins,4,"Entertaining, balanced and nicely written romp through the history of genetics, filled with fascinating characters such as Ilya Ivanov, the Russian scientist who tried to breed humanzees by impregnating chimps with human sperm (and vice versa, which almost happened until African officials thought better of offering up their women for such an experiment). Some of the science can be a little befuddling without a firm rooting in biology (time to bone up those DNA bases from Life Science 101!), but every chapter contains connections and stories that the non-scientists among us (and maybe some scientists too?) have never heard before. Could Toulouse-Lautrec's heredity have influenced his art? Oh, yes, it could have. Kean has the story, and it's a beaut. Is Humane Genome guru Craig Venter an egomaniacal jerk? Um, maybe - but his story is probably more important to our times than that of, say, the past few presidential campaigns or even global warming, to cite some events that get much more daily attention. The book even ends with an intriguing and slightly scary prospective look at the future of gene research, which might even include - gulp - DNA computers. Old-hat stuff for science geeks, perhaps, but it's all pretty delectable for non-pros. "
89,0316202975,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2613351-linda-robinson,4,"DNA, when unwound, could reach to Pluto and back to Earth again. Kean tries to unwind most of this distance for us, and the journey is a little long. Kean writes like a fan of science, which is good, but releases a tendency to cover every sidebar story genetically connected to our code. We're reminded again of the classroom bully fights that are waged with any research, and the childish grip of some scientists on pet theories, and personal endeavor. I wonder where we would be if this sniping was replaced by cooperation in laboratories and classrooms? Kean gives credit thankfully to the women scientists who are always involved in breakthroughs, but are hidden behind the curtain of history and male science writers. Kudos, Kean! While anecdotes are interesting, too many is like a houseguest that overstays the welcome. The last chapters are the most interesting - if DNA/RNA, genetics and epigenetics are an enormously powerful computing system, when will technology make the leap from circuit boards to proteins? That journey is going on now."

This book, The Violinist's Thumb, took forever to come in at the library and I could hardly wait to read it. Well, it's difficult to even tell this is the same author. His other book reads well, is organized and very interesting. This book reads as if the author pulled information from lots of other sources and threw it together. The chapter headings in this book often have very little to do with the chapter material. The material is not the author's but instead he is continuously using other author's works. I felt like I was reading Reader's Digest versions of other books. If you are truly interested in genes, DNA, science then this is not a book you will enjoy.It is very sensationalists. There was one photo in there of an infant...born with a tail. That was just a totally bizarre photo included purely to appeal to ?something? I don't know what, but it was not to appeal to people interested in science. So disappointing. This is just one example of how this book completely lets the reader down. Instead of science and DNA as the focus the author's focus is on evolution. Nothing on the cover or description indicates that this book will be about evolution and DNA. It just was not the same quality of writing or information as his first book. Mr. Kean is obviously a skilled writer but I wish he had put the same effort into this book as the Disappearing Spoon. Wish it had been as good as his other book..."

Can you fathom that pheromones could make you fall in love?The Violinist's Thumb contains chapters on all of these topics - it combines shocking facts with biological premises with the history of DNA discovery. For those who love biology Sam Kean incorporates an inundation of knowledge in this book. His writing never gets too long-winded or lackadaisical; his humor is refreshing but he maintains his ethos with a scholarly tone.However, it took me over two weeks to finish this book just because I couldn't keep an interest in the subject matter. I sped through certain chapters like the one on atavisms, though the passages about well-known scientists and brazen theories bored me. On an entirely objective level perhaps this book deserves a higher rating. But, because I rate subjectively and feel cheated out of the time I could've used to read other books, The Violinist's Thumb gets a three.Recommended for anyone who enjoys biology or wants a relatively easy introduction to the subject. I used a chapter of this book for my AP Biology project and impressed my teacher, showing that The Violinist's Thumb is accessible to a wide variety of ages and knowledge levels.*review cross-posted on my blog, the quiet voice."

Complex information that typically the most bright struggle with, passed out in the easiest to understand genetics I've encountered.By recounting the history of the subject, through the personal and professional lives of the scientists in the field Kean informs, entertains and debates a topic that we should all be interested in.Kean manages to do all this while retaining a human touch to his work. Studying genetics, DNA, and such tends to freak people out. But, it is hard to imagine anyone reacting to this book with squeamishness.Highly recommended to anyone with any interest in people, biology, evolution, behaviour, well anyone with interests really."
93,0316202975,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1069092-brad,3,"Another fun Sam Kean book. Like his earlier book The Disappearing Spoon that tackled the periodic table, Kean explores DNA and genetics in his latest with a fun and lighthearted approach. The science here is targeted heavily toward the layperson and he does a fine job introducing genetics to the unfamiliar. And he had some really great stories: the guy who was victim to BOTH Hiroshima and Nagasaki; the vicious rivalries of the Human Genome Project. Also like the Disappearing Spoon his silliness has a tendency to get old and I found myself rolling my eyes on more than one occasion. But, to be fair, the book really wasn’t written for the likes of me; people who deal with this crap for a living. Instead, I think it will become one of my recommended reads to my freshman and sophomore undergrads when we talk us some Mendel. Fun and quick with some great stories. And you might learn a little science, too. . . "
94,0316202975,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3286826-aaronb,4,"I read this as a follow up to the Disappearing Spoon. It deals with DNA and genes, and I liked the way he delves into history and links it to scientific breakthroughs. The pieces on homosexuality and genetics were quite interesting, as was the (mostly unfulfilled) page-turning chase to complete the Human Genome Project by the two duelling factions of scientists. It brings to mind IBM's practice of throwing two project teams on a software problem ""if you want to get the work done really quickly"".The Hapsburg part about incest and the genetic problems it made visible by studying court artists' pictures of them was remarkable. Seam Kean has helped a wider audience to understand, esp. with regard to cloning, that your genes do not determine you, but are only one piece of a larger puzzle to understand our background and what makes us tick."
95,0316202975,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7318623-catbookmom,2,"Started this as a break from a series I'm deeply involved in reading, and found myself thinking about the video explaining dinosaur DNA that is part of the **Jurassic Park** movie. Some of this seems like very dumbed-down science and other parts are very detailed. I found myself skipping around, and certainly my eyes glazed over in some places, where the tech-speak was just too much to absorb. Some of the information about the huge advances in DNA research and analysis is just mind-boggling, things like the cost of a DNA analysis dropping from millions of dollars to almost pocket-change. "
96,0316202975,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3440334-fred-forbes,5,"Flip a coin one thousand times and you will get heads about half the time, tails the other half. That is probably the way most authors would express the thought. Sam Kean writes ""If you flip a dime a thousand times, you'll get approximately five hundred FDRs and 500 torches ..."" It is that type of clever, accessible writing that makes Kean such a joy to read. Make no mistake, the study of DNA and genetics can be challenging but when it is presented as he does, integrating it well into science, history and art it is much more a pleasure than a slog. Recommended to anyone with a bit of curious intellect - a pleasurable way to learn."
97,0316202975,http://goodreads.com/user/show/12541461-betseak,4,"'The Violinist's Thumb' is an excellent overview of the history of DNA and genetics research. As I read the book in its audio version, the scientific parts were somewhat difficult to follow. Nevertheless, they were pretty well illuminated and made accessible through numerous entertaining stories, some of which a bit creepy, like the one about the attempts to make 'humanzees' (a human-chimpanzee cross-breed), yet others…hmm… a bit gossipy, let's say, but in a good, enlightening way. Recommended."
98,0316202975,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3617921-david-schwan,5,"Fascinating book which covers the history of discoveries surrounding DNA and how DNA works. Many people have been involved in learning how DNA works. Very little coverage of Watson & Crick versus Linus Pauling which has been covered well elsewhere. Lot's of detail regarding the fruit fly experiments, and lot's of other more forgotten but important breakthroughs. "

In The Violinist’s Thumb: And Other Lost Tales of Love, War, and Genius, as Written by Our Genetic Code, he explores the wonders of the magical building block of life: DNA.There are genes to explain crazy cat ladies, why other people have no fingerprints, and why some people survive nuclear bombs. Genes illuminate everything from JFK’s bronze skin (it wasn’t a tan) to Einstein’s genius. They prove that Neanderthals and humans bred thousands of years more recently than any of us would feel comfortable thinking. They can even allow some people, because of the exceptional flexibility of their thumbs and fingers, to become truly singular violinists.Kean’s vibrant storytelling once again makes science entertaining, explaining human history and whimsy while showing how DNA will influence our species’ future."

102,0316202975,http://goodreads.com/user/show/974110-wendi-lau,5,"Interesting, FUNNY, so riveting, even all the end notes are worth reading. Mr. Kean has such surprising turns of phrase. He is a very good storyteller."
103,0316202975,http://goodreads.com/user/show/54953761-tamara-cassinat,4,"I really enjoy Sam Kean books. This one - since it dealt with biology and DNA, which I know little about, wasn’t as interesting to me as his other book “The Disappearing Spoon” which is about chemistry and the making of the periodic table. Still really cool. Really interesting. Would recommend it. "
104,0316202975,http://goodreads.com/user/show/41735508-noah-goats,4,"Kean writes with humor and humanity, and weaves the science of our genetic code around the interesting stories of real people. The result is a scientific page turner."
105,0316202975,http://goodreads.com/user/show/20022340-jennie-rosenblum,4,"Easy to read, even with all the scientific terminology. Enjoyable side stories of the people behind the science."
106,0316202975,http://goodreads.com/user/show/10132668-trasa,5,"A book that simultaneously manages to teach you about DNA and related subjects while giving really salacious stories about the people involved with the science during the last couple hundred years. Excellent science, research, writing and flow of the book."
107,0316202975,http://goodreads.com/user/show/37650802-kara,4,"Kean is a very talented science writer, and this book is extremely readable — I powered through it in a little more than three days. He takes complex topics, breaks them down, and explains them in a way that everyday readers can understand, no small feat when it comes to genetics. Kean also provides a good balance of anecdotes and transitions easily between stories and science (a switch that I have seen awkwardly and/or abruptly handled in a lot of nonfiction). Usually, genetics isn't a nonfiction subject that I'm compelled to read about, unlike (say) psychology, but I blew through book and found myself wanting to check out some of Kean's sources for more information. This is definitely a book for a generalist audience and not DNA buffs who want to get in the weeds, but seeing as how I am a generalist reader, that was just fine by me."
108,0316202975,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1842160-courtney-williams,5,"The book: The Violinist's ThumbThe author: Sam Kean, American science writer.The subject: An exploration of DNA: the stories of its discovery, how it affects our lives and how it will shape our future.Why I chose it: I've seen it recommended before on one ""good popular science"" list or another. Also, the cover and title.The rating: Five out of five starsWhat I thought of it: I really should have reviewed this book a few weeks ago when I read it... I know I loved it, but can't remember exactly what I wanted to say about it! Anyway, I'll review it as best I can regardless.I am a violinist (and violist) myself and happen to have type D brachydactyly, also known as club thumb. It's a harmless quirk of genetics – much like hitch-hiker's thumb, which I also have on both hands – that has nevertheless been associated with both royals and murderers. I joke with my boyfriend that I'd be the worst X-Man ever and my name would be Thumbs and my superpower would be THUMBS! (And then I wave my thumbs in his face. It's a really funny joke.)

My thumbs. Yes, I put them on Instagram.Sadly, unlike the violinist whose thumbs inspired the title of this book, Niccolò Paganini, my thumbs have not helped me become such an incredible musician that people believe I sold my soul to the Devil. In fact, my hands are quite small in general, which impedes my ability to play and, try as I might, I still can't stop locking my tiny right thumb when holding the bow, rather than bending it gracefully. Despite my genetics betraying me so utterly, in terms of playing the higher string instruments at least, I'm still very interested in the subject itself and the stories behind its development. This book was right up my street.As you can probably tell by the top star rating, I really enjoyed this book, both as a piece of science writing and a generally enjoyable read. I have very little in the way of biology knowledge – I stopped studying it after GCSE Double Science, though I've read a little about it – I found it to be just in-depth enough that I learned things, but didn't feel I was in over my head. As someone who is interested enough in the history of science to be considering doing a masters degree in it, I loved all the stories Kean relates and all the tangents he goes on. The one that most stuck with me was the man who was a survivor of both the Hiroshima and Nagasaki atomic bombings. The endnotes were brilliant too, even if I always hate having to flick back and forth (yes, I'm lazy). I enjoyed the casual language and irreverent humour as well; it could have easily come off as an insincere attempt to be approachable, but it really worked well and felt appropriate.I wouldn't recommend this book to you if you want a gentle and linear introduction to genetics as a science, with background included where necessary. However, if you like science history, learning about scientific personalities and tangents galore, give this a go. I enjoyed it a great deal.Just one more thing: I was incredibly (disproportionately) excited to figure out the ""easter egg"" that Kean hid in his book quite quickly. If you've still not got it, let me know and I can give you a hint ;-)"
109,0316202975,http://goodreads.com/user/show/11516573-delta,3,"This was an interesting read for me. I'm familiar with the science of genetics (although by no means an expert or even a novice), but I feel like this book is written for readers with more expertise or at least a higher level of knowledge of biology. Most of the book is written for the average lay-person, but there are sections that read like a college-level textbook. Overall, I found it interesting, but would probably not recommend unless you are really interested in the subject."
110,0316202975,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1444762-jill,4,"You may recognize the author’s name because of his previous bestselling book about the periodic table, The Disappearing Spoon. In this book, he tackles genetics, doing a fine job in explaining a very complex subject bit by bit, with clever analogies and a good deal of humor.There are loads of interesting tidbits:Of all the survivors of the World War II atomic bombing of Hiroshima and Nagasaki, some 150 were caught near both cities on both days! (Talk about a run of bad luck!)In the 1940’s and 1950’s, many female scientists were nuns, because, as Kean explains, Women at the time usually had to relinquish their careers upon marrying, while unmarried women...provoked suspicion or derision and sometimes earned such low pay they couldn’t make ends meet.”Humans share about 99% of our DNA with chimpanzees, making them our closest living relatives. But male chimps have something humans don’t: little bumps called spines on their penises. According to Kean, “this loss decreases male sensation during sex and thereby prolongs copulation, which scientists suspect helps humans pair-bond and stay monogamous.”Who knew?Kean explains why Arctic explorers can risk death by eating the liver of polar bears, or why some people who have one cat start getting more cats. He also talks about the phenomenon of epigenetics: how genes can, in fact, be influenced by the environment, with the effects actually passed on to progeny, much as theorized by the discredited Jean-Baptiste Lamarck. He even explains how why the beliefs of some religions couldn’t possibly be true: the genetic evidence tells a different story.Evaluation: This book is full of fascinating anecdotes, as well as a lot of science, which you can actually just scan if you prefer, without it detracting from the general thrust of the book. One big criticism: When I read a nonfiction book, I depend heavily on the index to help me refer back to ideas I just read 20 minutes ago but forgot already. The index in this book is extremely inadequate. Want to look up that bit about cats, for example? Well, you won’t find anything under “cat” or “feline”: unless you remember that the organism which is the culprit is called Toxoplasma gondii, you’re out of luck!Otherwise, it was a very entertaining read; once again Kean has succeeded in making science fun, which is absolutely a good thing!Rating: 3.5/5"
111,0316202975,http://goodreads.com/user/show/10762842-nicole-r,5,"I binged on new release contemporary fiction lately and, while it led me to many great books, it left me craving something nonfiction. Leah K's review earlier this month of The Violinist's Thumb made my decision of what to read to balance my “book diet” a no brainer.DNA. Amino acids. Genes. I likely lost most of you after “DNA”. DNA is the basis of all life. Just FOUR MEASLY “LETTERS” account for all of the diversity IN THE ENTIRE WORLD. Seriously. Mind blowing. But how much do we really know about the blueprint for life? I have a PhD in biology so I likely know more than the average Joe Schmo but I have just barely covered the tip of the iceberg.Sam Kean brilliantly escorts us through the just-deeper-than-the-basics of DNA. He explains: 	 • the physical structure of DNA and how this translates into amino acids and genes; 	 • how one species becomes two (or three or four or….) through different pressures on DNA; 	 • the evolution of human genes and how we have morphed from primate to Neanderthal to Homo sapiens but still have 99% the same DNA as the person sitting next to us, down the hall, or in Siberia; and 	 • what can (or can’t) genes teach us.Mr. Kean uses interesting stories, mini-bios of famous scientists, and humor to draw the reader in, make complicated concepts understandable, and – most importantly – entertain us. I learned a lot about the idiosyncrasies of names I hear all the time like Darwin, Watson and Crick, Mendel, and others. For example, I had NO IDEA that Darwin was actually an extremely sickly man following the Voyage of the Beagle and may have had a genetic predilection for his symptoms!Other fun facts: Tsutomu Yamaguchi is the only officially recognized person by the Japanese government to have survived both the Hiroshima AND Nagasaki bombings….and, then he lived to be 93 years old! There is a theory that the Toba supervolcanic eruption roughly 75,000 years ago is responsible for the near-extinction of humans, the genetic bottleneck that followed, and why humans are so genetically similar today. And, there is a similar supervolcano just building up steam under Wyoming!Seriously, this book was phenomenal. It was simple and clear enough that everyone could learn something but had enough interesting sidebars that even those well-versed in genetics would likely learn something new. Mr. Kean, you have a new fan and I plan on reading the Disappearing Spoon very soon!"
112,0316202975,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3837733-joan,5,"This was absolutely fascinating! The author writes in a very approachable manner, so that you can understand fairly complicated stuff without needing a scholarly biology background. He also does this with no hint of writing down to anyone. He gleefully shows how very human the scientists who study DNA and genetics are, as well as how human are their subjects, many of whom have genetic based diseases. He finishes with a cautionary note. He reminds his audience that DNA only works in probabilities, not in possibilities. In other words, the first time he had his genome sequenced, he told them he wanted no information on whether he is going to get Parkinson's or not. After reading and absorbing the information, he realized he was being silly. Potential is not necessarily doom. He got online and clicked to remove the note against getting that information. Hurray, he isn't going to get Parkinson's! Later, an update on what the information means came and he checked. Oops. He does have a potential to get Parkinson's. It didn't worry him the way it did when he started studying this field. He checked and found out he has a 20% increased chance of getting Parkinson''s. He can now realize that is fairly low percentage. BTW in case you are wondering, but don't want to read the book to find out, the violinist's thumb in the title, refers to Pagannini. He possibly had a genetic condition where his joints, including that thumb, were amazingly flexible.However, that same condition that made him possibly the greatest violinist of all time, also gave him great misery and likely an early death. He introduced the concept of epigenetics which was a new concept to me and apparently one of the really complicating factors in studying DNA. If you have any interest in genetics or the history of science, this is a must read! I'm really grateful to Rebecca for recommending this book and have checked out another book by this author. Expect a review on that book in several months!"
113,0316202975,http://goodreads.com/user/show/73003404-daniel,4,"I read this book due to my love of The Disappearing Spoon: And Other True Tales of Madness, Love, and the History of the World from the Periodic Table of the Elements, of which this is a spiritual sequel (review here - pretty much all of which applies), but while I enjoyed it, I did not find it to be as magical as the original, despite the nearly identical writing style and structure. The Violinist's Thumb was narrated differently for audiobook than The Disappearing Spoon, and I did consume portions of it via e-reader, but I don't think those discrepancies are responsible for my less-gushing enthusiasm.Instead, I think this is entirely down to subject matter. First, I think the physics and chemistry that formed the core of The Disappearing Spoon was likely more comfortable for the author, a former Physics student, than the biology at the heart of The Violinist's Thumb - a view reinforced by the former's earlier publication. Second, while there is a lot of ""unknown"" in physics and chemistry, our current understanding can explain a great deal of interesting real-world phenomena, whereas genetics seems to have a much more ambiguous causal relationship, which is harder to latch on to. Most importantly, though, I think I'm personally just less interested in genetics than I was in the material in The Disappearing Spoon. This book is still excellent though, like its predecessor, and anyone interested in heredity should definitely pick it up."
114,0316202975,http://goodreads.com/user/show/9958121-nicole,4,"I missed about a decade of, oh, everything going on in the world, due to childrearing and family responsibilities and constraints, so I pretty much had only the vaguest idea that the Human Genome Project was happening. This book is a great starting place for someone who knows only a little history of science and pretty much nothing about genetics.The cutesy language that other reviewers have found irksome delighted me. Sometimes his language, his references, are quite clever. I had to look up quite a few words, and I'm not talking about the scientific terms. Last night my son asked, ""How is it that every time you open that book you start laughing?"" The anecdotes and funny references (i.e. Roald Dahl and the Maginot Line) give the non-scientist hooks to hang a lot of technical information on, information that I would not have retained otherwise. Although I understand that he is writing for the average reader, not the scientist, I shared another reviewer's frustrations about citations. He often says something along the lines of ""one scientist commented that 'blah blah blah'"" but we never get to know who that person was. The endnotes were full of delicious little facts, and a few sources were cited or recommended there, but certainly a more detailed list of references would have been appropriate, and not distracting (if that was the concern) to the non-scientist, if tucked away at the end of the book. A cast of characters list would also have been helpful. That said, good starting place, clever and engaging. "
115,0316202975,http://goodreads.com/user/show/264570-bonnie,2,"I deserve a medal for not only making it through this complete obfuscation of a book, but presenting it at book club as well. Sentence after sentence and paragraph after paragraph refuting what the author's goal was for the book (if indeed I even understood that). Paragraphs with evidence based verbiage while including words like perhaps, somehow, but then refuted. I don't even have the energy to write a review on it.I'm glad I read it. I did learn something--just don't ask me what. I will add that the author lost his credence many times, but none more so than with this gem of inaccurate and untruthful reporting found in the notes in the back of the book: ""Mormons have traditionally believed--ever since Joseph Smith, just fourteen years old, copied down Jehovah's very words in 1820. . . ."" Joseph Smith was not 14 years old when he began translation of the Book of Mormon; using the word ""copying"" is an untruth, and Jehovah's very words are in the Book of Mormon, but only chapters 11-28 of 3rd Nephi (one of 15 or so books that make up the Book of Mormon). The rest is a history of two different people that left Jerusalem at two different times. I'd gotten to page 241 in this book before I found this cowardly note tucked into the back of the book. And if the author were off that much on this very small and insignificant portion of the book, one can only ask how much else irresponsible reporting of purported facts did he do?"
116,0316202975,http://goodreads.com/user/show/16013276-melissa-meinhard,3,"Overall this was a very interesting book but I had some major problems with the author's choice of language. He tried to make this more of an ""everyman's"" book instead of a straight science book and lost something in the compromise. In order to make the book seem more poetic he takes liberties with the science. The problems I had were when he was talking about the animals in the book; he often used the words ""monkeys"" and ""apes"" interchangeably as well as others like ""rats"" and ""mice"". I can see he was trying to not use the same words over and over again, and thought that some variety would make the book more enjoyable. For someone who is not a scientist, this would most likely go unnoticed. But if you are writing a book in order to educate people on something, they deserve to be given the correct information. I was so frustrated at some points that I had to put the book down and come back to it when i wasn't so annoyed.The thing that I enjoyed the most about this book was the acrostic that was challenged in the beginning of the book. If you can figure it out, the author wants you to email him your answer. A friend and I worked on it and got it all correct except for the final letter. That was the most fun I had had with a book in awhile. So it gets 3 stars--I liked it. Negative points for the abuse of science, but positive points for the fun and difficult acrostic."
117,0316202975,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2600140-rebecca,3,"The author writes about DNA from its discovery to how scientists learned to interpret it and interpret genes, infighting among scientists working to map the genome, ethical issues, etc. He illuminates the information with lots of fascinating anecdotes and stories of people and places affected by some aberration in DNA/genes in ways we wouldn't suspect.I'll admit that even in this work aimed at the general public, some of the science was above my head, and I yawned my way through the technical details. I got a lot more out of the examples and stories, such as why you should never eat polar bear liver. The author does a good job of choosing interesting happenings to explore in terms of genetics, and I did finally understand how genes could be mapped (well, sort of). The book was kind of a long slog, so I would only recommend it to those with a strong interest in science, and particularly DNA/genes.[As a side note, I forgot that I read this and picked it up again as an audiobook, and gave up pretty early on because I couldn't keep the thread of it in my head. Plus I thought the horrific details of Hiroshima and Nagasaki were unnecessary. They did cause gene damage and mutation, which is necessary to the subject of the book, but the gruesome descriptions of injuries felt gratuitous.]"
118,0316202975,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3486418-scott-collins,4,"Entertaining, balanced and nicely written romp through the history of genetics, filled with fascinating characters such as Ilya Ivanov, the Russian scientist who tried to breed humanzees by impregnating chimps with human sperm (and vice versa, which almost happened until African officials thought better of offering up their women for such an experiment). Some of the science can be a little befuddling without a firm rooting in biology (time to bone up those DNA bases from Life Science 101!), but every chapter contains connections and stories that the non-scientists among us (and maybe some scientists too?) have never heard before. Could Toulouse-Lautrec's heredity have influenced his art? Oh, yes, it could have. Kean has the story, and it's a beaut. Is Humane Genome guru Craig Venter an egomaniacal jerk? Um, maybe - but his story is probably more important to our times than that of, say, the past few presidential campaigns or even global warming, to cite some events that get much more daily attention. The book even ends with an intriguing and slightly scary prospective look at the future of gene research, which might even include - gulp - DNA computers. Old-hat stuff for science geeks, perhaps, but it's all pretty delectable for non-pros. "
119,0316202975,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2613351-linda-robinson,4,"DNA, when unwound, could reach to Pluto and back to Earth again. Kean tries to unwind most of this distance for us, and the journey is a little long. Kean writes like a fan of science, which is good, but releases a tendency to cover every sidebar story genetically connected to our code. We're reminded again of the classroom bully fights that are waged with any research, and the childish grip of some scientists on pet theories, and personal endeavor. I wonder where we would be if this sniping was replaced by cooperation in laboratories and classrooms? Kean gives credit thankfully to the women scientists who are always involved in breakthroughs, but are hidden behind the curtain of history and male science writers. Kudos, Kean! While anecdotes are interesting, too many is like a houseguest that overstays the welcome. The last chapters are the most interesting - if DNA/RNA, genetics and epigenetics are an enormously powerful computing system, when will technology make the leap from circuit boards to proteins? That journey is going on now."
120,0316202975,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5174097-a,1,"I read Sam Kean's other book, The Disappearing Spoon and loved it. This book, The Violinist's Thumb, took forever to come in at the library and I could hardly wait to read it. Well, it's difficult to even tell this is the same author. His other book reads well, is organized and very interesting. This book reads as if the author pulled information from lots of other sources and threw it together. The chapter headings in this book often have very little to do with the chapter material. The material is not the author's but instead he is continuously using other author's works. I felt like I was reading Reader's Digest versions of other books. If you are truly interested in genes, DNA, science then this is not a book you will enjoy.It is very sensationalists. There was one photo in there of an infant...born with a tail. That was just a totally bizarre photo included purely to appeal to ?something? I don't know what, but it was not to appeal to people interested in science. So disappointing. This is just one example of how this book completely lets the reader down. Instead of science and DNA as the focus the author's focus is on evolution. Nothing on the cover or description indicates that this book will be about evolution and DNA. It just was not the same quality of writing or information as his first book. Mr. Kean is obviously a skilled writer but I wish he had put the same effort into this book as the Disappearing Spoon. Wish it had been as good as his other book..."

Can you fathom that pheromones could make you fall in love?The Violinist's Thumb contains chapters on all of these topics - it combines shocking facts with biological premises with the history of DNA discovery. For those who love biology Sam Kean incorporates an inundation of knowledge in this book. His writing never gets too long-winded or lackadaisical; his humor is refreshing but he maintains his ethos with a scholarly tone.However, it took me over two weeks to finish this book just because I couldn't keep an interest in the subject matter. I sped through certain chapters like the one on atavisms, though the passages about well-known scientists and brazen theories bored me. On an entirely objective level perhaps this book deserves a higher rating. But, because I rate subjectively and feel cheated out of the time I could've used to read other books, The Violinist's Thumb gets a three.Recommended for anyone who enjoys biology or wants a relatively easy introduction to the subject. I used a chapter of this book for my AP Biology project and impressed my teacher, showing that The Violinist's Thumb is accessible to a wide variety of ages and knowledge levels.*review cross-posted on my blog, the quiet voice."

At first his slightly oddball humour and focus on the personal dramas of his subject's put me off. Then I realised that between the one-liners and gossip-columnesque recounting of scientist's lives was a mass of hard information. Complex information that typically the most bright struggle with, passed out in the easiest to understand genetics I've encountered.By recounting the history of the subject, through the personal and professional lives of the scientists in the field Kean informs, entertains and debates a topic that we should all be interested in.Kean manages to do all this while retaining a human touch to his work. Studying genetics, DNA, and such tends to freak people out. But, it is hard to imagine anyone reacting to this book with squeamishness.Highly recommended to anyone with any interest in people, biology, evolution, behaviour, well anyone with interests really."
123,0316202975,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1069092-brad,3,"Another fun Sam Kean book. Like his earlier book The Disappearing Spoon that tackled the periodic table, Kean explores DNA and genetics in his latest with a fun and lighthearted approach. The science here is targeted heavily toward the layperson and he does a fine job introducing genetics to the unfamiliar. And he had some really great stories: the guy who was victim to BOTH Hiroshima and Nagasaki; the vicious rivalries of the Human Genome Project. Also like the Disappearing Spoon his silliness has a tendency to get old and I found myself rolling my eyes on more than one occasion. But, to be fair, the book really wasn’t written for the likes of me; people who deal with this crap for a living. Instead, I think it will become one of my recommended reads to my freshman and sophomore undergrads when we talk us some Mendel. Fun and quick with some great stories. And you might learn a little science, too. . . "
124,0316202975,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3286826-aaronb,4,"I read this as a follow up to the Disappearing Spoon. It deals with DNA and genes, and I liked the way he delves into history and links it to scientific breakthroughs. The pieces on homosexuality and genetics were quite interesting, as was the (mostly unfulfilled) page-turning chase to complete the Human Genome Project by the two duelling factions of scientists. It brings to mind IBM's practice of throwing two project teams on a software problem ""if you want to get the work done really quickly"".The Hapsburg part about incest and the genetic problems it made visible by studying court artists' pictures of them was remarkable. Seam Kean has helped a wider audience to understand, esp. with regard to cloning, that your genes do not determine you, but are only one piece of a larger puzzle to understand our background and what makes us tick."
125,0316202975,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7318623-catbookmom,2,"Started this as a break from a series I'm deeply involved in reading, and found myself thinking about the video explaining dinosaur DNA that is part of the **Jurassic Park** movie. Some of this seems like very dumbed-down science and other parts are very detailed. I found myself skipping around, and certainly my eyes glazed over in some places, where the tech-speak was just too much to absorb. Some of the information about the huge advances in DNA research and analysis is just mind-boggling, things like the cost of a DNA analysis dropping from millions of dollars to almost pocket-change. "
126,0316202975,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3440334-fred-forbes,5,"Flip a coin one thousand times and you will get heads about half the time, tails the other half. That is probably the way most authors would express the thought. Sam Kean writes ""If you flip a dime a thousand times, you'll get approximately five hundred FDRs and 500 torches ..."" It is that type of clever, accessible writing that makes Kean such a joy to read. Make no mistake, the study of DNA and genetics can be challenging but when it is presented as he does, integrating it well into science, history and art it is much more a pleasure than a slog. Recommended to anyone with a bit of curious intellect - a pleasurable way to learn."

As I read the book in its audio version, the scientific parts were somewhat difficult to follow. Nevertheless, they were pretty well illuminated and made accessible through numerous entertaining stories, some of which a bit creepy, like the one about the attempts to make 'humanzees' (a human-chimpanzee cross-breed), yet others…hmm… a bit gossipy, let's say, but in a good, enlightening way. Recommended."
128,0316202975,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3617921-david-schwan,5,"Fascinating book which covers the history of discoveries surrounding DNA and how DNA works. Many people have been involved in learning how DNA works. Very little coverage of Watson & Crick versus Linus Pauling which has been covered well elsewhere. Lot's of detail regarding the fruit fly experiments, and lot's of other more forgotten but important breakthroughs. "

In The Violinist’s Thumb: And Other Lost Tales of Love, War, and Genius, as Written by Our Genetic Code, he explores the wonders of the magical building block of life: DNA.There are genes to explain crazy cat ladies, why other people have no fingerprints, and why some people survive nuclear bombs. Genes illuminate everything from JFK’s bronze skin (it wasn’t a tan) to Einstein’s genius. They prove that Neanderthals and humans bred thousands of years more recently than any of us would feel comfortable thinking. They can even allow some people, because of the exceptional flexibility of their thumbs and fingers, to become truly singular violinists.Kean’s vibrant storytelling once again makes science entertaining, explaining human history and whimsy while showing how DNA will influence our species’ future."

132,0316202975,http://goodreads.com/user/show/974110-wendi-lau,5,"Interesting, FUNNY, so riveting, even all the end notes are worth reading. Mr. Kean has such surprising turns of phrase. He is a very good storyteller."
133,0316202975,http://goodreads.com/user/show/54953761-tamara-cassinat,4,"I really enjoy Sam Kean books. This one - since it dealt with biology and DNA, which I know little about, wasn’t as interesting to me as his other book “The Disappearing Spoon” which is about chemistry and the making of the periodic table. Still really cool. Really interesting. Would recommend it. "
134,0316202975,http://goodreads.com/user/show/41735508-noah-goats,4,"Kean writes with humor and humanity, and weaves the science of our genetic code around the interesting stories of real people. The result is a scientific page turner."
135,0316202975,http://goodreads.com/user/show/20022340-jennie-rosenblum,4,"Easy to read, even with all the scientific terminology. Enjoyable side stories of the people behind the science."
136,0316202975,http://goodreads.com/user/show/10132668-trasa,5,"A book that simultaneously manages to teach you about DNA and related subjects while giving really salacious stories about the people involved with the science during the last couple hundred years. Excellent science, research, writing and flow of the book."
137,0316202975,http://goodreads.com/user/show/37650802-kara,4,"Kean is a very talented science writer, and this book is extremely readable — I powered through it in a little more than three days. He takes complex topics, breaks them down, and explains them in a way that everyday readers can understand, no small feat when it comes to genetics. Kean also provides a good balance of anecdotes and transitions easily between stories and science (a switch that I have seen awkwardly and/or abruptly handled in a lot of nonfiction). Usually, genetics isn't a nonfiction subject that I'm compelled to read about, unlike (say) psychology, but I blew through book and found myself wanting to check out some of Kean's sources for more information. This is definitely a book for a generalist audience and not DNA buffs who want to get in the weeds, but seeing as how I am a generalist reader, that was just fine by me."
138,0316202975,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1842160-courtney-williams,5,"The book: The Violinist's ThumbThe author: Sam Kean, American science writer.The subject: An exploration of DNA: the stories of its discovery, how it affects our lives and how it will shape our future.Why I chose it: I've seen it recommended before on one ""good popular science"" list or another. Also, the cover and title.The rating: Five out of five starsWhat I thought of it: I really should have reviewed this book a few weeks ago when I read it... I know I loved it, but can't remember exactly what I wanted to say about it! Anyway, I'll review it as best I can regardless.I am a violinist (and violist) myself and happen to have type D brachydactyly, also known as club thumb. It's a harmless quirk of genetics – much like hitch-hiker's thumb, which I also have on both hands – that has nevertheless been associated with both royals and murderers. I joke with my boyfriend that I'd be the worst X-Man ever and my name would be Thumbs and my superpower would be THUMBS! (And then I wave my thumbs in his face. It's a really funny joke.)

My thumbs. Yes, I put them on Instagram.Sadly, unlike the violinist whose thumbs inspired the title of this book, Niccolò Paganini, my thumbs have not helped me become such an incredible musician that people believe I sold my soul to the Devil. In fact, my hands are quite small in general, which impedes my ability to play and, try as I might, I still can't stop locking my tiny right thumb when holding the bow, rather than bending it gracefully. Despite my genetics betraying me so utterly, in terms of playing the higher string instruments at least, I'm still very interested in the subject itself and the stories behind its development. This book was right up my street.As you can probably tell by the top star rating, I really enjoyed this book, both as a piece of science writing and a generally enjoyable read. I have very little in the way of biology knowledge – I stopped studying it after GCSE Double Science, though I've read a little about it – I found it to be just in-depth enough that I learned things, but didn't feel I was in over my head. As someone who is interested enough in the history of science to be considering doing a masters degree in it, I loved all the stories Kean relates and all the tangents he goes on. The one that most stuck with me was the man who was a survivor of both the Hiroshima and Nagasaki atomic bombings. The endnotes were brilliant too, even if I always hate having to flick back and forth (yes, I'm lazy). I enjoyed the casual language and irreverent humour as well; it could have easily come off as an insincere attempt to be approachable, but it really worked well and felt appropriate.I wouldn't recommend this book to you if you want a gentle and linear introduction to genetics as a science, with background included where necessary. However, if you like science history, learning about scientific personalities and tangents galore, give this a go. I enjoyed it a great deal.Just one more thing: I was incredibly (disproportionately) excited to figure out the ""easter egg"" that Kean hid in his book quite quickly. If you've still not got it, let me know and I can give you a hint ;-)"
139,0316202975,http://goodreads.com/user/show/11516573-delta,3,"This was an interesting read for me. I'm familiar with the science of genetics (although by no means an expert or even a novice), but I feel like this book is written for readers with more expertise or at least a higher level of knowledge of biology. Most of the book is written for the average lay-person, but there are sections that read like a college-level textbook. Overall, I found it interesting, but would probably not recommend unless you are really interested in the subject."
140,0316202975,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1444762-jill,4,"You may recognize the author’s name because of his previous bestselling book about the periodic table, The Disappearing Spoon. In this book, he tackles genetics, doing a fine job in explaining a very complex subject bit by bit, with clever analogies and a good deal of humor.There are loads of interesting tidbits:Of all the survivors of the World War II atomic bombing of Hiroshima and Nagasaki, some 150 were caught near both cities on both days! (Talk about a run of bad luck!)In the 1940’s and 1950’s, many female scientists were nuns, because, as Kean explains, Women at the time usually had to relinquish their careers upon marrying, while unmarried women...provoked suspicion or derision and sometimes earned such low pay they couldn’t make ends meet.”Humans share about 99% of our DNA with chimpanzees, making them our closest living relatives. But male chimps have something humans don’t: little bumps called spines on their penises. According to Kean, “this loss decreases male sensation during sex and thereby prolongs copulation, which scientists suspect helps humans pair-bond and stay monogamous.”Who knew?Kean explains why Arctic explorers can risk death by eating the liver of polar bears, or why some people who have one cat start getting more cats. He also talks about the phenomenon of epigenetics: how genes can, in fact, be influenced by the environment, with the effects actually passed on to progeny, much as theorized by the discredited Jean-Baptiste Lamarck. He even explains how why the beliefs of some religions couldn’t possibly be true: the genetic evidence tells a different story.Evaluation: This book is full of fascinating anecdotes, as well as a lot of science, which you can actually just scan if you prefer, without it detracting from the general thrust of the book. One big criticism: When I read a nonfiction book, I depend heavily on the index to help me refer back to ideas I just read 20 minutes ago but forgot already. The index in this book is extremely inadequate. Want to look up that bit about cats, for example? Well, you won’t find anything under “cat” or “feline”: unless you remember that the organism which is the culprit is called Toxoplasma gondii, you’re out of luck!Otherwise, it was a very entertaining read; once again Kean has succeeded in making science fun, which is absolutely a good thing!Rating: 3.5/5"
141,0316202975,http://goodreads.com/user/show/10762842-nicole-r,5,"I binged on new release contemporary fiction lately and, while it led me to many great books, it left me craving something nonfiction. Leah K's review earlier this month of The Violinist's Thumb made my decision of what to read to balance my “book diet” a no brainer.DNA. Amino acids. Genes. I likely lost most of you after “DNA”. DNA is the basis of all life. Just FOUR MEASLY “LETTERS” account for all of the diversity IN THE ENTIRE WORLD. Seriously. Mind blowing. But how much do we really know about the blueprint for life? I have a PhD in biology so I likely know more than the average Joe Schmo but I have just barely covered the tip of the iceberg.Sam Kean brilliantly escorts us through the just-deeper-than-the-basics of DNA. He explains: 	 • the physical structure of DNA and how this translates into amino acids and genes; 	 • how one species becomes two (or three or four or….) through different pressures on DNA; 	 • the evolution of human genes and how we have morphed from primate to Neanderthal to Homo sapiens but still have 99% the same DNA as the person sitting next to us, down the hall, or in Siberia; and 	 • what can (or can’t) genes teach us.Mr. Kean uses interesting stories, mini-bios of famous scientists, and humor to draw the reader in, make complicated concepts understandable, and – most importantly – entertain us. I learned a lot about the idiosyncrasies of names I hear all the time like Darwin, Watson and Crick, Mendel, and others. For example, I had NO IDEA that Darwin was actually an extremely sickly man following the Voyage of the Beagle and may have had a genetic predilection for his symptoms!Other fun facts: Tsutomu Yamaguchi is the only officially recognized person by the Japanese government to have survived both the Hiroshima AND Nagasaki bombings….and, then he lived to be 93 years old! There is a theory that the Toba supervolcanic eruption roughly 75,000 years ago is responsible for the near-extinction of humans, the genetic bottleneck that followed, and why humans are so genetically similar today. And, there is a similar supervolcano just building up steam under Wyoming!Seriously, this book was phenomenal. It was simple and clear enough that everyone could learn something but had enough interesting sidebars that even those well-versed in genetics would likely learn something new. Mr. Kean, you have a new fan and I plan on reading the Disappearing Spoon very soon!"
142,0316202975,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3837733-joan,5,"This was absolutely fascinating! The author writes in a very approachable manner, so that you can understand fairly complicated stuff without needing a scholarly biology background. He also does this with no hint of writing down to anyone. He gleefully shows how very human the scientists who study DNA and genetics are, as well as how human are their subjects, many of whom have genetic based diseases. He finishes with a cautionary note. He reminds his audience that DNA only works in probabilities, not in possibilities. In other words, the first time he had his genome sequenced, he told them he wanted no information on whether he is going to get Parkinson's or not. After reading and absorbing the information, he realized he was being silly. Potential is not necessarily doom. He got online and clicked to remove the note against getting that information. Hurray, he isn't going to get Parkinson's! Later, an update on what the information means came and he checked. Oops. He does have a potential to get Parkinson's. It didn't worry him the way it did when he started studying this field. He checked and found out he has a 20% increased chance of getting Parkinson''s. He can now realize that is fairly low percentage. BTW in case you are wondering, but don't want to read the book to find out, the violinist's thumb in the title, refers to Pagannini. He possibly had a genetic condition where his joints, including that thumb, were amazingly flexible.However, that same condition that made him possibly the greatest violinist of all time, also gave him great misery and likely an early death. He introduced the concept of epigenetics which was a new concept to me and apparently one of the really complicating factors in studying DNA. If you have any interest in genetics or the history of science, this is a must read! I'm really grateful to Rebecca for recommending this book and have checked out another book by this author. Expect a review on that book in several months!"
143,0316202975,http://goodreads.com/user/show/73003404-daniel,4,"I read this book due to my love of The Disappearing Spoon: And Other True Tales of Madness, Love, and the History of the World from the Periodic Table of the Elements, of which this is a spiritual sequel (review here - pretty much all of which applies), but while I enjoyed it, I did not find it to be as magical as the original, despite the nearly identical writing style and structure. The Violinist's Thumb was narrated differently for audiobook than The Disappearing Spoon, and I did consume portions of it via e-reader, but I don't think those discrepancies are responsible for my less-gushing enthusiasm.Instead, I think this is entirely down to subject matter. First, I think the physics and chemistry that formed the core of The Disappearing Spoon was likely more comfortable for the author, a former Physics student, than the biology at the heart of The Violinist's Thumb - a view reinforced by the former's earlier publication. Second, while there is a lot of ""unknown"" in physics and chemistry, our current understanding can explain a great deal of interesting real-world phenomena, whereas genetics seems to have a much more ambiguous causal relationship, which is harder to latch on to. Most importantly, though, I think I'm personally just less interested in genetics than I was in the material in The Disappearing Spoon. This book is still excellent though, like its predecessor, and anyone interested in heredity should definitely pick it up."
144,0316202975,http://goodreads.com/user/show/9958121-nicole,4,"I missed about a decade of, oh, everything going on in the world, due to childrearing and family responsibilities and constraints, so I pretty much had only the vaguest idea that the Human Genome Project was happening. This book is a great starting place for someone who knows only a little history of science and pretty much nothing about genetics.The cutesy language that other reviewers have found irksome delighted me. Sometimes his language, his references, are quite clever. I had to look up quite a few words, and I'm not talking about the scientific terms. Last night my son asked, ""How is it that every time you open that book you start laughing?"" The anecdotes and funny references (i.e. Roald Dahl and the Maginot Line) give the non-scientist hooks to hang a lot of technical information on, information that I would not have retained otherwise. Although I understand that he is writing for the average reader, not the scientist, I shared another reviewer's frustrations about citations. He often says something along the lines of ""one scientist commented that 'blah blah blah'"" but we never get to know who that person was. The endnotes were full of delicious little facts, and a few sources were cited or recommended there, but certainly a more detailed list of references would have been appropriate, and not distracting (if that was the concern) to the non-scientist, if tucked away at the end of the book. A cast of characters list would also have been helpful. That said, good starting place, clever and engaging. "
145,0316202975,http://goodreads.com/user/show/264570-bonnie,2,"I deserve a medal for not only making it through this complete obfuscation of a book, but presenting it at book club as well. Sentence after sentence and paragraph after paragraph refuting what the author's goal was for the book (if indeed I even understood that). Paragraphs with evidence based verbiage while including words like perhaps, somehow, but then refuted. I don't even have the energy to write a review on it.I'm glad I read it. I did learn something--just don't ask me what. I will add that the author lost his credence many times, but none more so than with this gem of inaccurate and untruthful reporting found in the notes in the back of the book: ""Mormons have traditionally believed--ever since Joseph Smith, just fourteen years old, copied down Jehovah's very words in 1820. . . ."" Joseph Smith was not 14 years old when he began translation of the Book of Mormon; using the word ""copying"" is an untruth, and Jehovah's very words are in the Book of Mormon, but only chapters 11-28 of 3rd Nephi (one of 15 or so books that make up the Book of Mormon). The rest is a history of two different people that left Jerusalem at two different times. I'd gotten to page 241 in this book before I found this cowardly note tucked into the back of the book. And if the author were off that much on this very small and insignificant portion of the book, one can only ask how much else irresponsible reporting of purported facts did he do?"
146,0316202975,http://goodreads.com/user/show/16013276-melissa-meinhard,3,"Overall this was a very interesting book but I had some major problems with the author's choice of language. He tried to make this more of an ""everyman's"" book instead of a straight science book and lost something in the compromise. In order to make the book seem more poetic he takes liberties with the science. The problems I had were when he was talking about the animals in the book; he often used the words ""monkeys"" and ""apes"" interchangeably as well as others like ""rats"" and ""mice"". I can see he was trying to not use the same words over and over again, and thought that some variety would make the book more enjoyable. For someone who is not a scientist, this would most likely go unnoticed. But if you are writing a book in order to educate people on something, they deserve to be given the correct information. I was so frustrated at some points that I had to put the book down and come back to it when i wasn't so annoyed.The thing that I enjoyed the most about this book was the acrostic that was challenged in the beginning of the book. If you can figure it out, the author wants you to email him your answer. A friend and I worked on it and got it all correct except for the final letter. That was the most fun I had had with a book in awhile. So it gets 3 stars--I liked it. Negative points for the abuse of science, but positive points for the fun and difficult acrostic."
147,0316202975,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2600140-rebecca,3,"The author writes about DNA from its discovery to how scientists learned to interpret it and interpret genes, infighting among scientists working to map the genome, ethical issues, etc. He illuminates the information with lots of fascinating anecdotes and stories of people and places affected by some aberration in DNA/genes in ways we wouldn't suspect.I'll admit that even in this work aimed at the general public, some of the science was above my head, and I yawned my way through the technical details. I got a lot more out of the examples and stories, such as why you should never eat polar bear liver. The author does a good job of choosing interesting happenings to explore in terms of genetics, and I did finally understand how genes could be mapped (well, sort of). The book was kind of a long slog, so I would only recommend it to those with a strong interest in science, and particularly DNA/genes.[As a side note, I forgot that I read this and picked it up again as an audiobook, and gave up pretty early on because I couldn't keep the thread of it in my head. Plus I thought the horrific details of Hiroshima and Nagasaki were unnecessary. They did cause gene damage and mutation, which is necessary to the subject of the book, but the gruesome descriptions of injuries felt gratuitous.]"
148,0316202975,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3486418-scott-collins,4,"Entertaining, balanced and nicely written romp through the history of genetics, filled with fascinating characters such as Ilya Ivanov, the Russian scientist who tried to breed humanzees by impregnating chimps with human sperm (and vice versa, which almost happened until African officials thought better of offering up their women for such an experiment). Some of the science can be a little befuddling without a firm rooting in biology (time to bone up those DNA bases from Life Science 101!), but every chapter contains connections and stories that the non-scientists among us (and maybe some scientists too?) have never heard before. Could Toulouse-Lautrec's heredity have influenced his art? Oh, yes, it could have. Kean has the story, and it's a beaut. Is Humane Genome guru Craig Venter an egomaniacal jerk? Um, maybe - but his story is probably more important to our times than that of, say, the past few presidential campaigns or even global warming, to cite some events that get much more daily attention. The book even ends with an intriguing and slightly scary prospective look at the future of gene research, which might even include - gulp - DNA computers. Old-hat stuff for science geeks, perhaps, but it's all pretty delectable for non-pros. "
149,0316202975,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2613351-linda-robinson,4,"DNA, when unwound, could reach to Pluto and back to Earth again. Kean tries to unwind most of this distance for us, and the journey is a little long. Kean writes like a fan of science, which is good, but releases a tendency to cover every sidebar story genetically connected to our code. We're reminded again of the classroom bully fights that are waged with any research, and the childish grip of some scientists on pet theories, and personal endeavor. I wonder where we would be if this sniping was replaced by cooperation in laboratories and classrooms? Kean gives credit thankfully to the women scientists who are always involved in breakthroughs, but are hidden behind the curtain of history and male science writers. Kudos, Kean! While anecdotes are interesting, too many is like a houseguest that overstays the welcome. The last chapters are the most interesting - if DNA/RNA, genetics and epigenetics are an enormously powerful computing system, when will technology make the leap from circuit boards to proteins? That journey is going on now."
150,0316202975,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5174097-a,1,"I read Sam Kean's other book, The Disappearing Spoon and loved it. This book, The Violinist's Thumb, took forever to come in at the library and I could hardly wait to read it. Well, it's difficult to even tell this is the same author. His other book reads well, is organized and very interesting. This book reads as if the author pulled information from lots of other sources and threw it together. The chapter headings in this book often have very little to do with the chapter material. The material is not the author's but instead he is continuously using other author's works. I felt like I was reading Reader's Digest versions of other books. If you are truly interested in genes, DNA, science then this is not a book you will enjoy.It is very sensationalists. There was one photo in there of an infant...born with a tail. That was just a totally bizarre photo included purely to appeal to ?something? I don't know what, but it was not to appeal to people interested in science. So disappointing. This is just one example of how this book completely lets the reader down. Instead of science and DNA as the focus the author's focus is on evolution. Nothing on the cover or description indicates that this book will be about evolution and DNA. It just was not the same quality of writing or information as his first book. Mr. Kean is obviously a skilled writer but I wish he had put the same effort into this book as the Disappearing Spoon. Wish it had been as good as his other book..."

Can you fathom that pheromones could make you fall in love?The Violinist's Thumb contains chapters on all of these topics - it combines shocking facts with biological premises with the history of DNA discovery. For those who love biology Sam Kean incorporates an inundation of knowledge in this book. His writing never gets too long-winded or lackadaisical; his humor is refreshing but he maintains his ethos with a scholarly tone.However, it took me over two weeks to finish this book just because I couldn't keep an interest in the subject matter. I sped through certain chapters like the one on atavisms, though the passages about well-known scientists and brazen theories bored me. On an entirely objective level perhaps this book deserves a higher rating. But, because I rate subjectively and feel cheated out of the time I could've used to read other books, The Violinist's Thumb gets a three.Recommended for anyone who enjoys biology or wants a relatively easy introduction to the subject. I used a chapter of this book for my AP Biology project and impressed my teacher, showing that The Violinist's Thumb is accessible to a wide variety of ages and knowledge levels.*review cross-posted on my blog, the quiet voice."

At first his slightly oddball humour and focus on the personal dramas of his subject's put me off. Then I realised that between the one-liners and gossip-columnesque recounting of scientist's lives was a mass of hard information. Complex information that typically the most bright struggle with, passed out in the easiest to understand genetics I've encountered.By recounting the history of the subject, through the personal and professional lives of the scientists in the field Kean informs, entertains and debates a topic that we should all be interested in.Kean manages to do all this while retaining a human touch to his work. Studying genetics, DNA, and such tends to freak people out. But, it is hard to imagine anyone reacting to this book with squeamishness.Highly recommended to anyone with any interest in people, biology, evolution, behaviour, well anyone with interests really."
153,0316202975,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1069092-brad,3,"Another fun Sam Kean book. Like his earlier book The Disappearing Spoon that tackled the periodic table, Kean explores DNA and genetics in his latest with a fun and lighthearted approach. The science here is targeted heavily toward the layperson and he does a fine job introducing genetics to the unfamiliar. And he had some really great stories: the guy who was victim to BOTH Hiroshima and Nagasaki; the vicious rivalries of the Human Genome Project. Also like the Disappearing Spoon his silliness has a tendency to get old and I found myself rolling my eyes on more than one occasion. But, to be fair, the book really wasn’t written for the likes of me; people who deal with this crap for a living. Instead, I think it will become one of my recommended reads to my freshman and sophomore undergrads when we talk us some Mendel. Fun and quick with some great stories. And you might learn a little science, too. . . "
154,0316202975,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3286826-aaronb,4,"I read this as a follow up to the Disappearing Spoon. It deals with DNA and genes, and I liked the way he delves into history and links it to scientific breakthroughs. The pieces on homosexuality and genetics were quite interesting, as was the (mostly unfulfilled) page-turning chase to complete the Human Genome Project by the two duelling factions of scientists. It brings to mind IBM's practice of throwing two project teams on a software problem ""if you want to get the work done really quickly"".The Hapsburg part about incest and the genetic problems it made visible by studying court artists' pictures of them was remarkable. Seam Kean has helped a wider audience to understand, esp. with regard to cloning, that your genes do not determine you, but are only one piece of a larger puzzle to understand our background and what makes us tick."
155,0316202975,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7318623-catbookmom,2,"Started this as a break from a series I'm deeply involved in reading, and found myself thinking about the video explaining dinosaur DNA that is part of the **Jurassic Park** movie. Some of this seems like very dumbed-down science and other parts are very detailed. I found myself skipping around, and certainly my eyes glazed over in some places, where the tech-speak was just too much to absorb. Some of the information about the huge advances in DNA research and analysis is just mind-boggling, things like the cost of a DNA analysis dropping from millions of dollars to almost pocket-change. "
156,0316202975,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3440334-fred-forbes,5,"Flip a coin one thousand times and you will get heads about half the time, tails the other half. That is probably the way most authors would express the thought. Sam Kean writes ""If you flip a dime a thousand times, you'll get approximately five hundred FDRs and 500 torches ..."" It is that type of clever, accessible writing that makes Kean such a joy to read. Make no mistake, the study of DNA and genetics can be challenging but when it is presented as he does, integrating it well into science, history and art it is much more a pleasure than a slog. Recommended to anyone with a bit of curious intellect - a pleasurable way to learn."

As I read the book in its audio version, the scientific parts were somewhat difficult to follow. Nevertheless, they were pretty well illuminated and made accessible through numerous entertaining stories, some of which a bit creepy, like the one about the attempts to make 'humanzees' (a human-chimpanzee cross-breed), yet others…hmm… a bit gossipy, let's say, but in a good, enlightening way. Recommended."
158,0316202975,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3617921-david-schwan,5,"Fascinating book which covers the history of discoveries surrounding DNA and how DNA works. Many people have been involved in learning how DNA works. Very little coverage of Watson & Crick versus Linus Pauling which has been covered well elsewhere.

In The Violinist’s Thumb: And Other Lost Tales of Love, War, and Genius, as Written by Our Genetic Code, he explores the wonders of the magical building block of life: DNA.There are genes to explain crazy cat ladies, why other people have no fingerprints, and why some people survive nuclear bombs. Genes illuminate everything from JFK’s bronze skin (it wasn’t a tan) to Einstein’s genius. They prove that Neanderthals and humans bred thousands of years more recently than any of us would feel comfortable thinking. They can even allow some people, because of the exceptional flexibility of their thumbs and fingers, to become truly singular violinists.Kean’s vibrant storytelling once again makes science entertaining, explaining human history and whimsy while showing how DNA will influence our species’ future."

162,0316202975,http://goodreads.com/user/show/974110-wendi-lau,5,"Interesting, FUNNY, so riveting, even all the end notes are worth reading. Mr. Kean has such surprising turns of phrase. He is a very good storyteller."
163,0316202975,http://goodreads.com/user/show/54953761-tamara-cassinat,4,"I really enjoy Sam Kean books. This one - since it dealt with biology and DNA, which I know little about, wasn’t as interesting to me as his other book “The Disappearing Spoon” which is about chemistry and the making of the periodic table. Still really cool. Really interesting. Would recommend it. "
164,0316202975,http://goodreads.com/user/show/41735508-noah-goats,4,"Kean writes with humor and humanity, and weaves the science of our genetic code around the interesting stories of real people. The result is a scientific page turner."
165,0316202975,http://goodreads.com/user/show/20022340-jennie-rosenblum,4,"Easy to read, even with all the scientific terminology. Enjoyable side stories of the people behind the science."

Excellent science, research, writing and flow of the book."
167,0316202975,http://goodreads.com/user/show/37650802-kara,4,"Kean is a very talented science writer, and this book is extremely readable — I powered through it in a little more than three days. He takes complex topics, breaks them down, and explains them in a way that everyday readers can understand, no small feat when it comes to genetics. Kean also provides a good balance of anecdotes and transitions easily between stories and science (a switch that I have seen awkwardly and/or abruptly handled in a lot of nonfiction). Usually, genetics isn't a nonfiction subject that I'm compelled to read about, unlike (say) psychology, but I blew through book and found myself wanting to check out some of Kean's sources for more information. This is definitely a book for a generalist audience and not DNA buffs who want to get in the weeds, but seeing as how I am a generalist reader, that was just fine by me."
168,0316202975,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1842160-courtney-williams,5,"The book: The Violinist's ThumbThe author: Sam Kean, American science writer.The subject: An exploration of DNA: the stories of its discovery, how it affects our lives and how it will shape our future.Why I chose it: I've seen it recommended before on one ""good popular science"" list or another. Also, the cover and title.The rating: Five out of five starsWhat I thought of it: I really should have reviewed this book a few weeks ago when I read it... I know I loved it, but can't remember exactly what I wanted to say about it! Anyway, I'll review it as best I can regardless.I am a violinist (and violist) myself and happen to have type D brachydactyly, also known as club thumb. It's a harmless quirk of genetics – much like hitch-hiker's thumb, which I also have on both hands – that has nevertheless been associated with both royals and murderers. I joke with my boyfriend that I'd be the worst X-Man ever and my name would be Thumbs and my superpower would be THUMBS! (And then I wave my thumbs in his face. It's a really funny joke.)

My thumbs. Yes, I put them on Instagram.Sadly, unlike the violinist whose thumbs inspired the title of this book, Niccolò Paganini, my thumbs have not helped me become such an incredible musician that people believe I sold my soul to the Devil. In fact, my hands are quite small in general, which impedes my ability to play and, try as I might, I still can't stop locking my tiny right thumb when holding the bow, rather than bending it gracefully. Despite my genetics betraying me so utterly, in terms of playing the higher string instruments at least, I'm still very interested in the subject itself and the stories behind its development. This book was right up my street.As you can probably tell by the top star rating, I really enjoyed this book, both as a piece of science writing and a generally enjoyable read. I have very little in the way of biology knowledge – I stopped studying it after GCSE Double Science, though I've read a little about it – I found it to be just in-depth enough that I learned things, but didn't feel I was in over my head. As someone who is interested enough in the history of science to be considering doing a masters degree in it, I loved all the stories Kean relates and all the tangents he goes on. The one that most stuck with me was the man who was a survivor of both the Hiroshima and Nagasaki atomic bombings. The endnotes were brilliant too, even if I always hate having to flick back and forth (yes, I'm lazy). I enjoyed the casual language and irreverent humour as well; it could have easily come off as an insincere attempt to be approachable, but it really worked well and felt appropriate.I wouldn't recommend this book to you if you want a gentle and linear introduction to genetics as a science, with background included where necessary. However, if you like science history, learning about scientific personalities and tangents galore, give this a go. I enjoyed it a great deal.Just one more thing: I was incredibly (disproportionately) excited to figure out the ""easter egg"" that Kean hid in his book quite quickly. If you've still not got it, let me know and I can give you a hint ;-)"
169,0316202975,http://goodreads.com/user/show/11516573-delta,3,"This was an interesting read for me. I'm familiar with the science of genetics (although by no means an expert or even a novice), but I feel like this book is written for readers with more expertise or at least a higher level of knowledge of biology. Most of the book is written for the average lay-person, but there are sections that read like a college-level textbook. Overall, I found it interesting, but would probably not recommend unless you are really interested in the subject."
170,0316202975,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1444762-jill,4,"You may recognize the author’s name because of his previous bestselling book about the periodic table, The Disappearing Spoon. In this book, he tackles genetics, doing a fine job in explaining a very complex subject bit by bit, with clever analogies and a good deal of humor.There are loads of interesting tidbits:Of all the survivors of the World War II atomic bombing of Hiroshima and Nagasaki, some 150 were caught near both cities on both days! (Talk about a run of bad luck!)In the 1940’s and 1950’s, many female scientists were nuns, because, as Kean explains, Women at the time usually had to relinquish their careers upon marrying, while unmarried women...provoked suspicion or derision and sometimes earned such low pay they couldn’t make ends meet.”Humans share about 99% of our DNA with chimpanzees, making them our closest living relatives. But male chimps have something humans don’t: little bumps called spines on their penises. According to Kean, “this loss decreases male sensation during sex and thereby prolongs copulation, which scientists suspect helps humans pair-bond and stay monogamous.”Who knew?Kean explains why Arctic explorers can risk death by eating the liver of polar bears, or why some people who have one cat start getting more cats. He also talks about the phenomenon of epigenetics: how genes can, in fact, be influenced by the environment, with the effects actually passed on to progeny, much as theorized by the discredited Jean-Baptiste Lamarck. He even explains how why the beliefs of some religions couldn’t possibly be true: the genetic evidence tells a different story.Evaluation: This book is full of fascinating anecdotes, as well as a lot of science, which you can actually just scan if you prefer, without it detracting from the general thrust of the book. One big criticism: When I read a nonfiction book, I depend heavily on the index to help me refer back to ideas I just read 20 minutes ago but forgot already. The index in this book is extremely inadequate. Want to look up that bit about cats, for example? Well, you won’t find anything under “cat” or “feline”: unless you remember that the organism which is the culprit is called Toxoplasma gondii, you’re out of luck!Otherwise, it was a very entertaining read; once again Kean has succeeded in making science fun, which is absolutely a good thing!Rating: 3.5/5"
171,0316202975,http://goodreads.com/user/show/10762842-nicole-r,5,"I binged on new release contemporary fiction lately and, while it led me to many great books, it left me craving something nonfiction. Leah K's review earlier this month of The Violinist's Thumb made my decision of what to read to balance my “book diet” a no brainer.DNA. Amino acids. Genes. I likely lost most of you after “DNA”. DNA is the basis of all life. Just FOUR MEASLY “LETTERS” account for all of the diversity IN THE ENTIRE WORLD. Seriously. Mind blowing. But how much do we really know about the blueprint for life? I have a PhD in biology so I likely know more than the average Joe Schmo but I have just barely covered the tip of the iceberg.Sam Kean brilliantly escorts us through the just-deeper-than-the-basics of DNA. He explains: 	 • the physical structure of DNA and how this translates into amino acids and genes; 	 • how one species becomes two (or three or four or….) through different pressures on DNA; 	 • the evolution of human genes and how we have morphed from primate to Neanderthal to Homo sapiens but still have 99% the same DNA as the person sitting next to us, down the hall, or in Siberia; and 	 • what can (or can’t) genes teach us.Mr. Kean uses interesting stories, mini-bios of famous scientists, and humor to draw the reader in, make complicated concepts understandable, and – most importantly – entertain us. I learned a lot about the idiosyncrasies of names I hear all the time like Darwin, Watson and Crick, Mendel, and others. For example, I had NO IDEA that Darwin was actually an extremely sickly man following the Voyage of the Beagle and may have had a genetic predilection for his symptoms!Other fun facts: Tsutomu Yamaguchi is the only officially recognized person by the Japanese government to have survived both the Hiroshima AND Nagasaki bombings….and, then he lived to be 93 years old! There is a theory that the Toba supervolcanic eruption roughly 75,000 years ago is responsible for the near-extinction of humans, the genetic bottleneck that followed, and why humans are so genetically similar today. And, there is a similar supervolcano just building up steam under Wyoming!Seriously, this book was phenomenal. It was simple and clear enough that everyone could learn something but had enough interesting sidebars that even those well-versed in genetics would likely learn something new. Mr. Kean, you have a new fan and I plan on reading the Disappearing Spoon very soon!"
172,0316202975,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3837733-joan,5,"This was absolutely fascinating! The author writes in a very approachable manner, so that you can understand fairly complicated stuff without needing a scholarly biology background. He also does this with no hint of writing down to anyone. He gleefully shows how very human the scientists who study DNA and genetics are, as well as how human are their subjects, many of whom have genetic based diseases. He finishes with a cautionary note. He reminds his audience that DNA only works in probabilities, not in possibilities. In other words, the first time he had his genome sequenced, he told them he wanted no information on whether he is going to get Parkinson's or not. After reading and absorbing the information, he realized he was being silly. Potential is not necessarily doom. He got online and clicked to remove the note against getting that information. Hurray, he isn't going to get Parkinson's! Later, an update on what the information means came and he checked. Oops. He does have a potential to get Parkinson's. It didn't worry him the way it did when he started studying this field. He checked and found out he has a 20% increased chance of getting Parkinson''s. He can now realize that is fairly low percentage. BTW in case you are wondering, but don't want to read the book to find out, the violinist's thumb in the title, refers to Pagannini. He possibly had a genetic condition where his joints, including that thumb, were amazingly flexible.However, that same condition that made him possibly the greatest violinist of all time, also gave him great misery and likely an early death. He introduced the concept of epigenetics which was a new concept to me and apparently one of the really complicating factors in studying DNA. If you have any interest in genetics or the history of science, this is a must read! I'm really grateful to Rebecca for recommending this book and have checked out another book by this author. Expect a review on that book in several months!"
173,0316202975,http://goodreads.com/user/show/73003404-daniel,4,"I read this book due to my love of The Disappearing Spoon: And Other True Tales of Madness, Love, and the History of the World from the Periodic Table of the Elements, of which this is a spiritual sequel (review here - pretty much all of which applies), but while I enjoyed it, I did not find it to be as magical as the original, despite the nearly identical writing style and structure. The Violinist's Thumb was narrated differently for audiobook than The Disappearing Spoon, and I did consume portions of it via e-reader, but I don't think those discrepancies are responsible for my less-gushing enthusiasm.Instead, I think this is entirely down to subject matter. First, I think the physics and chemistry that formed the core of The Disappearing Spoon was likely more comfortable for the author, a former Physics student, than the biology at the heart of The Violinist's Thumb - a view reinforced by the former's earlier publication. Second, while there is a lot of ""unknown"" in physics and chemistry, our current understanding can explain a great deal of interesting real-world phenomena, whereas genetics seems to have a much more ambiguous causal relationship, which is harder to latch on to. Most importantly, though, I think I'm personally just less interested in genetics than I was in the material in The Disappearing Spoon. This book is still excellent though, like its predecessor, and anyone interested in heredity should definitely pick it up."
174,0316202975,http://goodreads.com/user/show/9958121-nicole,4,"I missed about a decade of, oh, everything going on in the world, due to childrearing and family responsibilities and constraints, so I pretty much had only the vaguest idea that the Human Genome Project was happening. This book is a great starting place for someone who knows only a little history of science and pretty much nothing about genetics.The cutesy language that other reviewers have found irksome delighted me. Sometimes his language, his references, are quite clever. I had to look up quite a few words, and I'm not talking about the scientific terms. Last night my son asked, ""How is it that every time you open that book you start laughing?"" The anecdotes and funny references (i.e. Roald Dahl and the Maginot Line) give the non-scientist hooks to hang a lot of technical information on, information that I would not have retained otherwise. Although I understand that he is writing for the average reader, not the scientist, I shared another reviewer's frustrations about citations. He often says something along the lines of ""one scientist commented that 'blah blah blah'"" but we never get to know who that person was. The endnotes were full of delicious little facts, and a few sources were cited or recommended there, but certainly a more detailed list of references would have been appropriate, and not distracting (if that was the concern) to the non-scientist, if tucked away at the end of the book. A cast of characters list would also have been helpful. That said, good starting place, clever and engaging. "
175,0316202975,http://goodreads.com/user/show/264570-bonnie,2,"I deserve a medal for not only making it through this complete obfuscation of a book, but presenting it at book club as well. Sentence after sentence and paragraph after paragraph refuting what the author's goal was for the book (if indeed I even understood that). Paragraphs with evidence based verbiage while including words like perhaps, somehow, but then refuted. I don't even have the energy to write a review on it.I'm glad I read it. I did learn something--just don't ask me what. I will add that the author lost his credence many times, but none more so than with this gem of inaccurate and untruthful reporting found in the notes in the back of the book: ""Mormons have traditionally believed--ever since Joseph Smith, just fourteen years old, copied down Jehovah's very words in 1820. . . ."" Joseph Smith was not 14 years old when he began translation of the Book of Mormon; using the word ""copying"" is an untruth, and Jehovah's very words are in the Book of Mormon, but only chapters 11-28 of 3rd Nephi (one of 15 or so books that make up the Book of Mormon). The rest is a history of two different people that left Jerusalem at two different times. I'd gotten to page 241 in this book before I found this cowardly note tucked into the back of the book. And if the author were off that much on this very small and insignificant portion of the book, one can only ask how much else irresponsible reporting of purported facts did he do?"
176,0316202975,http://goodreads.com/user/show/16013276-melissa-meinhard,3,"Overall this was a very interesting book but I had some major problems with the author's choice of language. He tried to make this more of an ""everyman's"" book instead of a straight science book and lost something in the compromise. In order to make the book seem more poetic he takes liberties with the science. The problems I had were when he was talking about the animals in the book; he often used the words ""monkeys"" and ""apes"" interchangeably as well as others like ""rats"" and ""mice"". I can see he was trying to not use the same words over and over again, and thought that some variety would make the book more enjoyable. For someone who is not a scientist, this would most likely go unnoticed. But if you are writing a book in order to educate people on something, they deserve to be given the correct information. I was so frustrated at some points that I had to put the book down and come back to it when i wasn't so annoyed.The thing that I enjoyed the most about this book was the acrostic that was challenged in the beginning of the book. If you can figure it out, the author wants you to email him your answer. A friend and I worked on it and got it all correct except for the final letter. That was the most fun I had had with a book in awhile. So it gets 3 stars--I liked it. Negative points for the abuse of science, but positive points for the fun and difficult acrostic."
177,0316202975,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2600140-rebecca,3,"The author writes about DNA from its discovery to how scientists learned to interpret it and interpret genes, infighting among scientists working to map the genome, ethical issues, etc. He illuminates the information with lots of fascinating anecdotes and stories of people and places affected by some aberration in DNA/genes in ways we wouldn't suspect.I'll admit that even in this work aimed at the general public, some of the science was above my head, and I yawned my way through the technical details. I got a lot more out of the examples and stories, such as why you should never eat polar bear liver. The author does a good job of choosing interesting happenings to explore in terms of genetics, and I did finally understand how genes could be mapped (well, sort of). The book was kind of a long slog, so I would only recommend it to those with a strong interest in science, and particularly DNA/genes.[As a side note, I forgot that I read this and picked it up again as an audiobook, and gave up pretty early on because I couldn't keep the thread of it in my head. Plus I thought the horrific details of Hiroshima and Nagasaki were unnecessary. They did cause gene damage and mutation, which is necessary to the subject of the book, but the gruesome descriptions of injuries felt gratuitous.]"
178,0316202975,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3486418-scott-collins,4,"Entertaining, balanced and nicely written romp through the history of genetics, filled with fascinating characters such as Ilya Ivanov, the Russian scientist who tried to breed humanzees by impregnating chimps with human sperm (and vice versa, which almost happened until African officials thought better of offering up their women for such an experiment). Some of the science can be a little befuddling without a firm rooting in biology (time to bone up those DNA bases from Life Science 101!), but every chapter contains connections and stories that the non-scientists among us (and maybe some scientists too?) have never heard before. Could Toulouse-Lautrec's heredity have influenced his art? Oh, yes, it could have. Kean has the story, and it's a beaut. Is Humane Genome guru Craig Venter an egomaniacal jerk? Um, maybe - but his story is probably more important to our times than that of, say, the past few presidential campaigns or even global warming, to cite some events that get much more daily attention. The book even ends with an intriguing and slightly scary prospective look at the future of gene research, which might even include - gulp - DNA computers. Old-hat stuff for science geeks, perhaps, but it's all pretty delectable for non-pros. "
179,0316202975,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2613351-linda-robinson,4,"DNA, when unwound, could reach to Pluto and back to Earth again. Kean tries to unwind most of this distance for us, and the journey is a little long. Kean writes like a fan of science, which is good, but releases a tendency to cover every sidebar story genetically connected to our code. We're reminded again of the classroom bully fights that are waged with any research, and the childish grip of some scientists on pet theories, and personal endeavor. I wonder where we would be if this sniping was replaced by cooperation in laboratories and classrooms? Kean gives credit thankfully to the women scientists who are always involved in breakthroughs, but are hidden behind the curtain of history and male science writers. Kudos, Kean! While anecdotes are interesting, too many is like a houseguest that overstays the welcome. The last chapters are the most interesting - if DNA/RNA, genetics and epigenetics are an enormously powerful computing system, when will technology make the leap from circuit boards to proteins? That journey is going on now."
180,0316202975,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5174097-a,1,"I read Sam Kean's other book, The Disappearing Spoon and loved it. This book, The Violinist's Thumb, took forever to come in at the library and I could hardly wait to read it. Well, it's difficult to even tell this is the same author. His other book reads well, is organized and very interesting. This book reads as if the author pulled information from lots of other sources and threw it together. The chapter headings in this book often have very little to do with the chapter material. The material is not the author's but instead he is continuously using other author's works. I felt like I was reading Reader's Digest versions of other books. If you are truly interested in genes, DNA, science then this is not a book you will enjoy.It is very sensationalists. There was one photo in there of an infant...born with a tail. That was just a totally bizarre photo included purely to appeal to ?something? I don't know what, but it was not to appeal to people interested in science. So disappointing. This is just one example of how this book completely lets the reader down. Instead of science and DNA as the focus the author's focus is on evolution. Nothing on the cover or description indicates that this book will be about evolution and DNA. It just was not the same quality of writing or information as his first book. Mr. Kean is obviously a skilled writer but I wish he had put the same effort into this book as the Disappearing Spoon. Wish it had been as good as his other book..."

Can you fathom that pheromones could make you fall in love?The Violinist's Thumb contains chapters on all of these topics - it combines shocking facts with biological premises with the history of DNA discovery. For those who love biology Sam Kean incorporates an inundation of knowledge in this book. His writing never gets too long-winded or lackadaisical; his humor is refreshing but he maintains his ethos with a scholarly tone.However, it took me over two weeks to finish this book just because I couldn't keep an interest in the subject matter. I sped through certain chapters like the one on atavisms, though the passages about well-known scientists and brazen theories bored me. On an entirely objective level perhaps this book deserves a higher rating. But, because I rate subjectively and feel cheated out of the time I could've used to read other books, The Violinist's Thumb gets a three.Recommended for anyone who enjoys biology or wants a relatively easy introduction to the subject. I used a chapter of this book for my AP Biology project and impressed my teacher, showing that The Violinist's Thumb is accessible to a wide variety of ages and knowledge levels.*review cross-posted on my blog, the quiet voice."

At first his slightly oddball humour and focus on the personal dramas of his subject's put me off. Then I realised that between the one-liners and gossip-columnesque recounting of scientist's lives was a mass of hard information. Complex information that typically the most bright struggle with, passed out in the easiest to understand genetics I've encountered.By recounting the history of the subject, through the personal and professional lives of the scientists in the field Kean informs, entertains and debates a topic that we should all be interested in.Kean manages to do all this while retaining a human touch to his work. Studying genetics, DNA, and such tends to freak people out. But, it is hard to imagine anyone reacting to this book with squeamishness.Highly recommended to anyone with any interest in people, biology, evolution, behaviour, well anyone with interests really."
183,0316202975,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1069092-brad,3,"Another fun Sam Kean book. Like his earlier book The Disappearing Spoon that tackled the periodic table, Kean explores DNA and genetics in his latest with a fun and lighthearted approach. The science here is targeted heavily toward the layperson and he does a fine job introducing genetics to the unfamiliar. And he had some really great stories: the guy who was victim to BOTH Hiroshima and Nagasaki; the vicious rivalries of the Human Genome Project. Also like the Disappearing Spoon his silliness has a tendency to get old and I found myself rolling my eyes on more than one occasion. But, to be fair, the book really wasn’t written for the likes of me; people who deal with this crap for a living. Instead, I think it will become one of my recommended reads to my freshman and sophomore undergrads when we talk us some Mendel. Fun and quick with some great stories. And you might learn a little science, too. . . "
184,0316202975,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3286826-aaronb,4,"I read this as a follow up to the Disappearing Spoon. It deals with DNA and genes, and I liked the way he delves into history and links it to scientific breakthroughs. The pieces on homosexuality and genetics were quite interesting, as was the (mostly unfulfilled) page-turning chase to complete the Human Genome Project by the two duelling factions of scientists. It brings to mind IBM's practice of throwing two project teams on a software problem ""if you want to get the work done really quickly"".The Hapsburg part about incest and the genetic problems it made visible by studying court artists' pictures of them was remarkable. Seam Kean has helped a wider audience to understand, esp. with regard to cloning, that your genes do not determine you, but are only one piece of a larger puzzle to understand our background and what makes us tick."
185,0316202975,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7318623-catbookmom,2,"Started this as a break from a series I'm deeply involved in reading, and found myself thinking about the video explaining dinosaur DNA that is part of the **Jurassic Park** movie. Some of this seems like very dumbed-down science and other parts are very detailed. I found myself skipping around, and certainly my eyes glazed over in some places, where the tech-speak was just too much to absorb. Some of the information about the huge advances in DNA research and analysis is just mind-boggling, things like the cost of a DNA analysis dropping from millions of dollars to almost pocket-change. "
186,0316202975,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3440334-fred-forbes,5,"Flip a coin one thousand times and you will get heads about half the time, tails the other half. That is probably the way most authors would express the thought. Sam Kean writes ""If you flip a dime a thousand times, you'll get approximately five hundred FDRs and 500 torches ..."" It is that type of clever, accessible writing that makes Kean such a joy to read. Make no mistake, the study of DNA and genetics can be challenging but when it is presented as he does, integrating it well into science, history and art it is much more a pleasure than a slog. Recommended to anyone with a bit of curious intellect - a pleasurable way to learn."

As I read the book in its audio version, the scientific parts were somewhat difficult to follow. Nevertheless, they were pretty well illuminated and made accessible through numerous entertaining stories, some of which a bit creepy, like the one about the attempts to make 'humanzees' (a human-chimpanzee cross-breed), yet others…hmm… a bit gossipy, let's say, but in a good, enlightening way. Recommended."
188,0316202975,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3617921-david-schwan,5,"Fascinating book which covers the history of discoveries surrounding DNA and how DNA works. Many people have been involved in learning how DNA works. Very little coverage of Watson & Crick versus Linus Pauling which has been covered well elsewhere. Lot's of detail regarding the fruit fly experiments, and lot's of other more forgotten but important breakthroughs. "

In The Violinist’s Thumb: And Other Lost Tales of Love, War, and Genius, as Written by Our Genetic Code, he explores the wonders of the magical building block of life: DNA.There are genes to explain crazy cat ladies, why other people have no fingerprints, and why some people survive nuclear bombs. Genes illuminate everything from JFK’s bronze skin (it wasn’t a tan) to Einstein’s genius. They prove that Neanderthals and humans bred thousands of years more recently than any of us would feel comfortable thinking. They can even allow some people, because of the exceptional flexibility of their thumbs and fingers, to become truly singular violinists.Kean’s vibrant storytelling once again makes science entertaining, explaining human history and whimsy while showing how DNA will influence our species’ future."

192,0316202975,http://goodreads.com/user/show/974110-wendi-lau,5,"Interesting, FUNNY, so riveting, even all the end notes are worth reading. Mr. Kean has such surprising turns of phrase. He is a very good storyteller."
193,0316202975,http://goodreads.com/user/show/54953761-tamara-cassinat,4,"I really enjoy Sam Kean books. This one - since it dealt with biology and DNA, which I know little about, wasn’t as interesting to me as his other book “The Disappearing Spoon” which is about chemistry and the making of the periodic table. Still really cool. Really interesting. Would recommend it. "
194,0316202975,http://goodreads.com/user/show/41735508-noah-goats,4,"Kean writes with humor and humanity, and weaves the science of our genetic code around the interesting stories of real people. The result is a scientific page turner."
195,0316202975,http://goodreads.com/user/show/20022340-jennie-rosenblum,4,"Easy to read, even with all the scientific terminology. Enjoyable side stories of the people behind the science."
196,0316202975,http://goodreads.com/user/show/10132668-trasa,5,"A book that simultaneously manages to teach you about DNA and related subjects while giving really salacious stories about the people involved with the science during the last couple hundred years. Excellent science, research, writing and flow of the book."
197,0316202975,http://goodreads.com/user/show/37650802-kara,4,"Kean is a very talented science writer, and this book is extremely readable — I powered through it in a little more than three days. He takes complex topics, breaks them down, and explains them in a way that everyday readers can understand, no small feat when it comes to genetics. Kean also provides a good balance of anecdotes and transitions easily between stories and science (a switch that I have seen awkwardly and/or abruptly handled in a lot of nonfiction). Usually, genetics isn't a nonfiction subject that I'm compelled to read about, unlike (say) psychology, but I blew through book and found myself wanting to check out some of Kean's sources for more information. This is definitely a book for a generalist audience and not DNA buffs who want to get in the weeds, but seeing as how I am a generalist reader, that was just fine by me."
198,0316202975,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1842160-courtney-williams,5,"The book: The Violinist's ThumbThe author: Sam Kean, American science writer.The subject: An exploration of DNA: the stories of its discovery, how it affects our lives and how it will shape our future.Why I chose it: I've seen it recommended before on one ""good popular science"" list or another. Also, the cover and title.The rating: Five out of five starsWhat I thought of it: I really should have reviewed this book a few weeks ago when I read it... I know I loved it, but can't remember exactly what I wanted to say about it! Anyway, I'll review it as best I can regardless.I am a violinist (and violist) myself and happen to have type D brachydactyly, also known as club thumb. It's a harmless quirk of genetics – much like hitch-hiker's thumb, which I also have on both hands – that has nevertheless been associated with both royals and murderers. I joke with my boyfriend that I'd be the worst X-Man ever and my name would be Thumbs and my superpower would be THUMBS! (And then I wave my thumbs in his face. It's a really funny joke.)

My thumbs. Yes, I put them on Instagram.Sadly, unlike the violinist whose thumbs inspired the title of this book, Niccolò Paganini, my thumbs have not helped me become such an incredible musician that people believe I sold my soul to the Devil. In fact, my hands are quite small in general, which impedes my ability to play and, try as I might, I still can't stop locking my tiny right thumb when holding the bow, rather than bending it gracefully. Despite my genetics betraying me so utterly, in terms of playing the higher string instruments at least, I'm still very interested in the subject itself and the stories behind its development. This book was right up my street.As you can probably tell by the top star rating, I really enjoyed this book, both as a piece of science writing and a generally enjoyable read. I have very little in the way of biology knowledge – I stopped studying it after GCSE Double Science, though I've read a little about it – I found it to be just in-depth enough that I learned things, but didn't feel I was in over my head. As someone who is interested enough in the history of science to be considering doing a masters degree in it, I loved all the stories Kean relates and all the tangents he goes on. The one that most stuck with me was the man who was a survivor of both the Hiroshima and Nagasaki atomic bombings. The endnotes were brilliant too, even if I always hate having to flick back and forth (yes, I'm lazy). I enjoyed the casual language and irreverent humour as well; it could have easily come off as an insincere attempt to be approachable, but it really worked well and felt appropriate.I wouldn't recommend this book to you if you want a gentle and linear introduction to genetics as a science, with background included where necessary. However, if you like science history, learning about scientific personalities and tangents galore, give this a go. I enjoyed it a great deal.Just one more thing: I was incredibly (disproportionately) excited to figure out the ""easter egg"" that Kean hid in his book quite quickly. If you've still not got it, let me know and I can give you a hint ;-)"
199,0316202975,http://goodreads.com/user/show/11516573-delta,3,"This was an interesting read for me. I'm familiar with the science of genetics (although by no means an expert or even a novice), but I feel like this book is written for readers with more expertise or at least a higher level of knowledge of biology. Most of the book is written for the average lay-person, but there are sections that read like a college-level textbook. Overall, I found it interesting, but would probably not recommend unless you are really interested in the subject."
200,0316202975,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1444762-jill,4,"You may recognize the author’s name because of his previous bestselling book about the periodic table, The Disappearing Spoon. In this book, he tackles genetics, doing a fine job in explaining a very complex subject bit by bit, with clever analogies and a good deal of humor.There are loads of interesting tidbits:Of all the survivors of the World War II atomic bombing of Hiroshima and Nagasaki, some 150 were caught near both cities on both days! (Talk about a run of bad luck!)In the 1940’s and 1950’s, many female scientists were nuns, because, as Kean explains, Women at the time usually had to relinquish their careers upon marrying, while unmarried women...provoked suspicion or derision and sometimes earned such low pay they couldn’t make ends meet.”Humans share about 99% of our DNA with chimpanzees, making them our closest living relatives. But male chimps have something humans don’t: little bumps called spines on their penises. According to Kean, “this loss decreases male sensation during sex and thereby prolongs copulation, which scientists suspect helps humans pair-bond and stay monogamous.”Who knew?Kean explains why Arctic explorers can risk death by eating the liver of polar bears, or why some people who have one cat start getting more cats. He also talks about the phenomenon of epigenetics: how genes can, in fact, be influenced by the environment, with the effects actually passed on to progeny, much as theorized by the discredited Jean-Baptiste Lamarck. He even explains how why the beliefs of some religions couldn’t possibly be true: the genetic evidence tells a different story.Evaluation: This book is full of fascinating anecdotes, as well as a lot of science, which you can actually just scan if you prefer, without it detracting from the general thrust of the book. One big criticism: When I read a nonfiction book, I depend heavily on the index to help me refer back to ideas I just read 20 minutes ago but forgot already. The index in this book is extremely inadequate. Want to look up that bit about cats, for example? Well, you won’t find anything under “cat” or “feline”: unless you remember that the organism which is the culprit is called Toxoplasma gondii, you’re out of luck!Otherwise, it was a very entertaining read; once again Kean has succeeded in making science fun, which is absolutely a good thing!Rating: 3.5/5"
201,0316202975,http://goodreads.com/user/show/10762842-nicole-r,5,"I binged on new release contemporary fiction lately and, while it led me to many great books, it left me craving something nonfiction. Leah K's review earlier this month of The Violinist's Thumb made my decision of what to read to balance my “book diet” a no brainer.DNA. Amino acids. Genes. I likely lost most of you after “DNA”. DNA is the basis of all life. Just FOUR MEASLY “LETTERS” account for all of the diversity IN THE ENTIRE WORLD. Seriously. Mind blowing. But how much do we really know about the blueprint for life? I have a PhD in biology so I likely know more than the average Joe Schmo but I have just barely covered the tip of the iceberg.Sam Kean brilliantly escorts us through the just-deeper-than-the-basics of DNA. He explains: 	 • the physical structure of DNA and how this translates into amino acids and genes; 	 • how one species becomes two (or three or four or….) through different pressures on DNA; 	 • the evolution of human genes and how we have morphed from primate to Neanderthal to Homo sapiens but still have 99% the same DNA as the person sitting next to us, down the hall, or in Siberia; and 	 • what can (or can’t) genes teach us.Mr. Kean uses interesting stories, mini-bios of famous scientists, and humor to draw the reader in, make complicated concepts understandable, and – most importantly – entertain us. I learned a lot about the idiosyncrasies of names I hear all the time like Darwin, Watson and Crick, Mendel, and others. For example, I had NO IDEA that Darwin was actually an extremely sickly man following the Voyage of the Beagle and may have had a genetic predilection for his symptoms!Other fun facts: Tsutomu Yamaguchi is the only officially recognized person by the Japanese government to have survived both the Hiroshima AND Nagasaki bombings….and, then he lived to be 93 years old! There is a theory that the Toba supervolcanic eruption roughly 75,000 years ago is responsible for the near-extinction of humans, the genetic bottleneck that followed, and why humans are so genetically similar today. And, there is a similar supervolcano just building up steam under Wyoming!Seriously, this book was phenomenal. It was simple and clear enough that everyone could learn something but had enough interesting sidebars that even those well-versed in genetics would likely learn something new. Mr. Kean, you have a new fan and I plan on reading the Disappearing Spoon very soon!"
202,0316202975,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3837733-joan,5,"This was absolutely fascinating! The author writes in a very approachable manner, so that you can understand fairly complicated stuff without needing a scholarly biology background. He also does this with no hint of writing down to anyone. He gleefully shows how very human the scientists who study DNA and genetics are, as well as how human are their subjects, many of whom have genetic based diseases. He finishes with a cautionary note. He reminds his audience that DNA only works in probabilities, not in possibilities. In other words, the first time he had his genome sequenced, he told them he wanted no information on whether he is going to get Parkinson's or not. After reading and absorbing the information, he realized he was being silly. Potential is not necessarily doom. He got online and clicked to remove the note against getting that information. Hurray, he isn't going to get Parkinson's! Later, an update on what the information means came and he checked. Oops. He does have a potential to get Parkinson's. It didn't worry him the way it did when he started studying this field. He checked and found out he has a 20% increased chance of getting Parkinson''s. He can now realize that is fairly low percentage. BTW in case you are wondering, but don't want to read the book to find out, the violinist's thumb in the title, refers to Pagannini. He possibly had a genetic condition where his joints, including that thumb, were amazingly flexible.However, that same condition that made him possibly the greatest violinist of all time, also gave him great misery and likely an early death. He introduced the concept of epigenetics which was a new concept to me and apparently one of the really complicating factors in studying DNA. If you have any interest in genetics or the history of science, this is a must read! I'm really grateful to Rebecca for recommending this book and have checked out another book by this author. Expect a review on that book in several months!"
203,0316202975,http://goodreads.com/user/show/73003404-daniel,4,"I read this book due to my love of The Disappearing Spoon: And Other True Tales of Madness, Love, and the History of the World from the Periodic Table of the Elements, of which this is a spiritual sequel (review here - pretty much all of which applies), but while I enjoyed it, I did not find it to be as magical as the original, despite the nearly identical writing style and structure. The Violinist's Thumb was narrated differently for audiobook than The Disappearing Spoon, and I did consume portions of it via e-reader, but I don't think those discrepancies are responsible for my less-gushing enthusiasm.Instead, I think this is entirely down to subject matter. First, I think the physics and chemistry that formed the core of The Disappearing Spoon was likely more comfortable for the author, a former Physics student, than the biology at the heart of The Violinist's Thumb - a view reinforced by the former's earlier publication. Second, while there is a lot of ""unknown"" in physics and chemistry, our current understanding can explain a great deal of interesting real-world phenomena, whereas genetics seems to have a much more ambiguous causal relationship, which is harder to latch on to. Most importantly, though, I think I'm personally just less interested in genetics than I was in the material in The Disappearing Spoon. This book is still excellent though, like its predecessor, and anyone interested in heredity should definitely pick it up."
204,0316202975,http://goodreads.com/user/show/9958121-nicole,4,"I missed about a decade of, oh, everything going on in the world, due to childrearing and family responsibilities and constraints, so I pretty much had only the vaguest idea that the Human Genome Project was happening. This book is a great starting place for someone who knows only a little history of science and pretty much nothing about genetics.The cutesy language that other reviewers have found irksome delighted me. Sometimes his language, his references, are quite clever. I had to look up quite a few words, and I'm not talking about the scientific terms. Last night my son asked, ""How is it that every time you open that book you start laughing?"" The anecdotes and funny references (i.e. Roald Dahl and the Maginot Line) give the non-scientist hooks to hang a lot of technical information on, information that I would not have retained otherwise. Although I understand that he is writing for the average reader, not the scientist, I shared another reviewer's frustrations about citations. He often says something along the lines of ""one scientist commented that 'blah blah blah'"" but we never get to know who that person was. The endnotes were full of delicious little facts, and a few sources were cited or recommended there, but certainly a more detailed list of references would have been appropriate, and not distracting (if that was the concern) to the non-scientist, if tucked away at the end of the book. A cast of characters list would also have been helpful. That said, good starting place, clever and engaging. "
205,0316202975,http://goodreads.com/user/show/264570-bonnie,2,"I deserve a medal for not only making it through this complete obfuscation of a book, but presenting it at book club as well. Sentence after sentence and paragraph after paragraph refuting what the author's goal was for the book (if indeed I even understood that). Paragraphs with evidence based verbiage while including words like perhaps, somehow, but then refuted. I don't even have the energy to write a review on it.I'm glad I read it. I did learn something--just don't ask me what. I will add that the author lost his credence many times, but none more so than with this gem of inaccurate and untruthful reporting found in the notes in the back of the book: ""Mormons have traditionally believed--ever since Joseph Smith, just fourteen years old, copied down Jehovah's very words in 1820. . . ."" Joseph Smith was not 14 years old when he began translation of the Book of Mormon; using the word ""copying"" is an untruth, and Jehovah's very words are in the Book of Mormon, but only chapters 11-28 of 3rd Nephi (one of 15 or so books that make up the Book of Mormon). The rest is a history of two different people that left Jerusalem at two different times. I'd gotten to page 241 in this book before I found this cowardly note tucked into the back of the book. And if the author were off that much on this very small and insignificant portion of the book, one can only ask how much else irresponsible reporting of purported facts did he do?"
206,0316202975,http://goodreads.com/user/show/16013276-melissa-meinhard,3,"Overall this was a very interesting book but I had some major problems with the author's choice of language. He tried to make this more of an ""everyman's"" book instead of a straight science book and lost something in the compromise. In order to make the book seem more poetic he takes liberties with the science. The problems I had were when he was talking about the animals in the book; he often used the words ""monkeys"" and ""apes"" interchangeably as well as others like ""rats"" and ""mice"". I can see he was trying to not use the same words over and over again, and thought that some variety would make the book more enjoyable. For someone who is not a scientist, this would most likely go unnoticed. But if you are writing a book in order to educate people on something, they deserve to be given the correct information. I was so frustrated at some points that I had to put the book down and come back to it when i wasn't so annoyed.The thing that I enjoyed the most about this book was the acrostic that was challenged in the beginning of the book. If you can figure it out, the author wants you to email him your answer. A friend and I worked on it and got it all correct except for the final letter. That was the most fun I had had with a book in awhile. So it gets 3 stars--I liked it. Negative points for the abuse of science, but positive points for the fun and difficult acrostic."
207,0316202975,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2600140-rebecca,3,"The author writes about DNA from its discovery to how scientists learned to interpret it and interpret genes, infighting among scientists working to map the genome, ethical issues, etc. He illuminates the information with lots of fascinating anecdotes and stories of people and places affected by some aberration in DNA/genes in ways we wouldn't suspect.I'll admit that even in this work aimed at the general public, some of the science was above my head, and I yawned my way through the technical details. I got a lot more out of the examples and stories, such as why you should never eat polar bear liver. The author does a good job of choosing interesting happenings to explore in terms of genetics, and I did finally understand how genes could be mapped (well, sort of). The book was kind of a long slog, so I would only recommend it to those with a strong interest in science, and particularly DNA/genes.[As a side note, I forgot that I read this and picked it up again as an audiobook, and gave up pretty early on because I couldn't keep the thread of it in my head. Plus I thought the horrific details of Hiroshima and Nagasaki were unnecessary. They did cause gene damage and mutation, which is necessary to the subject of the book, but the gruesome descriptions of injuries felt gratuitous.]"
208,0316202975,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3486418-scott-collins,4,"Entertaining, balanced and nicely written romp through the history of genetics, filled with fascinating characters such as Ilya Ivanov, the Russian scientist who tried to breed humanzees by impregnating chimps with human sperm (and vice versa, which almost happened until African officials thought better of offering up their women for such an experiment). Some of the science can be a little befuddling without a firm rooting in biology (time to bone up those DNA bases from Life Science 101!), but every chapter contains connections and stories that the non-scientists among us (and maybe some scientists too?) have never heard before. Could Toulouse-Lautrec's heredity have influenced his art? Oh, yes, it could have. Kean has the story, and it's a beaut. Is Humane Genome guru Craig Venter an egomaniacal jerk? Um, maybe - but his story is probably more important to our times than that of, say, the past few presidential campaigns or even global warming, to cite some events that get much more daily attention. The book even ends with an intriguing and slightly scary prospective look at the future of gene research, which might even include - gulp - DNA computers. Old-hat stuff for science geeks, perhaps, but it's all pretty delectable for non-pros. "
209,0316202975,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2613351-linda-robinson,4,"DNA, when unwound, could reach to Pluto and back to Earth again. Kean tries to unwind most of this distance for us, and the journey is a little long. Kean writes like a fan of science, which is good, but releases a tendency to cover every sidebar story genetically connected to our code. We're reminded again of the classroom bully fights that are waged with any research, and the childish grip of some scientists on pet theories, and personal endeavor. I wonder where we would be if this sniping was replaced by cooperation in laboratories and classrooms? Kean gives credit thankfully to the women scientists who are always involved in breakthroughs, but are hidden behind the curtain of history and male science writers. Kudos, Kean! While anecdotes are interesting, too many is like a houseguest that overstays the welcome. The last chapters are the most interesting - if DNA/RNA, genetics and epigenetics are an enormously powerful computing system, when will technology make the leap from circuit boards to proteins? That journey is going on now."
210,0316202975,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5174097-a,1,"I read Sam Kean's other book, The Disappearing Spoon and loved it. This book, The Violinist's Thumb, took forever to come in at the library and I could hardly wait to read it. Well, it's difficult to even tell this is the same author. His other book reads well, is organized and very interesting. This book reads as if the author pulled information from lots of other sources and threw it together. The chapter headings in this book often have very little to do with the chapter material. The material is not the author's but instead he is continuously using other author's works. I felt like I was reading Reader's Digest versions of other books. If you are truly interested in genes, DNA, science then this is not a book you will enjoy.It is very sensationalists. There was one photo in there of an infant...born with a tail. That was just a totally bizarre photo included purely to appeal to ?something? I don't know what, but it was not to appeal to people interested in science. So disappointing. This is just one example of how this book completely lets the reader down. Instead of science and DNA as the focus the author's focus is on evolution. Nothing on the cover or description indicates that this book will be about evolution and DNA. It just was not the same quality of writing or information as his first book. Mr. Kean is obviously a skilled writer but I wish he had put the same effort into this book as the Disappearing Spoon. Wish it had been as good as his other book..."

Can you fathom that pheromones could make you fall in love?The Violinist's Thumb contains chapters on all of these topics - it combines shocking facts with biological premises with the history of DNA discovery. For those who love biology Sam Kean incorporates an inundation of knowledge in this book. His writing never gets too long-winded or lackadaisical; his humor is refreshing but he maintains his ethos with a scholarly tone.However, it took me over two weeks to finish this book just because I couldn't keep an interest in the subject matter. I sped through certain chapters like the one on atavisms, though the passages about well-known scientists and brazen theories bored me. On an entirely objective level perhaps this book deserves a higher rating. But, because I rate subjectively and feel cheated out of the time I could've used to read other books, The Violinist's Thumb gets a three.Recommended for anyone who enjoys biology or wants a relatively easy introduction to the subject. I used a chapter of this book for my AP Biology project and impressed my teacher, showing that The Violinist's Thumb is accessible to a wide variety of ages and knowledge levels.*review cross-posted on my blog, the quiet voice."

At first his slightly oddball humour and focus on the personal dramas of his subject's put me off. Then I realised that between the one-liners and gossip-columnesque recounting of scientist's lives was a mass of hard information. Complex information that typically the most bright struggle with, passed out in the easiest to understand genetics I've encountered.By recounting the history of the subject, through the personal and professional lives of the scientists in the field Kean informs, entertains and debates a topic that we should all be interested in.Kean manages to do all this while retaining a human touch to his work. Studying genetics, DNA, and such tends to freak people out. But, it is hard to imagine anyone reacting to this book with squeamishness.Highly recommended to anyone with any interest in people, biology, evolution, behaviour, well anyone with interests really."
213,0316202975,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1069092-brad,3,"Another fun Sam Kean book. Like his earlier book The Disappearing Spoon that tackled the periodic table, Kean explores DNA and genetics in his latest with a fun and lighthearted approach. The science here is targeted heavily toward the layperson and he does a fine job introducing genetics to the unfamiliar. And he had some really great stories: the guy who was victim to BOTH Hiroshima and Nagasaki; the vicious rivalries of the Human Genome Project. Also like the Disappearing Spoon his silliness has a tendency to get old and I found myself rolling my eyes on more than one occasion. But, to be fair, the book really wasn’t written for the likes of me; people who deal with this crap for a living. Instead, I think it will become one of my recommended reads to my freshman and sophomore undergrads when we talk us some Mendel. Fun and quick with some great stories. And you might learn a little science, too. . . "
214,0316202975,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3286826-aaronb,4,"I read this as a follow up to the Disappearing Spoon. It deals with DNA and genes, and I liked the way he delves into history and links it to scientific breakthroughs. The pieces on homosexuality and genetics were quite interesting, as was the (mostly unfulfilled) page-turning chase to complete the Human Genome Project by the two duelling factions of scientists. It brings to mind IBM's practice of throwing two project teams on a software problem ""if you want to get the work done really quickly"".The Hapsburg part about incest and the genetic problems it made visible by studying court artists' pictures of them was remarkable. Seam Kean has helped a wider audience to understand, esp. with regard to cloning, that your genes do not determine you, but are only one piece of a larger puzzle to understand our background and what makes us tick."
215,0316202975,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7318623-catbookmom,2,"Started this as a break from a series I'm deeply involved in reading, and found myself thinking about the video explaining dinosaur DNA that is part of the **Jurassic Park** movie. Some of this seems like very dumbed-down science and other parts are very detailed. I found myself skipping around, and certainly my eyes glazed over in some places, where the tech-speak was just too much to absorb. Some of the information about the huge advances in DNA research and analysis is just mind-boggling, things like the cost of a DNA analysis dropping from millions of dollars to almost pocket-change. "
216,0316202975,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3440334-fred-forbes,5,"Flip a coin one thousand times and you will get heads about half the time, tails the other half. That is probably the way most authors would express the thought. Sam Kean writes ""If you flip a dime a thousand times, you'll get approximately five hundred FDRs and 500 torches ..."" It is that type of clever, accessible writing that makes Kean such a joy to read. Make no mistake, the study of DNA and genetics can be challenging but when it is presented as he does, integrating it well into science, history and art it is much more a pleasure than a slog. Recommended to anyone with a bit of curious intellect - a pleasurable way to learn."
217,0316202975,http://goodreads.com/user/show/12541461-betseak,4,"'The Violinist's Thumb' is an excellent overview of the history of DNA and genetics research. As I read the book in its audio version, the scientific parts were somewhat difficult to follow. Nevertheless, they were pretty well illuminated and made accessible through numerous entertaining stories, some of which a bit creepy, like the one about the attempts to make 'humanzees' (a human-chimpanzee cross-breed), yet others…hmm… a bit gossipy, let's say, but in a good, enlightening way. Recommended."
218,0316202975,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3617921-david-schwan,5,"Fascinating book which covers the history of discoveries surrounding DNA and how DNA works. Many people have been involved in learning how DNA works. Very little coverage of Watson & Crick versus Linus Pauling which has been covered well elsewhere. Lot's of detail regarding the fruit fly experiments, and lot's of other more forgotten but important breakthroughs. "

In The Violinist’s Thumb: And Other Lost Tales of Love, War, and Genius, as Written by Our Genetic Code, he explores the wonders of the magical building block of life: DNA.There are genes to explain crazy cat ladies, why other people have no fingerprints, and why some people survive nuclear bombs. Genes illuminate everything from JFK’s bronze skin (it wasn’t a tan) to Einstein’s genius. They prove that Neanderthals and humans bred thousands of years more recently than any of us would feel comfortable thinking. They can even allow some people, because of the exceptional flexibility of their thumbs and fingers, to become truly singular violinists.Kean’s vibrant storytelling once again makes science entertaining, explaining human history and whimsy while showing how DNA will influence our species’ future."

222,0316202975,http://goodreads.com/user/show/974110-wendi-lau,5,"Interesting, FUNNY, so riveting, even all the end notes are worth reading. Mr. Kean has such surprising turns of phrase. He is a very good storyteller."
223,0316202975,http://goodreads.com/user/show/54953761-tamara-cassinat,4,"I really enjoy Sam Kean books. This one - since it dealt with biology and DNA, which I know little about, wasn’t as interesting to me as his other book “The Disappearing Spoon” which is about chemistry and the making of the periodic table. Still really cool. Really interesting. Would recommend it. "
224,0316202975,http://goodreads.com/user/show/41735508-noah-goats,4,"Kean writes with humor and humanity, and weaves the science of our genetic code around the interesting stories of real people. The result is a scientific page turner."
225,0316202975,http://goodreads.com/user/show/20022340-jennie-rosenblum,4,"Easy to read, even with all the scientific terminology. Enjoyable side stories of the people behind the science."
226,0316202975,http://goodreads.com/user/show/10132668-trasa,5,"A book that simultaneously manages to teach you about DNA and related subjects while giving really salacious stories about the people involved with the science during the last couple hundred years. Excellent science, research, writing and flow of the book."
227,0316202975,http://goodreads.com/user/show/37650802-kara,4,"Kean is a very talented science writer, and this book is extremely readable — I powered through it in a little more than three days. He takes complex topics, breaks them down, and explains them in a way that everyday readers can understand, no small feat when it comes to genetics. Kean also provides a good balance of anecdotes and transitions easily between stories and science (a switch that I have seen awkwardly and/or abruptly handled in a lot of nonfiction). Usually, genetics isn't a nonfiction subject that I'm compelled to read about, unlike (say) psychology, but I blew through book and found myself wanting to check out some of Kean's sources for more information. This is definitely a book for a generalist audience and not DNA buffs who want to get in the weeds, but seeing as how I am a generalist reader, that was just fine by me."
228,0316202975,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1842160-courtney-williams,5,"The book: The Violinist's ThumbThe author: Sam Kean, American science writer.The subject: An exploration of DNA: the stories of its discovery, how it affects our lives and how it will shape our future.Why I chose it: I've seen it recommended before on one ""good popular science"" list or another. Also, the cover and title.The rating: Five out of five starsWhat I thought of it: I really should have reviewed this book a few weeks ago when I read it... I know I loved it, but can't remember exactly what I wanted to say about it! Anyway, I'll review it as best I can regardless.I am a violinist (and violist) myself and happen to have type D brachydactyly, also known as club thumb. It's a harmless quirk of genetics – much like hitch-hiker's thumb, which I also have on both hands – that has nevertheless been associated with both royals and murderers. I joke with my boyfriend that I'd be the worst X-Man ever and my name would be Thumbs and my superpower would be THUMBS! (And then I wave my thumbs in his face. It's a really funny joke.)

My thumbs. Yes, I put them on Instagram.Sadly, unlike the violinist whose thumbs inspired the title of this book, Niccolò Paganini, my thumbs have not helped me become such an incredible musician that people believe I sold my soul to the Devil. In fact, my hands are quite small in general, which impedes my ability to play and, try as I might, I still can't stop locking my tiny right thumb when holding the bow, rather than bending it gracefully. Despite my genetics betraying me so utterly, in terms of playing the higher string instruments at least, I'm still very interested in the subject itself and the stories behind its development. This book was right up my street.As you can probably tell by the top star rating, I really enjoyed this book, both as a piece of science writing and a generally enjoyable read. I have very little in the way of biology knowledge – I stopped studying it after GCSE Double Science, though I've read a little about it – I found it to be just in-depth enough that I learned things, but didn't feel I was in over my head. As someone who is interested enough in the history of science to be considering doing a masters degree in it, I loved all the stories Kean relates and all the tangents he goes on. The one that most stuck with me was the man who was a survivor of both the Hiroshima and Nagasaki atomic bombings. The endnotes were brilliant too, even if I always hate having to flick back and forth (yes, I'm lazy). I enjoyed the casual language and irreverent humour as well; it could have easily come off as an insincere attempt to be approachable, but it really worked well and felt appropriate.I wouldn't recommend this book to you if you want a gentle and linear introduction to genetics as a science, with background included where necessary. However, if you like science history, learning about scientific personalities and tangents galore, give this a go. I enjoyed it a great deal.Just one more thing: I was incredibly (disproportionately) excited to figure out the ""easter egg"" that Kean hid in his book quite quickly. If you've still not got it, let me know and I can give you a hint ;-)"
229,0316202975,http://goodreads.com/user/show/11516573-delta,3,"This was an interesting read for me. I'm familiar with the science of genetics (although by no means an expert or even a novice), but I feel like this book is written for readers with more expertise or at least a higher level of knowledge of biology. Most of the book is written for the average lay-person, but there are sections that read like a college-level textbook. Overall, I found it interesting, but would probably not recommend unless you are really interested in the subject."
230,0316202975,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1444762-jill,4,"You may recognize the author’s name because of his previous bestselling book about the periodic table, The Disappearing Spoon. In this book, he tackles genetics, doing a fine job in explaining a very complex subject bit by bit, with clever analogies and a good deal of humor.There are loads of interesting tidbits:Of all the survivors of the World War II atomic bombing of Hiroshima and Nagasaki, some 150 were caught near both cities on both days! (Talk about a run of bad luck!)In the 1940’s and 1950’s, many female scientists were nuns, because, as Kean explains, Women at the time usually had to relinquish their careers upon marrying, while unmarried women...provoked suspicion or derision and sometimes earned such low pay they couldn’t make ends meet.”Humans share about 99% of our DNA with chimpanzees, making them our closest living relatives. But male chimps have something humans don’t: little bumps called spines on their penises. According to Kean, “this loss decreases male sensation during sex and thereby prolongs copulation, which scientists suspect helps humans pair-bond and stay monogamous.”Who knew?Kean explains why Arctic explorers can risk death by eating the liver of polar bears, or why some people who have one cat start getting more cats. He also talks about the phenomenon of epigenetics: how genes can, in fact, be influenced by the environment, with the effects actually passed on to progeny, much as theorized by the discredited Jean-Baptiste Lamarck. He even explains how why the beliefs of some religions couldn’t possibly be true: the genetic evidence tells a different story.Evaluation: This book is full of fascinating anecdotes, as well as a lot of science, which you can actually just scan if you prefer, without it detracting from the general thrust of the book. One big criticism: When I read a nonfiction book, I depend heavily on the index to help me refer back to ideas I just read 20 minutes ago but forgot already. The index in this book is extremely inadequate. Want to look up that bit about cats, for example? Well, you won’t find anything under “cat” or “feline”: unless you remember that the organism which is the culprit is called Toxoplasma gondii, you’re out of luck!Otherwise, it was a very entertaining read; once again Kean has succeeded in making science fun, which is absolutely a good thing!Rating: 3.5/5"
231,0316202975,http://goodreads.com/user/show/10762842-nicole-r,5,"I binged on new release contemporary fiction lately and, while it led me to many great books, it left me craving something nonfiction. Leah K's review earlier this month of The Violinist's Thumb made my decision of what to read to balance my “book diet” a no brainer.DNA. Amino acids. Genes. I likely lost most of you after “DNA”. DNA is the basis of all life. Just FOUR MEASLY “LETTERS” account for all of the diversity IN THE ENTIRE WORLD. Seriously. Mind blowing. But how much do we really know about the blueprint for life? I have a PhD in biology so I likely know more than the average Joe Schmo but I have just barely covered the tip of the iceberg.Sam Kean brilliantly escorts us through the just-deeper-than-the-basics of DNA. He explains: 	 • the physical structure of DNA and how this translates into amino acids and genes; 	 • how one species becomes two (or three or four or….) through different pressures on DNA; 	 • the evolution of human genes and how we have morphed from primate to Neanderthal to Homo sapiens but still have 99% the same DNA as the person sitting next to us, down the hall, or in Siberia; and 	 • what can (or can’t) genes teach us.Mr. Kean uses interesting stories, mini-bios of famous scientists, and humor to draw the reader in, make complicated concepts understandable, and – most importantly – entertain us. I learned a lot about the idiosyncrasies of names I hear all the time like Darwin, Watson and Crick, Mendel, and others. For example, I had NO IDEA that Darwin was actually an extremely sickly man following the Voyage of the Beagle and may have had a genetic predilection for his symptoms!Other fun facts: Tsutomu Yamaguchi is the only officially recognized person by the Japanese government to have survived both the Hiroshima AND Nagasaki bombings….and, then he lived to be 93 years old! There is a theory that the Toba supervolcanic eruption roughly 75,000 years ago is responsible for the near-extinction of humans, the genetic bottleneck that followed, and why humans are so genetically similar today. And, there is a similar supervolcano just building up steam under Wyoming!Seriously, this book was phenomenal. It was simple and clear enough that everyone could learn something but had enough interesting sidebars that even those well-versed in genetics would likely learn something new. Mr. Kean, you have a new fan and I plan on reading the Disappearing Spoon very soon!"
232,0316202975,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3837733-joan,5,"This was absolutely fascinating! The author writes in a very approachable manner, so that you can understand fairly complicated stuff without needing a scholarly biology background. He also does this with no hint of writing down to anyone. He gleefully shows how very human the scientists who study DNA and genetics are, as well as how human are their subjects, many of whom have genetic based diseases. He finishes with a cautionary note. He reminds his audience that DNA only works in probabilities, not in possibilities. In other words, the first time he had his genome sequenced, he told them he wanted no information on whether he is going to get Parkinson's or not. After reading and absorbing the information, he realized he was being silly. Potential is not necessarily doom. He got online and clicked to remove the note against getting that information. Hurray, he isn't going to get Parkinson's! Later, an update on what the information means came and he checked. Oops. He does have a potential to get Parkinson's. It didn't worry him the way it did when he started studying this field. He checked and found out he has a 20% increased chance of getting Parkinson''s. He can now realize that is fairly low percentage. BTW in case you are wondering, but don't want to read the book to find out, the violinist's thumb in the title, refers to Pagannini. He possibly had a genetic condition where his joints, including that thumb, were amazingly flexible.However, that same condition that made him possibly the greatest violinist of all time, also gave him great misery and likely an early death. He introduced the concept of epigenetics which was a new concept to me and apparently one of the really complicating factors in studying DNA. If you have any interest in genetics or the history of science, this is a must read! I'm really grateful to Rebecca for recommending this book and have checked out another book by this author. Expect a review on that book in several months!"
233,0316202975,http://goodreads.com/user/show/73003404-daniel,4,"I read this book due to my love of The Disappearing Spoon: And Other True Tales of Madness, Love, and the History of the World from the Periodic Table of the Elements, of which this is a spiritual sequel (review here - pretty much all of which applies), but while I enjoyed it, I did not find it to be as magical as the original, despite the nearly identical writing style and structure. The Violinist's Thumb was narrated differently for audiobook than The Disappearing Spoon, and I did consume portions of it via e-reader, but I don't think those discrepancies are responsible for my less-gushing enthusiasm.Instead, I think this is entirely down to subject matter. First, I think the physics and chemistry that formed the core of The Disappearing Spoon was likely more comfortable for the author, a former Physics student, than the biology at the heart of The Violinist's Thumb - a view reinforced by the former's earlier publication. Second, while there is a lot of ""unknown"" in physics and chemistry, our current understanding can explain a great deal of interesting real-world phenomena, whereas genetics seems to have a much more ambiguous causal relationship, which is harder to latch on to. Most importantly, though, I think I'm personally just less interested in genetics than I was in the material in The Disappearing Spoon. This book is still excellent though, like its predecessor, and anyone interested in heredity should definitely pick it up."
234,0316202975,http://goodreads.com/user/show/9958121-nicole,4,"I missed about a decade of, oh, everything going on in the world, due to childrearing and family responsibilities and constraints, so I pretty much had only the vaguest idea that the Human Genome Project was happening. This book is a great starting place for someone who knows only a little history of science and pretty much nothing about genetics.The cutesy language that other reviewers have found irksome delighted me. Sometimes his language, his references, are quite clever. I had to look up quite a few words, and I'm not talking about the scientific terms. Last night my son asked, ""How is it that every time you open that book you start laughing?"" The anecdotes and funny references (i.e. Roald Dahl and the Maginot Line) give the non-scientist hooks to hang a lot of technical information on, information that I would not have retained otherwise. Although I understand that he is writing for the average reader, not the scientist, I shared another reviewer's frustrations about citations. He often says something along the lines of ""one scientist commented that 'blah blah blah'"" but we never get to know who that person was. The endnotes were full of delicious little facts, and a few sources were cited or recommended there, but certainly a more detailed list of references would have been appropriate, and not distracting (if that was the concern) to the non-scientist, if tucked away at the end of the book. A cast of characters list would also have been helpful. That said, good starting place, clever and engaging. "
235,0316202975,http://goodreads.com/user/show/264570-bonnie,2,"I deserve a medal for not only making it through this complete obfuscation of a book, but presenting it at book club as well. Sentence after sentence and paragraph after paragraph refuting what the author's goal was for the book (if indeed I even understood that). Paragraphs with evidence based verbiage while including words like perhaps, somehow, but then refuted. I don't even have the energy to write a review on it.I'm glad I read it. I did learn something--just don't ask me what. I will add that the author lost his credence many times, but none more so than with this gem of inaccurate and untruthful reporting found in the notes in the back of the book: ""Mormons have traditionally believed--ever since Joseph Smith, just fourteen years old, copied down Jehovah's very words in 1820. . . ."" Joseph Smith was not 14 years old when he began translation of the Book of Mormon; using the word ""copying"" is an untruth, and Jehovah's very words are in the Book of Mormon, but only chapters 11-28 of 3rd Nephi (one of 15 or so books that make up the Book of Mormon). The rest is a history of two different people that left Jerusalem at two different times. I'd gotten to page 241 in this book before I found this cowardly note tucked into the back of the book. And if the author were off that much on this very small and insignificant portion of the book, one can only ask how much else irresponsible reporting of purported facts did he do?"
236,0316202975,http://goodreads.com/user/show/16013276-melissa-meinhard,3,"Overall this was a very interesting book but I had some major problems with the author's choice of language. He tried to make this more of an ""everyman's"" book instead of a straight science book and lost something in the compromise. In order to make the book seem more poetic he takes liberties with the science. The problems I had were when he was talking about the animals in the book; he often used the words ""monkeys"" and ""apes"" interchangeably as well as others like ""rats"" and ""mice"". I can see he was trying to not use the same words over and over again, and thought that some variety would make the book more enjoyable. For someone who is not a scientist, this would most likely go unnoticed. But if you are writing a book in order to educate people on something, they deserve to be given the correct information. I was so frustrated at some points that I had to put the book down and come back to it when i wasn't so annoyed.The thing that I enjoyed the most about this book was the acrostic that was challenged in the beginning of the book. If you can figure it out, the author wants you to email him your answer. A friend and I worked on it and got it all correct except for the final letter. That was the most fun I had had with a book in awhile. So it gets 3 stars--I liked it. Negative points for the abuse of science, but positive points for the fun and difficult acrostic."
237,0316202975,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2600140-rebecca,3,"The author writes about DNA from its discovery to how scientists learned to interpret it and interpret genes, infighting among scientists working to map the genome, ethical issues, etc. He illuminates the information with lots of fascinating anecdotes and stories of people and places affected by some aberration in DNA/genes in ways we wouldn't suspect.I'll admit that even in this work aimed at the general public, some of the science was above my head, and I yawned my way through the technical details. I got a lot more out of the examples and stories, such as why you should never eat polar bear liver. The author does a good job of choosing interesting happenings to explore in terms of genetics, and I did finally understand how genes could be mapped (well, sort of). The book was kind of a long slog, so I would only recommend it to those with a strong interest in science, and particularly DNA/genes.[As a side note, I forgot that I read this and picked it up again as an audiobook, and gave up pretty early on because I couldn't keep the thread of it in my head. Plus I thought the horrific details of Hiroshima and Nagasaki were unnecessary. They did cause gene damage and mutation, which is necessary to the subject of the book, but the gruesome descriptions of injuries felt gratuitous.]"
238,0316202975,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3486418-scott-collins,4,"Entertaining, balanced and nicely written romp through the history of genetics, filled with fascinating characters such as Ilya Ivanov, the Russian scientist who tried to breed humanzees by impregnating chimps with human sperm (and vice versa, which almost happened until African officials thought better of offering up their women for such an experiment). Some of the science can be a little befuddling without a firm rooting in biology (time to bone up those DNA bases from Life Science 101!), but every chapter contains connections and stories that the non-scientists among us (and maybe some scientists too?) have never heard before. Could Toulouse-Lautrec's heredity have influenced his art? Oh, yes, it could have. Kean has the story, and it's a beaut. Is Humane Genome guru Craig Venter an egomaniacal jerk? Um, maybe - but his story is probably more important to our times than that of, say, the past few presidential campaigns or even global warming, to cite some events that get much more daily attention. The book even ends with an intriguing and slightly scary prospective look at the future of gene research, which might even include - gulp - DNA computers. Old-hat stuff for science geeks, perhaps, but it's all pretty delectable for non-pros. "
239,0316202975,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2613351-linda-robinson,4,"DNA, when unwound, could reach to Pluto and back to Earth again. Kean tries to unwind most of this distance for us, and the journey is a little long. Kean writes like a fan of science, which is good, but releases a tendency to cover every sidebar story genetically connected to our code. We're reminded again of the classroom bully fights that are waged with any research, and the childish grip of some scientists on pet theories, and personal endeavor. I wonder where we would be if this sniping was replaced by cooperation in laboratories and classrooms? Kean gives credit thankfully to the women scientists who are always involved in breakthroughs, but are hidden behind the curtain of history and male science writers. Kudos, Kean! While anecdotes are interesting, too many is like a houseguest that overstays the welcome. The last chapters are the most interesting - if DNA/RNA, genetics and epigenetics are an enormously powerful computing system, when will technology make the leap from circuit boards to proteins? That journey is going on now."
240,0316202975,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5174097-a,1,"I read Sam Kean's other book, The Disappearing Spoon and loved it. This book, The Violinist's Thumb, took forever to come in at the library and I could hardly wait to read it. Well, it's difficult to even tell this is the same author. His other book reads well, is organized and very interesting. This book reads as if the author pulled information from lots of other sources and threw it together. The chapter headings in this book often have very little to do with the chapter material. The material is not the author's but instead he is continuously using other author's works. I felt like I was reading Reader's Digest versions of other books. If you are truly interested in genes, DNA, science then this is not a book you will enjoy.It is very sensationalists. There was one photo in there of an infant...born with a tail. That was just a totally bizarre photo included purely to appeal to ?something? I don't know what, but it was not to appeal to people interested in science. So disappointing. This is just one example of how this book completely lets the reader down. Instead of science and DNA as the focus the author's focus is on evolution. Nothing on the cover or description indicates that this book will be about evolution and DNA. It just was not the same quality of writing or information as his first book. Mr. Kean is obviously a skilled writer but I wish he had put the same effort into this book as the Disappearing Spoon. Wish it had been as good as his other book..."

Can you fathom that pheromones could make you fall in love?The Violinist's Thumb contains chapters on all of these topics - it combines shocking facts with biological premises with the history of DNA discovery. For those who love biology Sam Kean incorporates an inundation of knowledge in this book. His writing never gets too long-winded or lackadaisical; his humor is refreshing but he maintains his ethos with a scholarly tone.However, it took me over two weeks to finish this book just because I couldn't keep an interest in the subject matter. I sped through certain chapters like the one on atavisms, though the passages about well-known scientists and brazen theories bored me. On an entirely objective level perhaps this book deserves a higher rating. But, because I rate subjectively and feel cheated out of the time I could've used to read other books, The Violinist's Thumb gets a three.Recommended for anyone who enjoys biology or wants a relatively easy introduction to the subject. I used a chapter of this book for my AP Biology project and impressed my teacher, showing that The Violinist's Thumb is accessible to a wide variety of ages and knowledge levels.*review cross-posted on my blog, the quiet voice."

At first his slightly oddball humour and focus on the personal dramas of his subject's put me off. Then I realised that between the one-liners and gossip-columnesque recounting of scientist's lives was a mass of hard information. Complex information that typically the most bright struggle with, passed out in the easiest to understand genetics I've encountered.By recounting the history of the subject, through the personal and professional lives of the scientists in the field Kean informs, entertains and debates a topic that we should all be interested in.Kean manages to do all this while retaining a human touch to his work. Studying genetics, DNA, and such tends to freak people out. But, it is hard to imagine anyone reacting to this book with squeamishness.Highly recommended to anyone with any interest in people, biology, evolution, behaviour, well anyone with interests really."
243,0316202975,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1069092-brad,3,"Another fun Sam Kean book. Like his earlier book The Disappearing Spoon that tackled the periodic table, Kean explores DNA and genetics in his latest with a fun and lighthearted approach. The science here is targeted heavily toward the layperson and he does a fine job introducing genetics to the unfamiliar. And he had some really great stories: the guy who was victim to BOTH Hiroshima and Nagasaki; the vicious rivalries of the Human Genome Project. Also like the Disappearing Spoon his silliness has a tendency to get old and I found myself rolling my eyes on more than one occasion. But, to be fair, the book really wasn’t written for the likes of me; people who deal with this crap for a living. Instead, I think it will become one of my recommended reads to my freshman and sophomore undergrads when we talk us some Mendel. Fun and quick with some great stories. And you might learn a little science, too. . . "
244,0316202975,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3286826-aaronb,4,"I read this as a follow up to the Disappearing Spoon. It deals with DNA and genes, and I liked the way he delves into history and links it to scientific breakthroughs. The pieces on homosexuality and genetics were quite interesting, as was the (mostly unfulfilled) page-turning chase to complete the Human Genome Project by the two duelling factions of scientists. It brings to mind IBM's practice of throwing two project teams on a software problem ""if you want to get the work done really quickly"".The Hapsburg part about incest and the genetic problems it made visible by studying court artists' pictures of them was remarkable. Seam Kean has helped a wider audience to understand, esp. with regard to cloning, that your genes do not determine you, but are only one piece of a larger puzzle to understand our background and what makes us tick."
245,0316202975,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7318623-catbookmom,2,"Started this as a break from a series I'm deeply involved in reading, and found myself thinking about the video explaining dinosaur DNA that is part of the **Jurassic Park** movie. Some of this seems like very dumbed-down science and other parts are very detailed. I found myself skipping around, and certainly my eyes glazed over in some places, where the tech-speak was just too much to absorb. Some of the information about the huge advances in DNA research and analysis is just mind-boggling, things like the cost of a DNA analysis dropping from millions of dollars to almost pocket-change. "
246,0316202975,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3440334-fred-forbes,5,"Flip a coin one thousand times and you will get heads about half the time, tails the other half. That is probably the way most authors would express the thought. Sam Kean writes ""If you flip a dime a thousand times, you'll get approximately five hundred FDRs and 500 torches ..."" It is that type of clever, accessible writing that makes Kean such a joy to read. Make no mistake, the study of DNA and genetics can be challenging but when it is presented as he does, integrating it well into science, history and art it is much more a pleasure than a slog. Recommended to anyone with a bit of curious intellect - a pleasurable way to learn."

As I read the book in its audio version, the scientific parts were somewhat difficult to follow. Nevertheless, they were pretty well illuminated and made accessible through numerous entertaining stories, some of which a bit creepy, like the one about the attempts to make 'humanzees' (a human-chimpanzee cross-breed), yet others…hmm… a bit gossipy, let's say, but in a good, enlightening way. Recommended."
248,0316202975,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3617921-david-schwan,5,"Fascinating book which covers the history of discoveries surrounding DNA and how DNA works. Many people have been involved in learning how DNA works. Very little coverage of Watson & Crick versus Linus Pauling which has been covered well elsewhere. Lot's of detail regarding the fruit fly experiments, and lot's of other more forgotten but important breakthroughs. "

In The Violinist’s Thumb: And Other Lost Tales of Love, War, and Genius, as Written by Our Genetic Code, he explores the wonders of the magical building block of life: DNA.There are genes to explain crazy cat ladies, why other people have no fingerprints, and why some people survive nuclear bombs. Genes illuminate everything from JFK’s bronze skin (it wasn’t a tan) to Einstein’s genius. They prove that Neanderthals and humans bred thousands of years more recently than any of us would feel comfortable thinking. They can even allow some people, because of the exceptional flexibility of their thumbs and fingers, to become truly singular violinists.Kean’s vibrant storytelling once again makes science entertaining, explaining human history and whimsy while showing how DNA will influence our species’ future."

252,0316202975,http://goodreads.com/user/show/974110-wendi-lau,5,"Interesting, FUNNY, so riveting, even all the end notes are worth reading. Mr. Kean has such surprising turns of phrase. He is a very good storyteller."
253,0316202975,http://goodreads.com/user/show/54953761-tamara-cassinat,4,"I really enjoy Sam Kean books. This one - since it dealt with biology and DNA, which I know little about, wasn’t as interesting to me as his other book “The Disappearing Spoon” which is about chemistry and the making of the periodic table. Still really cool. Really interesting. Would recommend it. "
254,0316202975,http://goodreads.com/user/show/41735508-noah-goats,4,"Kean writes with humor and humanity, and weaves the science of our genetic code around the interesting stories of real people. The result is a scientific page turner."
255,0316202975,http://goodreads.com/user/show/20022340-jennie-rosenblum,4,"Easy to read, even with all the scientific terminology. Enjoyable side stories of the people behind the science."
256,0316202975,http://goodreads.com/user/show/10132668-trasa,5,"A book that simultaneously manages to teach you about DNA and related subjects while giving really salacious stories about the people involved with the science during the last couple hundred years. Excellent science, research, writing and flow of the book."
257,0316202975,http://goodreads.com/user/show/37650802-kara,4,"Kean is a very talented science writer, and this book is extremely readable — I powered through it in a little more than three days. He takes complex topics, breaks them down, and explains them in a way that everyday readers can understand, no small feat when it comes to genetics. Kean also provides a good balance of anecdotes and transitions easily between stories and science (a switch that I have seen awkwardly and/or abruptly handled in a lot of nonfiction). Usually, genetics isn't a nonfiction subject that I'm compelled to read about, unlike (say) psychology, but I blew through book and found myself wanting to check out some of Kean's sources for more information. This is definitely a book for a generalist audience and not DNA buffs who want to get in the weeds, but seeing as how I am a generalist reader, that was just fine by me."
258,0316202975,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1842160-courtney-williams,5,"The book: The Violinist's ThumbThe author: Sam Kean, American science writer.The subject: An exploration of DNA: the stories of its discovery, how it affects our lives and how it will shape our future.Why I chose it: I've seen it recommended before on one ""good popular science"" list or another. Also, the cover and title.The rating: Five out of five starsWhat I thought of it: I really should have reviewed this book a few weeks ago when I read it... I know I loved it, but can't remember exactly what I wanted to say about it! Anyway, I'll review it as best I can regardless.I am a violinist (and violist) myself and happen to have type D brachydactyly, also known as club thumb. It's a harmless quirk of genetics – much like hitch-hiker's thumb, which I also have on both hands – that has nevertheless been associated with both royals and murderers. I joke with my boyfriend that I'd be the worst X-Man ever and my name would be Thumbs and my superpower would be THUMBS! (And then I wave my thumbs in his face. It's a really funny joke.)

My thumbs. Yes, I put them on Instagram.Sadly, unlike the violinist whose thumbs inspired the title of this book, Niccolò Paganini, my thumbs have not helped me become such an incredible musician that people believe I sold my soul to the Devil. In fact, my hands are quite small in general, which impedes my ability to play and, try as I might, I still can't stop locking my tiny right thumb when holding the bow, rather than bending it gracefully. Despite my genetics betraying me so utterly, in terms of playing the higher string instruments at least, I'm still very interested in the subject itself and the stories behind its development. This book was right up my street.As you can probably tell by the top star rating, I really enjoyed this book, both as a piece of science writing and a generally enjoyable read. I have very little in the way of biology knowledge – I stopped studying it after GCSE Double Science, though I've read a little about it – I found it to be just in-depth enough that I learned things, but didn't feel I was in over my head. As someone who is interested enough in the history of science to be considering doing a masters degree in it, I loved all the stories Kean relates and all the tangents he goes on. The one that most stuck with me was the man who was a survivor of both the Hiroshima and Nagasaki atomic bombings. The endnotes were brilliant too, even if I always hate having to flick back and forth (yes, I'm lazy). I enjoyed the casual language and irreverent humour as well; it could have easily come off as an insincere attempt to be approachable, but it really worked well and felt appropriate.I wouldn't recommend this book to you if you want a gentle and linear introduction to genetics as a science, with background included where necessary. However, if you like science history, learning about scientific personalities and tangents galore, give this a go. I enjoyed it a great deal.Just one more thing: I was incredibly (disproportionately) excited to figure out the ""easter egg"" that Kean hid in his book quite quickly. If you've still not got it, let me know and I can give you a hint ;-)"
259,0316202975,http://goodreads.com/user/show/11516573-delta,3,"This was an interesting read for me. I'm familiar with the science of genetics (although by no means an expert or even a novice), but I feel like this book is written for readers with more expertise or at least a higher level of knowledge of biology. Most of the book is written for the average lay-person, but there are sections that read like a college-level textbook. Overall, I found it interesting, but would probably not recommend unless you are really interested in the subject."
260,0316202975,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1444762-jill,4,"You may recognize the author’s name because of his previous bestselling book about the periodic table, The Disappearing Spoon. In this book, he tackles genetics, doing a fine job in explaining a very complex subject bit by bit, with clever analogies and a good deal of humor.There are loads of interesting tidbits:Of all the survivors of the World War II atomic bombing of Hiroshima and Nagasaki, some 150 were caught near both cities on both days! (Talk about a run of bad luck!)In the 1940’s and 1950’s, many female scientists were nuns, because, as Kean explains, Women at the time usually had to relinquish their careers upon marrying, while unmarried women...provoked suspicion or derision and sometimes earned such low pay they couldn’t make ends meet.”Humans share about 99% of our DNA with chimpanzees, making them our closest living relatives. But male chimps have something humans don’t: little bumps called spines on their penises. According to Kean, “this loss decreases male sensation during sex and thereby prolongs copulation, which scientists suspect helps humans pair-bond and stay monogamous.”Who knew?Kean explains why Arctic explorers can risk death by eating the liver of polar bears, or why some people who have one cat start getting more cats. He also talks about the phenomenon of epigenetics: how genes can, in fact, be influenced by the environment, with the effects actually passed on to progeny, much as theorized by the discredited Jean-Baptiste Lamarck. He even explains how why the beliefs of some religions couldn’t possibly be true: the genetic evidence tells a different story.Evaluation: This book is full of fascinating anecdotes, as well as a lot of science, which you can actually just scan if you prefer, without it detracting from the general thrust of the book. One big criticism: When I read a nonfiction book, I depend heavily on the index to help me refer back to ideas I just read 20 minutes ago but forgot already. The index in this book is extremely inadequate. Want to look up that bit about cats, for example? Well, you won’t find anything under “cat” or “feline”: unless you remember that the organism which is the culprit is called Toxoplasma gondii, you’re out of luck!Otherwise, it was a very entertaining read; once again Kean has succeeded in making science fun, which is absolutely a good thing!Rating: 3.5/5"
261,0316202975,http://goodreads.com/user/show/10762842-nicole-r,5,"I binged on new release contemporary fiction lately and, while it led me to many great books, it left me craving something nonfiction. Leah K's review earlier this month of The Violinist's Thumb made my decision of what to read to balance my “book diet” a no brainer.DNA. Amino acids. Genes. I likely lost most of you after “DNA”. DNA is the basis of all life. Just FOUR MEASLY “LETTERS” account for all of the diversity IN THE ENTIRE WORLD. Seriously. Mind blowing. But how much do we really know about the blueprint for life? I have a PhD in biology so I likely know more than the average Joe Schmo but I have just barely covered the tip of the iceberg.Sam Kean brilliantly escorts us through the just-deeper-than-the-basics of DNA. He explains: 	 • the physical structure of DNA and how this translates into amino acids and genes; 	 • how one species becomes two (or three or four or….) through different pressures on DNA; 	 • the evolution of human genes and how we have morphed from primate to Neanderthal to Homo sapiens but still have 99% the same DNA as the person sitting next to us, down the hall, or in Siberia; and 	 • what can (or can’t) genes teach us.Mr. Kean uses interesting stories, mini-bios of famous scientists, and humor to draw the reader in, make complicated concepts understandable, and – most importantly – entertain us. I learned a lot about the idiosyncrasies of names I hear all the time like Darwin, Watson and Crick, Mendel, and others. For example, I had NO IDEA that Darwin was actually an extremely sickly man following the Voyage of the Beagle and may have had a genetic predilection for his symptoms!Other fun facts: Tsutomu Yamaguchi is the only officially recognized person by the Japanese government to have survived both the Hiroshima AND Nagasaki bombings….and, then he lived to be 93 years old! There is a theory that the Toba supervolcanic eruption roughly 75,000 years ago is responsible for the near-extinction of humans, the genetic bottleneck that followed, and why humans are so genetically similar today. And, there is a similar supervolcano just building up steam under Wyoming!Seriously, this book was phenomenal. It was simple and clear enough that everyone could learn something but had enough interesting sidebars that even those well-versed in genetics would likely learn something new. Mr. Kean, you have a new fan and I plan on reading the Disappearing Spoon very soon!"
262,0316202975,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3837733-joan,5,"This was absolutely fascinating! The author writes in a very approachable manner, so that you can understand fairly complicated stuff without needing a scholarly biology background. He also does this with no hint of writing down to anyone. He gleefully shows how very human the scientists who study DNA and genetics are, as well as how human are their subjects, many of whom have genetic based diseases. He finishes with a cautionary note. He reminds his audience that DNA only works in probabilities, not in possibilities. In other words, the first time he had his genome sequenced, he told them he wanted no information on whether he is going to get Parkinson's or not. After reading and absorbing the information, he realized he was being silly. Potential is not necessarily doom. He got online and clicked to remove the note against getting that information. Hurray, he isn't going to get Parkinson's! Later, an update on what the information means came and he checked. Oops. He does have a potential to get Parkinson's. It didn't worry him the way it did when he started studying this field. He checked and found out he has a 20% increased chance of getting Parkinson''s. He can now realize that is fairly low percentage. BTW in case you are wondering, but don't want to read the book to find out, the violinist's thumb in the title, refers to Pagannini. He possibly had a genetic condition where his joints, including that thumb, were amazingly flexible.However, that same condition that made him possibly the greatest violinist of all time, also gave him great misery and likely an early death. He introduced the concept of epigenetics which was a new concept to me and apparently one of the really complicating factors in studying DNA. If you have any interest in genetics or the history of science, this is a must read! I'm really grateful to Rebecca for recommending this book and have checked out another book by this author. Expect a review on that book in several months!"
263,0316202975,http://goodreads.com/user/show/73003404-daniel,4,"I read this book due to my love of The Disappearing Spoon: And Other True Tales of Madness, Love, and the History of the World from the Periodic Table of the Elements, of which this is a spiritual sequel (review here - pretty much all of which applies), but while I enjoyed it, I did not find it to be as magical as the original, despite the nearly identical writing style and structure. The Violinist's Thumb was narrated differently for audiobook than The Disappearing Spoon, and I did consume portions of it via e-reader, but I don't think those discrepancies are responsible for my less-gushing enthusiasm.Instead, I think this is entirely down to subject matter. First, I think the physics and chemistry that formed the core of The Disappearing Spoon was likely more comfortable for the author, a former Physics student, than the biology at the heart of The Violinist's Thumb - a view reinforced by the former's earlier publication. Second, while there is a lot of ""unknown"" in physics and chemistry, our current understanding can explain a great deal of interesting real-world phenomena, whereas genetics seems to have a much more ambiguous causal relationship, which is harder to latch on to. Most importantly, though, I think I'm personally just less interested in genetics than I was in the material in The Disappearing Spoon. This book is still excellent though, like its predecessor, and anyone interested in heredity should definitely pick it up."
264,0316202975,http://goodreads.com/user/show/9958121-nicole,4,"I missed about a decade of, oh, everything going on in the world, due to childrearing and family responsibilities and constraints, so I pretty much had only the vaguest idea that the Human Genome Project was happening. This book is a great starting place for someone who knows only a little history of science and pretty much nothing about genetics.The cutesy language that other reviewers have found irksome delighted me. Sometimes his language, his references, are quite clever. I had to look up quite a few words, and I'm not talking about the scientific terms. Last night my son asked, ""How is it that every time you open that book you start laughing?"" The anecdotes and funny references (i.e. Roald Dahl and the Maginot Line) give the non-scientist hooks to hang a lot of technical information on, information that I would not have retained otherwise. Although I understand that he is writing for the average reader, not the scientist, I shared another reviewer's frustrations about citations. He often says something along the lines of ""one scientist commented that 'blah blah blah'"" but we never get to know who that person was. The endnotes were full of delicious little facts, and a few sources were cited or recommended there, but certainly a more detailed list of references would have been appropriate, and not distracting (if that was the concern) to the non-scientist, if tucked away at the end of the book. A cast of characters list would also have been helpful. That said, good starting place, clever and engaging. "
265,0316202975,http://goodreads.com/user/show/264570-bonnie,2,"I deserve a medal for not only making it through this complete obfuscation of a book, but presenting it at book club as well. Sentence after sentence and paragraph after paragraph refuting what the author's goal was for the book (if indeed I even understood that). Paragraphs with evidence based verbiage while including words like perhaps, somehow, but then refuted. I don't even have the energy to write a review on it.I'm glad I read it. I did learn something--just don't ask me what. I will add that the author lost his credence many times, but none more so than with this gem of inaccurate and untruthful reporting found in the notes in the back of the book: ""Mormons have traditionally believed--ever since Joseph Smith, just fourteen years old, copied down Jehovah's very words in 1820. . . ."" Joseph Smith was not 14 years old when he began translation of the Book of Mormon; using the word ""copying"" is an untruth, and Jehovah's very words are in the Book of Mormon, but only chapters 11-28 of 3rd Nephi (one of 15 or so books that make up the Book of Mormon). The rest is a history of two different people that left Jerusalem at two different times. I'd gotten to page 241 in this book before I found this cowardly note tucked into the back of the book. And if the author were off that much on this very small and insignificant portion of the book, one can only ask how much else irresponsible reporting of purported facts did he do?"
266,0316202975,http://goodreads.com/user/show/16013276-melissa-meinhard,3,"Overall this was a very interesting book but I had some major problems with the author's choice of language. He tried to make this more of an ""everyman's"" book instead of a straight science book and lost something in the compromise. In order to make the book seem more poetic he takes liberties with the science. The problems I had were when he was talking about the animals in the book; he often used the words ""monkeys"" and ""apes"" interchangeably as well as others like ""rats"" and ""mice"". I can see he was trying to not use the same words over and over again, and thought that some variety would make the book more enjoyable. For someone who is not a scientist, this would most likely go unnoticed. But if you are writing a book in order to educate people on something, they deserve to be given the correct information. I was so frustrated at some points that I had to put the book down and come back to it when i wasn't so annoyed.The thing that I enjoyed the most about this book was the acrostic that was challenged in the beginning of the book. If you can figure it out, the author wants you to email him your answer. A friend and I worked on it and got it all correct except for the final letter. That was the most fun I had had with a book in awhile. So it gets 3 stars--I liked it. Negative points for the abuse of science, but positive points for the fun and difficult acrostic."
267,0316202975,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2600140-rebecca,3,"The author writes about DNA from its discovery to how scientists learned to interpret it and interpret genes, infighting among scientists working to map the genome, ethical issues, etc. He illuminates the information with lots of fascinating anecdotes and stories of people and places affected by some aberration in DNA/genes in ways we wouldn't suspect.I'll admit that even in this work aimed at the general public, some of the science was above my head, and I yawned my way through the technical details. I got a lot more out of the examples and stories, such as why you should never eat polar bear liver. The author does a good job of choosing interesting happenings to explore in terms of genetics, and I did finally understand how genes could be mapped (well, sort of). The book was kind of a long slog, so I would only recommend it to those with a strong interest in science, and particularly DNA/genes.[As a side note, I forgot that I read this and picked it up again as an audiobook, and gave up pretty early on because I couldn't keep the thread of it in my head. Plus I thought the horrific details of Hiroshima and Nagasaki were unnecessary. They did cause gene damage and mutation, which is necessary to the subject of the book, but the gruesome descriptions of injuries felt gratuitous.]"
268,0316202975,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3486418-scott-collins,4,"Entertaining, balanced and nicely written romp through the history of genetics, filled with fascinating characters such as Ilya Ivanov, the Russian scientist who tried to breed humanzees by impregnating chimps with human sperm (and vice versa, which almost happened until African officials thought better of offering up their women for such an experiment). Some of the science can be a little befuddling without a firm rooting in biology (time to bone up those DNA bases from Life Science 101!), but every chapter contains connections and stories that the non-scientists among us (and maybe some scientists too?) have never heard before. Could Toulouse-Lautrec's heredity have influenced his art? Oh, yes, it could have. Kean has the story, and it's a beaut. Is Humane Genome guru Craig Venter an egomaniacal jerk? Um, maybe - but his story is probably more important to our times than that of, say, the past few presidential campaigns or even global warming, to cite some events that get much more daily attention. The book even ends with an intriguing and slightly scary prospective look at the future of gene research, which might even include - gulp - DNA computers. Old-hat stuff for science geeks, perhaps, but it's all pretty delectable for non-pros. "
269,0316202975,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2613351-linda-robinson,4,"DNA, when unwound, could reach to Pluto and back to Earth again. Kean tries to unwind most of this distance for us, and the journey is a little long. Kean writes like a fan of science, which is good, but releases a tendency to cover every sidebar story genetically connected to our code. We're reminded again of the classroom bully fights that are waged with any research, and the childish grip of some scientists on pet theories, and personal endeavor. I wonder where we would be if this sniping was replaced by cooperation in laboratories and classrooms? Kean gives credit thankfully to the women scientists who are always involved in breakthroughs, but are hidden behind the curtain of history and male science writers. Kudos, Kean! While anecdotes are interesting, too many is like a houseguest that overstays the welcome. The last chapters are the most interesting - if DNA/RNA, genetics and epigenetics are an enormously powerful computing system, when will technology make the leap from circuit boards to proteins? That journey is going on now."
270,0316202975,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5174097-a,1,"I read Sam Kean's other book, The Disappearing Spoon and loved it. This book, The Violinist's Thumb, took forever to come in at the library and I could hardly wait to read it. Well, it's difficult to even tell this is the same author. His other book reads well, is organized and very interesting. This book reads as if the author pulled information from lots of other sources and threw it together. The chapter headings in this book often have very little to do with the chapter material. The material is not the author's but instead he is continuously using other author's works. I felt like I was reading Reader's Digest versions of other books. If you are truly interested in genes, DNA, science then this is not a book you will enjoy.It is very sensationalists. There was one photo in there of an infant...born with a tail. That was just a totally bizarre photo included purely to appeal to ?something? I don't know what, but it was not to appeal to people interested in science. So disappointing. This is just one example of how this book completely lets the reader down. Instead of science and DNA as the focus the author's focus is on evolution. Nothing on the cover or description indicates that this book will be about evolution and DNA. It just was not the same quality of writing or information as his first book. Mr. Kean is obviously a skilled writer but I wish he had put the same effort into this book as the Disappearing Spoon. Wish it had been as good as his other book..."

Can you fathom that pheromones could make you fall in love?The Violinist's Thumb contains chapters on all of these topics - it combines shocking facts with biological premises with the history of DNA discovery. For those who love biology Sam Kean incorporates an inundation of knowledge in this book. His writing never gets too long-winded or lackadaisical; his humor is refreshing but he maintains his ethos with a scholarly tone.However, it took me over two weeks to finish this book just because I couldn't keep an interest in the subject matter. I sped through certain chapters like the one on atavisms, though the passages about well-known scientists and brazen theories bored me. On an entirely objective level perhaps this book deserves a higher rating. But, because I rate subjectively and feel cheated out of the time I could've used to read other books, The Violinist's Thumb gets a three.Recommended for anyone who enjoys biology or wants a relatively easy introduction to the subject. I used a chapter of this book for my AP Biology project and impressed my teacher, showing that The Violinist's Thumb is accessible to a wide variety of ages and knowledge levels.*review cross-posted on my blog, the quiet voice."

At first his slightly oddball humour and focus on the personal dramas of his subject's put me off. Then I realised that between the one-liners and gossip-columnesque recounting of scientist's lives was a mass of hard information. Complex information that typically the most bright struggle with, passed out in the easiest to understand genetics I've encountered.By recounting the history of the subject, through the personal and professional lives of the scientists in the field Kean informs, entertains and debates a topic that we should all be interested in.Kean manages to do all this while retaining a human touch to his work. Studying genetics, DNA, and such tends to freak people out. But, it is hard to imagine anyone reacting to this book with squeamishness.Highly recommended to anyone with any interest in people, biology, evolution, behaviour, well anyone with interests really."
273,0316202975,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1069092-brad,3,"Another fun Sam Kean book. Like his earlier book The Disappearing Spoon that tackled the periodic table, Kean explores DNA and genetics in his latest with a fun and lighthearted approach. The science here is targeted heavily toward the layperson and he does a fine job introducing genetics to the unfamiliar. And he had some really great stories: the guy who was victim to BOTH Hiroshima and Nagasaki; the vicious rivalries of the Human Genome Project. Also like the Disappearing Spoon his silliness has a tendency to get old and I found myself rolling my eyes on more than one occasion. But, to be fair, the book really wasn’t written for the likes of me; people who deal with this crap for a living. Instead, I think it will become one of my recommended reads to my freshman and sophomore undergrads when we talk us some Mendel. Fun and quick with some great stories. And you might learn a little science, too. . . "
274,0316202975,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3286826-aaronb,4,"I read this as a follow up to the Disappearing Spoon. It deals with DNA and genes, and I liked the way he delves into history and links it to scientific breakthroughs. The pieces on homosexuality and genetics were quite interesting, as was the (mostly unfulfilled) page-turning chase to complete the Human Genome Project by the two duelling factions of scientists. It brings to mind IBM's practice of throwing two project teams on a software problem ""if you want to get the work done really quickly"".The Hapsburg part about incest and the genetic problems it made visible by studying court artists' pictures of them was remarkable. Seam Kean has helped a wider audience to understand, esp. with regard to cloning, that your genes do not determine you, but are only one piece of a larger puzzle to understand our background and what makes us tick."
275,0316202975,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7318623-catbookmom,2,"Started this as a break from a series I'm deeply involved in reading, and found myself thinking about the video explaining dinosaur DNA that is part of the **Jurassic Park** movie. Some of this seems like very dumbed-down science and other parts are very detailed. I found myself skipping around, and certainly my eyes glazed over in some places, where the tech-speak was just too much to absorb. Some of the information about the huge advances in DNA research and analysis is just mind-boggling, things like the cost of a DNA analysis dropping from millions of dollars to almost pocket-change. "
276,0316202975,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3440334-fred-forbes,5,"Flip a coin one thousand times and you will get heads about half the time, tails the other half. That is probably the way most authors would express the thought. Sam Kean writes ""If you flip a dime a thousand times, you'll get approximately five hundred FDRs and 500 torches ..."" It is that type of clever, accessible writing that makes Kean such a joy to read. Make no mistake, the study of DNA and genetics can be challenging but when it is presented as he does, integrating it well into science, history and art it is much more a pleasure than a slog. Recommended to anyone with a bit of curious intellect - a pleasurable way to learn."
277,0316202975,http://goodreads.com/user/show/12541461-betseak,4,"'The Violinist's Thumb' is an excellent overview of the history of DNA and genetics research. As I read the book in its audio version, the scientific parts were somewhat difficult to follow. Nevertheless, they were pretty well illuminated and made accessible through numerous entertaining stories, some of which a bit creepy, like the one about the attempts to make 'humanzees' (a human-chimpanzee cross-breed), yet others…hmm… a bit gossipy, let's say, but in a good, enlightening way. Recommended."
278,0316202975,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3617921-david-schwan,5,"Fascinating book which covers the history of discoveries surrounding DNA and how DNA works. Many people have been involved in learning how DNA works. Very little coverage of Watson & Crick versus Linus Pauling which has been covered well elsewhere. Lot's of detail regarding the fruit fly experiments, and lot's of other more forgotten but important breakthroughs. "
279,0316202975,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3558741-laney,5,"Fabulous and entertaining read. It's one of those non-fiction books that is written in an approachable, story-based way. HIGHLY recommended for anyone who is interested in the strange idiosyncrasies of DNA and the human genome."
280,0316202975,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1894763-catherine-mustread,4,"From New books Network podcast: ""In The Disappearing Spoon, bestselling author Sam Kean unlocked the mysteries of the periodic table. In The Violinist’s Thumb: And Other Lost Tales of Love, War, and Genius, as Written by Our Genetic Code, he explores the wonders of the magical building block of life: DNA.There are genes to explain crazy cat ladies, why other people have no fingerprints, and why some people survive nuclear bombs. Genes illuminate everything from JFK’s bronze skin (it wasn’t a tan) to Einstein’s genius. They prove that Neanderthals and humans bred thousands of years more recently than any of us would feel comfortable thinking. They can even allow some people, because of the exceptional flexibility of their thumbs and fingers, to become truly singular violinists.Kean’s vibrant storytelling once again makes science entertaining, explaining human history and whimsy while showing how DNA will influence our species’ future."
281,0316202975,http://goodreads.com/user/show/47860635-xandy,4,This author is a new favorite!
282,0316202975,http://goodreads.com/user/show/974110-wendi-lau,5,"Interesting, FUNNY, so riveting, even all the end notes are worth reading. Mr. Kean has such surprising turns of phrase. He is a very good storyteller."
283,0316202975,http://goodreads.com/user/show/54953761-tamara-cassinat,4,"I really enjoy Sam Kean books. This one - since it dealt with biology and DNA, which I know little about, wasn’t as interesting to me as his other book “The Disappearing Spoon” which is about chemistry and the making of the periodic table. Still really cool. Really interesting. Would recommend it. "
284,0316202975,http://goodreads.com/user/show/41735508-noah-goats,4,"Kean writes with humor and humanity, and weaves the science of our genetic code around the interesting stories of real people. The result is a scientific page turner."
285,0316202975,http://goodreads.com/user/show/20022340-jennie-rosenblum,4,"Easy to read, even with all the scientific terminology. Enjoyable side stories of the people behind the science."
286,0316202975,http://goodreads.com/user/show/10132668-trasa,5,"A book that simultaneously manages to teach you about DNA and related subjects while giving really salacious stories about the people involved with the science during the last couple hundred years. Excellent science, research, writing and flow of the book."
287,0316202975,http://goodreads.com/user/show/37650802-kara,4,"Kean is a very talented science writer, and this book is extremely readable — I powered through it in a little more than three days. He takes complex topics, breaks them down, and explains them in a way that everyday readers can understand, no small feat when it comes to genetics. Kean also provides a good balance of anecdotes and transitions easily between stories and science (a switch that I have seen awkwardly and/or abruptly handled in a lot of nonfiction). Usually, genetics isn't a nonfiction subject that I'm compelled to read about, unlike (say) psychology, but I blew through book and found myself wanting to check out some of Kean's sources for more information. This is definitely a book for a generalist audience and not DNA buffs who want to get in the weeds, but seeing as how I am a generalist reader, that was just fine by me."
288,0316202975,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1842160-courtney-williams,5,"The book: The Violinist's ThumbThe author: Sam Kean, American science writer.The subject: An exploration of DNA: the stories of its discovery, how it affects our lives and how it will shape our future.Why I chose it: I've seen it recommended before on one ""good popular science"" list or another. Also, the cover and title.The rating: Five out of five starsWhat I thought of it: I really should have reviewed this book a few weeks ago when I read it... I know I loved it, but can't remember exactly what I wanted to say about it! Anyway, I'll review it as best I can regardless.I am a violinist (and violist) myself and happen to have type D brachydactyly, also known as club thumb. It's a harmless quirk of genetics – much like hitch-hiker's thumb, which I also have on both hands – that has nevertheless been associated with both royals and murderers. I joke with my boyfriend that I'd be the worst X-Man ever and my name would be Thumbs and my superpower would be THUMBS! (And then I wave my thumbs in his face. It's a really funny joke.)

My thumbs. Yes, I put them on Instagram.Sadly, unlike the violinist whose thumbs inspired the title of this book, Niccolò Paganini, my thumbs have not helped me become such an incredible musician that people believe I sold my soul to the Devil. In fact, my hands are quite small in general, which impedes my ability to play and, try as I might, I still can't stop locking my tiny right thumb when holding the bow, rather than bending it gracefully. Despite my genetics betraying me so utterly, in terms of playing the higher string instruments at least, I'm still very interested in the subject itself and the stories behind its development. This book was right up my street.As you can probably tell by the top star rating, I really enjoyed this book, both as a piece of science writing and a generally enjoyable read. I have very little in the way of biology knowledge – I stopped studying it after GCSE Double Science, though I've read a little about it – I found it to be just in-depth enough that I learned things, but didn't feel I was in over my head. As someone who is interested enough in the history of science to be considering doing a masters degree in it, I loved all the stories Kean relates and all the tangents he goes on. The one that most stuck with me was the man who was a survivor of both the Hiroshima and Nagasaki atomic bombings. The endnotes were brilliant too, even if I always hate having to flick back and forth (yes, I'm lazy). I enjoyed the casual language and irreverent humour as well; it could have easily come off as an insincere attempt to be approachable, but it really worked well and felt appropriate.I wouldn't recommend this book to you if you want a gentle and linear introduction to genetics as a science, with background included where necessary. However, if you like science history, learning about scientific personalities and tangents galore, give this a go. I enjoyed it a great deal.Just one more thing: I was incredibly (disproportionately) excited to figure out the ""easter egg"" that Kean hid in his book quite quickly. If you've still not got it, let me know and I can give you a hint ;-)"
289,0316202975,http://goodreads.com/user/show/11516573-delta,3,"This was an interesting read for me. I'm familiar with the science of genetics (although by no means an expert or even a novice), but I feel like this book is written for readers with more expertise or at least a higher level of knowledge of biology. Most of the book is written for the average lay-person, but there are sections that read like a college-level textbook. Overall, I found it interesting, but would probably not recommend unless you are really interested in the subject."
290,0316202975,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1444762-jill,4,"You may recognize the author’s name because of his previous bestselling book about the periodic table, The Disappearing Spoon. In this book, he tackles genetics, doing a fine job in explaining a very complex subject bit by bit, with clever analogies and a good deal of humor.There are loads of interesting tidbits:Of all the survivors of the World War II atomic bombing of Hiroshima and Nagasaki, some 150 were caught near both cities on both days! (Talk about a run of bad luck!)In the 1940’s and 1950’s, many female scientists were nuns, because, as Kean explains, Women at the time usually had to relinquish their careers upon marrying, while unmarried women...provoked suspicion or derision and sometimes earned such low pay they couldn’t make ends meet.”Humans share about 99% of our DNA with chimpanzees, making them our closest living relatives. But male chimps have something humans don’t: little bumps called spines on their penises. According to Kean, “this loss decreases male sensation during sex and thereby prolongs copulation, which scientists suspect helps humans pair-bond and stay monogamous.”Who knew?Kean explains why Arctic explorers can risk death by eating the liver of polar bears, or why some people who have one cat start getting more cats. He also talks about the phenomenon of epigenetics: how genes can, in fact, be influenced by the environment, with the effects actually passed on to progeny, much as theorized by the discredited Jean-Baptiste Lamarck. He even explains how why the beliefs of some religions couldn’t possibly be true: the genetic evidence tells a different story.Evaluation: This book is full of fascinating anecdotes, as well as a lot of science, which you can actually just scan if you prefer, without it detracting from the general thrust of the book. One big criticism: When I read a nonfiction book, I depend heavily on the index to help me refer back to ideas I just read 20 minutes ago but forgot already. The index in this book is extremely inadequate. Want to look up that bit about cats, for example? Well, you won’t find anything under “cat” or “feline”: unless you remember that the organism which is the culprit is called Toxoplasma gondii, you’re out of luck!Otherwise, it was a very entertaining read; once again Kean has succeeded in making science fun, which is absolutely a good thing!Rating: 3.5/5"
291,0316202975,http://goodreads.com/user/show/10762842-nicole-r,5,"I binged on new release contemporary fiction lately and, while it led me to many great books, it left me craving something nonfiction. Leah K's review earlier this month of The Violinist's Thumb made my decision of what to read to balance my “book diet” a no brainer.DNA. Amino acids. Genes. I likely lost most of you after “DNA”. DNA is the basis of all life. Just FOUR MEASLY “LETTERS” account for all of the diversity IN THE ENTIRE WORLD. Seriously. Mind blowing. But how much do we really know about the blueprint for life? I have a PhD in biology so I likely know more than the average Joe Schmo but I have just barely covered the tip of the iceberg.Sam Kean brilliantly escorts us through the just-deeper-than-the-basics of DNA. He explains: 	 • the physical structure of DNA and how this translates into amino acids and genes; 	 • how one species becomes two (or three or four or….) through different pressures on DNA; 	 • the evolution of human genes and how we have morphed from primate to Neanderthal to Homo sapiens but still have 99% the same DNA as the person sitting next to us, down the hall, or in Siberia; and 	 • what can (or can’t) genes teach us.Mr. Kean uses interesting stories, mini-bios of famous scientists, and humor to draw the reader in, make complicated concepts understandable, and – most importantly – entertain us. I learned a lot about the idiosyncrasies of names I hear all the time like Darwin, Watson and Crick, Mendel, and others. For example, I had NO IDEA that Darwin was actually an extremely sickly man following the Voyage of the Beagle and may have had a genetic predilection for his symptoms!Other fun facts: Tsutomu Yamaguchi is the only officially recognized person by the Japanese government to have survived both the Hiroshima AND Nagasaki bombings….and, then he lived to be 93 years old! There is a theory that the Toba supervolcanic eruption roughly 75,000 years ago is responsible for the near-extinction of humans, the genetic bottleneck that followed, and why humans are so genetically similar today. And, there is a similar supervolcano just building up steam under Wyoming!Seriously, this book was phenomenal. It was simple and clear enough that everyone could learn something but had enough interesting sidebars that even those well-versed in genetics would likely learn something new. Mr. Kean, you have a new fan and I plan on reading the Disappearing Spoon very soon!"
292,0316202975,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3837733-joan,5,"This was absolutely fascinating! The author writes in a very approachable manner, so that you can understand fairly complicated stuff without needing a scholarly biology background. He also does this with no hint of writing down to anyone. He gleefully shows how very human the scientists who study DNA and genetics are, as well as how human are their subjects, many of whom have genetic based diseases. He finishes with a cautionary note. He reminds his audience that DNA only works in probabilities, not in possibilities. In other words, the first time he had his genome sequenced, he told them he wanted no information on whether he is going to get Parkinson's or not. After reading and absorbing the information, he realized he was being silly. Potential is not necessarily doom. He got online and clicked to remove the note against getting that information. Hurray, he isn't going to get Parkinson's! Later, an update on what the information means came and he checked. Oops. He does have a potential to get Parkinson's. It didn't worry him the way it did when he started studying this field. He checked and found out he has a 20% increased chance of getting Parkinson''s. He can now realize that is fairly low percentage. BTW in case you are wondering, but don't want to read the book to find out, the violinist's thumb in the title, refers to Pagannini. He possibly had a genetic condition where his joints, including that thumb, were amazingly flexible.However, that same condition that made him possibly the greatest violinist of all time, also gave him great misery and likely an early death. He introduced the concept of epigenetics which was a new concept to me and apparently one of the really complicating factors in studying DNA. If you have any interest in genetics or the history of science, this is a must read! I'm really grateful to Rebecca for recommending this book and have checked out another book by this author. Expect a review on that book in several months!"
293,0316202975,http://goodreads.com/user/show/73003404-daniel,4,"I read this book due to my love of The Disappearing Spoon: And Other True Tales of Madness, Love, and the History of the World from the Periodic Table of the Elements, of which this is a spiritual sequel (review here - pretty much all of which applies), but while I enjoyed it, I did not find it to be as magical as the original, despite the nearly identical writing style and structure. The Violinist's Thumb was narrated differently for audiobook than The Disappearing Spoon, and I did consume portions of it via e-reader, but I don't think those discrepancies are responsible for my less-gushing enthusiasm.Instead, I think this is entirely down to subject matter. First, I think the physics and chemistry that formed the core of The Disappearing Spoon was likely more comfortable for the author, a former Physics student, than the biology at the heart of The Violinist's Thumb - a view reinforced by the former's earlier publication. Second, while there is a lot of ""unknown"" in physics and chemistry, our current understanding can explain a great deal of interesting real-world phenomena, whereas genetics seems to have a much more ambiguous causal relationship, which is harder to latch on to. Most importantly, though, I think I'm personally just less interested in genetics than I was in the material in The Disappearing Spoon. This book is still excellent though, like its predecessor, and anyone interested in heredity should definitely pick it up."
294,0316202975,http://goodreads.com/user/show/9958121-nicole,4,"I missed about a decade of, oh, everything going on in the world, due to childrearing and family responsibilities and constraints, so I pretty much had only the vaguest idea that the Human Genome Project was happening. This book is a great starting place for someone who knows only a little history of science and pretty much nothing about genetics.The cutesy language that other reviewers have found irksome delighted me. Sometimes his language, his references, are quite clever. I had to look up quite a few words, and I'm not talking about the scientific terms. Last night my son asked, ""How is it that every time you open that book you start laughing?"" The anecdotes and funny references (i.e. Roald Dahl and the Maginot Line) give the non-scientist hooks to hang a lot of technical information on, information that I would not have retained otherwise. Although I understand that he is writing for the average reader, not the scientist, I shared another reviewer's frustrations about citations. He often says something along the lines of ""one scientist commented that 'blah blah blah'"" but we never get to know who that person was. The endnotes were full of delicious little facts, and a few sources were cited or recommended there, but certainly a more detailed list of references would have been appropriate, and not distracting (if that was the concern) to the non-scientist, if tucked away at the end of the book. A cast of characters list would also have been helpful. That said, good starting place, clever and engaging. "
295,0316202975,http://goodreads.com/user/show/264570-bonnie,2,"I deserve a medal for not only making it through this complete obfuscation of a book, but presenting it at book club as well. Sentence after sentence and paragraph after paragraph refuting what the author's goal was for the book (if indeed I even understood that). Paragraphs with evidence based verbiage while including words like perhaps, somehow, but then refuted. I don't even have the energy to write a review on it.I'm glad I read it. I did learn something--just don't ask me what. I will add that the author lost his credence many times, but none more so than with this gem of inaccurate and untruthful reporting found in the notes in the back of the book: ""Mormons have traditionally believed--ever since Joseph Smith, just fourteen years old, copied down Jehovah's very words in 1820. . . ."" Joseph Smith was not 14 years old when he began translation of the Book of Mormon; using the word ""copying"" is an untruth, and Jehovah's very words are in the Book of Mormon, but only chapters 11-28 of 3rd Nephi (one of 15 or so books that make up the Book of Mormon). The rest is a history of two different people that left Jerusalem at two different times. I'd gotten to page 241 in this book before I found this cowardly note tucked into the back of the book. And if the author were off that much on this very small and insignificant portion of the book, one can only ask how much else irresponsible reporting of purported facts did he do?"
296,0316202975,http://goodreads.com/user/show/16013276-melissa-meinhard,3,"Overall this was a very interesting book but I had some major problems with the author's choice of language. He tried to make this more of an ""everyman's"" book instead of a straight science book and lost something in the compromise. In order to make the book seem more poetic he takes liberties with the science. The problems I had were when he was talking about the animals in the book; he often used the words ""monkeys"" and ""apes"" interchangeably as well as others like ""rats"" and ""mice"". I can see he was trying to not use the same words over and over again, and thought that some variety would make the book more enjoyable. For someone who is not a scientist, this would most likely go unnoticed. But if you are writing a book in order to educate people on something, they deserve to be given the correct information. I was so frustrated at some points that I had to put the book down and come back to it when i wasn't so annoyed.The thing that I enjoyed the most about this book was the acrostic that was challenged in the beginning of the book. If you can figure it out, the author wants you to email him your answer. A friend and I worked on it and got it all correct except for the final letter. That was the most fun I had had with a book in awhile. So it gets 3 stars--I liked it. Negative points for the abuse of science, but positive points for the fun and difficult acrostic."
297,0316202975,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2600140-rebecca,3,"The author writes about DNA from its discovery to how scientists learned to interpret it and interpret genes, infighting among scientists working to map the genome, ethical issues, etc. He illuminates the information with lots of fascinating anecdotes and stories of people and places affected by some aberration in DNA/genes in ways we wouldn't suspect.I'll admit that even in this work aimed at the general public, some of the science was above my head, and I yawned my way through the technical details. I got a lot more out of the examples and stories, such as why you should never eat polar bear liver. The author does a good job of choosing interesting happenings to explore in terms of genetics, and I did finally understand how genes could be mapped (well, sort of). The book was kind of a long slog, so I would only recommend it to those with a strong interest in science, and particularly DNA/genes.[As a side note, I forgot that I read this and picked it up again as an audiobook, and gave up pretty early on because I couldn't keep the thread of it in my head. Plus I thought the horrific details of Hiroshima and Nagasaki were unnecessary. They did cause gene damage and mutation, which is necessary to the subject of the book, but the gruesome descriptions of injuries felt gratuitous.]"
298,0316202975,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3486418-scott-collins,4,"Entertaining, balanced and nicely written romp through the history of genetics, filled with fascinating characters such as Ilya Ivanov, the Russian scientist who tried to breed humanzees by impregnating chimps with human sperm (and vice versa, which almost happened until African officials thought better of offering up their women for such an experiment). Some of the science can be a little befuddling without a firm rooting in biology (time to bone up those DNA bases from Life Science 101!), but every chapter contains connections and stories that the non-scientists among us (and maybe some scientists too?) have never heard before. Could Toulouse-Lautrec's heredity have influenced his art? Oh, yes, it could have. Kean has the story, and it's a beaut. Is Humane Genome guru Craig Venter an egomaniacal jerk? Um, maybe - but his story is probably more important to our times than that of, say, the past few presidential campaigns or even global warming, to cite some events that get much more daily attention. The book even ends with an intriguing and slightly scary prospective look at the future of gene research, which might even include - gulp - DNA computers. Old-hat stuff for science geeks, perhaps, but it's all pretty delectable for non-pros. "
299,0316202975,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2613351-linda-robinson,4,"DNA, when unwound, could reach to Pluto and back to Earth again. Kean tries to unwind most of this distance for us, and the journey is a little long. Kean writes like a fan of science, which is good, but releases a tendency to cover every sidebar story genetically connected to our code. We're reminded again of the classroom bully fights that are waged with any research, and the childish grip of some scientists on pet theories, and personal endeavor. I wonder where we would be if this sniping was replaced by cooperation in laboratories and classrooms? Kean gives credit thankfully to the women scientists who are always involved in breakthroughs, but are hidden behind the curtain of history and male science writers. Kudos, Kean! While anecdotes are interesting, too many is like a houseguest that overstays the welcome. The last chapters are the most interesting - if DNA/RNA, genetics and epigenetics are an enormously powerful computing system, when will technology make the leap from circuit boards to proteins? That journey is going on now."
