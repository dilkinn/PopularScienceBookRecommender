0,141659907X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5293536-melki,4,"Coffee is bad for you.No, now they're saying it's good for you.Well, how can avocados be good for you? They're full of fat.Yes, but it's the good kind of fat.There's a good kind of fat?AAAAaAAAAAaaaaaAAA!!!You can drive yourself nuts trying to figure out what is good for you and what is unhealthy. (Last time I checked, being nuts was definitely UNhealthy.)Luckily, A.J. Jacobs is around to investigate, using his own body as his guinea pig, and give you the skinny on being healthy. (And, yes, being skinny is usually healthier, dammit!) He tries fad diets, exercise crazes and CPAP machines so you don't have to waste your time and money on things that don't work. Only...some things work for some people and not for others. And some things work if you believe they work. So, there are no real answers here, other than move more, eat less. But, if you're looking for a fun, occasionally educational time, read this book. (Hopefully while you're walking on a treadmill.)As usual, the best parts of Jacobs' books are the really wacky, yet undeniably true facts he manages to unearth, like:-- You have more germs in your gut right now than humans that ever lived on earth.-- Graham crackers were invented to quell the passions in hormonal adolescent boys.--If you spend lots of time reading on the toilet, better order a case of Preparation H now; prolonged sitting whilst shitting causes hemorrhoids.--THIS irresistible quote by a renowned urologist: ""The penis is the dipstick of the body's health.""--And, did you know that musical conductors live such long lives because they spend so much time flapping their arms about?That last one impressed me so much, I've made an attempt to move my arms a bit more wherever I go. Yes, I look like a crazy person. Yes, people are laughing at me. All I can say is, laugh now. I'll be that old, old lady at your funeral, wildly swinging her arms as she laughs and laughs."
1,141659907X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7752067-lacie,4,"Now, this is a writer with whom I can sit down and drink organic smoothies. I consider myself a bit of a closet health nut -- I say closet health nut, because you might not be able to tell by the size of my thighs that I am much of a health nut at all. But A.J.'s humble quest to become the strongest, most virile hunk of masculine flesh alive is one that I'd empathize with. At the very least, I can read his book and feel justified in his inevitable conclusion that THIS is the reason why one shouldn't knock oneself out trying to pursue the epitome of good health; my excuse is moderation and unavoidable mortality.When I wasn't laughing to the point of tears, I did mentally underline some doable gems from his breadth of research:1. Mindfulness is key to enjoying a smaller plate of food.2. Look for every opportunity to move. (I am the nut who keeps hand weights in the car for long commutes.)3. Take the time to take a break. Truly value things like sleep and silence.4. Some of us do get lightheaded, weak, and gassy on a vegan/vegetarian diet. (This had been my experience as well, so I laughed a little at discovering that I wasn't the only one.) His diet wasn't totally carnivorous, so much as light on empty carbs and more substantial on fruits and vegetables.5. Short triatholons do exist! I will have to do one of them sometime.6. Training the brain might be something to look into.Sadly, after reading, I never got around to actually going to the gym (time constraints, as usual), but I did honor my favorite chapter -- calorie reduction and mindfulness -- by eating one cheeto at a time, mentally envisioning the taste of each and carefully chewing 20+ times before swallowing. It's not the epitome of health, per se, but someone's got to start somewhere."
2,141659907X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/11004626-gwern,3,"Another entry in the Jacobs formula: he'll breeze through a large number of activities, giving very superficial descriptions & background, making wisecracks, and recording his wife's reaction to everything.The problem with this one is that ultimately, all his health interventions are lame. Tim Ferris may be a huckster, but at least in 4 Hour Body, he put himself out on the edge and wrote about interesting things which might make real differences if they panned out; while Jacobs recycles crunchy granola nonsense and works his way through a bunch of boring and tired interventions and foods, many of which could never make any large difference in his health or longevity even if true.†He has no ambition or bravery at all: I was disappointed that he was scared off by caloric restriction and wouldn't even give intermittent fasting a try (despite alternate-day fasting being probably the simplest diet ever), and when he finally does try something a little more drastic like Clomid for testosterone deficiency he seems to abandon it as fast as he possibly can despite admitting that it seemed to be more effective than pretty much anything else. This is a general trend with everything he reports back on: he drops them as fast as possible, without giving them a fair shake.I mean, I don't believe that, say, fruit juice fasts work but if Jacobs is going to try then, couldn't he at least stick it out more than 3 days? I felt he was wasting both his and my time. (That said, I am amused to find out just how many eccentric exercise classes apparently can be found in Central Park over the course of a year.) Chapter 19 was on sleep, a subject near and dear to my own self-experimenting heart, so I had great expectations, and was disappointed to see that it boiled down to 'get a CPAP for snoring' and apparently using his brand-new Zeo less than week. Or on the topic of driving and walking helmets, whose net benefit I found myself uncertain of after reviewing some of the research literature, he brings them up but dismisses as impossible, not because they don't seem worthwhile, but because they would be too embarrassing - Jacobs, seriously, are you a man or a mouse? (The only things he seems to really stick with is his treadmill desk - well, fair enough for a writer - and, weirdly given his terror of embarrassment, noise-canceling headphones. As if the photos of the headphones didn't make him look like he was autistic...?) Some gaps just struck me as odd: why would a germaphobe look into squat toilets and wash his hands excessively, but omit any consideration of bidets which could remove most of the reason one would need to wash hands?Perhaps unsurprisingly, I reached the final chapter and was distinctly unimpressed what his two years of effort had wrought:I went for my final exam at EHE and found out I’d lost another half pound, ending at 156.5 (total weight loss: 16 pounds). I’d gone down two belt sizes. Dr. Harry Fisch told me that my lipid panel numbers “are so good, they’ll give you a heart attack” (HDL: 48, LDL: 62). I more than halved my body fat percentage. I can now run a mile in less than seven minutes as opposed to not at all. I have a visible chest.One might think that such results, while laudable, did not require 2 years and probably were entirely due his eating less and spending some time weightlifting and running.The evaluation of research is also weak. Jacobs promises in the intro to draw as much on the Cochrane Collaboration as possible (fantastic!) but if he did so in the rest of the book, I must've missed it (boo, hiss). And while it's a tired, sometimes overused truism in my parts of the Internet that 'correlation is not causation', Jacobs is one of the people for whom that dictum was meant.Aside from the main storyline of the latest health fad, Jacobs counterpoints the slow death from old age & dementia of his grandfather and the unexpected death of his eccentric orthorexic aunt. These are good reminders of the horrors of aging but while well intentioned, Jacobs, superficial and middle-class humorously as ever, is unable to bring out the tragedy of the material anywhere near as well as, say, Still Alice, Do No Harm, or even blog posts like ""Who By Very Slow Decay"".So what's good? Well, Jacobs is intermittently funny. He does go through a wide range of interventions, which is mildly interesting, and if nothing else, makes the point that there are a lot of hucksters and idiots and people fooled by randomness out there, and that there is no nostrum that will not put someone on cloud nine nor silver bullet so silly that it will not sooth someone's sickness. For me, it functioned as reminders (the accident chapter reminded me that after a slip in my bathroom, I had meant to buy anti-slip pads, which I've put on my shopping list; his treadmill usage has inspired me to clean off my own treadmill desk and at least use it while watching movies or playing games; I had heard of the potential benefits of squat toilets but until reading the FAQ by the guy selling them I had not realized that it was possible to retrofit regular Western toilets to be squat toilets, so I may grab some cinder blocks & plywood and give it a try; and his own conspicuous failure to try out IF makes me feel more motivated to give it a try myself soon, especially now that I've got daily blood glucose measurements debugged). So it wasn't all bad.† To elaborate on this one point: we don't have hard precise evidence on most of the claims covered in the book, but for a lot of them we can give upper bounds on maximum possible benefits. For starters, lifespan is in humans, as it is in other species, partially heritable, so about a quarter of variability is off the table from the getgo. And no one has ever lived longer than Jeanne Calment's 122 years while life expectancy for Jacobs is ~80 (above-average since he's an employed well-educated white man with good family longevity), so he couldn't expect more than 40 years for anything that past humans have tried. Similarly, because of the exponential increase in death risk with age, the value of preventing any given disease in old age is not as high as it may seem, since if you prevent a heart attack, they may just die of a stroke or Alzheimer's instead, which sharply limits how valuable any particular intervention could be. So for example, if you could prevent cancer in its entirety, I've seen estimates that this might add a grand total of 10 years to average life expectancy, which is much less than one would expect; Jacobs quotes one person as noting there's something like 50k industrial chemicals out there; so if all cancers were caused by a modern industrial chemical, and you could eliminate each chemical completely for free at the cost of a day's research or work or income, then doing so would be... a huge net loss since 50,000 days >> 10 years (3,652 days). Not to mention that adult life expectancies have kept increasing hand in hand with the proliferation of industrial chemicals, suggesting that all of them together can explain only a fraction of variance. If you spend a day worrying about Bisphenol, you'd better have good reasons for thinking it's very likely to be harmful, because the prior probability is low, the harm is likely fairly minimal, you can't do much about it, and what you can do is expensive."
3,141659907X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/12102894-peter,5,"After this book I rate AJ Jacobs as one of my favourite authors. The book contains enough facts to make it a credible read. However, it is his OCD that adds the humour to his readers (but not necessary to his long suffering family). Well worth a read."
4,141659907X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7315643-megan-rowe,4,"Reading this book made me realize how paranoid I really am, because, as I was reading it, the author kept talking about how much he was freaking out his family members with the drastic things he was doing, and I just kept thinking ""Well, that's reasonable."" In fact, the book might have made me MORE paranoid for a little while, just because I realized all of the things that I hadn't considered. Unlike Jacobs, I do read The Cat in the Hat to my son, but I do think the Cat could make a pretty infamous crime team with the Kool Aid Man, and I'm sure Jacobs would have something to say about sugaring children's water. In the end, he came to the conclusion that moderation was best, and he made it very easy for the reader to arrive there with him. I found his book very funny and well-written, and I'm sure I will pick up some of his previous books at some point.I just wanted to add that there were a couple times that this book almost made me cry, and it was unexpected--you don't realize how attached to these people you become--and I thought that it was surprising, and a reflection on how subtle and effective of a storyteller Jacobs is."
5,141659907X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/220791-lena,3,"This book is the latest stunt memoir by AJ Jacobs, the man who previously worked on his mind by reading the encyclopedia and his spirit by living according to the Bible. Now it's time for the body, and Jacobs spent two years focusing on how to be healthier in all areas from his teeth to his toes.When it comes to matters of health, everyone has an opinion, and they usually contradict each other. Jacobs does a decent job of providing a balanced look at many of his subjects, including whatever actual science may or may not be behind them, through such moments as letting his toxin-obsessed Aunt Marti banish his plastic shower curtain and conventional cleaning products while interviewing a medical professional who argues that our robust livers are more than up to the task of dealing with the hazards modern living throws at us.Though the subject of health can be a serious one, the tone of this book is generally breezy and amusing, with a couple of (supposedly good for you) laugh out loud moments thrown in. It's also interesting to see the results of Jacobs' experiments on himself; though personal anecdote is an unreliable way of determining the overall effectiveness of a particular intervention, it's the one that matters the most to us individually and the only tool we have to evaluate some of the more outlandish ideas presented.I did enjoy this book and might have given it four stars if I wasn't already familiar with most of the information covered. If I were someone who hadn't already spent a lot of time researching health, however, I would have found this a very accessible and inspiring guide to making positive health changes."

7,141659907X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/12490048-mediaman,2,"A.J. Jacobs is getting tired and flabby--and I'm talking about his book writing, not his physical condition. He has done the same gimmick for a number of books now, where he transforms his life by giving his all to a specific subject, and it's just not that interesting any more. It lacks creativity and proves him to be somewhat dim-witted.In this case he tries to follow all the advice books, diets and research on health. The problem is that there are thousands to choose from and many of them are contradictory. So he focuses on some of the weird ones, like the guys who live like cavemen and think we should hunt meat and eat it raw. Instead of this coming across like an intelligent study of the subject, it seems like one big joke.His writing style is very self-centered and that gets dull fast. He's just not that interesting of a person and while he's self-deprecating he also is very unaware of how disgusting or insulting he can be. His subtle put-downs of his wife, family and friends isn't funny.So if you've read his other books this one isn't much different and certainly is far from the best. If this is your first exposure to Jacobs you may find it somewhat interesting but it's overdone and not the taut review of the subject that it could be. What would make an interesting magazine article makes for a very boring book. "
8,141659907X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/477874-heather,4,"For ""The Know-It-All,"" A.J. Jacobs read the entire Encyclopedia Britannica. For ""The Year of Living Biblically,"" he attempted to follow every rule in the Bible for a year. For ""The Guinea Pig Diaries,"" he did a whole bunch of crazy stuff, including practice Radical Honesty and attend the Academy Awards disguised as a movie star. Now, in ""Drop Dead Healthy,"" he chronicles his latest endeavor: trying to become the healthiest person alive. Basically, this means doing a ton of research and meeting with lots of experts, then trying all the different things that are supposed to make human beings more healthy. Jacobs focuses on different parts of the body--the heart, the lungs, the stomach, the skin, etc--for a month each and writes about what did and didn't get results. And, of course, drives his poor wife, Julie, crazy during the whole thing. I have enjoyed all of A.J. Jacobs' books--in fact, I like his style so much that I originally subscribed to Esquire magazine just to read more of his writing between books. I like experimental journalism in general, but I especially appreciate the goofy but thoughtful approach Jacobs uses. Obviously my expectations for ""Drop Dead Healthy"" were high, and I was not disappointed. As usual, Jacobs really did his research and covered angles that I hadn't even thought of. It did seem a bit overwhelming in some places; perhaps it would have been less staggering if he'd chosen a more narrow focus for the project. There's just so much information out there and so many experts who contradict each other, so maybe Jacobs bit off more than he could chew. Still, I actually learned quite a bit. Sure, there's plenty of stuff that we've all heard before--always eat breakfast, move as much as possible, and just suck it up and floss, for goodness' sake--but he weeds out some things that don't work and comes up with some good tips for actually doing some of the things the experts recommend. And I was cracking up through the whole thing. Jacobs isn't afraid to make fun of himself, and there are certainly plenty of opportunities to do so in a book about trying to be more healthy (think feeling wimpy next to the muscleheads at the gym and trying poop without sitting down). The best thing about this book, however, is that it made me much more aware of my health and how I treat myself. It sort of gave me a wake up call about how much better I'll feel if I do a few small things for my health, and it definitely motivated me to eat more fresh, local foods; get more sleep; move more throughout the day; and more. ""Drop Dead Healthy"" is a book I'd recommend for anyone who feels like they need a boost in inspiration and wants to have some fun along the way."
9,141659907X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/931082-arminius,5,"After listening to A.J. Jacobs talking about his book “Drop Dead Healthy” on the Doctor’s show on Sirius radio I thought to myself I need to read this. Mr. Jacobs tries many different fitness exercises and nutritional trends attempting to find out what works and what doesn’t. I like how he systematically looks at each part of the body and then seeks the corresponding expert to tell him how to make it better. I do not think he adds a significant amount of unfamiliar information about fitness however. What I took from this book is that any type of exercise as long as you work up a sweat is good. Also, you should attempt to incorporate movement in your life. Sitting is unhealthy so try and avoid it as much as you can. Walk or ride a bike to go places when you can. Walk the stairs instead of the elevator. This information isn’t new but it is accentuated in this book.One of the more interesting theories he discovers is the Placebo effect power. It was recommended to him to see an acupuncturist to cure his shoulder pain. The acupuncturist used just three needles and his pain was relieved. He told this to his trainer. The trainer informed Mr Jacobs that he gets needles all over his body when he goes to acupuncture. Mr Jacobs concluded that because he thought that the acupuncture would work is what made it work. He also found out that the Placebo effect works better the more outrageous the cure seems to be. Other statements presented are fairly good advice, if they work. For example, proper posture improves your health. Also sunlight appears to help your eyes. In addition, the hands seem to be connected to the brain. Hand stretching then may help brain function. The book solidifies current exercise and nutrition information and brings light to some other information in an entertaining, and sometimes funny, way. "
10,141659907X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1999603-elliot-ratzman,4,"Oh, AJ Jacobs—how I love reading your books! Let me consider the ways. First, they are chock-full of interesting facts, studies and expert opinion. In this one, he consults health professionals, eccentrics and innovative (or quack) practitioners that help him explore the world of the body, its enemies and its allies—from creating a treadmill desk, working out like a caveman to exploring raw food diets. Second, Jacobs is clever and laugh-out-loud funny. His intelligence and self-deprecation always amuse me and put me in a great mood. Third, his wife Julie is the perfect character in all of his books—sarcastic, droll, eye-rolling and hilarious. They make an excellent team. Fourth, he respects all of his subjects, showing them in their all-too-human light without condescending. Finally, we get to follow Jacobs undergoing his experiment; here, getting into shape, eating better, and figuring out how to live an alternative lifestyle while staying true to his family. May a thousand AJs bloom!"
11,141659907X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/57901-jerzy,4,"As with Jacobs' other books, there is a breadth of laughs and aha moments, and less so on the depth. You won't learn the full ins and outs of every health fad, but it's good entertainment, and at least this book comes with appendices summarizing the health tips he really thought were worth keeping.The sections with his grandfather are touching, and Jacobs' sons are friggin' adorable. Their logic puzzles are great:The trick is, instead of offering three or four items, Lucas gives only two options. He'll ask me, ""Which one of these doesn't belong: the chair or the tomato?"" ""Chair?"" I'll say. ""No, tomato."" It's more challenging than a Zen koan.Also, Nike's ""Just Do It!"" slogan came from the final words of a murderer about to be exectured. I can't find it quite as motivating anymore.I still need to watch the Steven Pinker talk on cursing that he mentions: maybe this one?The tips I really liked:* portion control through smaller plates, more chewing, putting down the fork between bites, and eating an apple 15 minutes before a meal* make healthy food more appetizing by making it crunchy (i.e. put sunflower seeds on salads); and start the day with protein, not carbs* treadmill desks not only help you lose weight but can make you more productive and clear-minded once you get used to one* rubbing your own shoulders reduces levels of cortisol (stress-related hormone)* reading on the toilet (and generally sitting there a long time) causes swelling of veins in certain places where you do not want swelling* after brushing and flossing, the next best tooth-care tip is to chew sugar-free gum after meals* it's possible to sharpen your sense of smell, for example by trying to identify the bottles in your spice rack without looking (I'd love to try this!)* scents can be relaxing but, despite aromatherapy's generalizations, it's very personal for everyone and often linked to memories; find a smell that relaxes you and carry it around (Jacobs carries around a little almond oil vial)"
12,141659907X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1358516-crystal,5,"Entertaining Brysonesque read. Originally, I wrote that this ""isn't a book that you read to learn a lot about being healthy. It's not loaded with facts and studies but is nonetheless informative and reminds you to consider that there are many facets to healthful living despite how narrowly we focus on diet and exercise."" However, as I read through my highlighted passages, it is in fact loaded with important facts. It's written in a light Bryson, humorous style that doesn't make it feel like a weighty non-fiction book. I've been so time-pressed lately it's a struggle to find time to finish a book, but this one was worthy of any free minute I could find. To succinctly summarize the book, Jacobs addresses all aspects of our health, as stated at the start of the book, ""Our well-being is an accumulation of hundreds of little choices we make every day—what to eat, drink, breathe, wear, think, say, watch, lift, and smear on our skin."" Jacobs also shares personal stories that remind us that no matter what we do, unfortunately, we're still mortal. These and many details from the book will stay with me a long time.Following are some of my favorite passages. Stop reading now if you want to discover all these wonderful facts yourself.But the more I read, the more I realize an unfortunate truth: Sitting and staring at screens all day is bad for you. Really bad, like smoking-unfiltered-menthols-while-eating-cheese-coated-lard-and-screaming-at-your-spouse bad. Michelle Obama is right. We need to move. Chairs are the enemy. Sitting puts you at risk for heart disease, diabetes, obesity, and some types of cancer, including colon and ovarian.One option is Lasik surgery, which I’m still mulling. But I recently met one of the inventors of the Lasik technology, and guess what? He still wears glasses. He’s wary of taking the risk. That gave me pause.Senses, Diane Ackerman writes about how Cézanne’s fuzzy still lifes and landscapes might be partly the result of his poor vision. (His doctor commanded him to wear spectacles, but apparently Cézanne refused, calling them vulgar.) Degas had even more optical woes. He was both nearsighted and extremely sensitive to light, one of the reasons he might have preferred indoor scenes to landscapes. If Degas’s eyes had been stronger, we might have been looking at banal sunsets instead of his wonderful ballerinas.I moved my bedtime from 1 a.m. to 11:30 p.m. It was an act of trust. I had to trust my future self that he would be more efficient tomorrow if I went to sleep now. I had to convince myself that sending postmidnight e-mails was counterproductive. Turns out I didn’t trust myself too well. Most nights I was still up at 12:30 a.m.A survey by the National Association of Home Builders says 60 percent of custom houses will have dual master bedrooms by 2015.About Jack Lalane: “People thought I was a charlatan and a nut,” he said. “The doctors were against me. They said working out with weights would give people heart attacks and they’d lose their sex drive.” He started out as a junk-food addict but had his Road-to-Damascus moment when he was fifteen and attended a health lecture. His diet from then on consisted of raw fruits, vegetables, fish, oatmeal, and egg whites—come to think of it, pretty much my diet.The no-sugar diet is ridiculously hard to sustain, and sustain it I won’t. But just two weeks of sugar fasting improved how I felt. I had more energy, fewer aches and pains, and better workouts. As always, the placebo effect shouldn’t be discounted. But I’ve become more antisugar as a result of this mini-experiment.The other day, though, I had a breakthrough. I listened to a segment on the great science show Radiolab about bad habits. It featured an interview with Thomas Schelling—the Nobel Prize–winning economist who came up with now-self-vs.-future-self concept of egonomics. (Find it here: http://www.radiolab.org/people/thomas....)The health benefits are huge, he says. Laughter lowers the level of the stress hormone cortisol. It boosts immunity and reduces pain. A University of Maryland study found that big laughers had a 40 percent lower rate of heart disease than nonlaughers. (So there!)And indeed, so far, science shows no link between cancer and stress. That’s important to state, because much of America believes otherwise. Sapolsky cites a 2001 study where the majority of patients believed their breast cancer was caused not by genetics, diet, or environment, but by stress.Just contemplate the awful spectacle of surgery without anesthesia. If you read the absorbing book The Pain Chronicles by Melanie Thernstrom, you learn that doctors refused to tell their patients what day surgery was scheduled for. They simply showed up at the patient’s house on a random Tuesday or Thursday for a surprise operation. Otherwise, the patients would commit suicide the night before. It was that bad.Ratey, our Paleolithic forefathers walked eight to ten miles a day. Our grandparents expended an average of eight hundred calories a day more than we do. Biomedical Research Center compared heart problems in men who spent more than twenty-three hours a week sitting, and those who sat for less than eleven hours. The big sitters had a 64 percent higher chance of fatal heart disease. And the bad news doesn’t end there. The sitters weren’t slackers. A lot of them went to the gym when they weren’t sitting. But their workouts couldn’t fully overcome the damage from their desk chair.A Nippon Medical School study showed that two-hour walks in a forest caused a 50 percent spike in natural killer cells, a powerful immune cell.But wait. There's more. Read the book for yourself to see. "
13,141659907X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2617038-julie-bestry,4,"Let's say you'd like to be healthier but you're overwhelmed by reading all of the conflicting magazine articles and books regarding what's the healthiest way to eat, exercise, improve your sleep, avoid toxins, boost your immunity, have better sex, prevent damage to skin and eyes and ears and whatnot, and feel secure in definitive answers.Yeah, good luck with that.A. J. Jacobs has made a career out of experimenting with his life -- he read the Encyclopedia Britannica for a year, he lived by (Old and New Testament) Biblical principles for a year, he did a bunch of mini-experiments, and now, he's spent two years trying to improve his health by interviewing experts and living by their advice. Mixed in are tiny anecdotes regarding his grandfather (who would have made a wonderful subject of a book), his long-suffering wife, and his little boys. Considering he's an editor at Esquire, you'd expect a few juicy work stories, but nope.Jacobs is workmanlike; each chapter is a bit like a blog post -- a concentration on one health area with a few sub-areas and a round-up of his monthly progress. It's lightly self-deprecating, and certainly easy enough to read. At times, it's a relief that Jacobs is going to all of this effort, because it sounds exhausting, and at times depressing. And still, very little is definitive.The problem is that science can lack certainty, so some of what Jacobs conveys is the certitude with which some experts speak and the conflicting nature of so-called experts on the same topics. He (mostly) treats out-there wackadoodles with respect, but late in the book, I found that he interviewed a man I know personally to be abusive and to have fabricated the accuracy and recency of his credentials, which makes me call into question everyone else interviewed. So, if you like reading about people doing life experiments (as I do), this may be up your alley. You may find Jacobs annoying, which, after 300+ pages he can be, and you'll have to decide for yourself which approaches will work (or at least work for you), but it's well-written and, at worse, benign.Warning, a few of the personal anecdotes are sad; if you're in mourning, you may want to move this to the bottom of your pile. Finally, Jacobs does provide some great resources in case readers want to follow up on their own. So, you may not get certitude, but you may find some inspiration and options."
14,141659907X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/793094-lisa,3,"Best selling author, A.J. Jacobs writes about his attempts to adapt to life styles in a humorous way. You may remember The Year of Living Biblically, The Know-It-All, and My Life As an Experiment.In this book he strives to become the healthiest man in the world by consulting experts and their advice and incorporating his funny version of that advice into his life.In each of the first 26 chapters he focuses on one part of the body and searches for ways one could incorporate actions to perfect that part or system.For instance in the first chapter,""The Stomach"", subtitled, ""The Quest to Eat Right"", Jacobs made a list of 100 diets. Then he researched studies and consulted experts, and he came up with an approach he could live with for eating right. It's all that stuff you have heard before, but Jacobs says it in an entertaining way! At the end of each chapter he breaks down how he is progressing with his change of lifestyle. He also pokes fun of himself and his idiosyncrasies. He is a germ-a-phobe and his wife is not. I can relate; I haven't had even a cold in over a year and it is my personal quest to see how long I can go without being sick.There were certain chapters that I was more interested in than others, like ""The Brain: The Quest to Be Smarter"". As I have gotten older I have found it more difficult to learn and remember; and I forget things! Unfortunately, I don't think I learned anything new in the chapter, but I will keep tutoring math in hopes that brain exercise will pay off. Like Jacobs, I agree that exercising the body also helps to keep the mind sharp. My own advice: if you belong to a gym that has Expresso Bikes, try those because they will exercise your body and mind at the same time. I love Expresso Bikes!!

I do the races, but I love the dragon chases:

I was also very interested in the chapter on avoiding the sedentary life. I've looked at desks you can stand at and I had heard about treadmill desks, such as this one:

I looked online for Jacobs' homemade treadmill desk, but couldn't find it. It is pretty interesting. My husband keeps his treadmill in my office, and I have decided that when I have reading to do, I will do it at low speed on the treadmill. I do use the treadmill every day (M-F)at the Y at a brisk pace, but this will be slower, just to get me out of a chair at a time I would ordinarily be sitting. I just started today and I have used it for a total of about 25 minutes. I really don't think I can write while on the treadmill; just trying to make notes on the what I was reading was not so good. I do think this may be the most beneficial thing I take from this book."
15,141659907X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/854592-judy,4,"Dear A.J. Jacobs. I just love the fact that you are willing to devote years of your life for my education and amusement. Your ""One Man's Humble Quest"" series is a delight of the first order. I've talked about your first two books in the series, ""The Know-It-All"" and ""The Year of Living Biblically"" until my friends have asked me to stop. But ""Drop Dead Healthy"" is going to get that conversation going again. An excellent job. Congratulations. For those that I won't be seeing in the next few days--get this book and read it. While on a vacation in the Caribbean, Jacobs is hospitalized for tropical pneumonia. Lying in the hospital, feeling sorry for himself, remembering his wife's repeated comments that she doesn't want to be a young widow with three children, and realizing that his middle age body looks like a ""python that swallowed a goat"", Jacobs decides that he is going to transform himself into the world's healthiest human. But rather than simply reducing his food intake and getting more exercise, Jacobs wants to embark on a two-year quest to get healthy while exploring the range of available diet and fitness advice from across the spectrum. And expensive? Oh yes, it was expensive. Earphones to dull the noise of every day life, a helmet to be used as a safeguard while walking the streets of New York, and a juicer were only some of the deliveries to his apartment. He also purchased a treadmill and, after finding out that running on it was disruptive to his entire building, he converted it to a desk so that he could walk continuously while working. In trying to transform his health, Jacobs tries extreme chewing, the caveman workout, the slow fitness movement where an individual only exercises 20 minutes a week (frankly, I'm intrigued), acupuncture, the joys of squatting on toilet seats to have more efficient ""private moments"", and numerous other approaches to whole body health. Focusing on an organ a month, Jacobs involves his entire family in his quest, although there is a lot of eye rolling and mocking comments fly. At the end of the two years, a slimmer, healthier Jacobs realizes that there are some habits that he is going to keep and some that he won't. And he sums up his experience with the advice-eat less, move more, and avoid pollutants. Now those are words that can make sense to all of us. "
16,141659907X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1436215-kelly-hager,3,"This is Jacobs' fourth quirky memoir. In this one, he decides to become the world's healthiest man by focusing on different aspects of his body and improving them. Obviously he changes his diet and exercise habits (as in, he begins to exercise) but he also does things like use moisturizer and apply sunscreen, have sex more often, and change what he uses to clean his home and laundry (there are many, many more changes). He tries several different diets and, best of all for my purposes, learns that moderate drinkers live longer than people who don't drink at all and people who drink too much. AND this counts for beer and liquor, not just wine. So my occasional margarita habit is healthy! (My regular french fry habit, not so much.) I don't generally read nonfiction, but AJ Jacobs is a must-read author for me. His books are incredibly funny but I also manage to learn something. For example, even lazy Americans will walk the equivalent of the circumference of the earth over the course of their lifetime. So even though I live a lifestyle that's incredibly sedentary, that still sounds like quite an accomplishment. (I probably should not view it that way and should probably actually consider it a challenge to get off the couch and walk more.)The problem with trying to get healthy is that there are so many conflicting ideas about what's good for you and what's bad for you. For example, there are people who say that the healthiest diet is one that consists of no or little meat and then there are just as many people who say that carbs are the problem. (Probably as long as you avoid fried food, you're ahead of the game.) Anyway. This is an incredibly entertaining book (especially when he decides to try pole dancing). This book reinforced why I will always buy everything that AJ Jacobs writes. Recommended."

Some books, like chick lit and mysteries, are mostly just delicious. Some books, like history books, are mostly just nutritious. A. J. Jacobs’ books are a little of both. Yummy and good-for-you. Especially this book. Drop Dead Healthy, like all of Jacobs’ books, is the story of Jacobs attempting to challenge himself to do something very difficult. This time Jacobs takes on the challenge of becoming very healthy. Very, very healthy. And, like all of his books, Jacobs loves to push himself to extremes. (Who can forget the chapter in Year of Living Biblically when Jacobs tells how he went to the park in NYC and began to follow the Biblical edict to stone adulterers?) Jacobs, in his quest to become very, very healthy, attempts to eat right, exercise properly, experience quiet, lower his stress, de-toxify his home, breathe better, have a perfect night’s sleep, stand up straight, see better….Whew! It is exhausting to just read the list of all the things he attempts to do in order to try to be the world’s healthiest person. Yes, exhausting but also hilarious. Jacobs doesn’t do anything halfway. He is torn, at one point in the book, between trying to decide whether to wear earphones (to mute the noise of city life) or a helmet (to protect his skull). (His poor wife. I always think about his poor wife when I read his books. Did she have any idea what she was in for when she married him?!) You can’t help but take in a little of the knowledge about good health that Jacobs shares in bits and pieces all through the book."
18,141659907X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1237196-petra-x,3,"This whole genre of journalists deciding that they could make money from a series of really rather silly episodes is most amusing. A.J. Jacobs doesn't disappoint in this respect and even adds some vaguely interesting facts and things-we-ought-to-do. Unfortunately, amusing as it is, this genre also suffers from one major defect, all the books in it are entirely forgettable just as the journalists columns were. So I don't remember any tips to get healthy, stay healthy, be more beautiful and live longer. If you want some, just read one of the many instructive books from that even larger and even more forgettable genre, Self Help.(view spoiler)[I do have one tip though, don't eat Twinkies - Deconstructed: My Journey to Discover How the Ingredients Found in Processed Foods Are Grown, Mined (Yes, Mined), and Manipulated Into What America Eats (hide spoiler)]Finished Jan 1st, 2014"
19,141659907X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2623428-karen,4,"I enjoyed this in its audio book version, but I might wind up picking up a paperback so I can reference it later. I'm always thinking about how to improve my diet and exercise habits, but this book helped me to think more holistically about my approach. I think AJ is at his best when he's not just funny, but also able to demonstrate his earnest desire to turn his latest stunt into an opportunity for personal development. As AJ tries to become the Healthiest Human on the Planet (or whatever he calls it), he also confronts issues like how our health decisions impact our loved ones, how we reconcile any health quest with the knowledge of our mortality, and which standards we use to measure our sense of self-worth.If I was introducing someone to this author, I would point them straight to The Year of Living Biblically: One Man's Humble Quest to Follow the Bible as Literally as Possible. But this offering would come in second place. "
20,141659907X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1128298-angie,0,"This is a fun, shallow read on Jacob's attempt to become the healthiest man possible. If you keep up with health news, there isn't anything really new or noteworthy in this book. As a means of organizing, Jacob's tackles one body system or organ per chapter which is effective, but sort of forced and some of his transitions seem artificial/corny as a result. However, his voice is entertaining and engaging, he achieved some measurable results, and he offers some practical and up-to-date health advice. During the writing of this book, Jacob's vibrant, elderly grandfather's health declines and he dies as a result. As reader, I wish Jacob would have written more about this and how grieving and mental health are connected. His own desire to improve his health to extend his life in hopes to see his children grow up is a major theme, but this is not fully explored or connected to his grandfather's longevity. This could have been a more meaningful/deeper thread to this narrative. "
21,141659907X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/279256-diane,4,"This is the second book by A.J. Jacobs that I've read, and it didn't disappoint. Jacobs is such a funny and clever writer that I chose ""Drop Dead Healthy"" to keep me company during a particularly stressful week of grad school.In this book, Jacobs spends two years trying to be as healthy as he can. He tries new exercises, he experiments with different diets, he creates a ""treadmill desk"" so he can walk while he writes. He even went to a sleep clinic to try to fix his snoring. It's a fun look at the health craze in America, but it isn't preachy. And once again, I felt a bit sorry for his wife who had to put up with all of his shenanigans. Note: If you have a sense of humor about religion, I also recommend Jacobs' book ""The Year of Living Biblically."" "
22,141659907X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/13779-k,3,"A.J. Jacobs is always fun, even if his shtick is getting predictable. In his latest the-crazy-thing-I-tried-for-a-year line-up, A.J. is trying to get healthy. As with his experiment in living biblically, he tries a wide range of extreme experiences and eventually comes out with some interesting insights and a newly enhanced lifestyle, having incorporated a more moderate version of some of his more felicitous discoveries. I wouldn't tell you to drop everything and run out to read this book, but if you have some downtime and can't find something you've been dying to read, you could do worse. "
23,141659907X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1427816-karen,4,"As with his previous books, Jacobs tackles another topic with humor along with his research and using himself as a guinea pig. He points out how much conflicting information is out there and puts a lot of it to the test. While there is some good advice, this is a book meant for entertainment and did that pretty darn well. None of get out of this life alive and no matter what you do, sometimes illness comes anyway, but that doesn't mean we should just give up and eat crap while vegging on the couch. Just don't get obsessive and miss out on living your life."
24,141659907X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2069203-elizabeth,3,This was such a fun read. A.J. Jacobs is a funny dude. He writes well and always makes me laugh with his observations. And I love how he just GOES FOR IT when researching his subject matter. This time it is the health industry and his quest is to achieve perfect health. In order to do so he interviews the respected and the nutters. SO FUN. Read it.

Interesting, right?"
26,141659907X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5142243-lorrie,4,"I definitely needed to read this book and was constantly reminded that a sedentary life is not good.

27,141659907X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1585572-sharon,3,"I found that the appendices were the most helpful part of this book, since the author summarized his best learning from his two years of living a more healthy life. Bottom line: eat lots of fruits and vegetables, keep moving and be social. "
28,141659907X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4209082-benjamin-thomas,4,"I’ve become a big fan of AJ Jacobs’ books wherein he describes his experiences when submersing himself in one subject area or another. This is the man who lived an entire year trying to follow the dictates of the bible as much as possible (The Year of Living Biblically: One Man's Humble Quest to Follow the Bible as Literally as Possible) as well as the guy who read the entire Encyclopedia Britannica (The Know-It-All: One Man's Humble Quest to Become the Smartest Person in the World). These objectives are meant to be absurdist, of course, but Mr. Jacobs always manages to convey a lot of interesting information and perspective along with the humor.This one is no exception. The topic this time is health, a subject that is huge and difficult to boil down into easy-to-digest (pun intended) nuggets. Mr. Jacobs has a plan to become the healthiest person in the world (tongue in cheek) after a two-year span. He divides his experience into individual months, each one devoted to a particular health topic as he adds to his lengthy list of all he needs to do to live a perfectly healthy life. Major chapters cover the stomach (diet), the heart (exercise), the adrenal gland (reduce stress) etc. Other chapters are shorter and cover such things as the feet, the skin, the nose, the eyes, ears, and many more. Safety (or how not to get killed in accidents) also gets its own chapter.Mr. Jacobs does a lot of research and consults numerous experts, often seeking out the most extreme examples of each point of view. For example, he consults experts on nutrition who vary from those who are low carbs/high protein to those with the opposite approach. In fact, in almost every area of health there appears to be a continuum (like a political spectrum of left vs right) and each individual must decide where they fall on it and how to proceed. One thing I particularly appreciated was Mr. Jacobs’ pointing out the placebo effect. Just because you try a new style of footwear to improve your exercise, doesn’t mean that the small improvement you feel isn’t due to the simple fact that you expect it to improve. I also enjoyed how the author ties the whole book together, using his family as examples, whether it is his eccentric aunt who is obsessed with avoiding germs and toxic household products, or it is his aging grandfather as he approaches death. As always, I really feel for Mr. Jacobs’ wife, Julie, who must put up with his obsessions for months on end, but her sacrifices for my benefit are much appreciated.The bottom line message to improve health can really be boiled down to five words: eat less, move more, relax. How one does this, of course, is the crux of it all. This book is for informational and entertainment purposes. It’s not meant to be a medical textbook. I’m thankful for that because reading it would not have been nearly as much fun."
29,141659907X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/52018258-brendan-sudol,5,"Learned a lot, laughed a lot.A few snippets:“The key to making healthy decisions is to respect your future self. Honor him or her. Treat him or her like you would treat a friend or a loved one.”“If evolution worked perfectly, healthy food would taste delicious and unhealthy food would make us gag. On Halloween, kids would fill their pails with quinoa and cauliflower. Dairy Queen would sell millions of bok choy Blizzards.”“Most health advice can be summed up in five words: Eat less, move more, relax.”“Exercise, exercise, exercise. I’ve read it a thousand times. It cuts down on heart disease and cancer. It soothes stress and improves concentration. It’s Prozac and Lipitor and Adderall combined. Surprisingly, it doesn’t seem to do much for weight loss, partly because a good workout makes us hungry, and we end up bingeing. But the other benefits? Well documented.”"
30,141659907X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1190762-tanya-w,4,"This is an entertaining read with thousands of ideas to contribute to health. This is a book that was good to listen to while doing laundry, driving etc... it's easy to pick up at almost any point in the book.I would say on the whole, it's practical value isn't as high as other more focused books.These were the things I personally felt most interesting that I have adopted or would like to adopt as part of my own healthy living regimen:A lower calorie diet (you probably already know about the studies that show a monkey on a 1/3 less than ""normal"" calories lives much longer than the other monkeys), limiting portions, ""mindful eating""... enjoy that chocolate, make it last instead of wolfing down a large quantity in a short period of time.Stand as frequently as possible rather than sit (burns more calories, is better for your body). I would personally like to have a ""treadmill computer workstation"" (even though Eric thinks it sound ridiculous).Plenty of whole foods.Squatting platform (better for body even though it's not generally part of our culture)... one to think about.Look on the bright side.Brain health in a nutshell:Do crossword puzzles.Play logic games.Do math.Memorize poems.Argue (consider all sides)... perhaps best to be done in your mind only!Try new things.High Intensity Interval Training (HIIT)... the benefits of working out at capacity for 20 second intervals with a 10 second rest for only 4 minutes, outweighed the benefits of a 45 minute workout at a moderate pace! The benefits: raised enfurance, lower blood sugar, improved lung capacity, weight loss, altered metabolism and muscle structure enabling higher calorie burn rate throughout the day (probably why running burns more calories per mile than slow to brisk walking.Fitness Fingers... maybe.Eat an apple 15 minutes before a meal to lower meal calorie consumption (average of 187 fewer calories consumed).Stress reduction ideas:Self-massage of shoulders, neck, and arms.Share worries with a friend.Meditate.Get a dog or cat (I probably won't do this because of allergies).The serenity prayer: ""God grant me the serenity to accept the thing I cannot change, Courage to chang eht things I can, And wisdom to know the difference.""

31,141659907X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7292446-alec,5,"As I said to my wife, ""I haven't enjoyed a book as much as I enjoyed Drop Dead Healthy in a long while."" I had to let this statement sit overnight to make sure it remained true after sleeping on it. Not only does it remain true, I feel even more strongly about it in the light of day than I did when I uttered it yesterday. This is not an criticism of the other books I've read, but the coming together of the right book at the right time and the change of gears from the books I've been reading lately. I really loved this book.I first discovered A.J. Jacobs when I read The Know-It-All: One Man's Humble Quest to Become the Smartest Person in the World (loved that one, too) and learned about his experimental life and humorous outlook on living. Writing in the first-person, Jacobs skill is bringing the reader along on his journey of discovery and learning; his real magic is realizing greater insights from these experiments and helping readers learn more about humanity along with him.Drop Dead Healthy is subtitled, ""One man's humble quest for bodily perfection."" Over the period of two years, Jacobs implements increasing health measures which focus on different parts (or systems) of his body. These measures are, at times, extreme and fringe (even cringe-worthy), but he embraces them wholeheartedly and (largely) with an open mind. The result is a humorous and honest look at how these things affected him and whether they're worth keeping them up long term.The book should not be read as a lifestyle or self-help book. It definitely fits more in the humor genre, but I did learn things throughout. I loved hearing from Jacobs again and appreciate his humanity and vulnerability. The parallel story lines add so much to his quest and make this a great read. Highly recommended."
32,141659907X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3122452-nancy,5,"How do you review a book about a experiential journalist with far more courage than the average journalist (except the war reporters) and humor? While I am feeling accomplished in getting my children's and my own teeth cleaned once a year, a mammogram every two or three, and counting calories while berating myself for not exercising, Jacobs is immersing himself in his research. While I steer clear of anything that might set off my OCD, Jacob's feeds it. Terrifying.Like his Year of Living Biblically, Jacob's does research then seeks out professionals to explain different theories relating to health. He then tries these different forms of exercise, diets, or enhancements much to the reader's glee and entertainment. The author experiments for two years. At least, that's all he covers in his book, although if he truly is OCD, it is still continuing. He goes through different facets of health each month, adding to his repertoire of healthy habits; heart, eyes, stomach, butt, ears, endocrine system, immune system, adrenal gland, brain, teeth, lungs, skin, genitals, gonads (not the same as genitals, apparently), sleep, etc. Jacobs does what might make the rest of us uncomfortable, again much to my glee. He wears sound cancelling earphones 10 hours a day, runs barefoot, pretends to be a caveman, gets a colonoscopy, sees a proctologist, tries pole dancing, acupuncture, gets a personal trainer, tries multiple diets and allows his crazy aunt Marti to critique his abode. I find his wife, Julie, to be absolutely enchanting, by the way.I stayed up too late at night reading this book, got kicked out of bed by my husband for laughing out loud, and ate Pita chips and Easter candy while reading about his experience with Clomid. It was a lot like fun. "
33,141659907X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4911481-derek,4,"A.J. Jacobs must have a very good strategy when he proposes his writing projects to his wife. Drop Dead Healthy, his newest book, is perhaps his most ambitious yet: a plan to spend two years systematically trying to become the healthiest man alive. As with Jacobs' previous efforts in reading the Encyclopedia Brittanica in a year and following every commandment in the Bible over a year, Jacobs acknowledges the ridiculousness inherent in his project as he embarks, establishing the parameters as he begins. In this case, he would try to improve one body part each month, focusing on experiencing new practices and coming into contact with the fringiest of fringes. There is always a sense of otherness for Jacobs as he investigates these constructs, and he has an ever-entertaining way of presenting his encounters. He weaves his personal narrative throughout the book - this time in his relationships with his grandfather and his eccentric Aunt Marti - making it as much of a biography of this period of his life as it is about the experience of experimenting. It's never really about whether he succeeds or not, since the journey is most of the success in itself; after all, it's just plain fun to read about his adventures. As usual, there are some stories I wish he had told, and some parts of the book that might have been cleaned up a bit in editing, but that's not the point. The point is enjoying and appreciating his efforts while maybe learning something along the way, as well as wondering what he might possibly do to top this journey the next time. Short of training to be an astronaut, I'm not sure what he could do that would be more audacious than this story; I'm sure he's already thought of something, and I can't wait to read that story too."
34,141659907X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/390242-mark,2," When will I learn? I knew I shouldn't read another A.J. Jacobs stunt book, but I did anyway. In this one, he spends two years trying various methods to improve his health. The book is dull with few insights that a reader can adapt to his/her own life. Much of the book is given over to descriptions of faddish workouts or people who run laughter workshops.  Jacobs intersperses the pieces on his self-improvements efforts with descriptions of two of his relatives, his 90-something grandfather and his Aunt Marty. Aunt Marty is one of the most supremely annoying people I have encountered in print, a know-it-all who rails against ""toxins"" in her environment, once having gone so far as to leave a new car with the windows down for six months before driving it, so afraid was Marty of the chemicals in the upholstery. Despite all of her efforts, Marty dies of leukemia at the age of 63.  With Jacobs' grandfather, a once powerful labor attorney, we read of his steep decline from an active nonagenarian to a shell of his formal self. I imagine his decline was hastened by his final realization that his offspring included such dimwits as A.J. and Marty.  I give the book two stars instead of one because there are some-not much-but some useful tips in the book. For example, try to have protein with breakfast to prevent being hunger later in the day. On the other hand, Jacobs repeats the canard about needing to drink 8 glasses of water a day, a myth that was dis-proven long ago. I'm surprised that he didn't say that we should wait an hour after eating before swimming or that women should refrain from activity while menstruating, so I guess I should be grateful for that. This is the last time I will be fooled into reading one of his books."
35,141659907X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/301768-judith,4,"I liked this book because the author doesn't take himself too seriously, is not a scientist and has no product or lifestyle to advocate, yet he finds a lot of useful advice in his 2 year quest for perfect health and shares it here with a grain of salt. His book is set up in short,easy to digest chapters which take each section of the body separately. No, he is not a doctor; that's what makes the book different from other get-healthy books. He is the editor of Esquire magazine and his writing is very humorous. At the end of his 2 year study he participated in a triathlon and concluded that he had improved his physical condition but he had missed too much time with his family so he was glad to scale back his quest for improvement. Some things I learned:1. We should all get treadmill desks so we would move while we are doing our paperwork/computer work.2. A good night's sleep is worth sleeping in a separate room to get away from a snoring spouse.3. We should pay more attention to our hearing---I think I need those noise reduction headphones on my next plane trip.I really liked this passage on the controversies over diet and nutrition studies. ""The problem is, it's hard to conduct randomized placebo-controlled studies on humans and their diets. If you could lock ten thousand people in identical rooms for eighty years and feed half of them nothing but vegan food and feed the other half nothing but steak and eggs, and keep everything else the same, you could have some real data. But unless a Bond villain decides to pursue a doctorate in nutrition, that's not going to happen."" "
36,141659907X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/12091097-jo,3,"There were times in this book when I laughed out loud and many where I smiled. Jacobs style is easy to read and its easy to empathize with him as he goes through his many experiments on the quest to become healthy. There probably isn't much information that is radically new here if you are interested in health and much of what is new isn't necessarily useful-if amusing- but reminders of maintaining good health are never a waste in my eyes and I did go out and buy a pedometer, I chew more slowly and try and breathe more deeply since I started reading. My main quibble is with the structure, each chapter is a month and also a body part and I felt that we would just be getting into a subject before we shifted abruptly, that often more depth on certain topics would have been appreciated. Jacobs obviously consumed a huge mass of information over the two years and I think the desire to put as much as possible into the book meant that many topics were skated over a little quickly for me. This book is about a journey rather than purporting to be a definitive text but sometimes I felt we were jumping around from topic to topic too much and this interrupted the flow of the book. I did, however, always enjoy any digression where his family was concerned, the inclusion of his Grandfather and Aunt, his long suffering wife and his sons, the human element of the book, whether it be friends or experts is what made the reading experience an enjoyable one. "
37,141659907X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/958564-cameron,3,"I wish I could be the type of writer that A.J. Jacobs is. Not for his effortless ways of documenting experiments through life experiences, but for his ability to earn an advance from his publishers to live out whatever experiment he so chooses. The issue of his book advance definitely comes into play in Drop Dead Healthy as Jacobs mentions spending that advance to go through speciality exercises regimes and intensive cleanses and extreme diets. The need that Jacobs feels to outline the constant hits that his advance takes in undergoing all of these trials subsequently outlines the point that being healthy can often be an expensive undertaking. I found that out as I, inspired by the book, endeavored to try out the Paleo diet for a while. After dropping $100 on a trip to the grocery store for a five-day supply and having my body oddly reject the protein-heavy diet after a couple of days, I counted it a failure. So, though Jacobs is not writing a self-help book as it were, but is writing more experimental journalism on a variety of issues relating to health, that is the main frustration. The average person can't afford to go on a colonic cleanse or join a hot yoga session in a swanky exercise club or eat a diet of only Venezuelan-grown veggies. And that is the real problem with American health which I kind of wish would have been broached a bit more. But, non-tangentially, the book was informative and entertaining, as Jacobs always tends to be."
38,141659907X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1200378-michelle,4,"I am a great fan of A.J. Jacobs and his willingness to engage radically with the ideas he chooses to explore. In this volume his quest is to become the healthiest man alive. He experiments with various diets, exercise programs, and other life-style modifications which remove toxins from his environment, change the way he does his desk job, and gets him meditating. He offers up the evidence provided for each change he makes, often tries out conflicting philosophies, and tracks his own reactions and progress. During the two year project he loses his 94 year old grandfather and an aunt in her 60s (a woman extremely devoted to an organic lifestyle). Jack LaLanne also dies in the process of Jacobs trying to schedule an interview with him. What I appreciate most is that though Jacobs gets extreme in his experimentation he ultimately seeks a middle road, a sense of balance in life. This is also not a how-to book written by some guru who lives up in the ether somewhere. Jacobs starts out as a self-described semi-squishy guy looking to get healthier so he can stick around longer for his family. In the end he has made significant improvements to his health and found what works best for him in terms of creating habits that keep him well but don't distance him from those he loves. Along the way he shares his frustrations, successes, and insights in an authentic way."

Jacobs decides to go on a two year quest to become the healthiest man alive. Jacobs decides to go about this by tackling one body part per month. He starts with the stomach and finishes up with the skull. Along the way, he focuses on everything from the adrenal gland (lower his stress levels) to the skin to the hands. Throughout the book, Jacobs shares interesting studies that have been conducted about health and we learn how many health claims by “experts” are dubious at best. Jacobs approaches the topic of his own health with skepticism, humor, and a willingness to try new things in the name of trying to become the healthiest man alive. He obviously doesn’t make his goal, but he learns a lot along the way (and shares it with his readers). This isn’t a how-to-manual, but the quirky story of Jacobs’ experiences and the many people he meets along the way as he tries to improve his health.Drop Dead Healthy is for people who have read and enjoyed Jacobs’ previous book, The Year of Living Biblically, and for those who are interested in self-improvement and health and fitness."

It's about a man's quest to be the healthiest person alive ,A.J.Jacobs started his project health to reach his goal as being the healthiest man alive ,the ironic part that he found out that he is so far from perfect but tried many diets ,exercises and products till he was more healthier than before ,sometimes he takes things to the extreme ,trying to find a balance.i liked the idea of taking care of your body for the sake of your future self .Luved the idea of chewdism as well ,which is trying to chew more which in turn will help you eat less. every chapter in this book covers a part of the human body while focusing on the main goal of being overall healthy .very informative and interesting book ,enjoyed reading it Alot Quotes from the book :“I spent most of my time thinking about the cynical but compelling Jim Fixx argument. No matter what you do, no matter how often you exercise, or eat organic cauliflower, or wear helmets, you still could die tomorrow. Or today. Or right after you read this sentence. So why bother?”Excerpt From: A. J. Jacobs. “Drop Dead Healthy.”“I’ll follow fitness expert Oscar Wilde’s advice: Be moderate in all things, including moderation.”Excerpt From: A. J. Jacobs. “Drop Dead Healthy.”"
41,141659907X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4324886-susan,4,"I finished in about 24 hours of reading. A very easy and entertaining read! Short synopsis: Basically this guy goes on a 2-year quest to become the “healthiest man in the world.” While he doesn’t exactly reach the impossible, he does an exhausting amount of research and figures out for himself what he felt made him a healthier person, even if it required experimenting with awkward gym classes (read: pole dancing), juice cleanses, and uncomfortable medical procedures.I highly recommend this as a fun read for those who strive to live healthier lives. He explores all the normal and all the crazy things people do to attain longevity. I’m impressed by his dedication to the project. I also liked that he always maintained some skepticism to everything and made it a point to acknowledge what does or doesn’t have research to back it up. He mentions several times that trying to focus on doing things the healthiest way possible can be completely overwhelming and stressful. The only bad thing I can say is that he really has a thing for Dr. Oz, who I hold a deep skepticism for based on his having such a high popularity on daytime TV. "
42,141659907X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2479444-leah-hortin,4,"I'm actually surprised by how much I enjoyed this book. I can't really relate to a middle-aged father in New York City but Jacobs was funny and witty and kept things light but interesting. He never came close to coming off as an expert and always seemed to look at both sides of the coin which I can really appreciate. I get how he works - go from your typical, sedentary American, dive right into a 2-year long quest to get healthy and try a huge variety things, then settle into a nice balance that you can maintain for the rest of your life. I love it. His wrap-up was great. I also enjoyed the fact that I had read a few of the books he referenced and was well aware of most of his research so a little pat on the back to me. I also really appreciate that he looked at more than just diet and exercise and also discussed sleep, hearing, sex, safety, etc. The one thing that I found myself wanting was before and after pictures. Sure, the numbers talk, but I think it would resonate more if there was visual evidence. Losing x amount of pounds isn't an indicator for muscle tone and I'd like to see what a reduction by more than half of your body fat looks like."
43,141659907X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7974722-morgan-bridge,4,"The great thing about this book was that a lot of the things I learned I can actually apply to my life and they were understandable. Yes, I will start walking more because we are not made to sit as long as we do. Maybe I will start thinking about what I'm eating (big maybe), but I will definitely start eating smaller portions (we eat too dang much). Jacobs does a superb job of explaining in a non-textbook way how to be healthy and gives you so many options that allows you to determine what would be best for you.The most important thing I learned from this book is that there is a fine line between being healthy and being healthy. I learned that it is very healthy to have human interaction and friendships, but I also learned that if you eat with people who don't eat healthy you are more likely not to eat healthy. So are you willing to give up eating with your friends so you can eat healthy, or are you willing to give up eating healthy to eat with you friends (I hope my friends pick the latter option seeing as my diet consists of pizza, coke and hot dogs)."
44,141659907X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4319251-clay-nichols,5,"This is a generous 5. More like a 4.5.I laughed out loud about a dozen times while reading this book, snorting at at AJ's antics as he tries to cram every popular heath and nutrition fad into a single year. Some of the laughs came a result of self-regonition, some at the absurdity of all attempts to achieve everlasting youth.The character he creates for his wife is the perfect foil and stand-in for the reader, groaning tolerantly at the earnest and dedicated silliness this guy is capable of.If you have a health nut in your family, this book is a good litmus of whether they have really gone over the edge.I thought the best chapters (organized by body part or system) were the best. Jacobs admits that he grows fatigued of his efforts at health, and that sometimes shows in the prose. He seems less interested and energized in his pursuit as the days wear on.Overall, this is perfect for the summer reading list of those who wonder how to pack supplements and kettle bells for their trip to the beach."
45,141659907X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2644090-erica,3,"Oh how I wish I had the desire and motivation to do something like this - learn all about healthiness and then do something with that knowledge. But, I don't so I read about someone else doing it, instead.As usual, Mr. Jacobs is delightful and sometimes irritating in his quest to learn all about a topic, health in this case. I again found myself adoring his wife, Julie, even if she IS a gym nut (I don't understand the lure) I also realized the problem with reading too much about another person's life - you have to endure the painful moments, too. I cried myself puffy during the epilogue.I don't know why, then, I wasn't as caught up in this book as I have been his others. Maybe I identified less. I'm definitely not a health freak and I could stand to be a lot more vigilant about my habits, but I didn't really feel along for the ride this time; I didn't feel I'd learned something I could apply to myself and become better. Maybe because I didn't lose any weight while listening to this book. I should have walked on a treadmill the whole time."
46,141659907X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/17252252-kate,4,"This book is certainly amusing and entertaining, although perhaps not a good guide for attaining ""bodily perfection."" I did find it subtly nudging me toward being more active (though I doubt I will fit a treadmill desk in my tiny apartment, it did encourage me to walk the ten flights of steps up to said apartment instead of taking the elevator all the time). The appendix has some sane and reasonable tips for being more active, eating less, and avoiding potentially harmful chemicals.Jacobs did consult with some knowledgeable people about how to attain maximum healthiness, but I bemoan the lack of citations, especially when he mentions that he has started doing something because ""studies show"" that it has a beneficial effect. I don't doubt that there is a study that shows that, but what study is it? I don't expect extreme scientific rigor from the editor of Esquire, but the lone voice of a specialist that the author consulted is not very convincing, either. If I would do one thing to improve this book, it would be to add a bit more science — in moderation, of course."
47,141659907X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1390410-missy,4,"The same author wrote the book ""A Year of Living Biblically"", which I also want to read. This one is about the two years he spent researching the best ways to maintain optimal health by trying the various suggestions in the health-minded world. As you can imagine there were several ""correct"" ways to choose from and many of them contradictory. He isn't a fitness buff, by any means, so this is written so the average person can relate. The chapters are divided into whichever body part or function he's working on at the time. The best part about the book, aside from the obvious- trying to live longer and stronger, is the humorous escapades! For instance, his relationship w/ his wife throughout the writing of the book. Also, I don't know what it says about my maturity, but one of the best chapters involved how to properly poop. This book, does go there and to many other places. He covered obvious topics like dieting,exercise, and sleep, as well as many less obvious topics. Those turned out to be interesting too."
48,141659907X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/9402537-preston-kutney,5,"A really OCD trip through a bunch of health movements. As always, Jacobs is highly entertaining and I learned a lot of interesting things, both useful and not-so-useful. Here is a short list of things I learned:On being cold:Being cold burns more calories - our bodies have to burn more fuel to maintain our body temperature. On cursing:You can alleviate pain by cursing. A study showed that volunteers could hold their hand under water 40 sec longer if they cursed. On the Paleo lifestyle: On top of the Paleo diet, (where they argue about pre or post invention of fire cooking) some extreme followers do a Paleo workout, where they Sprint thru the forest, lift logs, and run on all fours. I feel more aware of my health, and according to Jacobs, ""The more you pay attention to your body's statistics, the greater chance you'll adopt a healthy lifestyle."" I guarantee that if you read this, you'll come away with at least one new healthy habit. "
49,141659907X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3208015-amy-t-d,4,"Enjoyed listening to tbis book on CD while in the car. The author is an 'experiential' journalist who spent 2 years trying to be THE most healthiest man alive. He quoted a ton of epidemiology studies and I think he mostly did a very good job. Wasnt a fan of his praise of Gary Taubes, but I agreed with most of the rest of his conclusions. I especially liked his approach of trying (most) everything, including extremes, knowing that the best choice was somewhere in the middle. His general plan was to go one organ or body system at a time for exploring changes, for example, the stomach, eyes, skin, genitals, etc. He spent a lot of time on diet and exercise, which was appropriate. Maybe I liked it because it confirmed what I already believe (frequent physical activity, stand at your desk, eat a plant based diet, have a positive attitude, pet your dog, etc.). His nice sense of humor made it easy to listen to; laughing out loud on my daily commute is always a good thing."
50,141659907X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/8115957-lindsey,4,"This journalistic telling of a beginner's journey through every facet of health was illuminating. Though he didn't dive very deeply into any one category (diet, exercise, skin health, reproductive health, sleep, etc) he did touch on the basics of everything. Much of the information he reported wasn't new, because most of his sources are already popular in the health world (Gary Toubes, Tim Farris), and any health nut has probably already read most of them. But, the storyline, following the author's research was interesting and hilarious, with depthy, well developed characters following complete sub-plots of their own. The reader really does finish the book feeling like she knows the author personally, as well as his grounded, sarcastic wife, wiggly kids, failing old grandfather, crunchy aunt, and all the doctors and experts he interviews. I listened on audio, read by the author, and it was great."
51,141659907X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/795517-wendy,4,This was an entertaining and informative read about the author's attempt to be the healthiest person he could be. I enjoyed hearing his stories as he delved in various aspects of fitness and health. I thought it was interesting that it sounds like he has continued to practice quite a few of the healthy habits he adopted during the course of his research for this book as long term practices. There were quite a few things in this book which I really took to heart. The dangers of a sedentary lifestyle really hit close to home. It has made me want to make more of an effort to try to avoid sitting for long stretches and get up and move around more throughout the day. I would recommend this book to anyone interested in hearing about the author's joureny to more healthful living. There is a lot of useful information shared in an interesting and entertaining way.
52,141659907X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1147841-jackie,4,"A.J. Jacobs always entertains, and it is certainly true of this book. This is a result of slightly over 2 years of Jacobs taking on the concept of health, with a not completely tongue in cheek goal of being the healthiest human alive. Meets up with all sorts of health gurus, checking out, and often trying out, all sorts of health suggestions. Each month he focuses on a part of his body (stomach, heart, ears, but, immune system, etc.), and talks about what he's learned, what seemed to work, what didn't work, and what his ""take-away"" about it all was. He pokes a lot of fun of himself, but he also disseminates quite a bit of information throughout the book. You learn while you are laughing, and that is really all I have to say about it, isn't it?"
53,141659907X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1528649-michelle,5,"In another chapter of A.J. Jacobs quest to conquer what seems impossible there is unapologetic candor and honesty. In his two-year quest to become the healthiest man alive, Jacobs tries conventional methods of exercise and diet, holistic medicine and even hand exercises. His determination to walk the writing process is inspiring. Along with his quest, Jacobs gives the reader a taste of what its like to navigate a hectic life with children and career and educates Americans on what seems like thousands of methods of venturing into health. I give this book a 5 out of 5 because I laughed, I teared up at his family tragedies and I turned the last page with my determination to start my own journey to be Drop Dead Healthy. "
54,141659907X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4642832-jade-walker,4,"In general, I'm not a fan of self-help or nutrition books. However, ""Drop Dead Healthy"" is not only informative, it's hilarious, honest and touching. Needless to say, this book has inspired me more than any other to focus on my health. Thanks to Jacobs' experiences with dieting, exercise and alternative health ideas, I've purchased a Fitbit, started drinking more water and am even logging my food and sleep patterns. The only thing that kept this from being a 5-star book was that it left me wanting more. The author has a long list of health experiments and he was simply unable to finish them all (even with two years of trying). Perhaps he'll write a sequel? If so, I'm in. "

A.J. takes 2 years out of his life to become the ""healthiest man alive"" and checks them all out.His writing style is always fun. I'd recommend this in an audiobook (narrated by the author) if possible, as listening to him is always fun. He has a knack for narrating his own humor well (some folks don't!). Good book, gave me plenty to think about, a good dose of education and entertainment. I love his willingness to try anything and embarrass himself with good humor..."

I enjoyed his book, The Know-It-All, and the topic of this one is a topic that I have been interested in as well. I just wasn't smart enough to get a publishing company to fund my pursuit of health! Good for you, A.J.!!! Following a health scare, A.J. decides to pursue optimum health. The trouble is the plethora of information and options---separating the garbage from the true. In his quest, he tries pretty much everything. Entertaining read!"

He took a health tourists trip around the body and stayed a month or so in each ""region"" trying out the latest, most fadish as well as the most tried, tested and proven ideas for a healthy lifestyle. Some of his home experiments were hysterical while others were eye-opening. I may even change some of my habits thanks to him. Thoroughly enjoyable."

This one, in particular, was a lot of fun as he takes on the health industry...he tries or researches every diet and exercise plan out there and he seeks ways to improve the health of every body part. Written with humor and humanity, this time around there are even tidbits of useful information. For example, humming can help to ward off sinus infections (who knew?).I'm looking forward to whatever his next experiment might be."

I can't say I learned a lot that I didn't already know, but it was certainly interesting and entertaining at times reading A.J.'s chronicles of health experiments - some logical, some a bit absurd (hence, the funny bit).

But where to start? And what's the best, most effective way to do so? There are entire libraries out there devoted to the subject, but this book is actually an entertaining look - and for that, it gets 4-stars. To actually make healthy living - with advice based on science and sound, rational reasoning - into a book that can be read without making the reader feel bad, obese or on death's door? Well, that's a true feat.A.J. Jacobs does this by making himself the guinea pig, a gimmick he's used on the Bible and on Internet-level knowledge. In this case, he goes through body parts, looking at the science and what it says about how to achieve maximum healthfulness, which in this case doesn't mean model-thinness. The book's real message is how little we know about how the body works and what can and will make it work better. There's too many complicating factors to know for sure what makes carrots good for us, for example, because there's just as many complicating factors that make carrots bad for us. (Smoking seems to be that one exception.)My quibble with this book is that we spend lots of time on A.J.'s time with cavemen fitness freaks, for example, because it's a cutesy story, but very little time with almost everything else. There's so much stuffed in here and some of the stories/appointments/tests/trials are reduced to a paragraph. Eating raw food for a week, for example, gets about a half page. Still, I found the advice in the book helpful and somewhat obvious. (It's nice to have it confirmed.) Move more, make that movement a pattern of intensity and moderation, steer clear of white foods and get a good night's sleep. It's already gotten me up off the couch, combing through my pantry and doing 5-minute workouts for 4 cycles. That good night's sleep remains elusive! "
78,141659907X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1499157-rod-hilton,3,"I'm a big fan of A.J. Jacobs, I've read all of his other books and I generally find him to be a humorous and engaging writer. Drop Dead Healthy is no exception to this, it's interesting and funny throughout, but it's not as good as his other books.Jacobs wrote a book where he read the entire Encyclopedia, and one where he decided to follow the Bible literally for a year (both great books), both of which were long-term, very focused experiments with his life. Then he wrote a book which was more a collection of random, short experiments (The Guinea Pig Diaries), more or less a collection of short articles about doing random crap for a month or so. This third book is the weakest of the set because it lacks the focus of the first two books.So when I saw his new book was about trying to become healthy, it seemed to me like a return to form: a focused, directed book again. He even tries to link this book to his earlier two, by claiming that the first was about the mind, the second the spirit, and this the body, making something of a trilogy out of them. Unfortunately, that's not really how the book turned out.Drop Dead Healthy is, once again, a collection of short experiments, with one experiment per chapter. He tries the gym for one, he tries dieting for one, he goes Paleo for one, he focuses on germs for one, he focuses on getting peace and quiet for one (seriously?), he tries to have more sex for one, he focuses on toxins in his home for one, he works on his teeth for one, etc. He devotes chapters to posture, smell, sleeping, eyesight, and many more. Most of the chapters just have A.J. moving from random study to random study, trying it out for a bit and humorously talking about the impact on his life.What the book lacks is a focus like his first two similar outings. An entire book focused on A.J. trying to eat right and work out would have been great. He could have included his Paleo experiments, his experiments with different kinds of workout routines, free-running, treadmills, etc. Most of this material is instead relegated to a handful of chapters, and the rest is focused on stuff only barely related to the book's concept of trying to live healthy. The conclusion I came to was that A.J. didn't like eating healthy and working out, so he didn't stick to it very well for the full 2 years of the book, and instead had to pad the book with a bunch of random crap about massage treatments and smelling better and improving his posture to reach book length. I particularly hated his insistence on giving equal (or more) time to new agey nonsense, largely inspired by his Aunt. This sort of thing makes for perhaps an interesting article or two in Esquire, but it seems barely related to the concept of the book.It's unfortunate, the chapters that actually relate to HEALTHY living are interesting, so an entire book devoted to them would have been great. A.J.'s usual wit and charm make the chapters about random junk interesting and fun to read, but they make the overall book seem muddled and directionless. The book is also, unfortunately, not terribly informative. A.J. doesn't do much to distinguish between what actually works in terms of getting healthy and what doesn't. Someone looking to get healthy will be ENTERTAINED by this book, but won't learn anything from it. Finally, I'd like to make special mention of Jacob's wife, who really comes off like a pain in the ass in this book. As a person who lost a lot of weight I can tell you having your spouse be encouraging when you lose weight makes a huge difference. At one point after A.J. has been working hard on changing his eating habits and losing a few pounds, Julie tells him he went from looking 4 months pregnant to 3.5. If my wife had told me that after working hard I'd have had my motivation totally sapped. His wife usually comes off as a tolerant but somewhat disapproving person, graciously putting up with A.J.'s craziness while making occasional offhand remarks (she's the stereotypical ""sane wife married to a hilarious manchild"" so common in crappy sitcoms). In this book, she comes off like a real jerk, constantly making obnoxious remarks about the author.Overall, it's better than Guinea Pig Diaries, but nowhere near as good as Know-It-All or Living Biblically."
79,141659907X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3312882-rachel-p,4,"I won this book as a goodreads giveaway and I am so glad I did! In his novel, “Drop Dead Healthy”, A.J. Jacobs documents his 2 year long journey to become the healthiest man alive. He does a tremendous amount of research and reads a vast amount of studies from a variety of sources on the subject of human health. I appreciate how he makes this book about total health instead of just about diet and exercise. He breaks down the story by body part; focusing on a different part of the body in each chapter.**SPOILER ALERT**I actually rate this book 4.5 stars. I really enjoyed how he went for it; fitness crazes, fad diets, alternative medicine, etc. Out of the mountain of research he selected a few key studies to relate and expert advice to pursue. I took pleasure in learning about the calorie restrictive diet (living on the edge of starvation), the Paleo Movement (living like a cavemen), walking and running barefoot, replacing manufactured beauty products (such as shampoo and soap) with natural alternatives (such as baking soda and vinegar). Somethings I tried out with great success (like deskercising – desk exercising) and somethings I wouldn’t go near unless I got my own book deal (like acupuncture). It is a spectacular read but there are a few issues that prevent me from giving it the full 5 stars. For instance, there are two chapters on the stomach in which A.J. discusses different diets he’s trying but the diet is an ever-present element of the entire journey and I don’t feel like he always devotes as much attention to it as he should. For example, the author mentions at the end of a chapter he started eating steel cut oatmeal but doesn’t mention why or how this came about. I know that he didn’t want to make this book too long and perhaps in the interest of prioritization he couldn’t explain every food/diet choice and how it came about but I personally would have been interested in learning much more. He does sum up key points in the appendices but I still think it’s not enough. There are also no consistent measurements reported at the end of each chapter except weight. Granted, I don’t expect a whole long list of measurement indices but more consistency would’ve been better.Here are a few key highlights that I took away: - Eat on smaller plates because we tend to eat everything that’s on our plates. - Chew your food thoroughly and eat with family and friends instead of watching TV or reading. You will eat slower and thus give your body the 20 minutes it needs to feel full. - Stand more and choose activities (or modify existing ones) that put you in motion. Studies show that spending 1 hour at the gym and the rest of the day at a desk or on the couch is not much better for you than if you spent the whole day stationary. - There’s no such thing as superfoods. All fruits and veggies are equally good for you. Just make sure you wash non-organic produce in hot water and vinegar and let sit for 5 minutes. - Set fitness goals. Buy a pedometer and complete against yourself or a partner to see how many steps you can walk in a day (the recommended amount is 10,000 steps or 5 miles per day). Also, registering for a marathon and then having to train for it is great motivation to get or stay in shape. - Keep your brain fit by challenging yourself and trying new things.  - Enjoy life. Don’t let your health become a preoccupation to the exclusion of all other aspects of your life. Enjoy spending time with people that you love and you are happy to be around. Don’t waste time stressing over getting enough exercise or counting calories. This novel is packed with so much quality information it is definitely a keeper for me. A.J. is very relatable starting out as your average out of shape American male. He includes his family in his health project and intersperses his story with personal anecdotes which I think make his experience more real. And his writing is hilarious; I’m talking LAUGH OUT LOUD funny. So I actually burned calories while reading this book especially when I was doing it while iPloding on my treadmill desk. Thanks A.J.!"
80,141659907X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4962920-jill-furedy,4,"A.J. Jacobs is amusing as always, and had I come away feeling that I'd learned some relevant health tips, I'd have given the book more stars. Part of that may be my personal issues though, reading about a mostly healthy, if somewhat neurotic and underexercised man pursue ultimate health doesn't necessarily translate to a nutritionally challenged woman with Crohn's disease! So when he's talking about dried mangoes as his vice and I'm eating cheetos, I'm thinking he's already ahead of me in the dietary department. And when he's eating walnuts or apples, I'm wishing I could eat those without getting sick. And in a twist of odd timing, I read the stomach revistied section in the waiting room for my follow up appointment to get a b12 shot, to try and get back to normal levels, and where I was instructed to pick up calcium citrate and vitamin D, both of which were areas I'm a bit low on, as well and being told to cut back on sugars as I'm not yet prediabetic, but still too high. So maybe that's why his giving up dried mangoes seemed unimpressive, when I know how much more I need to change my diet! Though I did like his Odysseus contract to give them up.  Anyway, Jacobs clearly needed more exercise, but basically it was pneumonia that motivated him to begin the project, rather than a chronic health issue or doctors orders. Reminded me a bit of the Happiness Project, where a woman who was not unhappy nevertheless sets about to improve her happiness levels. On the one hand, I agree with her theory...work on it before you HAVE to and it will be easier should circumstances change. Which definately applies to health as well. But it still makes their self imposed challenges seem less impressive than those overcoming more severe obstacles.  But Jacobs is fun to read, so I was willing to see where he went with this. I hoped to pick up a few health tips, but I don't think I came away with much. He wasn't on either his vegan or his protein-heavy diets long enough to really see any differences (I believe he gave two weeks to each). Moderation and portion control have always been my go-to diet method. He writes about his adventures with juicers and dehydrators, but only mentions his introductions of quinoa, bok choy, and other foods in his statistic notes. Did he know how to cook this stuff that he'd never eaten before? Or did his wife know? Did he actually like it, or just eat it because it's healthy? And the chronolgy isn't as straight forward as his chapters imply, so things overlapped or happened in different orders, which sometimes threw me off. I liked that he had a team of experts he was relying on, but he looks into so many things and mentions the kooky alongside the scientifically backed, all of it told in his humorous storytelling format, so that not a lot of it stuck with me.  As with his religion book (I haven't read The Know It All), I think someone looking for straight up humor might find his books too fact heavy, and someone looking for tips or wisdom might find his books a little too specific to his life to be applied generally, or might find the treatment a bit too light. The publisher category is biography which is the probably the only way to classify it in order to meet expectations of genre: You have to be looking for a mix of the humor and info for his adventures to resonate. His stories of his wife, grandpa, aunt Marti help balance the humor and his obsession, so that you can tell he is living a real life while assigning himself these odd tasks. And I can see how his health lessons will disappear from my mind since I hear so much of it in magazines, TV shows, etc, but if anything sticks with me about the book it will probably be the elements involving his family or even those side characters who reappear, like his trainer or the Cave Man. I usually judge a book by how original or memorable it is, and those characters don't carry quite enough of this book for me to think I'll be able to tell you much about it next year. But it hit a few touching moments, was a quick fun read, had an occasional look into something unfamiliar, and plenty of humor, so it was all I expected of it. "
81,141659907X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1270609-brittany,3,"How I Came To Read This Book: I'm guessing I heard about it in Entertainment Weekly. I've always been fascinated by biology and the human body, and A.J. Jacobs' (semi-serious) quest to become the healthiest man alive was intriguing - and turned out to be quite different than what I'd bargained for, in a good way.The Plot: A.J. Jacobs is sort of the Morgan Spurlock of the nonfiction / journalism world. His past two books were all about taking on epic, life-altering projects (reading the encyclopaedia and following the rules of the Bible to the letter), and this one is no different. After exercising his mind and exploring his faith, this book is focused on all the crazy ways we try to get and stay healthy - from the inside out, top down. Each chapter is centered on a particular body part, and Jacobs' forays into speaking with experts, trying out routines, and somewhat attempting to bust myths by separating the fact from fiction in those medical claims (i.e. blueberries are not the world's best superfruit. If you believe it, the Maine marketing folks have done a good job). The Good & The Bad: Like I said, this book was really different than I anticipated. It was more of an intellectual and experiential smorgasbord of anecdotes and experiences, some given no more weight than a sentence, as opposed to a deep-digging day-by-day progress story (although there is some chronology to the book). On the plus side, it made for a quite light and easy read, filled with those bite-sized snippets of information our generation so craves. On the negative, I never felt like the book really went particularly deep into any one direction - although perhaps rightfully so. By the end of the book, Jacobs' himself acknowledges we still don't know so much, and that what worked for him might not work for you. The main takeaway here is to at least be aware of some of the major hazards we are exposed to, and see if changing some behaviours will have a positive impact on your life. If it does, great - I can say myself, I've been sampling ideas from the book over the last week and have enjoyed them / have many more I want to try out (drinking ice water *burns* calories!) My favourite is the advice to try standing for (at least) an hour or two during your workday - I leave work feeling way less mushy in the brain and the legs. At the same time, I also appreciated that some of the extremist examples Jacobs' references - many of which were more amusing than anything - probably aren't for everyone. It was amazing how often peoples behaviours' were inconclusively linked to their health, or how many contradictory studies exist out there. You get the sense that Jacobs may have gone into this looking for a foolproof guide to healthiness by examining all angles, and what he ends up with is a hedgehog of ideas that's hard to conceptualize into anything tangible. I'm not saying I went into this book expecting a miracle health book - that's definitely not the intent. But it's so surface and skims through so much at times, it's hard to rate this higher than a 3. I did enjoy it, and I think anyone with a passing interest in biology and health will enjoy it as much as I did, but I wish - not for lack of Jacobs' trying - it gave me a little more conclusive insight. The Bottom Line: A bit of a lark, but has some real insight you can incorporate into your everyday life. Anything Memorable?: I found it weird that Jacobs frequently - I mean every chapter practically - talked about advocating a plant-based diet yet didn't actual delve into it in any real form, other than a brief foray into raw veganism (not for me). That was one of the weaknesses of the book I suppose - it delved into extremes, which, while amusing and enlightening, wasn't all that practical. 60-book Challenge?: Book #43 in 2012"
82,141659907X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/10093055-angie-fehl,4,"I'm revisiting Jacobs' work in experimental journalism -- a process where he gives himself one monumental project, usually for a year or so, and writes a whole book about the process. The first of these I read was his book A Year Of Living Biblically, where he attempted to live by biblical era standards of clothing, diet, etc as literally as possible. I believe Drop Dead Healthy was written before that one, though. In this book, Jacobs, inspired by his own health scare, decides to take on a slew of popular diets, exercise programs and health fads, equipment, technology, treatments. Each chapter covers one specific area of his body (heart health, lung improvement, leg strength, etc.), detailing what all he got into to improve that particular area. Since he's writing from a male perspective, he even gets looks into how to improve testicular health. Just some of the topics he researches (and what he discovers in the process):> Vitamin C helps fight peridontal disease, but citrus is rough on tooth enamel.. soo... > ""Orthorexia"" is a term coined by Dr. Steven Bratman to describe when people fixate SO hard on dieting, to the point of the stress actually outweighing any nutritional benefits. Jacobs himself also refers to this mode of thinking as ""health food fetishism"". That said, Jacobs also puts himself on a few of the trendiest diet plans -- Paleo, Raw, No Sugar, and juice cleanse routines -- just to see how he fares and what it does for his body. At the time he was writing this book, he also managed to snag an interview with health guru Jack Lalanne (who has since passed away, age 96).> Jacobs researches the benefits of acupuncture, laugh yoga, and ""worry exchange"", where you literally team up with someone else -- they worry about your problems, you worry about theirs. He also looks at ""neurobic exercise"" for the brain: doing your daily tasks but doing them in the reverse order you naturally would (ie. taking a different route to work, using your non-dominant hand as your dominant for a time, etc.). He also looks into some of the newer trends like anti-gravity yoga (Sky Gym type places) and Strollercise for new moms, as well as programs for the more hardcore minded -- CrossFit and the Roman Legionnaire workout, which apparently involves smashing logs out in the woods with iron mallets?! Jacobs even takes on pole dancing classes! He also attempts to make it family get-together time when he does treadmill work and Pilates class with his mom and weight training with his dad. > Jacobs describes using Odysseus contracts (aka Ulysses Contracts) to help keep him on his goals. If I remember correctly, this was also a tool he mentions using in A Year Of Living Biblically. What keeps me reading Jacobs' books is not only the education the reader is given from all the data this guy compiles with each project, but also the fact that he can writes these books with such great humor, often poking fun at his own shortcomings.I personally loved how he talked about being all gung ho for this particular experiment and then catches a cold shortly into the program X-P Also, his record of all his wife's reactions and responses to what he's doing or what he brings home is definitely bonus entertainment. The chapters are nicely laid out in a sort of log or journal form so all the science and such that Jacobs covers is not overwhelming for the reader. So if you're all about becoming a more knowledgeable person, I wholeheartedly recommend getting into some of his works. Even if it feels like a lot of information at once, you can do what I do and just take a chapter or two a day, process that and then go on to the next section. You'll be surprised at the wealth of info that sticks in your noggin!"
83,141659907X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/647117-nicole,4,"Wow--I really plowed through this book! I'm a big fan of AJ Jacobs, and have read all of his books, which all fall into the ""immersion-journalism"" category. As usual, AJ Jacobs wrote a highly entertaining and informative book documenting his 2 years of striving to become the healthiest man alive. As a bit of a health-nut myself, I didn't just read this book for entertainment purposes, I actually paid attention for health tips. So, here's some of what I found interesting: Meditation is extraordinarily good for your health. Yes, I already knew this, but I have a problem with what I call ""spazzy-brain syndrome"". But, I'm not alone here, and what AJ does is he meditates by watching the gently pulsating sleep-mode light on a Macbook and breathes in sync with it. I never noticed that the sleep light actually resembles the deep breathing of sleep. So I tried it. And it gave my brain some focus. Nice tip AJ.Something else that caught my attention as a ""dietaholic"" who has tried just about every diet out there, I was interested to read that the Mediterranean Diet is the most widely accepted diet with the most scientific backing. It's a diet that I haven't specifically tried, though it sounds right up my alley.Noise-pollution…a health hazard I have previously given very little thought to, although reading about it did encourage me to try on the Bose noise-canceling headphones that he talks about, and I must say they are WONDERFUL. Though I will not be buying them anytime soon with their $300 price tag. Still, I think my world is too noisy, and I actually have taken steps to quiet it a bit. Walking. I used to have a pedometer that I clipped on to my pants, and I made certain that I walked more than 10,000 steps every day. That often meant walking in circles around the playground my kids were playing on rather than sitting on a nearby bench to just watch. It's a little thing, but those steps do make a huge difference. Makes me want to pay attention to moving more, even though I am a frequent exerciser. Everything in moderation. People who go to ""health"" extremes are just as at-risk as those who ignore their health. For wrinkles, one of the only things that actually works is Retin-A. But, like the Bose noise-cancelling headphones, it's bloody expensive, so I probably won't be trying that one anytime soon either.Chew more. Breathe from your stomach. Give thanks. Try new foods like kale and quinoa. Yes, I actually did buy these things on my last shopping trip. The kale was delicious. Haven't tried the quinoa yet (pronounced keen-wah by the way…) High Intensity Interval Training is most effective (which is good news for us Zumba enthusiasts…) Fidget. Actually use a smaller plate. Drink more water, specifically 15 minutes prior to meals. Have protein for breakfast. Eat spicy foods--they curb your appetite for salty and sweet and give your metabolism a boost. LOVED hearing that one. Eat more veggies. Avoid simple carbs. Add crunch to your food. Shop the perimeter of the store. If you're going to eat meat, eat it as a side dish. Don't use anti-bacterial soap, just use regular soap. Stuff I've heard before, but great tips nonetheless. One thing I think the book lacked was before and after pics. He told us his beginning and ending weight and other various stats, but after 2 years of regular gym attendance after never going previously, I would've thought pictures would be telling. But the pics he did include were great. The book as a whole was great. I'd recommend it."
84,141659907X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2349088-roberto-scarlato,5,"When I first sat down to read this book on my kindle, I had a pretty clear idea of how committed this writer really is to experimentation and research. I've read The Know-it-all and The Year of Living biblically and enjoyed them both. This author has the perfect balance of facts and humor that I've ever read.Not only does he plunge himself into the subjects he tackles but he does so for months or even years, reading every book on the subject he intends to document.So when I heard that he was completing his, what he calls, ""Mind, Body and Soul Trilogy"", I had to buy it right away. Chances are I will read it again.Since this is a non-fiction book, I decided to review it in three ways: entertainment, interesting and what I've learned.Is it entertaining?Yes, extremely. I marveled at the wealth of facts he's unearthed on health myths and just how far some people will go to remain healthy. Some fanatics are so into their own health clicks that they don't even know they are causing more harm than good. Like his other books, there were times when I had to put the book down because I had to walk off a laugh-out-loud moment. My wife thought I was crazy. I was so immersed and interested in knowing these healthy weirdoes. I laughed at the fact that there are people out there in public parks running around like cavemen thinking that doing so is the pinnacle of healthy living. I doubled over in a giggle fit finding out that the writer hurt his shoulder kayaking on the Wii console, or through his misadventures during a Laugh-Yoga class, or finding out that cursing alleviates stubbed toe pain. Yes, the laughs are not on every single page but there were more than enough to keep me reading.Is it interesting?I would say so. I was particularly surprised at just how many Health habits aren't good for you. There are people addicted to exercising or never getting sick. There are people obsessed with Whole Foods when really you will still find sugar around every corner and the only thing getting slimmer is your own wallet. As for the diets, he's tried them all. He even covered the South Beach Diet which I was on at one point. Yes it made me slim down slightly but I felt miserable the whole time.What I've learned?Since reading this book, I've become a firm believer in Chewdism. While I won't spend a full minute chewing my food, I do find myself slowing down and chewing my food more. I know that chocolate, especially dark chocolate, is good for your heart. I've become more health conscious, joining weight watchers to track my meals and doing Power90 exercises (35 minutes on weekdays) and feeling good about it. Whenever I can, I get up and walk around. I'm actually interested in buying a pedometer to measure how many steps I take in a regular work day. I used to be part Hypochondriac and part OCD but now I'm actively taking steps to limit those stray thoughts and feeling less worrisome about it. I now make a list of things I know I should not have: No Soda, No Ice Cream, No Burritos. In short, this book motivated me to get fit quick.As for the people who try to knock this one man's efforts, I would say that they should know that it isn't really all that healthy leaving a bad review to a well-researched, two-year invested, delightful escape into one subject that is so easy to laugh about. I mean, come on, the guy wrote this entire book while on a treadmill, that's commitment right there."
85,141659907X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/8213107-carolina,5,"Originally posted at: A Girl that Likes Books Who doesn’t want to be healthy? Specially now a days. I first bought this book for my boyfriend...actually I pre-order it; we got it the second day after it came out. Why? We are big fans of Jacobs and it was my boyfriend who introduced me to his books. Last year I read The Year of Living Biblically and in March of this year I read The Know-it-All. I was really excited to read it and, since I loved the other two, I had big expectations. Boy, did the book deliver. Jacobs spends 2 full years working on himself, taking care of this skin, meals, exercising, getting healthy...and happy. To quote the book: ""The key to making healthy decisions is to respect your future self. Honor him or her. Treat him or her like you would treat a friend or a loved one""As in his other books (I still have to read the Guinea Pig Diaries, but the order has been placed, and with 82% off!!!!) he doesn’t only talks about the “experiment” itself, but also how it affects him, his family and in smaller doses, about family in general. In the first book of the “series”, The Know-it-All, we learn about him and his wife trying to conceive, how his father also tried to read the whole Encyclopedia Britannica, and so on.In this book we meet his Grandfather, a remarkable 96 year old, with a lovely remark: ""You can retire, but you must find something you’re passionate about in your retirement. You need a reason to wake up in the morning""Something else that I really enjoy about his books, is the familiarity of the whole thing, I feel like a friend of mine is just telling me what he/she did during the week-end. The writing is fluid and casual, like a conversation. And I have to say, I love Julie, his wife. She has the patience of a saint, and her comments always make me smile. She tried some of the stuff with Jacobs in this book. I cannot blame her for not trying anything on the biblical year; at the same time, I loved her ""answer"" to a lot of the restrictions during that year...but I'm changing books here. Sorry.What did I learn with this book? That I’m doing fine, not great but fine in my own quest to be healthy. I watch my portions, and have also controlled a little of my roommate and my boyfriend; I’m lucky to work in an environment that is not highly noisy; I don’t wear as much sunscreen as is recommended, but the point I’ve been trying to carve in my friend’s brains was valid, it does make a difference to apply sunscreen in the morning; I love my Pilates class, even when it hurts the day after, “luckily” I cannot spend 8 hours sitting at the lab, since I have to move from one room to the other in order to finish my experiment. I could still be more active though.And finally, my favorite of them all: Reading before going to sleep, might actually be helpful to sleep better! (As long as is a non-electronic book J)Truth be told, I learnt about a ton of new tendencies, but the main point is that everything has to be done in moderation. From eating, to exercising, you cannot...should not exaggerate. Did I like this book? Oh yes! I think is my favorite book from Jacobs...we will see how it goes with the Guinea Pig Diaries."
86,141659907X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/125347-donovan,4,"Funny, loaded with great tips, easy to read and applicable to me - an overweight health conscience individual who wants to make health a priority, but constantly find himself overwhelmed with all of the opinions, contrary advice and amount of research (not to mention miss guided priorities and laziness).Recently, I spend close to a thousand dollars for an initial appointment with a naturopathic doctor. While I'm still in the evaluation process, I can't help looking skeptically at a number of his recommendations, some very contrary to other things I've read (excessive fat is ok, eat lots of meat, etc). What I loved about A. J. is he shares this healthy skepticism and he looks at things practically and methodically, but with an open mind and a willingness to try everything. I felt like he did it for the rest of us. His book project and advance gave him the time to do what the rest of us want to know, but don't have time to do (oh wait, he also is an editor for Esquire...so I guess that is another excuse). Anyway, he confirmed my thoughts on many issues and I'm happy to just following along with his conclusions - and in others situations I want to do a little more research before forming an opinion, but his practical advice definitely gives me a head start.His wit and writing make the book easy to follow. I read the first half on a cross country flight and the only thing that made me put it down was the passengers getting up all around me. The rest I finished during my brief period of reading before bed - a tip I've taken from A.J. that I'm determined to make a habit.Much of the advice is stuff you already know, but it serves as a great reminder. Exercise more - eat less - sleep more - relax - smile often, etc. Other things were less intuitive - don't read on toilet - observe Sabbath - avoid pedicures like the plague - etc.One of the most delightful things about the book is his sense of humor - it helped a book on health flow. Here's some quotes to give you a flavor of his under toned, slightly sarcastic, humor.""I did get a colonic, but I've decided not write about it at length. I didn't find it helpful or enlightening. I can tell you want it felt like, though: It felt like someone shooting water up your butt.""""Cigarettes' cost far outweigh any resulting trimness, just as asphyxiation outweighs the benefits of stretching out the spine when you hang yourself from a shower curtain rod.""""The MRI has a repertoire of noises that resemble, in no particular order: a game-show buzzer for a wrong answer, urgent knocking, a modem from 1992, a grizzly-bear growl, and a man with a raspy voice shouting what sounds like ""mother cooler!""""After decimating several vegetables, I decide juicing is my favorite form of food preparation. There's something perversely appealing about subjecting an innocent plant to that much violence.""""The dehydrator blows warm air on your food for hours, sometimes days. It reminds me of the temperature and intensity of dog's breath. So imagine a German shepherd exhaling on your fruit for a weekend.""""So, if weight loss is your goal, and you have impressive self-control, raw food is something to consider.""""Step back for a minute. Pretend you're from Mars. From a coldly rational point of view, pedestrian helmets aren't a crazy idea."""
87,141659907X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/879591-sara,4,"I won an advanced copy of this book through the First Reads program. The author has written previous books about various life experiments he's conducted; I'd previously read his book about living biblically for a year, trying to follow all the numerous, and sometimes conflicting, rules in the Bible. This book is along the same lines, following his adventures over the course of two years as he strives to be the healthiest person in the world. This means changing his lifestyle to adopt healthier habits, working out in various ways that are supposed to be best for your health, eating a better diet, and so on.I wouldn't call this book ""hilarious,"" but it's definitely amusing. Not only are his adventures in the name of health entertaining, but his writing is extremely witty. Even though you might begin reading the book with the thought that he's simply doing this healthy experiment to write a book about it, the results are so interesting and he does so much research about it, throwing himself into this fully, that you can't help but enjoy. I loved all the descriptions of the ways in which he tries to work out, and the diets he follows, even for brief periods of time. As he points out, there is so much conflicting advice out there about how to be healthy, how to work out properly, how to eat your way to health... it's exhausting. And yet he attempts to follow many of the regiments in the name of science. One of my favorite parts of the book came when he follows the ""Caveman Workout"", exercising the way cavemen supposedly did, shirtless and barefoot in Central Park, lifting logs in lieu of boulders with a handful of other men in this Paleo Movement. He paints such a vivid picture of what he's doing, and you can't help but laugh at some of the ridiculousness he encounters, with devoted followers to each and every movement.It was also entertaining to hear his adventures following some of the diets that have been hyped up as the way to health - the raw food diet, the no-carb diet, the juice cleanse... He not only describes what the diet entails, but he goes on to talk about what different scientists and health professionals have said about the diet, and then describes his own experiences following it. One of the more memorable parts for me was his description of the juice cleanse, buying the way expensive juices touted by B-list celebrities, then trying to starve off hunger as he craved anything solid to eat. For all the entertainment found in this book, there is also some advice about health and ways that you really can make a difference in your own life without going completely overboard. I enjoyed the balance of everything, as it never felt as if I was reading a self-help book, but simply an entertaining social experiment that left me with some helpful advice. I imagine that not everyone will like this book, as its dry humor and ridiculous situations could seem off-putting at first. However, if you're interested in reading about someone's adventures participating in all sorts of health fads - some that you've heard of, others that are completely strange - and hearing about it all from a self-deprecating but witty narrator, this is a great book. I'd easily recommend it."

I found this one less interesting than his others, but that may be because I was already familiar with a lot of the material already, unlike his biblical and encyclopedic books. And the last third is a totally useless index. For example: incidental exercise (fidgeting), and on the page listed the only reference is '...even fidgeting (or as so and so calls it, incidental exercise) can be good exercise...' No one needs an index for that!"
89,141659907X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1288876-julie-g,4,"Remember that time I read The Year of Living Biblically and raved about it and then A.J. Jacobs EMAILED ME??? Me too. I was a brand-new blogger and almost died when I realized that authors actually read blogger reviews and respond to them. So basically, besides the fact that The Year of Living Biblically was incredibly well done, the fact that A.J. Jacobs actually replied to my review (which, let's be honest, was not that great) made me a fan for life. I was dying to read this one and the perfect opportunity arose when Jennie got a copy from Goodreads (I think). She passed it on to me and I'm supposed to pass it on to Jacki, which I really do intend to do one day in the very near future. Really.So Drop Dead Healthy is similar to Jacobs' other books in terms of the whole guinea-pig thing. Basically his style is to choose something and learn all about it by using his life as an experiment. In The Year of Living Biblically, he spends an entire year living as close as he can to Old Testament law. In The Know It All he reads through an entire set of encyclopedias. In Drop Dead Healthy, the theme is phsyical fitness and how to achieve it. Jacobs goes through all of the body systems, one by one, and tries out different methods, diets, and fitness regimes and chronicles their success.WritingI, for one, think Jacobs is hilarious. His sense of humor is spot on with my tastes and I spent most of the book laughing out loud. It's written like a memoir and it's about his personal experiences, but he also includes good background information from a scientific standpoint and references many other texts that offer the data and research information that is missing from his own personal experiences. I probably added ten or so books to my to-be-read list based on Jacobs' references. I think he did a great job of balancing the scientific information with humor and his own personal anecdotes. Entertainment ValueAgain, the book was really funny. I like humor and I like learning new things, and Jacobs combines both in his books. I'm also interested right now in dieting and fitness, so this gave me some insight into what worked and what didn't, for Jacobs at least, as well as what the current trends are - and what I ought to avoid. The caveman workout, for example, isn't one I'm anxious to try any time soon.OverallI highly recommend picking this one up. It's a fast read, informative and funny. I think it's a good jumping off place for those who enjoy humor or memoir and are interested in non-fiction, as well as those who are interested in health and fitness. It's a good way to ease your way into more hard-core scientific reads (and provides a great list of those more in-depth books as well). Thank you, Jennie, for sending me your copy and I promise I'll have it on its way to Jacki ASAP!"

I can't say I learned a lot that I didn't already know, but it was certainly interesting and entertaining at times reading A.J.'s chronicles of health experiments - some logical, some a bit absurd (hence, the funny bit).

107,141659907X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/12497233-karen,4,"September feels like a ""new year,"" even though I've been out of school for two decades, and so I read this thinking, I need to lose several pounds and just generally get up and get out more. But where to start? And what's the best, most effective way to do so? There are entire libraries out there devoted to the subject, but this book is actually an entertaining look - and for that, it gets 4-stars. To actually make healthy living - with advice based on science and sound, rational reasoning - into a book that can be read without making the reader feel bad, obese or on death's door? Well, that's a true feat.A.J. Jacobs does this by making himself the guinea pig, a gimmick he's used on the Bible and on Internet-level knowledge. In this case, he goes through body parts, looking at the science and what it says about how to achieve maximum healthfulness, which in this case doesn't mean model-thinness. The book's real message is how little we know about how the body works and what can and will make it work better. There's too many complicating factors to know for sure what makes carrots good for us, for example, because there's just as many complicating factors that make carrots bad for us. (Smoking seems to be that one exception.)My quibble with this book is that we spend lots of time on A.J.'s time with cavemen fitness freaks, for example, because it's a cutesy story, but very little time with almost everything else. There's so much stuffed in here and some of the stories/appointments/tests/trials are reduced to a paragraph. Eating raw food for a week, for example, gets about a half page. Still, I found the advice in the book helpful and somewhat obvious. (It's nice to have it confirmed.) Move more, make that movement a pattern of intensity and moderation, steer clear of white foods and get a good night's sleep. It's already gotten me up off the couch, combing through my pantry and doing 5-minute workouts for 4 cycles. That good night's sleep remains elusive! "
108,141659907X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1499157-rod-hilton,3,"I'm a big fan of A.J. Jacobs, I've read all of his other books and I generally find him to be a humorous and engaging writer. Drop Dead Healthy is no exception to this, it's interesting and funny throughout, but it's not as good as his other books.Jacobs wrote a book where he read the entire Encyclopedia, and one where he decided to follow the Bible literally for a year (both great books), both of which were long-term, very focused experiments with his life. Then he wrote a book which was more a collection of random, short experiments (The Guinea Pig Diaries), more or less a collection of short articles about doing random crap for a month or so. This third book is the weakest of the set because it lacks the focus of the first two books.So when I saw his new book was about trying to become healthy, it seemed to me like a return to form: a focused, directed book again. He even tries to link this book to his earlier two, by claiming that the first was about the mind, the second the spirit, and this the body, making something of a trilogy out of them. Unfortunately, that's not really how the book turned out.Drop Dead Healthy is, once again, a collection of short experiments, with one experiment per chapter. He tries the gym for one, he tries dieting for one, he goes Paleo for one, he focuses on germs for one, he focuses on getting peace and quiet for one (seriously?), he tries to have more sex for one, he focuses on toxins in his home for one, he works on his teeth for one, etc. He devotes chapters to posture, smell, sleeping, eyesight, and many more. Most of the chapters just have A.J. moving from random study to random study, trying it out for a bit and humorously talking about the impact on his life.What the book lacks is a focus like his first two similar outings. An entire book focused on A.J. trying to eat right and work out would have been great. He could have included his Paleo experiments, his experiments with different kinds of workout routines, free-running, treadmills, etc. Most of this material is instead relegated to a handful of chapters, and the rest is focused on stuff only barely related to the book's concept of trying to live healthy. The conclusion I came to was that A.J. didn't like eating healthy and working out, so he didn't stick to it very well for the full 2 years of the book, and instead had to pad the book with a bunch of random crap about massage treatments and smelling better and improving his posture to reach book length. I particularly hated his insistence on giving equal (or more) time to new agey nonsense, largely inspired by his Aunt. This sort of thing makes for perhaps an interesting article or two in Esquire, but it seems barely related to the concept of the book.It's unfortunate, the chapters that actually relate to HEALTHY living are interesting, so an entire book devoted to them would have been great. A.J.'s usual wit and charm make the chapters about random junk interesting and fun to read, but they make the overall book seem muddled and directionless. The book is also, unfortunately, not terribly informative. A.J. doesn't do much to distinguish between what actually works in terms of getting healthy and what doesn't. Someone looking to get healthy will be ENTERTAINED by this book, but won't learn anything from it. Finally, I'd like to make special mention of Jacob's wife, who really comes off like a pain in the ass in this book. As a person who lost a lot of weight I can tell you having your spouse be encouraging when you lose weight makes a huge difference. At one point after A.J. has been working hard on changing his eating habits and losing a few pounds, Julie tells him he went from looking 4 months pregnant to 3.5. If my wife had told me that after working hard I'd have had my motivation totally sapped. His wife usually comes off as a tolerant but somewhat disapproving person, graciously putting up with A.J.'s craziness while making occasional offhand remarks (she's the stereotypical ""sane wife married to a hilarious manchild"" so common in crappy sitcoms). In this book, she comes off like a real jerk, constantly making obnoxious remarks about the author.Overall, it's better than Guinea Pig Diaries, but nowhere near as good as Know-It-All or Living Biblically."
109,141659907X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3312882-rachel-p,4,"I won this book as a goodreads giveaway and I am so glad I did! In his novel, “Drop Dead Healthy”, A.J. Jacobs documents his 2 year long journey to become the healthiest man alive. He does a tremendous amount of research and reads a vast amount of studies from a variety of sources on the subject of human health. I appreciate how he makes this book about total health instead of just about diet and exercise. He breaks down the story by body part; focusing on a different part of the body in each chapter.**SPOILER ALERT**I actually rate this book 4.5 stars. I really enjoyed how he went for it; fitness crazes, fad diets, alternative medicine, etc. Out of the mountain of research he selected a few key studies to relate and expert advice to pursue. I took pleasure in learning about the calorie restrictive diet (living on the edge of starvation), the Paleo Movement (living like a cavemen), walking and running barefoot, replacing manufactured beauty products (such as shampoo and soap) with natural alternatives (such as baking soda and vinegar). Somethings I tried out with great success (like deskercising – desk exercising) and somethings I wouldn’t go near unless I got my own book deal (like acupuncture). It is a spectacular read but there are a few issues that prevent me from giving it the full 5 stars. For instance, there are two chapters on the stomach in which A.J. discusses different diets he’s trying but the diet is an ever-present element of the entire journey and I don’t feel like he always devotes as much attention to it as he should. For example, the author mentions at the end of a chapter he started eating steel cut oatmeal but doesn’t mention why or how this came about. I know that he didn’t want to make this book too long and perhaps in the interest of prioritization he couldn’t explain every food/diet choice and how it came about but I personally would have been interested in learning much more. He does sum up key points in the appendices but I still think it’s not enough. There are also no consistent measurements reported at the end of each chapter except weight. Granted, I don’t expect a whole long list of measurement indices but more consistency would’ve been better.Here are a few key highlights that I took away: - Eat on smaller plates because we tend to eat everything that’s on our plates. - Chew your food thoroughly and eat with family and friends instead of watching TV or reading. You will eat slower and thus give your body the 20 minutes it needs to feel full. - Stand more and choose activities (or modify existing ones) that put you in motion. Studies show that spending 1 hour at the gym and the rest of the day at a desk or on the couch is not much better for you than if you spent the whole day stationary. - There’s no such thing as superfoods. All fruits and veggies are equally good for you. Just make sure you wash non-organic produce in hot water and vinegar and let sit for 5 minutes. - Set fitness goals. Buy a pedometer and complete against yourself or a partner to see how many steps you can walk in a day (the recommended amount is 10,000 steps or 5 miles per day). Also, registering for a marathon and then having to train for it is great motivation to get or stay in shape. - Keep your brain fit by challenging yourself and trying new things.  - Enjoy life. Don’t let your health become a preoccupation to the exclusion of all other aspects of your life. Enjoy spending time with people that you love and you are happy to be around. Don’t waste time stressing over getting enough exercise or counting calories. This novel is packed with so much quality information it is definitely a keeper for me. A.J. is very relatable starting out as your average out of shape American male. He includes his family in his health project and intersperses his story with personal anecdotes which I think make his experience more real. And his writing is hilarious; I’m talking LAUGH OUT LOUD funny. So I actually burned calories while reading this book especially when I was doing it while iPloding on my treadmill desk. Thanks A.J.!"
110,141659907X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4962920-jill-furedy,4,"A.J. Jacobs is amusing as always, and had I come away feeling that I'd learned some relevant health tips, I'd have given the book more stars. Part of that may be my personal issues though, reading about a mostly healthy, if somewhat neurotic and underexercised man pursue ultimate health doesn't necessarily translate to a nutritionally challenged woman with Crohn's disease! So when he's talking about dried mangoes as his vice and I'm eating cheetos, I'm thinking he's already ahead of me in the dietary department. And when he's eating walnuts or apples, I'm wishing I could eat those without getting sick. And in a twist of odd timing, I read the stomach revistied section in the waiting room for my follow up appointment to get a b12 shot, to try and get back to normal levels, and where I was instructed to pick up calcium citrate and vitamin D, both of which were areas I'm a bit low on, as well and being told to cut back on sugars as I'm not yet prediabetic, but still too high. So maybe that's why his giving up dried mangoes seemed unimpressive, when I know how much more I need to change my diet! Though I did like his Odysseus contract to give them up.  Anyway, Jacobs clearly needed more exercise, but basically it was pneumonia that motivated him to begin the project, rather than a chronic health issue or doctors orders. Reminded me a bit of the Happiness Project, where a woman who was not unhappy nevertheless sets about to improve her happiness levels. On the one hand, I agree with her theory...work on it before you HAVE to and it will be easier should circumstances change. Which definately applies to health as well. But it still makes their self imposed challenges seem less impressive than those overcoming more severe obstacles.  But Jacobs is fun to read, so I was willing to see where he went with this. I hoped to pick up a few health tips, but I don't think I came away with much. He wasn't on either his vegan or his protein-heavy diets long enough to really see any differences (I believe he gave two weeks to each). Moderation and portion control have always been my go-to diet method. He writes about his adventures with juicers and dehydrators, but only mentions his introductions of quinoa, bok choy, and other foods in his statistic notes. Did he know how to cook this stuff that he'd never eaten before? Or did his wife know? Did he actually like it, or just eat it because it's healthy? And the chronolgy isn't as straight forward as his chapters imply, so things overlapped or happened in different orders, which sometimes threw me off. I liked that he had a team of experts he was relying on, but he looks into so many things and mentions the kooky alongside the scientifically backed, all of it told in his humorous storytelling format, so that not a lot of it stuck with me.  As with his religion book (I haven't read The Know It All), I think someone looking for straight up humor might find his books too fact heavy, and someone looking for tips or wisdom might find his books a little too specific to his life to be applied generally, or might find the treatment a bit too light. The publisher category is biography which is the probably the only way to classify it in order to meet expectations of genre: You have to be looking for a mix of the humor and info for his adventures to resonate. His stories of his wife, grandpa, aunt Marti help balance the humor and his obsession, so that you can tell he is living a real life while assigning himself these odd tasks. And I can see how his health lessons will disappear from my mind since I hear so much of it in magazines, TV shows, etc, but if anything sticks with me about the book it will probably be the elements involving his family or even those side characters who reappear, like his trainer or the Cave Man. I usually judge a book by how original or memorable it is, and those characters don't carry quite enough of this book for me to think I'll be able to tell you much about it next year. But it hit a few touching moments, was a quick fun read, had an occasional look into something unfamiliar, and plenty of humor, so it was all I expected of it. "
111,141659907X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1270609-brittany,3,"How I Came To Read This Book: I'm guessing I heard about it in Entertainment Weekly. I've always been fascinated by biology and the human body, and A.J. Jacobs' (semi-serious) quest to become the healthiest man alive was intriguing - and turned out to be quite different than what I'd bargained for, in a good way.The Plot: A.J. Jacobs is sort of the Morgan Spurlock of the nonfiction / journalism world. His past two books were all about taking on epic, life-altering projects (reading the encyclopaedia and following the rules of the Bible to the letter), and this one is no different. After exercising his mind and exploring his faith, this book is focused on all the crazy ways we try to get and stay healthy - from the inside out, top down. Each chapter is centered on a particular body part, and Jacobs' forays into speaking with experts, trying out routines, and somewhat attempting to bust myths by separating the fact from fiction in those medical claims (i.e. blueberries are not the world's best superfruit. If you believe it, the Maine marketing folks have done a good job). The Good & The Bad: Like I said, this book was really different than I anticipated. It was more of an intellectual and experiential smorgasbord of anecdotes and experiences, some given no more weight than a sentence, as opposed to a deep-digging day-by-day progress story (although there is some chronology to the book). On the plus side, it made for a quite light and easy read, filled with those bite-sized snippets of information our generation so craves. On the negative, I never felt like the book really went particularly deep into any one direction - although perhaps rightfully so. By the end of the book, Jacobs' himself acknowledges we still don't know so much, and that what worked for him might not work for you. The main takeaway here is to at least be aware of some of the major hazards we are exposed to, and see if changing some behaviours will have a positive impact on your life. If it does, great - I can say myself, I've been sampling ideas from the book over the last week and have enjoyed them / have many more I want to try out (drinking ice water *burns* calories!) My favourite is the advice to try standing for (at least) an hour or two during your workday - I leave work feeling way less mushy in the brain and the legs. At the same time, I also appreciated that some of the extremist examples Jacobs' references - many of which were more amusing than anything - probably aren't for everyone. It was amazing how often peoples behaviours' were inconclusively linked to their health, or how many contradictory studies exist out there. You get the sense that Jacobs may have gone into this looking for a foolproof guide to healthiness by examining all angles, and what he ends up with is a hedgehog of ideas that's hard to conceptualize into anything tangible. I'm not saying I went into this book expecting a miracle health book - that's definitely not the intent. But it's so surface and skims through so much at times, it's hard to rate this higher than a 3. I did enjoy it, and I think anyone with a passing interest in biology and health will enjoy it as much as I did, but I wish - not for lack of Jacobs' trying - it gave me a little more conclusive insight. The Bottom Line: A bit of a lark, but has some real insight you can incorporate into your everyday life. Anything Memorable?: I found it weird that Jacobs frequently - I mean every chapter practically - talked about advocating a plant-based diet yet didn't actual delve into it in any real form, other than a brief foray into raw veganism (not for me). That was one of the weaknesses of the book I suppose - it delved into extremes, which, while amusing and enlightening, wasn't all that practical. 60-book Challenge?: Book #43 in 2012"
112,141659907X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/10093055-angie-fehl,4,"I'm revisiting Jacobs' work in experimental journalism -- a process where he gives himself one monumental project, usually for a year or so, and writes a whole book about the process. The first of these I read was his book A Year Of Living Biblically, where he attempted to live by biblical era standards of clothing, diet, etc as literally as possible. I believe Drop Dead Healthy was written before that one, though. In this book, Jacobs, inspired by his own health scare, decides to take on a slew of popular diets, exercise programs and health fads, equipment, technology, treatments. Each chapter covers one specific area of his body (heart health, lung improvement, leg strength, etc.), detailing what all he got into to improve that particular area. Since he's writing from a male perspective, he even gets looks into how to improve testicular health. Just some of the topics he researches (and what he discovers in the process):> Vitamin C helps fight peridontal disease, but citrus is rough on tooth enamel.. soo... > ""Orthorexia"" is a term coined by Dr. Steven Bratman to describe when people fixate SO hard on dieting, to the point of the stress actually outweighing any nutritional benefits. Jacobs himself also refers to this mode of thinking as ""health food fetishism"". That said, Jacobs also puts himself on a few of the trendiest diet plans -- Paleo, Raw, No Sugar, and juice cleanse routines -- just to see how he fares and what it does for his body. At the time he was writing this book, he also managed to snag an interview with health guru Jack Lalanne (who has since passed away, age 96).> Jacobs researches the benefits of acupuncture, laugh yoga, and ""worry exchange"", where you literally team up with someone else -- they worry about your problems, you worry about theirs. He also looks at ""neurobic exercise"" for the brain: doing your daily tasks but doing them in the reverse order you naturally would (ie. taking a different route to work, using your non-dominant hand as your dominant for a time, etc.). He also looks into some of the newer trends like anti-gravity yoga (Sky Gym type places) and Strollercise for new moms, as well as programs for the more hardcore minded -- CrossFit and the Roman Legionnaire workout, which apparently involves smashing logs out in the woods with iron mallets?! Jacobs even takes on pole dancing classes! He also attempts to make it family get-together time when he does treadmill work and Pilates class with his mom and weight training with his dad. > Jacobs describes using Odysseus contracts (aka Ulysses Contracts) to help keep him on his goals. If I remember correctly, this was also a tool he mentions using in A Year Of Living Biblically. What keeps me reading Jacobs' books is not only the education the reader is given from all the data this guy compiles with each project, but also the fact that he can writes these books with such great humor, often poking fun at his own shortcomings.I personally loved how he talked about being all gung ho for this particular experiment and then catches a cold shortly into the program X-P Also, his record of all his wife's reactions and responses to what he's doing or what he brings home is definitely bonus entertainment. The chapters are nicely laid out in a sort of log or journal form so all the science and such that Jacobs covers is not overwhelming for the reader. So if you're all about becoming a more knowledgeable person, I wholeheartedly recommend getting into some of his works. Even if it feels like a lot of information at once, you can do what I do and just take a chapter or two a day, process that and then go on to the next section. You'll be surprised at the wealth of info that sticks in your noggin!"
113,141659907X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/647117-nicole,4,"Wow--I really plowed through this book! I'm a big fan of AJ Jacobs, and have read all of his books, which all fall into the ""immersion-journalism"" category. As usual, AJ Jacobs wrote a highly entertaining and informative book documenting his 2 years of striving to become the healthiest man alive. As a bit of a health-nut myself, I didn't just read this book for entertainment purposes, I actually paid attention for health tips. So, here's some of what I found interesting: Meditation is extraordinarily good for your health. Yes, I already knew this, but I have a problem with what I call ""spazzy-brain syndrome"". But, I'm not alone here, and what AJ does is he meditates by watching the gently pulsating sleep-mode light on a Macbook and breathes in sync with it. I never noticed that the sleep light actually resembles the deep breathing of sleep. So I tried it. And it gave my brain some focus. Nice tip AJ.Something else that caught my attention as a ""dietaholic"" who has tried just about every diet out there, I was interested to read that the Mediterranean Diet is the most widely accepted diet with the most scientific backing. It's a diet that I haven't specifically tried, though it sounds right up my alley.Noise-pollution…a health hazard I have previously given very little thought to, although reading about it did encourage me to try on the Bose noise-canceling headphones that he talks about, and I must say they are WONDERFUL. Though I will not be buying them anytime soon with their $300 price tag. Still, I think my world is too noisy, and I actually have taken steps to quiet it a bit. Walking. I used to have a pedometer that I clipped on to my pants, and I made certain that I walked more than 10,000 steps every day. That often meant walking in circles around the playground my kids were playing on rather than sitting on a nearby bench to just watch. It's a little thing, but those steps do make a huge difference. Makes me want to pay attention to moving more, even though I am a frequent exerciser. Everything in moderation. People who go to ""health"" extremes are just as at-risk as those who ignore their health. For wrinkles, one of the only things that actually works is Retin-A. But, like the Bose noise-cancelling headphones, it's bloody expensive, so I probably won't be trying that one anytime soon either.Chew more. Breathe from your stomach. Give thanks. Try new foods like kale and quinoa. Yes, I actually did buy these things on my last shopping trip. The kale was delicious. Haven't tried the quinoa yet (pronounced keen-wah by the way…) High Intensity Interval Training is most effective (which is good news for us Zumba enthusiasts…) Fidget. Actually use a smaller plate. Drink more water, specifically 15 minutes prior to meals. Have protein for breakfast. Eat spicy foods--they curb your appetite for salty and sweet and give your metabolism a boost. LOVED hearing that one. Eat more veggies. Avoid simple carbs. Add crunch to your food. Shop the perimeter of the store. If you're going to eat meat, eat it as a side dish. Don't use anti-bacterial soap, just use regular soap. Stuff I've heard before, but great tips nonetheless. One thing I think the book lacked was before and after pics. He told us his beginning and ending weight and other various stats, but after 2 years of regular gym attendance after never going previously, I would've thought pictures would be telling. But the pics he did include were great. The book as a whole was great. I'd recommend it."
114,141659907X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2349088-roberto-scarlato,5,"When I first sat down to read this book on my kindle, I had a pretty clear idea of how committed this writer really is to experimentation and research. I've read The Know-it-all and The Year of Living biblically and enjoyed them both. This author has the perfect balance of facts and humor that I've ever read.Not only does he plunge himself into the subjects he tackles but he does so for months or even years, reading every book on the subject he intends to document.So when I heard that he was completing his, what he calls, ""Mind, Body and Soul Trilogy"", I had to buy it right away. Chances are I will read it again.Since this is a non-fiction book, I decided to review it in three ways: entertainment, interesting and what I've learned.Is it entertaining?Yes, extremely. I marveled at the wealth of facts he's unearthed on health myths and just how far some people will go to remain healthy. Some fanatics are so into their own health clicks that they don't even know they are causing more harm than good. Like his other books, there were times when I had to put the book down because I had to walk off a laugh-out-loud moment. My wife thought I was crazy. I was so immersed and interested in knowing these healthy weirdoes. I laughed at the fact that there are people out there in public parks running around like cavemen thinking that doing so is the pinnacle of healthy living. I doubled over in a giggle fit finding out that the writer hurt his shoulder kayaking on the Wii console, or through his misadventures during a Laugh-Yoga class, or finding out that cursing alleviates stubbed toe pain. Yes, the laughs are not on every single page but there were more than enough to keep me reading.Is it interesting?I would say so. I was particularly surprised at just how many Health habits aren't good for you. There are people addicted to exercising or never getting sick. There are people obsessed with Whole Foods when really you will still find sugar around every corner and the only thing getting slimmer is your own wallet. As for the diets, he's tried them all. He even covered the South Beach Diet which I was on at one point. Yes it made me slim down slightly but I felt miserable the whole time.What I've learned?Since reading this book, I've become a firm believer in Chewdism. While I won't spend a full minute chewing my food, I do find myself slowing down and chewing my food more. I know that chocolate, especially dark chocolate, is good for your heart. I've become more health conscious, joining weight watchers to track my meals and doing Power90 exercises (35 minutes on weekdays) and feeling good about it. Whenever I can, I get up and walk around. I'm actually interested in buying a pedometer to measure how many steps I take in a regular work day. I used to be part Hypochondriac and part OCD but now I'm actively taking steps to limit those stray thoughts and feeling less worrisome about it. I now make a list of things I know I should not have: No Soda, No Ice Cream, No Burritos. In short, this book motivated me to get fit quick.As for the people who try to knock this one man's efforts, I would say that they should know that it isn't really all that healthy leaving a bad review to a well-researched, two-year invested, delightful escape into one subject that is so easy to laugh about. I mean, come on, the guy wrote this entire book while on a treadmill, that's commitment right there."
115,141659907X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/8213107-carolina,5,"Originally posted at: A Girl that Likes Books Who doesn’t want to be healthy? Specially now a days. I first bought this book for my boyfriend...actually I pre-order it; we got it the second day after it came out. Why? We are big fans of Jacobs and it was my boyfriend who introduced me to his books. Last year I read The Year of Living Biblically and in March of this year I read The Know-it-All. I was really excited to read it and, since I loved the other two, I had big expectations. Boy, did the book deliver. Jacobs spends 2 full years working on himself, taking care of this skin, meals, exercising, getting healthy...and happy. To quote the book: ""The key to making healthy decisions is to respect your future self. Honor him or her. Treat him or her like you would treat a friend or a loved one""As in his other books (I still have to read the Guinea Pig Diaries, but the order has been placed, and with 82% off!!!!) he doesn’t only talks about the “experiment” itself, but also how it affects him, his family and in smaller doses, about family in general. In the first book of the “series”, The Know-it-All, we learn about him and his wife trying to conceive, how his father also tried to read the whole Encyclopedia Britannica, and so on.In this book we meet his Grandfather, a remarkable 96 year old, with a lovely remark: ""You can retire, but you must find something you’re passionate about in your retirement. You need a reason to wake up in the morning""Something else that I really enjoy about his books, is the familiarity of the whole thing, I feel like a friend of mine is just telling me what he/she did during the week-end. The writing is fluid and casual, like a conversation. And I have to say, I love Julie, his wife. She has the patience of a saint, and her comments always make me smile. She tried some of the stuff with Jacobs in this book. I cannot blame her for not trying anything on the biblical year; at the same time, I loved her ""answer"" to a lot of the restrictions during that year...but I'm changing books here. Sorry.What did I learn with this book? That I’m doing fine, not great but fine in my own quest to be healthy. I watch my portions, and have also controlled a little of my roommate and my boyfriend; I’m lucky to work in an environment that is not highly noisy; I don’t wear as much sunscreen as is recommended, but the point I’ve been trying to carve in my friend’s brains was valid, it does make a difference to apply sunscreen in the morning; I love my Pilates class, even when it hurts the day after, “luckily” I cannot spend 8 hours sitting at the lab, since I have to move from one room to the other in order to finish my experiment. I could still be more active though.And finally, my favorite of them all: Reading before going to sleep, might actually be helpful to sleep better! (As long as is a non-electronic book J)Truth be told, I learnt about a ton of new tendencies, but the main point is that everything has to be done in moderation. From eating, to exercising, you cannot...should not exaggerate. Did I like this book? Oh yes! I think is my favorite book from Jacobs...we will see how it goes with the Guinea Pig Diaries."
116,141659907X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/125347-donovan,4,"Funny, loaded with great tips, easy to read and applicable to me - an overweight health conscience individual who wants to make health a priority, but constantly find himself overwhelmed with all of the opinions, contrary advice and amount of research (not to mention miss guided priorities and laziness).Recently, I spend close to a thousand dollars for an initial appointment with a naturopathic doctor. While I'm still in the evaluation process, I can't help looking skeptically at a number of his recommendations, some very contrary to other things I've read (excessive fat is ok, eat lots of meat, etc). What I loved about A. J. is he shares this healthy skepticism and he looks at things practically and methodically, but with an open mind and a willingness to try everything. I felt like he did it for the rest of us. His book project and advance gave him the time to do what the rest of us want to know, but don't have time to do (oh wait, he also is an editor for Esquire...so I guess that is another excuse). Anyway, he confirmed my thoughts on many issues and I'm happy to just following along with his conclusions - and in others situations I want to do a little more research before forming an opinion, but his practical advice definitely gives me a head start.His wit and writing make the book easy to follow. I read the first half on a cross country flight and the only thing that made me put it down was the passengers getting up all around me. The rest I finished during my brief period of reading before bed - a tip I've taken from A.J. that I'm determined to make a habit.Much of the advice is stuff you already know, but it serves as a great reminder. Exercise more - eat less - sleep more - relax - smile often, etc. Other things were less intuitive - don't read on toilet - observe Sabbath - avoid pedicures like the plague - etc.One of the most delightful things about the book is his sense of humor - it helped a book on health flow. Here's some quotes to give you a flavor of his under toned, slightly sarcastic, humor.""I did get a colonic, but I've decided not write about it at length. I didn't find it helpful or enlightening. I can tell you want it felt like, though: It felt like someone shooting water up your butt.""""Cigarettes' cost far outweigh any resulting trimness, just as asphyxiation outweighs the benefits of stretching out the spine when you hang yourself from a shower curtain rod.""""The MRI has a repertoire of noises that resemble, in no particular order: a game-show buzzer for a wrong answer, urgent knocking, a modem from 1992, a grizzly-bear growl, and a man with a raspy voice shouting what sounds like ""mother cooler!""""After decimating several vegetables, I decide juicing is my favorite form of food preparation. There's something perversely appealing about subjecting an innocent plant to that much violence.""""The dehydrator blows warm air on your food for hours, sometimes days. It reminds me of the temperature and intensity of dog's breath. So imagine a German shepherd exhaling on your fruit for a weekend.""""So, if weight loss is your goal, and you have impressive self-control, raw food is something to consider.""""Step back for a minute. Pretend you're from Mars. From a coldly rational point of view, pedestrian helmets aren't a crazy idea."""
117,141659907X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/879591-sara,4,"I won an advanced copy of this book through the First Reads program. The author has written previous books about various life experiments he's conducted; I'd previously read his book about living biblically for a year, trying to follow all the numerous, and sometimes conflicting, rules in the Bible. This book is along the same lines, following his adventures over the course of two years as he strives to be the healthiest person in the world. This means changing his lifestyle to adopt healthier habits, working out in various ways that are supposed to be best for your health, eating a better diet, and so on.I wouldn't call this book ""hilarious,"" but it's definitely amusing. Not only are his adventures in the name of health entertaining, but his writing is extremely witty. Even though you might begin reading the book with the thought that he's simply doing this healthy experiment to write a book about it, the results are so interesting and he does so much research about it, throwing himself into this fully, that you can't help but enjoy. I loved all the descriptions of the ways in which he tries to work out, and the diets he follows, even for brief periods of time. As he points out, there is so much conflicting advice out there about how to be healthy, how to work out properly, how to eat your way to health... it's exhausting. And yet he attempts to follow many of the regiments in the name of science. One of my favorite parts of the book came when he follows the ""Caveman Workout"", exercising the way cavemen supposedly did, shirtless and barefoot in Central Park, lifting logs in lieu of boulders with a handful of other men in this Paleo Movement. He paints such a vivid picture of what he's doing, and you can't help but laugh at some of the ridiculousness he encounters, with devoted followers to each and every movement.It was also entertaining to hear his adventures following some of the diets that have been hyped up as the way to health - the raw food diet, the no-carb diet, the juice cleanse... He not only describes what the diet entails, but he goes on to talk about what different scientists and health professionals have said about the diet, and then describes his own experiences following it. One of the more memorable parts for me was his description of the juice cleanse, buying the way expensive juices touted by B-list celebrities, then trying to starve off hunger as he craved anything solid to eat. For all the entertainment found in this book, there is also some advice about health and ways that you really can make a difference in your own life without going completely overboard. I enjoyed the balance of everything, as it never felt as if I was reading a self-help book, but simply an entertaining social experiment that left me with some helpful advice. I imagine that not everyone will like this book, as its dry humor and ridiculous situations could seem off-putting at first. However, if you're interested in reading about someone's adventures participating in all sorts of health fads - some that you've heard of, others that are completely strange - and hearing about it all from a self-deprecating but witty narrator, this is a great book. I'd easily recommend it."
118,141659907X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/68833154-zack-wussow,2,"It's ok. I found this one less interesting than his others, but that may be because I was already familiar with a lot of the material already, unlike his biblical and encyclopedic books. And the last third is a totally useless index. For example: incidental exercise (fidgeting), and on the page listed the only reference is '...even fidgeting (or as so and so calls it, incidental exercise) can be good exercise...' No one needs an index for that!"
119,141659907X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1288876-julie-g,4,"Remember that time I read The Year of Living Biblically and raved about it and then A.J. Jacobs EMAILED ME??? Me too. I was a brand-new blogger and almost died when I realized that authors actually read blogger reviews and respond to them. So basically, besides the fact that The Year of Living Biblically was incredibly well done, the fact that A.J. Jacobs actually replied to my review (which, let's be honest, was not that great) made me a fan for life. I was dying to read this one and the perfect opportunity arose when Jennie got a copy from Goodreads (I think). She passed it on to me and I'm supposed to pass it on to Jacki, which I really do intend to do one day in the very near future. Really.So Drop Dead Healthy is similar to Jacobs' other books in terms of the whole guinea-pig thing. Basically his style is to choose something and learn all about it by using his life as an experiment. In The Year of Living Biblically, he spends an entire year living as close as he can to Old Testament law. In The Know It All he reads through an entire set of encyclopedias. In Drop Dead Healthy, the theme is phsyical fitness and how to achieve it. Jacobs goes through all of the body systems, one by one, and tries out different methods, diets, and fitness regimes and chronicles their success.WritingI, for one, think Jacobs is hilarious. His sense of humor is spot on with my tastes and I spent most of the book laughing out loud. It's written like a memoir and it's about his personal experiences, but he also includes good background information from a scientific standpoint and references many other texts that offer the data and research information that is missing from his own personal experiences. I probably added ten or so books to my to-be-read list based on Jacobs' references. I think he did a great job of balancing the scientific information with humor and his own personal anecdotes. Entertainment ValueAgain, the book was really funny. I like humor and I like learning new things, and Jacobs combines both in his books. I'm also interested right now in dieting and fitness, so this gave me some insight into what worked and what didn't, for Jacobs at least, as well as what the current trends are - and what I ought to avoid. The caveman workout, for example, isn't one I'm anxious to try any time soon.OverallI highly recommend picking this one up. It's a fast read, informative and funny. I think it's a good jumping off place for those who enjoy humor or memoir and are interested in non-fiction, as well as those who are interested in health and fitness. It's a good way to ease your way into more hard-core scientific reads (and provides a great list of those more in-depth books as well). Thank you, Jennie, for sending me your copy and I promise I'll have it on its way to Jacki ASAP!"
120,141659907X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6182210-krista,3,"I read this book on a whim after my mom recommended it to me - we're a very healthy family, so it was more for the comic value of it more than anything else. I can't say I learned a lot that I didn't already know, but it was certainly interesting and entertaining at times reading A.J.'s chronicles of health experiments - some logical, some a bit absurd (hence, the funny bit). Read it for the journey, not the destination."

This is a great book because of what we can learn about health, but also because Jacobs is funny, and the information is presented in a way that is accessible. If you have ever wondered about certain fad diets, what kind of exercise is ""best"" or just want to enjoy a book, I recommend this. (The audio version is incredibly enjoyable!)"

137,141659907X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/12497233-karen,4,"September feels like a ""new year,"" even though I've been out of school for two decades, and so I read this thinking, I need to lose several pounds and just generally get up and get out more. But where to start? And what's the best, most effective way to do so? There are entire libraries out there devoted to the subject, but this book is actually an entertaining look - and for that, it gets 4-stars. To actually make healthy living - with advice based on science and sound, rational reasoning - into a book that can be read without making the reader feel bad, obese or on death's door? Well, that's a true feat.A.J. Jacobs does this by making himself the guinea pig, a gimmick he's used on the Bible and on Internet-level knowledge. In this case, he goes through body parts, looking at the science and what it says about how to achieve maximum healthfulness, which in this case doesn't mean model-thinness. The book's real message is how little we know about how the body works and what can and will make it work better. There's too many complicating factors to know for sure what makes carrots good for us, for example, because there's just as many complicating factors that make carrots bad for us. (Smoking seems to be that one exception.)My quibble with this book is that we spend lots of time on A.J.'s time with cavemen fitness freaks, for example, because it's a cutesy story, but very little time with almost everything else. There's so much stuffed in here and some of the stories/appointments/tests/trials are reduced to a paragraph. Eating raw food for a week, for example, gets about a half page. Still, I found the advice in the book helpful and somewhat obvious. (It's nice to have it confirmed.) Move more, make that movement a pattern of intensity and moderation, steer clear of white foods and get a good night's sleep. It's already gotten me up off the couch, combing through my pantry and doing 5-minute workouts for 4 cycles. That good night's sleep remains elusive! "
138,141659907X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1499157-rod-hilton,3,"I'm a big fan of A.J. Jacobs, I've read all of his other books and I generally find him to be a humorous and engaging writer. Drop Dead Healthy is no exception to this, it's interesting and funny throughout, but it's not as good as his other books.Jacobs wrote a book where he read the entire Encyclopedia, and one where he decided to follow the Bible literally for a year (both great books), both of which were long-term, very focused experiments with his life. Then he wrote a book which was more a collection of random, short experiments (The Guinea Pig Diaries), more or less a collection of short articles about doing random crap for a month or so. This third book is the weakest of the set because it lacks the focus of the first two books.So when I saw his new book was about trying to become healthy, it seemed to me like a return to form: a focused, directed book again. He even tries to link this book to his earlier two, by claiming that the first was about the mind, the second the spirit, and this the body, making something of a trilogy out of them. Unfortunately, that's not really how the book turned out.Drop Dead Healthy is, once again, a collection of short experiments, with one experiment per chapter. He tries the gym for one, he tries dieting for one, he goes Paleo for one, he focuses on germs for one, he focuses on getting peace and quiet for one (seriously?), he tries to have more sex for one, he focuses on toxins in his home for one, he works on his teeth for one, etc. He devotes chapters to posture, smell, sleeping, eyesight, and many more. Most of the chapters just have A.J. moving from random study to random study, trying it out for a bit and humorously talking about the impact on his life.What the book lacks is a focus like his first two similar outings. An entire book focused on A.J. trying to eat right and work out would have been great. He could have included his Paleo experiments, his experiments with different kinds of workout routines, free-running, treadmills, etc. Most of this material is instead relegated to a handful of chapters, and the rest is focused on stuff only barely related to the book's concept of trying to live healthy. The conclusion I came to was that A.J. didn't like eating healthy and working out, so he didn't stick to it very well for the full 2 years of the book, and instead had to pad the book with a bunch of random crap about massage treatments and smelling better and improving his posture to reach book length. I particularly hated his insistence on giving equal (or more) time to new agey nonsense, largely inspired by his Aunt. This sort of thing makes for perhaps an interesting article or two in Esquire, but it seems barely related to the concept of the book.It's unfortunate, the chapters that actually relate to HEALTHY living are interesting, so an entire book devoted to them would have been great. A.J.'s usual wit and charm make the chapters about random junk interesting and fun to read, but they make the overall book seem muddled and directionless. The book is also, unfortunately, not terribly informative. A.J. doesn't do much to distinguish between what actually works in terms of getting healthy and what doesn't. Someone looking to get healthy will be ENTERTAINED by this book, but won't learn anything from it. Finally, I'd like to make special mention of Jacob's wife, who really comes off like a pain in the ass in this book. As a person who lost a lot of weight I can tell you having your spouse be encouraging when you lose weight makes a huge difference. At one point after A.J. has been working hard on changing his eating habits and losing a few pounds, Julie tells him he went from looking 4 months pregnant to 3.5. If my wife had told me that after working hard I'd have had my motivation totally sapped. His wife usually comes off as a tolerant but somewhat disapproving person, graciously putting up with A.J.'s craziness while making occasional offhand remarks (she's the stereotypical ""sane wife married to a hilarious manchild"" so common in crappy sitcoms). In this book, she comes off like a real jerk, constantly making obnoxious remarks about the author.Overall, it's better than Guinea Pig Diaries, but nowhere near as good as Know-It-All or Living Biblically."
139,141659907X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3312882-rachel-p,4,"I won this book as a goodreads giveaway and I am so glad I did! In his novel, “Drop Dead Healthy”, A.J. Jacobs documents his 2 year long journey to become the healthiest man alive. He does a tremendous amount of research and reads a vast amount of studies from a variety of sources on the subject of human health. I appreciate how he makes this book about total health instead of just about diet and exercise. He breaks down the story by body part; focusing on a different part of the body in each chapter.**SPOILER ALERT**I actually rate this book 4.5 stars. I really enjoyed how he went for it; fitness crazes, fad diets, alternative medicine, etc. Out of the mountain of research he selected a few key studies to relate and expert advice to pursue. I took pleasure in learning about the calorie restrictive diet (living on the edge of starvation), the Paleo Movement (living like a cavemen), walking and running barefoot, replacing manufactured beauty products (such as shampoo and soap) with natural alternatives (such as baking soda and vinegar). Somethings I tried out with great success (like deskercising – desk exercising) and somethings I wouldn’t go near unless I got my own book deal (like acupuncture). It is a spectacular read but there are a few issues that prevent me from giving it the full 5 stars. For instance, there are two chapters on the stomach in which A.J. discusses different diets he’s trying but the diet is an ever-present element of the entire journey and I don’t feel like he always devotes as much attention to it as he should. For example, the author mentions at the end of a chapter he started eating steel cut oatmeal but doesn’t mention why or how this came about. I know that he didn’t want to make this book too long and perhaps in the interest of prioritization he couldn’t explain every food/diet choice and how it came about but I personally would have been interested in learning much more. He does sum up key points in the appendices but I still think it’s not enough. There are also no consistent measurements reported at the end of each chapter except weight. Granted, I don’t expect a whole long list of measurement indices but more consistency would’ve been better.Here are a few key highlights that I took away: - Eat on smaller plates because we tend to eat everything that’s on our plates. - Chew your food thoroughly and eat with family and friends instead of watching TV or reading. You will eat slower and thus give your body the 20 minutes it needs to feel full. - Stand more and choose activities (or modify existing ones) that put you in motion. Studies show that spending 1 hour at the gym and the rest of the day at a desk or on the couch is not much better for you than if you spent the whole day stationary. - There’s no such thing as superfoods. All fruits and veggies are equally good for you. Just make sure you wash non-organic produce in hot water and vinegar and let sit for 5 minutes. - Set fitness goals. Buy a pedometer and complete against yourself or a partner to see how many steps you can walk in a day (the recommended amount is 10,000 steps or 5 miles per day). Also, registering for a marathon and then having to train for it is great motivation to get or stay in shape. - Keep your brain fit by challenging yourself and trying new things.  - Enjoy life. Don’t let your health become a preoccupation to the exclusion of all other aspects of your life. Enjoy spending time with people that you love and you are happy to be around. Don’t waste time stressing over getting enough exercise or counting calories. This novel is packed with so much quality information it is definitely a keeper for me. A.J. is very relatable starting out as your average out of shape American male. He includes his family in his health project and intersperses his story with personal anecdotes which I think make his experience more real. And his writing is hilarious; I’m talking LAUGH OUT LOUD funny. So I actually burned calories while reading this book especially when I was doing it while iPloding on my treadmill desk. Thanks A.J.!"
140,141659907X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4962920-jill-furedy,4,"A.J. Jacobs is amusing as always, and had I come away feeling that I'd learned some relevant health tips, I'd have given the book more stars. Part of that may be my personal issues though, reading about a mostly healthy, if somewhat neurotic and underexercised man pursue ultimate health doesn't necessarily translate to a nutritionally challenged woman with Crohn's disease! So when he's talking about dried mangoes as his vice and I'm eating cheetos, I'm thinking he's already ahead of me in the dietary department. And when he's eating walnuts or apples, I'm wishing I could eat those without getting sick. And in a twist of odd timing, I read the stomach revistied section in the waiting room for my follow up appointment to get a b12 shot, to try and get back to normal levels, and where I was instructed to pick up calcium citrate and vitamin D, both of which were areas I'm a bit low on, as well and being told to cut back on sugars as I'm not yet prediabetic, but still too high. So maybe that's why his giving up dried mangoes seemed unimpressive, when I know how much more I need to change my diet! Though I did like his Odysseus contract to give them up.  Anyway, Jacobs clearly needed more exercise, but basically it was pneumonia that motivated him to begin the project, rather than a chronic health issue or doctors orders. Reminded me a bit of the Happiness Project, where a woman who was not unhappy nevertheless sets about to improve her happiness levels. On the one hand, I agree with her theory...work on it before you HAVE to and it will be easier should circumstances change. Which definately applies to health as well. But it still makes their self imposed challenges seem less impressive than those overcoming more severe obstacles.  But Jacobs is fun to read, so I was willing to see where he went with this. I hoped to pick up a few health tips, but I don't think I came away with much. He wasn't on either his vegan or his protein-heavy diets long enough to really see any differences (I believe he gave two weeks to each). Moderation and portion control have always been my go-to diet method. He writes about his adventures with juicers and dehydrators, but only mentions his introductions of quinoa, bok choy, and other foods in his statistic notes. Did he know how to cook this stuff that he'd never eaten before? Or did his wife know? Did he actually like it, or just eat it because it's healthy? And the chronolgy isn't as straight forward as his chapters imply, so things overlapped or happened in different orders, which sometimes threw me off. I liked that he had a team of experts he was relying on, but he looks into so many things and mentions the kooky alongside the scientifically backed, all of it told in his humorous storytelling format, so that not a lot of it stuck with me.  As with his religion book (I haven't read The Know It All), I think someone looking for straight up humor might find his books too fact heavy, and someone looking for tips or wisdom might find his books a little too specific to his life to be applied generally, or might find the treatment a bit too light. The publisher category is biography which is the probably the only way to classify it in order to meet expectations of genre: You have to be looking for a mix of the humor and info for his adventures to resonate. His stories of his wife, grandpa, aunt Marti help balance the humor and his obsession, so that you can tell he is living a real life while assigning himself these odd tasks. And I can see how his health lessons will disappear from my mind since I hear so much of it in magazines, TV shows, etc, but if anything sticks with me about the book it will probably be the elements involving his family or even those side characters who reappear, like his trainer or the Cave Man. I usually judge a book by how original or memorable it is, and those characters don't carry quite enough of this book for me to think I'll be able to tell you much about it next year. But it hit a few touching moments, was a quick fun read, had an occasional look into something unfamiliar, and plenty of humor, so it was all I expected of it. "
141,141659907X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1270609-brittany,3,"How I Came To Read This Book: I'm guessing I heard about it in Entertainment Weekly. I've always been fascinated by biology and the human body, and A.J. Jacobs' (semi-serious) quest to become the healthiest man alive was intriguing - and turned out to be quite different than what I'd bargained for, in a good way.The Plot: A.J. Jacobs is sort of the Morgan Spurlock of the nonfiction / journalism world. His past two books were all about taking on epic, life-altering projects (reading the encyclopaedia and following the rules of the Bible to the letter), and this one is no different. After exercising his mind and exploring his faith, this book is focused on all the crazy ways we try to get and stay healthy - from the inside out, top down. Each chapter is centered on a particular body part, and Jacobs' forays into speaking with experts, trying out routines, and somewhat attempting to bust myths by separating the fact from fiction in those medical claims (i.e. blueberries are not the world's best superfruit. If you believe it, the Maine marketing folks have done a good job). The Good & The Bad: Like I said, this book was really different than I anticipated. It was more of an intellectual and experiential smorgasbord of anecdotes and experiences, some given no more weight than a sentence, as opposed to a deep-digging day-by-day progress story (although there is some chronology to the book). On the plus side, it made for a quite light and easy read, filled with those bite-sized snippets of information our generation so craves. On the negative, I never felt like the book really went particularly deep into any one direction - although perhaps rightfully so. By the end of the book, Jacobs' himself acknowledges we still don't know so much, and that what worked for him might not work for you. The main takeaway here is to at least be aware of some of the major hazards we are exposed to, and see if changing some behaviours will have a positive impact on your life. If it does, great - I can say myself, I've been sampling ideas from the book over the last week and have enjoyed them / have many more I want to try out (drinking ice water *burns* calories!) My favourite is the advice to try standing for (at least) an hour or two during your workday - I leave work feeling way less mushy in the brain and the legs. At the same time, I also appreciated that some of the extremist examples Jacobs' references - many of which were more amusing than anything - probably aren't for everyone. It was amazing how often peoples behaviours' were inconclusively linked to their health, or how many contradictory studies exist out there. You get the sense that Jacobs may have gone into this looking for a foolproof guide to healthiness by examining all angles, and what he ends up with is a hedgehog of ideas that's hard to conceptualize into anything tangible. I'm not saying I went into this book expecting a miracle health book - that's definitely not the intent. But it's so surface and skims through so much at times, it's hard to rate this higher than a 3. I did enjoy it, and I think anyone with a passing interest in biology and health will enjoy it as much as I did, but I wish - not for lack of Jacobs' trying - it gave me a little more conclusive insight. The Bottom Line: A bit of a lark, but has some real insight you can incorporate into your everyday life. Anything Memorable?: I found it weird that Jacobs frequently - I mean every chapter practically - talked about advocating a plant-based diet yet didn't actual delve into it in any real form, other than a brief foray into raw veganism (not for me). That was one of the weaknesses of the book I suppose - it delved into extremes, which, while amusing and enlightening, wasn't all that practical. 60-book Challenge?: Book #43 in 2012"
142,141659907X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/10093055-angie-fehl,4,"I'm revisiting Jacobs' work in experimental journalism -- a process where he gives himself one monumental project, usually for a year or so, and writes a whole book about the process. The first of these I read was his book A Year Of Living Biblically, where he attempted to live by biblical era standards of clothing, diet, etc as literally as possible. I believe Drop Dead Healthy was written before that one, though. In this book, Jacobs, inspired by his own health scare, decides to take on a slew of popular diets, exercise programs and health fads, equipment, technology, treatments. Each chapter covers one specific area of his body (heart health, lung improvement, leg strength, etc.), detailing what all he got into to improve that particular area. Since he's writing from a male perspective, he even gets looks into how to improve testicular health. Just some of the topics he researches (and what he discovers in the process):> Vitamin C helps fight peridontal disease, but citrus is rough on tooth enamel.. soo... > ""Orthorexia"" is a term coined by Dr. Steven Bratman to describe when people fixate SO hard on dieting, to the point of the stress actually outweighing any nutritional benefits. Jacobs himself also refers to this mode of thinking as ""health food fetishism"". That said, Jacobs also puts himself on a few of the trendiest diet plans -- Paleo, Raw, No Sugar, and juice cleanse routines -- just to see how he fares and what it does for his body. At the time he was writing this book, he also managed to snag an interview with health guru Jack Lalanne (who has since passed away, age 96).> Jacobs researches the benefits of acupuncture, laugh yoga, and ""worry exchange"", where you literally team up with someone else -- they worry about your problems, you worry about theirs. He also looks at ""neurobic exercise"" for the brain: doing your daily tasks but doing them in the reverse order you naturally would (ie. taking a different route to work, using your non-dominant hand as your dominant for a time, etc.). He also looks into some of the newer trends like anti-gravity yoga (Sky Gym type places) and Strollercise for new moms, as well as programs for the more hardcore minded -- CrossFit and the Roman Legionnaire workout, which apparently involves smashing logs out in the woods with iron mallets?! Jacobs even takes on pole dancing classes! He also attempts to make it family get-together time when he does treadmill work and Pilates class with his mom and weight training with his dad. > Jacobs describes using Odysseus contracts (aka Ulysses Contracts) to help keep him on his goals. If I remember correctly, this was also a tool he mentions using in A Year Of Living Biblically. What keeps me reading Jacobs' books is not only the education the reader is given from all the data this guy compiles with each project, but also the fact that he can writes these books with such great humor, often poking fun at his own shortcomings.I personally loved how he talked about being all gung ho for this particular experiment and then catches a cold shortly into the program X-P Also, his record of all his wife's reactions and responses to what he's doing or what he brings home is definitely bonus entertainment. The chapters are nicely laid out in a sort of log or journal form so all the science and such that Jacobs covers is not overwhelming for the reader. So if you're all about becoming a more knowledgeable person, I wholeheartedly recommend getting into some of his works. Even if it feels like a lot of information at once, you can do what I do and just take a chapter or two a day, process that and then go on to the next section. You'll be surprised at the wealth of info that sticks in your noggin!"
143,141659907X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/647117-nicole,4,"Wow--I really plowed through this book! I'm a big fan of AJ Jacobs, and have read all of his books, which all fall into the ""immersion-journalism"" category. As usual, AJ Jacobs wrote a highly entertaining and informative book documenting his 2 years of striving to become the healthiest man alive. As a bit of a health-nut myself, I didn't just read this book for entertainment purposes, I actually paid attention for health tips. So, here's some of what I found interesting: Meditation is extraordinarily good for your health. Yes, I already knew this, but I have a problem with what I call ""spazzy-brain syndrome"". But, I'm not alone here, and what AJ does is he meditates by watching the gently pulsating sleep-mode light on a Macbook and breathes in sync with it. I never noticed that the sleep light actually resembles the deep breathing of sleep. So I tried it. And it gave my brain some focus. Nice tip AJ.Something else that caught my attention as a ""dietaholic"" who has tried just about every diet out there, I was interested to read that the Mediterranean Diet is the most widely accepted diet with the most scientific backing. It's a diet that I haven't specifically tried, though it sounds right up my alley.Noise-pollution…a health hazard I have previously given very little thought to, although reading about it did encourage me to try on the Bose noise-canceling headphones that he talks about, and I must say they are WONDERFUL. Though I will not be buying them anytime soon with their $300 price tag. Still, I think my world is too noisy, and I actually have taken steps to quiet it a bit. Walking. I used to have a pedometer that I clipped on to my pants, and I made certain that I walked more than 10,000 steps every day. That often meant walking in circles around the playground my kids were playing on rather than sitting on a nearby bench to just watch. It's a little thing, but those steps do make a huge difference. Makes me want to pay attention to moving more, even though I am a frequent exerciser. Everything in moderation. People who go to ""health"" extremes are just as at-risk as those who ignore their health. For wrinkles, one of the only things that actually works is Retin-A. But, like the Bose noise-cancelling headphones, it's bloody expensive, so I probably won't be trying that one anytime soon either.Chew more. Breathe from your stomach. Give thanks. Try new foods like kale and quinoa. Yes, I actually did buy these things on my last shopping trip. The kale was delicious. Haven't tried the quinoa yet (pronounced keen-wah by the way…) High Intensity Interval Training is most effective (which is good news for us Zumba enthusiasts…) Fidget. Actually use a smaller plate. Drink more water, specifically 15 minutes prior to meals. Have protein for breakfast. Eat spicy foods--they curb your appetite for salty and sweet and give your metabolism a boost. LOVED hearing that one. Eat more veggies. Avoid simple carbs. Add crunch to your food. Shop the perimeter of the store. If you're going to eat meat, eat it as a side dish. Don't use anti-bacterial soap, just use regular soap. Stuff I've heard before, but great tips nonetheless. One thing I think the book lacked was before and after pics. He told us his beginning and ending weight and other various stats, but after 2 years of regular gym attendance after never going previously, I would've thought pictures would be telling. But the pics he did include were great. The book as a whole was great. I'd recommend it."
144,141659907X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2349088-roberto-scarlato,5,"When I first sat down to read this book on my kindle, I had a pretty clear idea of how committed this writer really is to experimentation and research. I've read The Know-it-all and The Year of Living biblically and enjoyed them both. This author has the perfect balance of facts and humor that I've ever read.Not only does he plunge himself into the subjects he tackles but he does so for months or even years, reading every book on the subject he intends to document.So when I heard that he was completing his, what he calls, ""Mind, Body and Soul Trilogy"", I had to buy it right away. Chances are I will read it again.Since this is a non-fiction book, I decided to review it in three ways: entertainment, interesting and what I've learned.Is it entertaining?Yes, extremely. I marveled at the wealth of facts he's unearthed on health myths and just how far some people will go to remain healthy. Some fanatics are so into their own health clicks that they don't even know they are causing more harm than good. Like his other books, there were times when I had to put the book down because I had to walk off a laugh-out-loud moment. My wife thought I was crazy. I was so immersed and interested in knowing these healthy weirdoes. I laughed at the fact that there are people out there in public parks running around like cavemen thinking that doing so is the pinnacle of healthy living. I doubled over in a giggle fit finding out that the writer hurt his shoulder kayaking on the Wii console, or through his misadventures during a Laugh-Yoga class, or finding out that cursing alleviates stubbed toe pain. Yes, the laughs are not on every single page but there were more than enough to keep me reading.Is it interesting?I would say so. I was particularly surprised at just how many Health habits aren't good for you. There are people addicted to exercising or never getting sick. There are people obsessed with Whole Foods when really you will still find sugar around every corner and the only thing getting slimmer is your own wallet. As for the diets, he's tried them all. He even covered the South Beach Diet which I was on at one point. Yes it made me slim down slightly but I felt miserable the whole time.What I've learned?Since reading this book, I've become a firm believer in Chewdism. While I won't spend a full minute chewing my food, I do find myself slowing down and chewing my food more. I know that chocolate, especially dark chocolate, is good for your heart. I've become more health conscious, joining weight watchers to track my meals and doing Power90 exercises (35 minutes on weekdays) and feeling good about it. Whenever I can, I get up and walk around. I'm actually interested in buying a pedometer to measure how many steps I take in a regular work day. I used to be part Hypochondriac and part OCD but now I'm actively taking steps to limit those stray thoughts and feeling less worrisome about it. I now make a list of things I know I should not have: No Soda, No Ice Cream, No Burritos. In short, this book motivated me to get fit quick.As for the people who try to knock this one man's efforts, I would say that they should know that it isn't really all that healthy leaving a bad review to a well-researched, two-year invested, delightful escape into one subject that is so easy to laugh about. I mean, come on, the guy wrote this entire book while on a treadmill, that's commitment right there."
145,141659907X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/8213107-carolina,5,"Originally posted at: A Girl that Likes Books Who doesn’t want to be healthy? Specially now a days. I first bought this book for my boyfriend...actually I pre-order it; we got it the second day after it came out. Why? We are big fans of Jacobs and it was my boyfriend who introduced me to his books. Last year I read The Year of Living Biblically and in March of this year I read The Know-it-All. I was really excited to read it and, since I loved the other two, I had big expectations. Boy, did the book deliver. Jacobs spends 2 full years working on himself, taking care of this skin, meals, exercising, getting healthy...and happy. To quote the book: ""The key to making healthy decisions is to respect your future self. Honor him or her. Treat him or her like you would treat a friend or a loved one""As in his other books (I still have to read the Guinea Pig Diaries, but the order has been placed, and with 82% off!!!!) he doesn’t only talks about the “experiment” itself, but also how it affects him, his family and in smaller doses, about family in general. In the first book of the “series”, The Know-it-All, we learn about him and his wife trying to conceive, how his father also tried to read the whole Encyclopedia Britannica, and so on.In this book we meet his Grandfather, a remarkable 96 year old, with a lovely remark: ""You can retire, but you must find something you’re passionate about in your retirement. You need a reason to wake up in the morning""Something else that I really enjoy about his books, is the familiarity of the whole thing, I feel like a friend of mine is just telling me what he/she did during the week-end. The writing is fluid and casual, like a conversation. And I have to say, I love Julie, his wife. She has the patience of a saint, and her comments always make me smile. She tried some of the stuff with Jacobs in this book. I cannot blame her for not trying anything on the biblical year; at the same time, I loved her ""answer"" to a lot of the restrictions during that year...but I'm changing books here. Sorry.What did I learn with this book? That I’m doing fine, not great but fine in my own quest to be healthy. I watch my portions, and have also controlled a little of my roommate and my boyfriend; I’m lucky to work in an environment that is not highly noisy; I don’t wear as much sunscreen as is recommended, but the point I’ve been trying to carve in my friend’s brains was valid, it does make a difference to apply sunscreen in the morning; I love my Pilates class, even when it hurts the day after, “luckily” I cannot spend 8 hours sitting at the lab, since I have to move from one room to the other in order to finish my experiment. I could still be more active though.And finally, my favorite of them all: Reading before going to sleep, might actually be helpful to sleep better! (As long as is a non-electronic book J)Truth be told, I learnt about a ton of new tendencies, but the main point is that everything has to be done in moderation. From eating, to exercising, you cannot...should not exaggerate. Did I like this book? Oh yes! I think is my favorite book from Jacobs...we will see how it goes with the Guinea Pig Diaries."
146,141659907X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/125347-donovan,4,"Funny, loaded with great tips, easy to read and applicable to me - an overweight health conscience individual who wants to make health a priority, but constantly find himself overwhelmed with all of the opinions, contrary advice and amount of research (not to mention miss guided priorities and laziness).Recently, I spend close to a thousand dollars for an initial appointment with a naturopathic doctor. While I'm still in the evaluation process, I can't help looking skeptically at a number of his recommendations, some very contrary to other things I've read (excessive fat is ok, eat lots of meat, etc). What I loved about A. J. is he shares this healthy skepticism and he looks at things practically and methodically, but with an open mind and a willingness to try everything. I felt like he did it for the rest of us. His book project and advance gave him the time to do what the rest of us want to know, but don't have time to do (oh wait, he also is an editor for Esquire...so I guess that is another excuse). Anyway, he confirmed my thoughts on many issues and I'm happy to just following along with his conclusions - and in others situations I want to do a little more research before forming an opinion, but his practical advice definitely gives me a head start.His wit and writing make the book easy to follow. I read the first half on a cross country flight and the only thing that made me put it down was the passengers getting up all around me. The rest I finished during my brief period of reading before bed - a tip I've taken from A.J. that I'm determined to make a habit.Much of the advice is stuff you already know, but it serves as a great reminder. Exercise more - eat less - sleep more - relax - smile often, etc. Other things were less intuitive - don't read on toilet - observe Sabbath - avoid pedicures like the plague - etc.One of the most delightful things about the book is his sense of humor - it helped a book on health flow. Here's some quotes to give you a flavor of his under toned, slightly sarcastic, humor.""I did get a colonic, but I've decided not write about it at length. I didn't find it helpful or enlightening. I can tell you want it felt like, though: It felt like someone shooting water up your butt.""""Cigarettes' cost far outweigh any resulting trimness, just as asphyxiation outweighs the benefits of stretching out the spine when you hang yourself from a shower curtain rod.""""The MRI has a repertoire of noises that resemble, in no particular order: a game-show buzzer for a wrong answer, urgent knocking, a modem from 1992, a grizzly-bear growl, and a man with a raspy voice shouting what sounds like ""mother cooler!""""After decimating several vegetables, I decide juicing is my favorite form of food preparation. There's something perversely appealing about subjecting an innocent plant to that much violence.""""The dehydrator blows warm air on your food for hours, sometimes days. It reminds me of the temperature and intensity of dog's breath. So imagine a German shepherd exhaling on your fruit for a weekend.""""So, if weight loss is your goal, and you have impressive self-control, raw food is something to consider.""""Step back for a minute. Pretend you're from Mars. From a coldly rational point of view, pedestrian helmets aren't a crazy idea."""
147,141659907X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/879591-sara,4,"I won an advanced copy of this book through the First Reads program. The author has written previous books about various life experiments he's conducted; I'd previously read his book about living biblically for a year, trying to follow all the numerous, and sometimes conflicting, rules in the Bible. This book is along the same lines, following his adventures over the course of two years as he strives to be the healthiest person in the world. This means changing his lifestyle to adopt healthier habits, working out in various ways that are supposed to be best for your health, eating a better diet, and so on.I wouldn't call this book ""hilarious,"" but it's definitely amusing. Not only are his adventures in the name of health entertaining, but his writing is extremely witty. Even though you might begin reading the book with the thought that he's simply doing this healthy experiment to write a book about it, the results are so interesting and he does so much research about it, throwing himself into this fully, that you can't help but enjoy. I loved all the descriptions of the ways in which he tries to work out, and the diets he follows, even for brief periods of time. As he points out, there is so much conflicting advice out there about how to be healthy, how to work out properly, how to eat your way to health... it's exhausting. And yet he attempts to follow many of the regiments in the name of science. One of my favorite parts of the book came when he follows the ""Caveman Workout"", exercising the way cavemen supposedly did, shirtless and barefoot in Central Park, lifting logs in lieu of boulders with a handful of other men in this Paleo Movement. He paints such a vivid picture of what he's doing, and you can't help but laugh at some of the ridiculousness he encounters, with devoted followers to each and every movement.It was also entertaining to hear his adventures following some of the diets that have been hyped up as the way to health - the raw food diet, the no-carb diet, the juice cleanse... He not only describes what the diet entails, but he goes on to talk about what different scientists and health professionals have said about the diet, and then describes his own experiences following it. One of the more memorable parts for me was his description of the juice cleanse, buying the way expensive juices touted by B-list celebrities, then trying to starve off hunger as he craved anything solid to eat. For all the entertainment found in this book, there is also some advice about health and ways that you really can make a difference in your own life without going completely overboard. I enjoyed the balance of everything, as it never felt as if I was reading a self-help book, but simply an entertaining social experiment that left me with some helpful advice. I imagine that not everyone will like this book, as its dry humor and ridiculous situations could seem off-putting at first. However, if you're interested in reading about someone's adventures participating in all sorts of health fads - some that you've heard of, others that are completely strange - and hearing about it all from a self-deprecating but witty narrator, this is a great book. I'd easily recommend it."
148,141659907X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/68833154-zack-wussow,2,"It's ok. I found this one less interesting than his others, but that may be because I was already familiar with a lot of the material already, unlike his biblical and encyclopedic books. And the last third is a totally useless index. For example: incidental exercise (fidgeting), and on the page listed the only reference is '...even fidgeting (or as so and so calls it, incidental exercise) can be good exercise...' No one needs an index for that!"
149,141659907X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1288876-julie-g,4,"Remember that time I read The Year of Living Biblically and raved about it and then A.J. Jacobs EMAILED ME??? Me too. I was a brand-new blogger and almost died when I realized that authors actually read blogger reviews and respond to them. So basically, besides the fact that The Year of Living Biblically was incredibly well done, the fact that A.J. Jacobs actually replied to my review (which, let's be honest, was not that great) made me a fan for life. I was dying to read this one and the perfect opportunity arose when Jennie got a copy from Goodreads (I think). She passed it on to me and I'm supposed to pass it on to Jacki, which I really do intend to do one day in the very near future. Really.So Drop Dead Healthy is similar to Jacobs' other books in terms of the whole guinea-pig thing. Basically his style is to choose something and learn all about it by using his life as an experiment. In The Year of Living Biblically, he spends an entire year living as close as he can to Old Testament law. In The Know It All he reads through an entire set of encyclopedias. In Drop Dead Healthy, the theme is phsyical fitness and how to achieve it. Jacobs goes through all of the body systems, one by one, and tries out different methods, diets, and fitness regimes and chronicles their success.WritingI, for one, think Jacobs is hilarious. His sense of humor is spot on with my tastes and I spent most of the book laughing out loud. It's written like a memoir and it's about his personal experiences, but he also includes good background information from a scientific standpoint and references many other texts that offer the data and research information that is missing from his own personal experiences. I probably added ten or so books to my to-be-read list based on Jacobs' references. I think he did a great job of balancing the scientific information with humor and his own personal anecdotes. Entertainment ValueAgain, the book was really funny. I like humor and I like learning new things, and Jacobs combines both in his books. I'm also interested right now in dieting and fitness, so this gave me some insight into what worked and what didn't, for Jacobs at least, as well as what the current trends are - and what I ought to avoid. The caveman workout, for example, isn't one I'm anxious to try any time soon.OverallI highly recommend picking this one up. It's a fast read, informative and funny. I think it's a good jumping off place for those who enjoy humor or memoir and are interested in non-fiction, as well as those who are interested in health and fitness. It's a good way to ease your way into more hard-core scientific reads (and provides a great list of those more in-depth books as well). Thank you, Jennie, for sending me your copy and I promise I'll have it on its way to Jacki ASAP!"

I can't say I learned a lot that I didn't already know, but it was certainly interesting and entertaining at times reading A.J.'s chronicles of health experiments - some logical, some a bit absurd (hence, the funny bit). Read it for the journey, not the destination."

If you have ever wondered about certain fad diets, what kind of exercise is ""best"" or just want to enjoy a book, I recommend this. (The audio version is incredibly enjoyable!)"

167,141659907X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/12497233-karen,4,"September feels like a ""new year,"" even though I've been out of school for two decades, and so I read this thinking, I need to lose several pounds and just generally get up and get out more. But where to start? And what's the best, most effective way to do so? There are entire libraries out there devoted to the subject, but this book is actually an entertaining look - and for that, it gets 4-stars. To actually make healthy living - with advice based on science and sound, rational reasoning - into a book that can be read without making the reader feel bad, obese or on death's door? Well, that's a true feat.A.J. Jacobs does this by making himself the guinea pig, a gimmick he's used on the Bible and on Internet-level knowledge. In this case, he goes through body parts, looking at the science and what it says about how to achieve maximum healthfulness, which in this case doesn't mean model-thinness. The book's real message is how little we know about how the body works and what can and will make it work better. There's too many complicating factors to know for sure what makes carrots good for us, for example, because there's just as many complicating factors that make carrots bad for us. (Smoking seems to be that one exception.)My quibble with this book is that we spend lots of time on A.J.'s time with cavemen fitness freaks, for example, because it's a cutesy story, but very little time with almost everything else. There's so much stuffed in here and some of the stories/appointments/tests/trials are reduced to a paragraph. Eating raw food for a week, for example, gets about a half page. Still, I found the advice in the book helpful and somewhat obvious. (It's nice to have it confirmed.) Move more, make that movement a pattern of intensity and moderation, steer clear of white foods and get a good night's sleep. It's already gotten me up off the couch, combing through my pantry and doing 5-minute workouts for 4 cycles. That good night's sleep remains elusive! "
168,141659907X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1499157-rod-hilton,3,"I'm a big fan of A.J. Jacobs, I've read all of his other books and I generally find him to be a humorous and engaging writer. Drop Dead Healthy is no exception to this, it's interesting and funny throughout, but it's not as good as his other books.Jacobs wrote a book where he read the entire Encyclopedia, and one where he decided to follow the Bible literally for a year (both great books), both of which were long-term, very focused experiments with his life. Then he wrote a book which was more a collection of random, short experiments (The Guinea Pig Diaries), more or less a collection of short articles about doing random crap for a month or so. This third book is the weakest of the set because it lacks the focus of the first two books.So when I saw his new book was about trying to become healthy, it seemed to me like a return to form: a focused, directed book again. He even tries to link this book to his earlier two, by claiming that the first was about the mind, the second the spirit, and this the body, making something of a trilogy out of them. Unfortunately, that's not really how the book turned out.Drop Dead Healthy is, once again, a collection of short experiments, with one experiment per chapter. He tries the gym for one, he tries dieting for one, he goes Paleo for one, he focuses on germs for one, he focuses on getting peace and quiet for one (seriously?), he tries to have more sex for one, he focuses on toxins in his home for one, he works on his teeth for one, etc. He devotes chapters to posture, smell, sleeping, eyesight, and many more. Most of the chapters just have A.J. moving from random study to random study, trying it out for a bit and humorously talking about the impact on his life.What the book lacks is a focus like his first two similar outings. An entire book focused on A.J. trying to eat right and work out would have been great. He could have included his Paleo experiments, his experiments with different kinds of workout routines, free-running, treadmills, etc. Most of this material is instead relegated to a handful of chapters, and the rest is focused on stuff only barely related to the book's concept of trying to live healthy. The conclusion I came to was that A.J. didn't like eating healthy and working out, so he didn't stick to it very well for the full 2 years of the book, and instead had to pad the book with a bunch of random crap about massage treatments and smelling better and improving his posture to reach book length. I particularly hated his insistence on giving equal (or more) time to new agey nonsense, largely inspired by his Aunt. This sort of thing makes for perhaps an interesting article or two in Esquire, but it seems barely related to the concept of the book.It's unfortunate, the chapters that actually relate to HEALTHY living are interesting, so an entire book devoted to them would have been great. A.J.'s usual wit and charm make the chapters about random junk interesting and fun to read, but they make the overall book seem muddled and directionless. The book is also, unfortunately, not terribly informative. A.J. doesn't do much to distinguish between what actually works in terms of getting healthy and what doesn't. Someone looking to get healthy will be ENTERTAINED by this book, but won't learn anything from it. Finally, I'd like to make special mention of Jacob's wife, who really comes off like a pain in the ass in this book. As a person who lost a lot of weight I can tell you having your spouse be encouraging when you lose weight makes a huge difference. At one point after A.J. has been working hard on changing his eating habits and losing a few pounds, Julie tells him he went from looking 4 months pregnant to 3.5. If my wife had told me that after working hard I'd have had my motivation totally sapped. His wife usually comes off as a tolerant but somewhat disapproving person, graciously putting up with A.J.'s craziness while making occasional offhand remarks (she's the stereotypical ""sane wife married to a hilarious manchild"" so common in crappy sitcoms). In this book, she comes off like a real jerk, constantly making obnoxious remarks about the author.Overall, it's better than Guinea Pig Diaries, but nowhere near as good as Know-It-All or Living Biblically."
169,141659907X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3312882-rachel-p,4,"I won this book as a goodreads giveaway and I am so glad I did! In his novel, “Drop Dead Healthy”, A.J. Jacobs documents his 2 year long journey to become the healthiest man alive. He does a tremendous amount of research and reads a vast amount of studies from a variety of sources on the subject of human health. I appreciate how he makes this book about total health instead of just about diet and exercise. He breaks down the story by body part; focusing on a different part of the body in each chapter.**SPOILER ALERT**I actually rate this book 4.5 stars. I really enjoyed how he went for it; fitness crazes, fad diets, alternative medicine, etc. Out of the mountain of research he selected a few key studies to relate and expert advice to pursue. I took pleasure in learning about the calorie restrictive diet (living on the edge of starvation), the Paleo Movement (living like a cavemen), walking and running barefoot, replacing manufactured beauty products (such as shampoo and soap) with natural alternatives (such as baking soda and vinegar). Somethings I tried out with great success (like deskercising – desk exercising) and somethings I wouldn’t go near unless I got my own book deal (like acupuncture). It is a spectacular read but there are a few issues that prevent me from giving it the full 5 stars. For instance, there are two chapters on the stomach in which A.J. discusses different diets he’s trying but the diet is an ever-present element of the entire journey and I don’t feel like he always devotes as much attention to it as he should. For example, the author mentions at the end of a chapter he started eating steel cut oatmeal but doesn’t mention why or how this came about. I know that he didn’t want to make this book too long and perhaps in the interest of prioritization he couldn’t explain every food/diet choice and how it came about but I personally would have been interested in learning much more. He does sum up key points in the appendices but I still think it’s not enough. There are also no consistent measurements reported at the end of each chapter except weight. Granted, I don’t expect a whole long list of measurement indices but more consistency would’ve been better.Here are a few key highlights that I took away: - Eat on smaller plates because we tend to eat everything that’s on our plates. - Chew your food thoroughly and eat with family and friends instead of watching TV or reading. You will eat slower and thus give your body the 20 minutes it needs to feel full. - Stand more and choose activities (or modify existing ones) that put you in motion. Studies show that spending 1 hour at the gym and the rest of the day at a desk or on the couch is not much better for you than if you spent the whole day stationary. - There’s no such thing as superfoods. All fruits and veggies are equally good for you. Just make sure you wash non-organic produce in hot water and vinegar and let sit for 5 minutes. - Set fitness goals. Buy a pedometer and complete against yourself or a partner to see how many steps you can walk in a day (the recommended amount is 10,000 steps or 5 miles per day). Also, registering for a marathon and then having to train for it is great motivation to get or stay in shape. - Keep your brain fit by challenging yourself and trying new things.  - Enjoy life. Don’t let your health become a preoccupation to the exclusion of all other aspects of your life. Enjoy spending time with people that you love and you are happy to be around. Don’t waste time stressing over getting enough exercise or counting calories. This novel is packed with so much quality information it is definitely a keeper for me. A.J. is very relatable starting out as your average out of shape American male. He includes his family in his health project and intersperses his story with personal anecdotes which I think make his experience more real. And his writing is hilarious; I’m talking LAUGH OUT LOUD funny. So I actually burned calories while reading this book especially when I was doing it while iPloding on my treadmill desk. Thanks A.J.!"
170,141659907X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4962920-jill-furedy,4,"A.J. Jacobs is amusing as always, and had I come away feeling that I'd learned some relevant health tips, I'd have given the book more stars. Part of that may be my personal issues though, reading about a mostly healthy, if somewhat neurotic and underexercised man pursue ultimate health doesn't necessarily translate to a nutritionally challenged woman with Crohn's disease! So when he's talking about dried mangoes as his vice and I'm eating cheetos, I'm thinking he's already ahead of me in the dietary department. And when he's eating walnuts or apples, I'm wishing I could eat those without getting sick. And in a twist of odd timing, I read the stomach revistied section in the waiting room for my follow up appointment to get a b12 shot, to try and get back to normal levels, and where I was instructed to pick up calcium citrate and vitamin D, both of which were areas I'm a bit low on, as well and being told to cut back on sugars as I'm not yet prediabetic, but still too high. So maybe that's why his giving up dried mangoes seemed unimpressive, when I know how much more I need to change my diet! Though I did like his Odysseus contract to give them up.  Anyway, Jacobs clearly needed more exercise, but basically it was pneumonia that motivated him to begin the project, rather than a chronic health issue or doctors orders. Reminded me a bit of the Happiness Project, where a woman who was not unhappy nevertheless sets about to improve her happiness levels. On the one hand, I agree with her theory...work on it before you HAVE to and it will be easier should circumstances change. Which definately applies to health as well. But it still makes their self imposed challenges seem less impressive than those overcoming more severe obstacles.  But Jacobs is fun to read, so I was willing to see where he went with this. I hoped to pick up a few health tips, but I don't think I came away with much. He wasn't on either his vegan or his protein-heavy diets long enough to really see any differences (I believe he gave two weeks to each). Moderation and portion control have always been my go-to diet method. He writes about his adventures with juicers and dehydrators, but only mentions his introductions of quinoa, bok choy, and other foods in his statistic notes. Did he know how to cook this stuff that he'd never eaten before? Or did his wife know? Did he actually like it, or just eat it because it's healthy? And the chronolgy isn't as straight forward as his chapters imply, so things overlapped or happened in different orders, which sometimes threw me off. I liked that he had a team of experts he was relying on, but he looks into so many things and mentions the kooky alongside the scientifically backed, all of it told in his humorous storytelling format, so that not a lot of it stuck with me.  As with his religion book (I haven't read The Know It All), I think someone looking for straight up humor might find his books too fact heavy, and someone looking for tips or wisdom might find his books a little too specific to his life to be applied generally, or might find the treatment a bit too light. The publisher category is biography which is the probably the only way to classify it in order to meet expectations of genre: You have to be looking for a mix of the humor and info for his adventures to resonate. His stories of his wife, grandpa, aunt Marti help balance the humor and his obsession, so that you can tell he is living a real life while assigning himself these odd tasks. And I can see how his health lessons will disappear from my mind since I hear so much of it in magazines, TV shows, etc, but if anything sticks with me about the book it will probably be the elements involving his family or even those side characters who reappear, like his trainer or the Cave Man. I usually judge a book by how original or memorable it is, and those characters don't carry quite enough of this book for me to think I'll be able to tell you much about it next year. But it hit a few touching moments, was a quick fun read, had an occasional look into something unfamiliar, and plenty of humor, so it was all I expected of it. "
171,141659907X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1270609-brittany,3,"How I Came To Read This Book: I'm guessing I heard about it in Entertainment Weekly. I've always been fascinated by biology and the human body, and A.J. Jacobs' (semi-serious) quest to become the healthiest man alive was intriguing - and turned out to be quite different than what I'd bargained for, in a good way.The Plot: A.J. Jacobs is sort of the Morgan Spurlock of the nonfiction / journalism world. His past two books were all about taking on epic, life-altering projects (reading the encyclopaedia and following the rules of the Bible to the letter), and this one is no different. After exercising his mind and exploring his faith, this book is focused on all the crazy ways we try to get and stay healthy - from the inside out, top down. Each chapter is centered on a particular body part, and Jacobs' forays into speaking with experts, trying out routines, and somewhat attempting to bust myths by separating the fact from fiction in those medical claims (i.e. blueberries are not the world's best superfruit. If you believe it, the Maine marketing folks have done a good job). The Good & The Bad: Like I said, this book was really different than I anticipated. It was more of an intellectual and experiential smorgasbord of anecdotes and experiences, some given no more weight than a sentence, as opposed to a deep-digging day-by-day progress story (although there is some chronology to the book). On the plus side, it made for a quite light and easy read, filled with those bite-sized snippets of information our generation so craves. On the negative, I never felt like the book really went particularly deep into any one direction - although perhaps rightfully so. By the end of the book, Jacobs' himself acknowledges we still don't know so much, and that what worked for him might not work for you. The main takeaway here is to at least be aware of some of the major hazards we are exposed to, and see if changing some behaviours will have a positive impact on your life. If it does, great - I can say myself, I've been sampling ideas from the book over the last week and have enjoyed them / have many more I want to try out (drinking ice water *burns* calories!) My favourite is the advice to try standing for (at least) an hour or two during your workday - I leave work feeling way less mushy in the brain and the legs. At the same time, I also appreciated that some of the extremist examples Jacobs' references - many of which were more amusing than anything - probably aren't for everyone. It was amazing how often peoples behaviours' were inconclusively linked to their health, or how many contradictory studies exist out there. You get the sense that Jacobs may have gone into this looking for a foolproof guide to healthiness by examining all angles, and what he ends up with is a hedgehog of ideas that's hard to conceptualize into anything tangible. I'm not saying I went into this book expecting a miracle health book - that's definitely not the intent. But it's so surface and skims through so much at times, it's hard to rate this higher than a 3. I did enjoy it, and I think anyone with a passing interest in biology and health will enjoy it as much as I did, but I wish - not for lack of Jacobs' trying - it gave me a little more conclusive insight. The Bottom Line: A bit of a lark, but has some real insight you can incorporate into your everyday life. Anything Memorable?: I found it weird that Jacobs frequently - I mean every chapter practically - talked about advocating a plant-based diet yet didn't actual delve into it in any real form, other than a brief foray into raw veganism (not for me). That was one of the weaknesses of the book I suppose - it delved into extremes, which, while amusing and enlightening, wasn't all that practical. 60-book Challenge?: Book #43 in 2012"
172,141659907X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/10093055-angie-fehl,4,"I'm revisiting Jacobs' work in experimental journalism -- a process where he gives himself one monumental project, usually for a year or so, and writes a whole book about the process. The first of these I read was his book A Year Of Living Biblically, where he attempted to live by biblical era standards of clothing, diet, etc as literally as possible. I believe Drop Dead Healthy was written before that one, though. In this book, Jacobs, inspired by his own health scare, decides to take on a slew of popular diets, exercise programs and health fads, equipment, technology, treatments. Each chapter covers one specific area of his body (heart health, lung improvement, leg strength, etc.), detailing what all he got into to improve that particular area. Since he's writing from a male perspective, he even gets looks into how to improve testicular health. Just some of the topics he researches (and what he discovers in the process):> Vitamin C helps fight peridontal disease, but citrus is rough on tooth enamel.. soo... > ""Orthorexia"" is a term coined by Dr. Steven Bratman to describe when people fixate SO hard on dieting, to the point of the stress actually outweighing any nutritional benefits. Jacobs himself also refers to this mode of thinking as ""health food fetishism"". That said, Jacobs also puts himself on a few of the trendiest diet plans -- Paleo, Raw, No Sugar, and juice cleanse routines -- just to see how he fares and what it does for his body. At the time he was writing this book, he also managed to snag an interview with health guru Jack Lalanne (who has since passed away, age 96).> Jacobs researches the benefits of acupuncture, laugh yoga, and ""worry exchange"", where you literally team up with someone else -- they worry about your problems, you worry about theirs. He also looks at ""neurobic exercise"" for the brain: doing your daily tasks but doing them in the reverse order you naturally would (ie. taking a different route to work, using your non-dominant hand as your dominant for a time, etc.). He also looks into some of the newer trends like anti-gravity yoga (Sky Gym type places) and Strollercise for new moms, as well as programs for the more hardcore minded -- CrossFit and the Roman Legionnaire workout, which apparently involves smashing logs out in the woods with iron mallets?! Jacobs even takes on pole dancing classes! He also attempts to make it family get-together time when he does treadmill work and Pilates class with his mom and weight training with his dad. > Jacobs describes using Odysseus contracts (aka Ulysses Contracts) to help keep him on his goals. If I remember correctly, this was also a tool he mentions using in A Year Of Living Biblically. What keeps me reading Jacobs' books is not only the education the reader is given from all the data this guy compiles with each project, but also the fact that he can writes these books with such great humor, often poking fun at his own shortcomings.I personally loved how he talked about being all gung ho for this particular experiment and then catches a cold shortly into the program X-P Also, his record of all his wife's reactions and responses to what he's doing or what he brings home is definitely bonus entertainment. The chapters are nicely laid out in a sort of log or journal form so all the science and such that Jacobs covers is not overwhelming for the reader. So if you're all about becoming a more knowledgeable person, I wholeheartedly recommend getting into some of his works. Even if it feels like a lot of information at once, you can do what I do and just take a chapter or two a day, process that and then go on to the next section. You'll be surprised at the wealth of info that sticks in your noggin!"
173,141659907X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/647117-nicole,4,"Wow--I really plowed through this book! I'm a big fan of AJ Jacobs, and have read all of his books, which all fall into the ""immersion-journalism"" category. As usual, AJ Jacobs wrote a highly entertaining and informative book documenting his 2 years of striving to become the healthiest man alive. As a bit of a health-nut myself, I didn't just read this book for entertainment purposes, I actually paid attention for health tips. So, here's some of what I found interesting: Meditation is extraordinarily good for your health. Yes, I already knew this, but I have a problem with what I call ""spazzy-brain syndrome"". But, I'm not alone here, and what AJ does is he meditates by watching the gently pulsating sleep-mode light on a Macbook and breathes in sync with it. I never noticed that the sleep light actually resembles the deep breathing of sleep. So I tried it. And it gave my brain some focus. Nice tip AJ.Something else that caught my attention as a ""dietaholic"" who has tried just about every diet out there, I was interested to read that the Mediterranean Diet is the most widely accepted diet with the most scientific backing. It's a diet that I haven't specifically tried, though it sounds right up my alley.Noise-pollution…a health hazard I have previously given very little thought to, although reading about it did encourage me to try on the Bose noise-canceling headphones that he talks about, and I must say they are WONDERFUL. Though I will not be buying them anytime soon with their $300 price tag. Still, I think my world is too noisy, and I actually have taken steps to quiet it a bit. Walking. I used to have a pedometer that I clipped on to my pants, and I made certain that I walked more than 10,000 steps every day. That often meant walking in circles around the playground my kids were playing on rather than sitting on a nearby bench to just watch. It's a little thing, but those steps do make a huge difference. Makes me want to pay attention to moving more, even though I am a frequent exerciser. Everything in moderation. People who go to ""health"" extremes are just as at-risk as those who ignore their health. For wrinkles, one of the only things that actually works is Retin-A. But, like the Bose noise-cancelling headphones, it's bloody expensive, so I probably won't be trying that one anytime soon either.Chew more. Breathe from your stomach. Give thanks. Try new foods like kale and quinoa. Yes, I actually did buy these things on my last shopping trip. The kale was delicious. Haven't tried the quinoa yet (pronounced keen-wah by the way…) High Intensity Interval Training is most effective (which is good news for us Zumba enthusiasts…) Fidget. Actually use a smaller plate. Drink more water, specifically 15 minutes prior to meals. Have protein for breakfast. Eat spicy foods--they curb your appetite for salty and sweet and give your metabolism a boost. LOVED hearing that one. Eat more veggies. Avoid simple carbs. Add crunch to your food. Shop the perimeter of the store. If you're going to eat meat, eat it as a side dish. Don't use anti-bacterial soap, just use regular soap. Stuff I've heard before, but great tips nonetheless. One thing I think the book lacked was before and after pics. He told us his beginning and ending weight and other various stats, but after 2 years of regular gym attendance after never going previously, I would've thought pictures would be telling. But the pics he did include were great. The book as a whole was great. I'd recommend it."
174,141659907X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2349088-roberto-scarlato,5,"When I first sat down to read this book on my kindle, I had a pretty clear idea of how committed this writer really is to experimentation and research. I've read The Know-it-all and The Year of Living biblically and enjoyed them both. This author has the perfect balance of facts and humor that I've ever read.Not only does he plunge himself into the subjects he tackles but he does so for months or even years, reading every book on the subject he intends to document.So when I heard that he was completing his, what he calls, ""Mind, Body and Soul Trilogy"", I had to buy it right away. Chances are I will read it again.Since this is a non-fiction book, I decided to review it in three ways: entertainment, interesting and what I've learned.Is it entertaining?Yes, extremely. I marveled at the wealth of facts he's unearthed on health myths and just how far some people will go to remain healthy. Some fanatics are so into their own health clicks that they don't even know they are causing more harm than good. Like his other books, there were times when I had to put the book down because I had to walk off a laugh-out-loud moment. My wife thought I was crazy. I was so immersed and interested in knowing these healthy weirdoes. I laughed at the fact that there are people out there in public parks running around like cavemen thinking that doing so is the pinnacle of healthy living. I doubled over in a giggle fit finding out that the writer hurt his shoulder kayaking on the Wii console, or through his misadventures during a Laugh-Yoga class, or finding out that cursing alleviates stubbed toe pain. Yes, the laughs are not on every single page but there were more than enough to keep me reading.Is it interesting?I would say so. I was particularly surprised at just how many Health habits aren't good for you. There are people addicted to exercising or never getting sick. There are people obsessed with Whole Foods when really you will still find sugar around every corner and the only thing getting slimmer is your own wallet. As for the diets, he's tried them all. He even covered the South Beach Diet which I was on at one point. Yes it made me slim down slightly but I felt miserable the whole time.What I've learned?Since reading this book, I've become a firm believer in Chewdism. While I won't spend a full minute chewing my food, I do find myself slowing down and chewing my food more. I know that chocolate, especially dark chocolate, is good for your heart. I've become more health conscious, joining weight watchers to track my meals and doing Power90 exercises (35 minutes on weekdays) and feeling good about it. Whenever I can, I get up and walk around. I'm actually interested in buying a pedometer to measure how many steps I take in a regular work day. I used to be part Hypochondriac and part OCD but now I'm actively taking steps to limit those stray thoughts and feeling less worrisome about it. I now make a list of things I know I should not have: No Soda, No Ice Cream, No Burritos. In short, this book motivated me to get fit quick.As for the people who try to knock this one man's efforts, I would say that they should know that it isn't really all that healthy leaving a bad review to a well-researched, two-year invested, delightful escape into one subject that is so easy to laugh about. I mean, come on, the guy wrote this entire book while on a treadmill, that's commitment right there."
175,141659907X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/8213107-carolina,5,"Originally posted at: A Girl that Likes Books Who doesn’t want to be healthy? Specially now a days. I first bought this book for my boyfriend...actually I pre-order it; we got it the second day after it came out. Why? We are big fans of Jacobs and it was my boyfriend who introduced me to his books. Last year I read The Year of Living Biblically and in March of this year I read The Know-it-All. I was really excited to read it and, since I loved the other two, I had big expectations. Boy, did the book deliver. Jacobs spends 2 full years working on himself, taking care of this skin, meals, exercising, getting healthy...and happy. To quote the book: ""The key to making healthy decisions is to respect your future self. Honor him or her. Treat him or her like you would treat a friend or a loved one""As in his other books (I still have to read the Guinea Pig Diaries, but the order has been placed, and with 82% off!!!!) he doesn’t only talks about the “experiment” itself, but also how it affects him, his family and in smaller doses, about family in general. In the first book of the “series”, The Know-it-All, we learn about him and his wife trying to conceive, how his father also tried to read the whole Encyclopedia Britannica, and so on.In this book we meet his Grandfather, a remarkable 96 year old, with a lovely remark: ""You can retire, but you must find something you’re passionate about in your retirement. You need a reason to wake up in the morning""Something else that I really enjoy about his books, is the familiarity of the whole thing, I feel like a friend of mine is just telling me what he/she did during the week-end. The writing is fluid and casual, like a conversation. And I have to say, I love Julie, his wife. She has the patience of a saint, and her comments always make me smile. She tried some of the stuff with Jacobs in this book. I cannot blame her for not trying anything on the biblical year; at the same time, I loved her ""answer"" to a lot of the restrictions during that year...but I'm changing books here. Sorry.What did I learn with this book? That I’m doing fine, not great but fine in my own quest to be healthy. I watch my portions, and have also controlled a little of my roommate and my boyfriend; I’m lucky to work in an environment that is not highly noisy; I don’t wear as much sunscreen as is recommended, but the point I’ve been trying to carve in my friend’s brains was valid, it does make a difference to apply sunscreen in the morning; I love my Pilates class, even when it hurts the day after, “luckily” I cannot spend 8 hours sitting at the lab, since I have to move from one room to the other in order to finish my experiment. I could still be more active though.And finally, my favorite of them all: Reading before going to sleep, might actually be helpful to sleep better! (As long as is a non-electronic book J)Truth be told, I learnt about a ton of new tendencies, but the main point is that everything has to be done in moderation. From eating, to exercising, you cannot...should not exaggerate. Did I like this book? Oh yes! I think is my favorite book from Jacobs...we will see how it goes with the Guinea Pig Diaries."
176,141659907X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/125347-donovan,4,"Funny, loaded with great tips, easy to read and applicable to me - an overweight health conscience individual who wants to make health a priority, but constantly find himself overwhelmed with all of the opinions, contrary advice and amount of research (not to mention miss guided priorities and laziness).Recently, I spend close to a thousand dollars for an initial appointment with a naturopathic doctor. While I'm still in the evaluation process, I can't help looking skeptically at a number of his recommendations, some very contrary to other things I've read (excessive fat is ok, eat lots of meat, etc). What I loved about A. J. is he shares this healthy skepticism and he looks at things practically and methodically, but with an open mind and a willingness to try everything. I felt like he did it for the rest of us. His book project and advance gave him the time to do what the rest of us want to know, but don't have time to do (oh wait, he also is an editor for Esquire...so I guess that is another excuse). Anyway, he confirmed my thoughts on many issues and I'm happy to just following along with his conclusions - and in others situations I want to do a little more research before forming an opinion, but his practical advice definitely gives me a head start.His wit and writing make the book easy to follow. I read the first half on a cross country flight and the only thing that made me put it down was the passengers getting up all around me. The rest I finished during my brief period of reading before bed - a tip I've taken from A.J. that I'm determined to make a habit.Much of the advice is stuff you already know, but it serves as a great reminder. Exercise more - eat less - sleep more - relax - smile often, etc. Other things were less intuitive - don't read on toilet - observe Sabbath - avoid pedicures like the plague - etc.One of the most delightful things about the book is his sense of humor - it helped a book on health flow. Here's some quotes to give you a flavor of his under toned, slightly sarcastic, humor.""I did get a colonic, but I've decided not write about it at length. I didn't find it helpful or enlightening. I can tell you want it felt like, though: It felt like someone shooting water up your butt.""""Cigarettes' cost far outweigh any resulting trimness, just as asphyxiation outweighs the benefits of stretching out the spine when you hang yourself from a shower curtain rod.""""The MRI has a repertoire of noises that resemble, in no particular order: a game-show buzzer for a wrong answer, urgent knocking, a modem from 1992, a grizzly-bear growl, and a man with a raspy voice shouting what sounds like ""mother cooler!""""After decimating several vegetables, I decide juicing is my favorite form of food preparation. There's something perversely appealing about subjecting an innocent plant to that much violence.""""The dehydrator blows warm air on your food for hours, sometimes days. It reminds me of the temperature and intensity of dog's breath. So imagine a German shepherd exhaling on your fruit for a weekend.""""So, if weight loss is your goal, and you have impressive self-control, raw food is something to consider.""""Step back for a minute. Pretend you're from Mars. From a coldly rational point of view, pedestrian helmets aren't a crazy idea."""
177,141659907X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/879591-sara,4,"I won an advanced copy of this book through the First Reads program. The author has written previous books about various life experiments he's conducted; I'd previously read his book about living biblically for a year, trying to follow all the numerous, and sometimes conflicting, rules in the Bible. This book is along the same lines, following his adventures over the course of two years as he strives to be the healthiest person in the world. This means changing his lifestyle to adopt healthier habits, working out in various ways that are supposed to be best for your health, eating a better diet, and so on.I wouldn't call this book ""hilarious,"" but it's definitely amusing. Not only are his adventures in the name of health entertaining, but his writing is extremely witty. Even though you might begin reading the book with the thought that he's simply doing this healthy experiment to write a book about it, the results are so interesting and he does so much research about it, throwing himself into this fully, that you can't help but enjoy. I loved all the descriptions of the ways in which he tries to work out, and the diets he follows, even for brief periods of time. As he points out, there is so much conflicting advice out there about how to be healthy, how to work out properly, how to eat your way to health... it's exhausting. And yet he attempts to follow many of the regiments in the name of science. One of my favorite parts of the book came when he follows the ""Caveman Workout"", exercising the way cavemen supposedly did, shirtless and barefoot in Central Park, lifting logs in lieu of boulders with a handful of other men in this Paleo Movement. He paints such a vivid picture of what he's doing, and you can't help but laugh at some of the ridiculousness he encounters, with devoted followers to each and every movement.It was also entertaining to hear his adventures following some of the diets that have been hyped up as the way to health - the raw food diet, the no-carb diet, the juice cleanse... He not only describes what the diet entails, but he goes on to talk about what different scientists and health professionals have said about the diet, and then describes his own experiences following it. One of the more memorable parts for me was his description of the juice cleanse, buying the way expensive juices touted by B-list celebrities, then trying to starve off hunger as he craved anything solid to eat. For all the entertainment found in this book, there is also some advice about health and ways that you really can make a difference in your own life without going completely overboard. I enjoyed the balance of everything, as it never felt as if I was reading a self-help book, but simply an entertaining social experiment that left me with some helpful advice. I imagine that not everyone will like this book, as its dry humor and ridiculous situations could seem off-putting at first. However, if you're interested in reading about someone's adventures participating in all sorts of health fads - some that you've heard of, others that are completely strange - and hearing about it all from a self-deprecating but witty narrator, this is a great book. I'd easily recommend it."
178,141659907X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/68833154-zack-wussow,2,"It's ok. I found this one less interesting than his others, but that may be because I was already familiar with a lot of the material already, unlike his biblical and encyclopedic books. And the last third is a totally useless index. For example: incidental exercise (fidgeting), and on the page listed the only reference is '...even fidgeting (or as so and so calls it, incidental exercise) can be good exercise...' No one needs an index for that!"
179,141659907X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1288876-julie-g,4,"Remember that time I read The Year of Living Biblically and raved about it and then A.J. Jacobs EMAILED ME??? Me too. I was a brand-new blogger and almost died when I realized that authors actually read blogger reviews and respond to them. So basically, besides the fact that The Year of Living Biblically was incredibly well done, the fact that A.J. Jacobs actually replied to my review (which, let's be honest, was not that great) made me a fan for life. I was dying to read this one and the perfect opportunity arose when Jennie got a copy from Goodreads (I think). She passed it on to me and I'm supposed to pass it on to Jacki, which I really do intend to do one day in the very near future. Really.So Drop Dead Healthy is similar to Jacobs' other books in terms of the whole guinea-pig thing. Basically his style is to choose something and learn all about it by using his life as an experiment. In The Year of Living Biblically, he spends an entire year living as close as he can to Old Testament law. In The Know It All he reads through an entire set of encyclopedias. In Drop Dead Healthy, the theme is phsyical fitness and how to achieve it. Jacobs goes through all of the body systems, one by one, and tries out different methods, diets, and fitness regimes and chronicles their success.WritingI, for one, think Jacobs is hilarious. His sense of humor is spot on with my tastes and I spent most of the book laughing out loud. It's written like a memoir and it's about his personal experiences, but he also includes good background information from a scientific standpoint and references many other texts that offer the data and research information that is missing from his own personal experiences. I probably added ten or so books to my to-be-read list based on Jacobs' references. I think he did a great job of balancing the scientific information with humor and his own personal anecdotes. Entertainment ValueAgain, the book was really funny. I like humor and I like learning new things, and Jacobs combines both in his books. I'm also interested right now in dieting and fitness, so this gave me some insight into what worked and what didn't, for Jacobs at least, as well as what the current trends are - and what I ought to avoid. The caveman workout, for example, isn't one I'm anxious to try any time soon.OverallI highly recommend picking this one up. It's a fast read, informative and funny. I think it's a good jumping off place for those who enjoy humor or memoir and are interested in non-fiction, as well as those who are interested in health and fitness. It's a good way to ease your way into more hard-core scientific reads (and provides a great list of those more in-depth books as well). Thank you, Jennie, for sending me your copy and I promise I'll have it on its way to Jacki ASAP!"
180,141659907X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6182210-krista,3,"I read this book on a whim after my mom recommended it to me - we're a very healthy family, so it was more for the comic value of it more than anything else. I can't say I learned a lot that I didn't already know, but it was certainly interesting and entertaining at times reading A.J.'s chronicles of health experiments - some logical, some a bit absurd (hence, the funny bit). Read it for the journey, not the destination."

This is a great book because of what we can learn about health, but also because Jacobs is funny, and the information is presented in a way that is accessible. If you have ever wondered about certain fad diets, what kind of exercise is ""best"" or just want to enjoy a book, I recommend this. (The audio version is incredibly enjoyable!)"

I appreciated the humor (especially his wife's jabs) and learned a few things, but was hoping for more holistic health advice than the body part specific tips.

197,141659907X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/12497233-karen,4,"September feels like a ""new year,"" even though I've been out of school for two decades, and so I read this thinking, I need to lose several pounds and just generally get up and get out more. But where to start? And what's the best, most effective way to do so? There are entire libraries out there devoted to the subject, but this book is actually an entertaining look - and for that, it gets 4-stars. To actually make healthy living - with advice based on science and sound, rational reasoning - into a book that can be read without making the reader feel bad, obese or on death's door? Well, that's a true feat.A.J. Jacobs does this by making himself the guinea pig, a gimmick he's used on the Bible and on Internet-level knowledge. In this case, he goes through body parts, looking at the science and what it says about how to achieve maximum healthfulness, which in this case doesn't mean model-thinness. The book's real message is how little we know about how the body works and what can and will make it work better. There's too many complicating factors to know for sure what makes carrots good for us, for example, because there's just as many complicating factors that make carrots bad for us. (Smoking seems to be that one exception.)My quibble with this book is that we spend lots of time on A.J.'s time with cavemen fitness freaks, for example, because it's a cutesy story, but very little time with almost everything else. There's so much stuffed in here and some of the stories/appointments/tests/trials are reduced to a paragraph. Eating raw food for a week, for example, gets about a half page. Still, I found the advice in the book helpful and somewhat obvious. (It's nice to have it confirmed.) Move more, make that movement a pattern of intensity and moderation, steer clear of white foods and get a good night's sleep. It's already gotten me up off the couch, combing through my pantry and doing 5-minute workouts for 4 cycles. That good night's sleep remains elusive! "
198,141659907X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1499157-rod-hilton,3,"I'm a big fan of A.J. Jacobs, I've read all of his other books and I generally find him to be a humorous and engaging writer. Drop Dead Healthy is no exception to this, it's interesting and funny throughout, but it's not as good as his other books.Jacobs wrote a book where he read the entire Encyclopedia, and one where he decided to follow the Bible literally for a year (both great books), both of which were long-term, very focused experiments with his life. Then he wrote a book which was more a collection of random, short experiments (The Guinea Pig Diaries), more or less a collection of short articles about doing random crap for a month or so. This third book is the weakest of the set because it lacks the focus of the first two books.So when I saw his new book was about trying to become healthy, it seemed to me like a return to form: a focused, directed book again. He even tries to link this book to his earlier two, by claiming that the first was about the mind, the second the spirit, and this the body, making something of a trilogy out of them. Unfortunately, that's not really how the book turned out.Drop Dead Healthy is, once again, a collection of short experiments, with one experiment per chapter. He tries the gym for one, he tries dieting for one, he goes Paleo for one, he focuses on germs for one, he focuses on getting peace and quiet for one (seriously?), he tries to have more sex for one, he focuses on toxins in his home for one, he works on his teeth for one, etc. He devotes chapters to posture, smell, sleeping, eyesight, and many more. Most of the chapters just have A.J. moving from random study to random study, trying it out for a bit and humorously talking about the impact on his life.What the book lacks is a focus like his first two similar outings. An entire book focused on A.J. trying to eat right and work out would have been great. He could have included his Paleo experiments, his experiments with different kinds of workout routines, free-running, treadmills, etc. Most of this material is instead relegated to a handful of chapters, and the rest is focused on stuff only barely related to the book's concept of trying to live healthy. The conclusion I came to was that A.J. didn't like eating healthy and working out, so he didn't stick to it very well for the full 2 years of the book, and instead had to pad the book with a bunch of random crap about massage treatments and smelling better and improving his posture to reach book length. I particularly hated his insistence on giving equal (or more) time to new agey nonsense, largely inspired by his Aunt. This sort of thing makes for perhaps an interesting article or two in Esquire, but it seems barely related to the concept of the book.It's unfortunate, the chapters that actually relate to HEALTHY living are interesting, so an entire book devoted to them would have been great. A.J.'s usual wit and charm make the chapters about random junk interesting and fun to read, but they make the overall book seem muddled and directionless. The book is also, unfortunately, not terribly informative. A.J. doesn't do much to distinguish between what actually works in terms of getting healthy and what doesn't. Someone looking to get healthy will be ENTERTAINED by this book, but won't learn anything from it. Finally, I'd like to make special mention of Jacob's wife, who really comes off like a pain in the ass in this book. As a person who lost a lot of weight I can tell you having your spouse be encouraging when you lose weight makes a huge difference. At one point after A.J. has been working hard on changing his eating habits and losing a few pounds, Julie tells him he went from looking 4 months pregnant to 3.5. If my wife had told me that after working hard I'd have had my motivation totally sapped. His wife usually comes off as a tolerant but somewhat disapproving person, graciously putting up with A.J.'s craziness while making occasional offhand remarks (she's the stereotypical ""sane wife married to a hilarious manchild"" so common in crappy sitcoms). In this book, she comes off like a real jerk, constantly making obnoxious remarks about the author.Overall, it's better than Guinea Pig Diaries, but nowhere near as good as Know-It-All or Living Biblically."
199,141659907X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3312882-rachel-p,4,"I won this book as a goodreads giveaway and I am so glad I did! In his novel, “Drop Dead Healthy”, A.J. Jacobs documents his 2 year long journey to become the healthiest man alive. He does a tremendous amount of research and reads a vast amount of studies from a variety of sources on the subject of human health. I appreciate how he makes this book about total health instead of just about diet and exercise. He breaks down the story by body part; focusing on a different part of the body in each chapter.**SPOILER ALERT**I actually rate this book 4.5 stars. I really enjoyed how he went for it; fitness crazes, fad diets, alternative medicine, etc. Out of the mountain of research he selected a few key studies to relate and expert advice to pursue. I took pleasure in learning about the calorie restrictive diet (living on the edge of starvation), the Paleo Movement (living like a cavemen), walking and running barefoot, replacing manufactured beauty products (such as shampoo and soap) with natural alternatives (such as baking soda and vinegar). Somethings I tried out with great success (like deskercising – desk exercising) and somethings I wouldn’t go near unless I got my own book deal (like acupuncture). It is a spectacular read but there are a few issues that prevent me from giving it the full 5 stars. For instance, there are two chapters on the stomach in which A.J. discusses different diets he’s trying but the diet is an ever-present element of the entire journey and I don’t feel like he always devotes as much attention to it as he should. For example, the author mentions at the end of a chapter he started eating steel cut oatmeal but doesn’t mention why or how this came about. I know that he didn’t want to make this book too long and perhaps in the interest of prioritization he couldn’t explain every food/diet choice and how it came about but I personally would have been interested in learning much more. He does sum up key points in the appendices but I still think it’s not enough. There are also no consistent measurements reported at the end of each chapter except weight. Granted, I don’t expect a whole long list of measurement indices but more consistency would’ve been better.Here are a few key highlights that I took away: - Eat on smaller plates because we tend to eat everything that’s on our plates. - Chew your food thoroughly and eat with family and friends instead of watching TV or reading. You will eat slower and thus give your body the 20 minutes it needs to feel full. - Stand more and choose activities (or modify existing ones) that put you in motion. Studies show that spending 1 hour at the gym and the rest of the day at a desk or on the couch is not much better for you than if you spent the whole day stationary. - There’s no such thing as superfoods. All fruits and veggies are equally good for you. Just make sure you wash non-organic produce in hot water and vinegar and let sit for 5 minutes. - Set fitness goals. Buy a pedometer and complete against yourself or a partner to see how many steps you can walk in a day (the recommended amount is 10,000 steps or 5 miles per day). Also, registering for a marathon and then having to train for it is great motivation to get or stay in shape. - Keep your brain fit by challenging yourself and trying new things.  - Enjoy life. Don’t let your health become a preoccupation to the exclusion of all other aspects of your life. Enjoy spending time with people that you love and you are happy to be around. Don’t waste time stressing over getting enough exercise or counting calories. This novel is packed with so much quality information it is definitely a keeper for me. A.J. is very relatable starting out as your average out of shape American male. He includes his family in his health project and intersperses his story with personal anecdotes which I think make his experience more real. And his writing is hilarious; I’m talking LAUGH OUT LOUD funny. So I actually burned calories while reading this book especially when I was doing it while iPloding on my treadmill desk. Thanks A.J.!"
200,141659907X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4962920-jill-furedy,4,"A.J. Jacobs is amusing as always, and had I come away feeling that I'd learned some relevant health tips, I'd have given the book more stars. Part of that may be my personal issues though, reading about a mostly healthy, if somewhat neurotic and underexercised man pursue ultimate health doesn't necessarily translate to a nutritionally challenged woman with Crohn's disease! So when he's talking about dried mangoes as his vice and I'm eating cheetos, I'm thinking he's already ahead of me in the dietary department. And when he's eating walnuts or apples, I'm wishing I could eat those without getting sick. And in a twist of odd timing, I read the stomach revistied section in the waiting room for my follow up appointment to get a b12 shot, to try and get back to normal levels, and where I was instructed to pick up calcium citrate and vitamin D, both of which were areas I'm a bit low on, as well and being told to cut back on sugars as I'm not yet prediabetic, but still too high. So maybe that's why his giving up dried mangoes seemed unimpressive, when I know how much more I need to change my diet! Though I did like his Odysseus contract to give them up.  Anyway, Jacobs clearly needed more exercise, but basically it was pneumonia that motivated him to begin the project, rather than a chronic health issue or doctors orders. Reminded me a bit of the Happiness Project, where a woman who was not unhappy nevertheless sets about to improve her happiness levels. On the one hand, I agree with her theory...work on it before you HAVE to and it will be easier should circumstances change. Which definately applies to health as well. But it still makes their self imposed challenges seem less impressive than those overcoming more severe obstacles.  But Jacobs is fun to read, so I was willing to see where he went with this. I hoped to pick up a few health tips, but I don't think I came away with much. He wasn't on either his vegan or his protein-heavy diets long enough to really see any differences (I believe he gave two weeks to each). Moderation and portion control have always been my go-to diet method. He writes about his adventures with juicers and dehydrators, but only mentions his introductions of quinoa, bok choy, and other foods in his statistic notes. Did he know how to cook this stuff that he'd never eaten before? Or did his wife know? Did he actually like it, or just eat it because it's healthy? And the chronolgy isn't as straight forward as his chapters imply, so things overlapped or happened in different orders, which sometimes threw me off. I liked that he had a team of experts he was relying on, but he looks into so many things and mentions the kooky alongside the scientifically backed, all of it told in his humorous storytelling format, so that not a lot of it stuck with me.  As with his religion book (I haven't read The Know It All), I think someone looking for straight up humor might find his books too fact heavy, and someone looking for tips or wisdom might find his books a little too specific to his life to be applied generally, or might find the treatment a bit too light. The publisher category is biography which is the probably the only way to classify it in order to meet expectations of genre: You have to be looking for a mix of the humor and info for his adventures to resonate. His stories of his wife, grandpa, aunt Marti help balance the humor and his obsession, so that you can tell he is living a real life while assigning himself these odd tasks. And I can see how his health lessons will disappear from my mind since I hear so much of it in magazines, TV shows, etc, but if anything sticks with me about the book it will probably be the elements involving his family or even those side characters who reappear, like his trainer or the Cave Man. I usually judge a book by how original or memorable it is, and those characters don't carry quite enough of this book for me to think I'll be able to tell you much about it next year. But it hit a few touching moments, was a quick fun read, had an occasional look into something unfamiliar, and plenty of humor, so it was all I expected of it. "
201,141659907X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1270609-brittany,3,"How I Came To Read This Book: I'm guessing I heard about it in Entertainment Weekly. I've always been fascinated by biology and the human body, and A.J. Jacobs' (semi-serious) quest to become the healthiest man alive was intriguing - and turned out to be quite different than what I'd bargained for, in a good way.The Plot: A.J. Jacobs is sort of the Morgan Spurlock of the nonfiction / journalism world. His past two books were all about taking on epic, life-altering projects (reading the encyclopaedia and following the rules of the Bible to the letter), and this one is no different. After exercising his mind and exploring his faith, this book is focused on all the crazy ways we try to get and stay healthy - from the inside out, top down. Each chapter is centered on a particular body part, and Jacobs' forays into speaking with experts, trying out routines, and somewhat attempting to bust myths by separating the fact from fiction in those medical claims (i.e. blueberries are not the world's best superfruit. If you believe it, the Maine marketing folks have done a good job). The Good & The Bad: Like I said, this book was really different than I anticipated. It was more of an intellectual and experiential smorgasbord of anecdotes and experiences, some given no more weight than a sentence, as opposed to a deep-digging day-by-day progress story (although there is some chronology to the book). On the plus side, it made for a quite light and easy read, filled with those bite-sized snippets of information our generation so craves. On the negative, I never felt like the book really went particularly deep into any one direction - although perhaps rightfully so. By the end of the book, Jacobs' himself acknowledges we still don't know so much, and that what worked for him might not work for you. The main takeaway here is to at least be aware of some of the major hazards we are exposed to, and see if changing some behaviours will have a positive impact on your life. If it does, great - I can say myself, I've been sampling ideas from the book over the last week and have enjoyed them / have many more I want to try out (drinking ice water *burns* calories!) My favourite is the advice to try standing for (at least) an hour or two during your workday - I leave work feeling way less mushy in the brain and the legs. At the same time, I also appreciated that some of the extremist examples Jacobs' references - many of which were more amusing than anything - probably aren't for everyone. It was amazing how often peoples behaviours' were inconclusively linked to their health, or how many contradictory studies exist out there. You get the sense that Jacobs may have gone into this looking for a foolproof guide to healthiness by examining all angles, and what he ends up with is a hedgehog of ideas that's hard to conceptualize into anything tangible. I'm not saying I went into this book expecting a miracle health book - that's definitely not the intent. But it's so surface and skims through so much at times, it's hard to rate this higher than a 3. I did enjoy it, and I think anyone with a passing interest in biology and health will enjoy it as much as I did, but I wish - not for lack of Jacobs' trying - it gave me a little more conclusive insight. The Bottom Line: A bit of a lark, but has some real insight you can incorporate into your everyday life. Anything Memorable?: I found it weird that Jacobs frequently - I mean every chapter practically - talked about advocating a plant-based diet yet didn't actual delve into it in any real form, other than a brief foray into raw veganism (not for me). That was one of the weaknesses of the book I suppose - it delved into extremes, which, while amusing and enlightening, wasn't all that practical. 60-book Challenge?: Book #43 in 2012"
202,141659907X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/10093055-angie-fehl,4,"I'm revisiting Jacobs' work in experimental journalism -- a process where he gives himself one monumental project, usually for a year or so, and writes a whole book about the process. The first of these I read was his book A Year Of Living Biblically, where he attempted to live by biblical era standards of clothing, diet, etc as literally as possible. I believe Drop Dead Healthy was written before that one, though. In this book, Jacobs, inspired by his own health scare, decides to take on a slew of popular diets, exercise programs and health fads, equipment, technology, treatments. Each chapter covers one specific area of his body (heart health, lung improvement, leg strength, etc.), detailing what all he got into to improve that particular area. Since he's writing from a male perspective, he even gets looks into how to improve testicular health. Just some of the topics he researches (and what he discovers in the process):> Vitamin C helps fight peridontal disease, but citrus is rough on tooth enamel.. soo... > ""Orthorexia"" is a term coined by Dr. Steven Bratman to describe when people fixate SO hard on dieting, to the point of the stress actually outweighing any nutritional benefits. Jacobs himself also refers to this mode of thinking as ""health food fetishism"". That said, Jacobs also puts himself on a few of the trendiest diet plans -- Paleo, Raw, No Sugar, and juice cleanse routines -- just to see how he fares and what it does for his body. At the time he was writing this book, he also managed to snag an interview with health guru Jack Lalanne (who has since passed away, age 96).> Jacobs researches the benefits of acupuncture, laugh yoga, and ""worry exchange"", where you literally team up with someone else -- they worry about your problems, you worry about theirs. He also looks at ""neurobic exercise"" for the brain: doing your daily tasks but doing them in the reverse order you naturally would (ie. taking a different route to work, using your non-dominant hand as your dominant for a time, etc.). He also looks into some of the newer trends like anti-gravity yoga (Sky Gym type places) and Strollercise for new moms, as well as programs for the more hardcore minded -- CrossFit and the Roman Legionnaire workout, which apparently involves smashing logs out in the woods with iron mallets?! Jacobs even takes on pole dancing classes! He also attempts to make it family get-together time when he does treadmill work and Pilates class with his mom and weight training with his dad. > Jacobs describes using Odysseus contracts (aka Ulysses Contracts) to help keep him on his goals. If I remember correctly, this was also a tool he mentions using in A Year Of Living Biblically. What keeps me reading Jacobs' books is not only the education the reader is given from all the data this guy compiles with each project, but also the fact that he can writes these books with such great humor, often poking fun at his own shortcomings.I personally loved how he talked about being all gung ho for this particular experiment and then catches a cold shortly into the program X-P Also, his record of all his wife's reactions and responses to what he's doing or what he brings home is definitely bonus entertainment. The chapters are nicely laid out in a sort of log or journal form so all the science and such that Jacobs covers is not overwhelming for the reader. So if you're all about becoming a more knowledgeable person, I wholeheartedly recommend getting into some of his works. Even if it feels like a lot of information at once, you can do what I do and just take a chapter or two a day, process that and then go on to the next section. You'll be surprised at the wealth of info that sticks in your noggin!"
203,141659907X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/647117-nicole,4,"Wow--I really plowed through this book! I'm a big fan of AJ Jacobs, and have read all of his books, which all fall into the ""immersion-journalism"" category. As usual, AJ Jacobs wrote a highly entertaining and informative book documenting his 2 years of striving to become the healthiest man alive. As a bit of a health-nut myself, I didn't just read this book for entertainment purposes, I actually paid attention for health tips. So, here's some of what I found interesting: Meditation is extraordinarily good for your health. Yes, I already knew this, but I have a problem with what I call ""spazzy-brain syndrome"". But, I'm not alone here, and what AJ does is he meditates by watching the gently pulsating sleep-mode light on a Macbook and breathes in sync with it. I never noticed that the sleep light actually resembles the deep breathing of sleep. So I tried it. And it gave my brain some focus. Nice tip AJ.Something else that caught my attention as a ""dietaholic"" who has tried just about every diet out there, I was interested to read that the Mediterranean Diet is the most widely accepted diet with the most scientific backing. It's a diet that I haven't specifically tried, though it sounds right up my alley.Noise-pollution…a health hazard I have previously given very little thought to, although reading about it did encourage me to try on the Bose noise-canceling headphones that he talks about, and I must say they are WONDERFUL. Though I will not be buying them anytime soon with their $300 price tag. Still, I think my world is too noisy, and I actually have taken steps to quiet it a bit. Walking. I used to have a pedometer that I clipped on to my pants, and I made certain that I walked more than 10,000 steps every day. That often meant walking in circles around the playground my kids were playing on rather than sitting on a nearby bench to just watch. It's a little thing, but those steps do make a huge difference. Makes me want to pay attention to moving more, even though I am a frequent exerciser. Everything in moderation. People who go to ""health"" extremes are just as at-risk as those who ignore their health. For wrinkles, one of the only things that actually works is Retin-A. But, like the Bose noise-cancelling headphones, it's bloody expensive, so I probably won't be trying that one anytime soon either.Chew more. Breathe from your stomach. Give thanks. Try new foods like kale and quinoa. Yes, I actually did buy these things on my last shopping trip. The kale was delicious. Haven't tried the quinoa yet (pronounced keen-wah by the way…) High Intensity Interval Training is most effective (which is good news for us Zumba enthusiasts…) Fidget. Actually use a smaller plate. Drink more water, specifically 15 minutes prior to meals. Have protein for breakfast. Eat spicy foods--they curb your appetite for salty and sweet and give your metabolism a boost. LOVED hearing that one. Eat more veggies. Avoid simple carbs. Add crunch to your food. Shop the perimeter of the store. If you're going to eat meat, eat it as a side dish. Don't use anti-bacterial soap, just use regular soap. Stuff I've heard before, but great tips nonetheless. One thing I think the book lacked was before and after pics. He told us his beginning and ending weight and other various stats, but after 2 years of regular gym attendance after never going previously, I would've thought pictures would be telling. But the pics he did include were great. The book as a whole was great. I'd recommend it."
204,141659907X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2349088-roberto-scarlato,5,"When I first sat down to read this book on my kindle, I had a pretty clear idea of how committed this writer really is to experimentation and research. I've read The Know-it-all and The Year of Living biblically and enjoyed them both. This author has the perfect balance of facts and humor that I've ever read.Not only does he plunge himself into the subjects he tackles but he does so for months or even years, reading every book on the subject he intends to document.So when I heard that he was completing his, what he calls, ""Mind, Body and Soul Trilogy"", I had to buy it right away. Chances are I will read it again.Since this is a non-fiction book, I decided to review it in three ways: entertainment, interesting and what I've learned.Is it entertaining?Yes, extremely. I marveled at the wealth of facts he's unearthed on health myths and just how far some people will go to remain healthy. Some fanatics are so into their own health clicks that they don't even know they are causing more harm than good. Like his other books, there were times when I had to put the book down because I had to walk off a laugh-out-loud moment. My wife thought I was crazy. I was so immersed and interested in knowing these healthy weirdoes. I laughed at the fact that there are people out there in public parks running around like cavemen thinking that doing so is the pinnacle of healthy living. I doubled over in a giggle fit finding out that the writer hurt his shoulder kayaking on the Wii console, or through his misadventures during a Laugh-Yoga class, or finding out that cursing alleviates stubbed toe pain. Yes, the laughs are not on every single page but there were more than enough to keep me reading.Is it interesting?I would say so. I was particularly surprised at just how many Health habits aren't good for you. There are people addicted to exercising or never getting sick. There are people obsessed with Whole Foods when really you will still find sugar around every corner and the only thing getting slimmer is your own wallet. As for the diets, he's tried them all. He even covered the South Beach Diet which I was on at one point. Yes it made me slim down slightly but I felt miserable the whole time.What I've learned?Since reading this book, I've become a firm believer in Chewdism. While I won't spend a full minute chewing my food, I do find myself slowing down and chewing my food more. I know that chocolate, especially dark chocolate, is good for your heart. I've become more health conscious, joining weight watchers to track my meals and doing Power90 exercises (35 minutes on weekdays) and feeling good about it. Whenever I can, I get up and walk around. I'm actually interested in buying a pedometer to measure how many steps I take in a regular work day. I used to be part Hypochondriac and part OCD but now I'm actively taking steps to limit those stray thoughts and feeling less worrisome about it. I now make a list of things I know I should not have: No Soda, No Ice Cream, No Burritos. In short, this book motivated me to get fit quick.As for the people who try to knock this one man's efforts, I would say that they should know that it isn't really all that healthy leaving a bad review to a well-researched, two-year invested, delightful escape into one subject that is so easy to laugh about. I mean, come on, the guy wrote this entire book while on a treadmill, that's commitment right there."
205,141659907X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/8213107-carolina,5,"Originally posted at: A Girl that Likes Books Who doesn’t want to be healthy? Specially now a days. I first bought this book for my boyfriend...actually I pre-order it; we got it the second day after it came out. Why? We are big fans of Jacobs and it was my boyfriend who introduced me to his books. Last year I read The Year of Living Biblically and in March of this year I read The Know-it-All. I was really excited to read it and, since I loved the other two, I had big expectations. Boy, did the book deliver. Jacobs spends 2 full years working on himself, taking care of this skin, meals, exercising, getting healthy...and happy. To quote the book: ""The key to making healthy decisions is to respect your future self. Honor him or her. Treat him or her like you would treat a friend or a loved one""As in his other books (I still have to read the Guinea Pig Diaries, but the order has been placed, and with 82% off!!!!) he doesn’t only talks about the “experiment” itself, but also how it affects him, his family and in smaller doses, about family in general. In the first book of the “series”, The Know-it-All, we learn about him and his wife trying to conceive, how his father also tried to read the whole Encyclopedia Britannica, and so on.In this book we meet his Grandfather, a remarkable 96 year old, with a lovely remark: ""You can retire, but you must find something you’re passionate about in your retirement. You need a reason to wake up in the morning""Something else that I really enjoy about his books, is the familiarity of the whole thing, I feel like a friend of mine is just telling me what he/she did during the week-end. The writing is fluid and casual, like a conversation. And I have to say, I love Julie, his wife. She has the patience of a saint, and her comments always make me smile. She tried some of the stuff with Jacobs in this book. I cannot blame her for not trying anything on the biblical year; at the same time, I loved her ""answer"" to a lot of the restrictions during that year...but I'm changing books here. Sorry.What did I learn with this book? That I’m doing fine, not great but fine in my own quest to be healthy. I watch my portions, and have also controlled a little of my roommate and my boyfriend; I’m lucky to work in an environment that is not highly noisy; I don’t wear as much sunscreen as is recommended, but the point I’ve been trying to carve in my friend’s brains was valid, it does make a difference to apply sunscreen in the morning; I love my Pilates class, even when it hurts the day after, “luckily” I cannot spend 8 hours sitting at the lab, since I have to move from one room to the other in order to finish my experiment. I could still be more active though.And finally, my favorite of them all: Reading before going to sleep, might actually be helpful to sleep better! (As long as is a non-electronic book J)Truth be told, I learnt about a ton of new tendencies, but the main point is that everything has to be done in moderation. From eating, to exercising, you cannot...should not exaggerate. Did I like this book? Oh yes! I think is my favorite book from Jacobs...we will see how it goes with the Guinea Pig Diaries."
206,141659907X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/125347-donovan,4,"Funny, loaded with great tips, easy to read and applicable to me - an overweight health conscience individual who wants to make health a priority, but constantly find himself overwhelmed with all of the opinions, contrary advice and amount of research (not to mention miss guided priorities and laziness).Recently, I spend close to a thousand dollars for an initial appointment with a naturopathic doctor. While I'm still in the evaluation process, I can't help looking skeptically at a number of his recommendations, some very contrary to other things I've read (excessive fat is ok, eat lots of meat, etc). What I loved about A. J. is he shares this healthy skepticism and he looks at things practically and methodically, but with an open mind and a willingness to try everything. I felt like he did it for the rest of us. His book project and advance gave him the time to do what the rest of us want to know, but don't have time to do (oh wait, he also is an editor for Esquire...so I guess that is another excuse). Anyway, he confirmed my thoughts on many issues and I'm happy to just following along with his conclusions - and in others situations I want to do a little more research before forming an opinion, but his practical advice definitely gives me a head start.His wit and writing make the book easy to follow. I read the first half on a cross country flight and the only thing that made me put it down was the passengers getting up all around me. The rest I finished during my brief period of reading before bed - a tip I've taken from A.J. that I'm determined to make a habit.Much of the advice is stuff you already know, but it serves as a great reminder. Exercise more - eat less - sleep more - relax - smile often, etc. Other things were less intuitive - don't read on toilet - observe Sabbath - avoid pedicures like the plague - etc.One of the most delightful things about the book is his sense of humor - it helped a book on health flow. Here's some quotes to give you a flavor of his under toned, slightly sarcastic, humor.""I did get a colonic, but I've decided not write about it at length. I didn't find it helpful or enlightening. I can tell you want it felt like, though: It felt like someone shooting water up your butt.""""Cigarettes' cost far outweigh any resulting trimness, just as asphyxiation outweighs the benefits of stretching out the spine when you hang yourself from a shower curtain rod.""""The MRI has a repertoire of noises that resemble, in no particular order: a game-show buzzer for a wrong answer, urgent knocking, a modem from 1992, a grizzly-bear growl, and a man with a raspy voice shouting what sounds like ""mother cooler!""""After decimating several vegetables, I decide juicing is my favorite form of food preparation. There's something perversely appealing about subjecting an innocent plant to that much violence.""""The dehydrator blows warm air on your food for hours, sometimes days. It reminds me of the temperature and intensity of dog's breath. So imagine a German shepherd exhaling on your fruit for a weekend.""""So, if weight loss is your goal, and you have impressive self-control, raw food is something to consider.""""Step back for a minute. Pretend you're from Mars. From a coldly rational point of view, pedestrian helmets aren't a crazy idea."""
207,141659907X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/879591-sara,4,"I won an advanced copy of this book through the First Reads program. The author has written previous books about various life experiments he's conducted; I'd previously read his book about living biblically for a year, trying to follow all the numerous, and sometimes conflicting, rules in the Bible. This book is along the same lines, following his adventures over the course of two years as he strives to be the healthiest person in the world. This means changing his lifestyle to adopt healthier habits, working out in various ways that are supposed to be best for your health, eating a better diet, and so on.I wouldn't call this book ""hilarious,"" but it's definitely amusing. Not only are his adventures in the name of health entertaining, but his writing is extremely witty. Even though you might begin reading the book with the thought that he's simply doing this healthy experiment to write a book about it, the results are so interesting and he does so much research about it, throwing himself into this fully, that you can't help but enjoy. I loved all the descriptions of the ways in which he tries to work out, and the diets he follows, even for brief periods of time. As he points out, there is so much conflicting advice out there about how to be healthy, how to work out properly, how to eat your way to health... it's exhausting. And yet he attempts to follow many of the regiments in the name of science. One of my favorite parts of the book came when he follows the ""Caveman Workout"", exercising the way cavemen supposedly did, shirtless and barefoot in Central Park, lifting logs in lieu of boulders with a handful of other men in this Paleo Movement. He paints such a vivid picture of what he's doing, and you can't help but laugh at some of the ridiculousness he encounters, with devoted followers to each and every movement.It was also entertaining to hear his adventures following some of the diets that have been hyped up as the way to health - the raw food diet, the no-carb diet, the juice cleanse... He not only describes what the diet entails, but he goes on to talk about what different scientists and health professionals have said about the diet, and then describes his own experiences following it. One of the more memorable parts for me was his description of the juice cleanse, buying the way expensive juices touted by B-list celebrities, then trying to starve off hunger as he craved anything solid to eat. For all the entertainment found in this book, there is also some advice about health and ways that you really can make a difference in your own life without going completely overboard. I enjoyed the balance of everything, as it never felt as if I was reading a self-help book, but simply an entertaining social experiment that left me with some helpful advice. I imagine that not everyone will like this book, as its dry humor and ridiculous situations could seem off-putting at first. However, if you're interested in reading about someone's adventures participating in all sorts of health fads - some that you've heard of, others that are completely strange - and hearing about it all from a self-deprecating but witty narrator, this is a great book. I'd easily recommend it."
208,141659907X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/68833154-zack-wussow,2,"It's ok. I found this one less interesting than his others, but that may be because I was already familiar with a lot of the material already, unlike his biblical and encyclopedic books. And the last third is a totally useless index. For example: incidental exercise (fidgeting), and on the page listed the only reference is '...even fidgeting (or as so and so calls it, incidental exercise) can be good exercise...' No one needs an index for that!"
209,141659907X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1288876-julie-g,4,"Remember that time I read The Year of Living Biblically and raved about it and then A.J. Jacobs EMAILED ME??? Me too. I was a brand-new blogger and almost died when I realized that authors actually read blogger reviews and respond to them. So basically, besides the fact that The Year of Living Biblically was incredibly well done, the fact that A.J. Jacobs actually replied to my review (which, let's be honest, was not that great) made me a fan for life. I was dying to read this one and the perfect opportunity arose when Jennie got a copy from Goodreads (I think). She passed it on to me and I'm supposed to pass it on to Jacki, which I really do intend to do one day in the very near future. Really.So Drop Dead Healthy is similar to Jacobs' other books in terms of the whole guinea-pig thing. Basically his style is to choose something and learn all about it by using his life as an experiment. In The Year of Living Biblically, he spends an entire year living as close as he can to Old Testament law. In The Know It All he reads through an entire set of encyclopedias. In Drop Dead Healthy, the theme is phsyical fitness and how to achieve it. Jacobs goes through all of the body systems, one by one, and tries out different methods, diets, and fitness regimes and chronicles their success.WritingI, for one, think Jacobs is hilarious. His sense of humor is spot on with my tastes and I spent most of the book laughing out loud. It's written like a memoir and it's about his personal experiences, but he also includes good background information from a scientific standpoint and references many other texts that offer the data and research information that is missing from his own personal experiences. I probably added ten or so books to my to-be-read list based on Jacobs' references. I think he did a great job of balancing the scientific information with humor and his own personal anecdotes. Entertainment ValueAgain, the book was really funny. I like humor and I like learning new things, and Jacobs combines both in his books. I'm also interested right now in dieting and fitness, so this gave me some insight into what worked and what didn't, for Jacobs at least, as well as what the current trends are - and what I ought to avoid. The caveman workout, for example, isn't one I'm anxious to try any time soon.OverallI highly recommend picking this one up. It's a fast read, informative and funny. I think it's a good jumping off place for those who enjoy humor or memoir and are interested in non-fiction, as well as those who are interested in health and fitness. It's a good way to ease your way into more hard-core scientific reads (and provides a great list of those more in-depth books as well). Thank you, Jennie, for sending me your copy and I promise I'll have it on its way to Jacki ASAP!"
210,141659907X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6182210-krista,3,"I read this book on a whim after my mom recommended it to me - we're a very healthy family, so it was more for the comic value of it more than anything else. I can't say I learned a lot that I didn't already know, but it was certainly interesting and entertaining at times reading A.J.'s chronicles of health experiments - some logical, some a bit absurd (hence, the funny bit). Read it for the journey, not the destination."

This is a great book because of what we can learn about health, but also because Jacobs is funny, and the information is presented in a way that is accessible. If you have ever wondered about certain fad diets, what kind of exercise is ""best"" or just want to enjoy a book, I recommend this. (The audio version is incredibly enjoyable!)"

I appreciated the humor (especially his wife's jabs) and learned a few things, but was hoping for more holistic health advice than the body part specific tips.

227,141659907X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/12497233-karen,4,"September feels like a ""new year,"" even though I've been out of school for two decades, and so I read this thinking, I need to lose several pounds and just generally get up and get out more. But where to start? And what's the best, most effective way to do so? There are entire libraries out there devoted to the subject, but this book is actually an entertaining look - and for that, it gets 4-stars. To actually make healthy living - with advice based on science and sound, rational reasoning - into a book that can be read without making the reader feel bad, obese or on death's door? Well, that's a true feat.A.J. Jacobs does this by making himself the guinea pig, a gimmick he's used on the Bible and on Internet-level knowledge. In this case, he goes through body parts, looking at the science and what it says about how to achieve maximum healthfulness, which in this case doesn't mean model-thinness. The book's real message is how little we know about how the body works and what can and will make it work better. There's too many complicating factors to know for sure what makes carrots good for us, for example, because there's just as many complicating factors that make carrots bad for us. (Smoking seems to be that one exception.)My quibble with this book is that we spend lots of time on A.J.'s time with cavemen fitness freaks, for example, because it's a cutesy story, but very little time with almost everything else. There's so much stuffed in here and some of the stories/appointments/tests/trials are reduced to a paragraph. Eating raw food for a week, for example, gets about a half page. Still, I found the advice in the book helpful and somewhat obvious. (It's nice to have it confirmed.) Move more, make that movement a pattern of intensity and moderation, steer clear of white foods and get a good night's sleep. It's already gotten me up off the couch, combing through my pantry and doing 5-minute workouts for 4 cycles. That good night's sleep remains elusive! "
228,141659907X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1499157-rod-hilton,3,"I'm a big fan of A.J. Jacobs, I've read all of his other books and I generally find him to be a humorous and engaging writer. Drop Dead Healthy is no exception to this, it's interesting and funny throughout, but it's not as good as his other books.Jacobs wrote a book where he read the entire Encyclopedia, and one where he decided to follow the Bible literally for a year (both great books), both of which were long-term, very focused experiments with his life. Then he wrote a book which was more a collection of random, short experiments (The Guinea Pig Diaries), more or less a collection of short articles about doing random crap for a month or so. This third book is the weakest of the set because it lacks the focus of the first two books.So when I saw his new book was about trying to become healthy, it seemed to me like a return to form: a focused, directed book again. He even tries to link this book to his earlier two, by claiming that the first was about the mind, the second the spirit, and this the body, making something of a trilogy out of them. Unfortunately, that's not really how the book turned out.Drop Dead Healthy is, once again, a collection of short experiments, with one experiment per chapter. He tries the gym for one, he tries dieting for one, he goes Paleo for one, he focuses on germs for one, he focuses on getting peace and quiet for one (seriously?), he tries to have more sex for one, he focuses on toxins in his home for one, he works on his teeth for one, etc. He devotes chapters to posture, smell, sleeping, eyesight, and many more. Most of the chapters just have A.J. moving from random study to random study, trying it out for a bit and humorously talking about the impact on his life.What the book lacks is a focus like his first two similar outings. An entire book focused on A.J. trying to eat right and work out would have been great. He could have included his Paleo experiments, his experiments with different kinds of workout routines, free-running, treadmills, etc. Most of this material is instead relegated to a handful of chapters, and the rest is focused on stuff only barely related to the book's concept of trying to live healthy. The conclusion I came to was that A.J. didn't like eating healthy and working out, so he didn't stick to it very well for the full 2 years of the book, and instead had to pad the book with a bunch of random crap about massage treatments and smelling better and improving his posture to reach book length. I particularly hated his insistence on giving equal (or more) time to new agey nonsense, largely inspired by his Aunt. This sort of thing makes for perhaps an interesting article or two in Esquire, but it seems barely related to the concept of the book.It's unfortunate, the chapters that actually relate to HEALTHY living are interesting, so an entire book devoted to them would have been great. A.J.'s usual wit and charm make the chapters about random junk interesting and fun to read, but they make the overall book seem muddled and directionless. The book is also, unfortunately, not terribly informative. A.J. doesn't do much to distinguish between what actually works in terms of getting healthy and what doesn't. Someone looking to get healthy will be ENTERTAINED by this book, but won't learn anything from it. Finally, I'd like to make special mention of Jacob's wife, who really comes off like a pain in the ass in this book. As a person who lost a lot of weight I can tell you having your spouse be encouraging when you lose weight makes a huge difference. At one point after A.J. has been working hard on changing his eating habits and losing a few pounds, Julie tells him he went from looking 4 months pregnant to 3.5. If my wife had told me that after working hard I'd have had my motivation totally sapped. His wife usually comes off as a tolerant but somewhat disapproving person, graciously putting up with A.J.'s craziness while making occasional offhand remarks (she's the stereotypical ""sane wife married to a hilarious manchild"" so common in crappy sitcoms). In this book, she comes off like a real jerk, constantly making obnoxious remarks about the author.Overall, it's better than Guinea Pig Diaries, but nowhere near as good as Know-It-All or Living Biblically."
229,141659907X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3312882-rachel-p,4,"I won this book as a goodreads giveaway and I am so glad I did! In his novel, “Drop Dead Healthy”, A.J. Jacobs documents his 2 year long journey to become the healthiest man alive. He does a tremendous amount of research and reads a vast amount of studies from a variety of sources on the subject of human health. I appreciate how he makes this book about total health instead of just about diet and exercise. He breaks down the story by body part; focusing on a different part of the body in each chapter.**SPOILER ALERT**I actually rate this book 4.5 stars. I really enjoyed how he went for it; fitness crazes, fad diets, alternative medicine, etc. Out of the mountain of research he selected a few key studies to relate and expert advice to pursue. I took pleasure in learning about the calorie restrictive diet (living on the edge of starvation), the Paleo Movement (living like a cavemen), walking and running barefoot, replacing manufactured beauty products (such as shampoo and soap) with natural alternatives (such as baking soda and vinegar). Somethings I tried out with great success (like deskercising – desk exercising) and somethings I wouldn’t go near unless I got my own book deal (like acupuncture). It is a spectacular read but there are a few issues that prevent me from giving it the full 5 stars. For instance, there are two chapters on the stomach in which A.J. discusses different diets he’s trying but the diet is an ever-present element of the entire journey and I don’t feel like he always devotes as much attention to it as he should. For example, the author mentions at the end of a chapter he started eating steel cut oatmeal but doesn’t mention why or how this came about. I know that he didn’t want to make this book too long and perhaps in the interest of prioritization he couldn’t explain every food/diet choice and how it came about but I personally would have been interested in learning much more. He does sum up key points in the appendices but I still think it’s not enough. There are also no consistent measurements reported at the end of each chapter except weight. Granted, I don’t expect a whole long list of measurement indices but more consistency would’ve been better.Here are a few key highlights that I took away: - Eat on smaller plates because we tend to eat everything that’s on our plates. - Chew your food thoroughly and eat with family and friends instead of watching TV or reading. You will eat slower and thus give your body the 20 minutes it needs to feel full. - Stand more and choose activities (or modify existing ones) that put you in motion. Studies show that spending 1 hour at the gym and the rest of the day at a desk or on the couch is not much better for you than if you spent the whole day stationary. - There’s no such thing as superfoods. All fruits and veggies are equally good for you. Just make sure you wash non-organic produce in hot water and vinegar and let sit for 5 minutes. - Set fitness goals. Buy a pedometer and complete against yourself or a partner to see how many steps you can walk in a day (the recommended amount is 10,000 steps or 5 miles per day). Also, registering for a marathon and then having to train for it is great motivation to get or stay in shape. - Keep your brain fit by challenging yourself and trying new things.  - Enjoy life. Don’t let your health become a preoccupation to the exclusion of all other aspects of your life. Enjoy spending time with people that you love and you are happy to be around. Don’t waste time stressing over getting enough exercise or counting calories. This novel is packed with so much quality information it is definitely a keeper for me. A.J. is very relatable starting out as your average out of shape American male. He includes his family in his health project and intersperses his story with personal anecdotes which I think make his experience more real. And his writing is hilarious; I’m talking LAUGH OUT LOUD funny. So I actually burned calories while reading this book especially when I was doing it while iPloding on my treadmill desk. Thanks A.J.!"
230,141659907X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4962920-jill-furedy,4,"A.J. Jacobs is amusing as always, and had I come away feeling that I'd learned some relevant health tips, I'd have given the book more stars. Part of that may be my personal issues though, reading about a mostly healthy, if somewhat neurotic and underexercised man pursue ultimate health doesn't necessarily translate to a nutritionally challenged woman with Crohn's disease! So when he's talking about dried mangoes as his vice and I'm eating cheetos, I'm thinking he's already ahead of me in the dietary department. And when he's eating walnuts or apples, I'm wishing I could eat those without getting sick. And in a twist of odd timing, I read the stomach revistied section in the waiting room for my follow up appointment to get a b12 shot, to try and get back to normal levels, and where I was instructed to pick up calcium citrate and vitamin D, both of which were areas I'm a bit low on, as well and being told to cut back on sugars as I'm not yet prediabetic, but still too high. So maybe that's why his giving up dried mangoes seemed unimpressive, when I know how much more I need to change my diet! Though I did like his Odysseus contract to give them up.  Anyway, Jacobs clearly needed more exercise, but basically it was pneumonia that motivated him to begin the project, rather than a chronic health issue or doctors orders. Reminded me a bit of the Happiness Project, where a woman who was not unhappy nevertheless sets about to improve her happiness levels. On the one hand, I agree with her theory...work on it before you HAVE to and it will be easier should circumstances change. Which definately applies to health as well. But it still makes their self imposed challenges seem less impressive than those overcoming more severe obstacles.  But Jacobs is fun to read, so I was willing to see where he went with this. I hoped to pick up a few health tips, but I don't think I came away with much. He wasn't on either his vegan or his protein-heavy diets long enough to really see any differences (I believe he gave two weeks to each). Moderation and portion control have always been my go-to diet method. He writes about his adventures with juicers and dehydrators, but only mentions his introductions of quinoa, bok choy, and other foods in his statistic notes. Did he know how to cook this stuff that he'd never eaten before? Or did his wife know? Did he actually like it, or just eat it because it's healthy? And the chronolgy isn't as straight forward as his chapters imply, so things overlapped or happened in different orders, which sometimes threw me off. I liked that he had a team of experts he was relying on, but he looks into so many things and mentions the kooky alongside the scientifically backed, all of it told in his humorous storytelling format, so that not a lot of it stuck with me.  As with his religion book (I haven't read The Know It All), I think someone looking for straight up humor might find his books too fact heavy, and someone looking for tips or wisdom might find his books a little too specific to his life to be applied generally, or might find the treatment a bit too light. The publisher category is biography which is the probably the only way to classify it in order to meet expectations of genre: You have to be looking for a mix of the humor and info for his adventures to resonate. His stories of his wife, grandpa, aunt Marti help balance the humor and his obsession, so that you can tell he is living a real life while assigning himself these odd tasks. And I can see how his health lessons will disappear from my mind since I hear so much of it in magazines, TV shows, etc, but if anything sticks with me about the book it will probably be the elements involving his family or even those side characters who reappear, like his trainer or the Cave Man. I usually judge a book by how original or memorable it is, and those characters don't carry quite enough of this book for me to think I'll be able to tell you much about it next year. But it hit a few touching moments, was a quick fun read, had an occasional look into something unfamiliar, and plenty of humor, so it was all I expected of it. "
231,141659907X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1270609-brittany,3,"How I Came To Read This Book: I'm guessing I heard about it in Entertainment Weekly. I've always been fascinated by biology and the human body, and A.J. Jacobs' (semi-serious) quest to become the healthiest man alive was intriguing - and turned out to be quite different than what I'd bargained for, in a good way.The Plot: A.J. Jacobs is sort of the Morgan Spurlock of the nonfiction / journalism world. His past two books were all about taking on epic, life-altering projects (reading the encyclopaedia and following the rules of the Bible to the letter), and this one is no different. After exercising his mind and exploring his faith, this book is focused on all the crazy ways we try to get and stay healthy - from the inside out, top down. Each chapter is centered on a particular body part, and Jacobs' forays into speaking with experts, trying out routines, and somewhat attempting to bust myths by separating the fact from fiction in those medical claims (i.e. blueberries are not the world's best superfruit. If you believe it, the Maine marketing folks have done a good job). The Good & The Bad: Like I said, this book was really different than I anticipated. It was more of an intellectual and experiential smorgasbord of anecdotes and experiences, some given no more weight than a sentence, as opposed to a deep-digging day-by-day progress story (although there is some chronology to the book). On the plus side, it made for a quite light and easy read, filled with those bite-sized snippets of information our generation so craves. On the negative, I never felt like the book really went particularly deep into any one direction - although perhaps rightfully so. By the end of the book, Jacobs' himself acknowledges we still don't know so much, and that what worked for him might not work for you. The main takeaway here is to at least be aware of some of the major hazards we are exposed to, and see if changing some behaviours will have a positive impact on your life. If it does, great - I can say myself, I've been sampling ideas from the book over the last week and have enjoyed them / have many more I want to try out (drinking ice water *burns* calories!) My favourite is the advice to try standing for (at least) an hour or two during your workday - I leave work feeling way less mushy in the brain and the legs. At the same time, I also appreciated that some of the extremist examples Jacobs' references - many of which were more amusing than anything - probably aren't for everyone. It was amazing how often peoples behaviours' were inconclusively linked to their health, or how many contradictory studies exist out there. You get the sense that Jacobs may have gone into this looking for a foolproof guide to healthiness by examining all angles, and what he ends up with is a hedgehog of ideas that's hard to conceptualize into anything tangible. I'm not saying I went into this book expecting a miracle health book - that's definitely not the intent. But it's so surface and skims through so much at times, it's hard to rate this higher than a 3. I did enjoy it, and I think anyone with a passing interest in biology and health will enjoy it as much as I did, but I wish - not for lack of Jacobs' trying - it gave me a little more conclusive insight. The Bottom Line: A bit of a lark, but has some real insight you can incorporate into your everyday life. Anything Memorable?: I found it weird that Jacobs frequently - I mean every chapter practically - talked about advocating a plant-based diet yet didn't actual delve into it in any real form, other than a brief foray into raw veganism (not for me). That was one of the weaknesses of the book I suppose - it delved into extremes, which, while amusing and enlightening, wasn't all that practical. 60-book Challenge?: Book #43 in 2012"
232,141659907X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/10093055-angie-fehl,4,"I'm revisiting Jacobs' work in experimental journalism -- a process where he gives himself one monumental project, usually for a year or so, and writes a whole book about the process. The first of these I read was his book A Year Of Living Biblically, where he attempted to live by biblical era standards of clothing, diet, etc as literally as possible. I believe Drop Dead Healthy was written before that one, though. In this book, Jacobs, inspired by his own health scare, decides to take on a slew of popular diets, exercise programs and health fads, equipment, technology, treatments. Each chapter covers one specific area of his body (heart health, lung improvement, leg strength, etc.), detailing what all he got into to improve that particular area. Since he's writing from a male perspective, he even gets looks into how to improve testicular health. Just some of the topics he researches (and what he discovers in the process):> Vitamin C helps fight peridontal disease, but citrus is rough on tooth enamel.. soo... > ""Orthorexia"" is a term coined by Dr. Steven Bratman to describe when people fixate SO hard on dieting, to the point of the stress actually outweighing any nutritional benefits. Jacobs himself also refers to this mode of thinking as ""health food fetishism"". That said, Jacobs also puts himself on a few of the trendiest diet plans -- Paleo, Raw, No Sugar, and juice cleanse routines -- just to see how he fares and what it does for his body. At the time he was writing this book, he also managed to snag an interview with health guru Jack Lalanne (who has since passed away, age 96).> Jacobs researches the benefits of acupuncture, laugh yoga, and ""worry exchange"", where you literally team up with someone else -- they worry about your problems, you worry about theirs. He also looks at ""neurobic exercise"" for the brain: doing your daily tasks but doing them in the reverse order you naturally would (ie. taking a different route to work, using your non-dominant hand as your dominant for a time, etc.). He also looks into some of the newer trends like anti-gravity yoga (Sky Gym type places) and Strollercise for new moms, as well as programs for the more hardcore minded -- CrossFit and the Roman Legionnaire workout, which apparently involves smashing logs out in the woods with iron mallets?! Jacobs even takes on pole dancing classes! He also attempts to make it family get-together time when he does treadmill work and Pilates class with his mom and weight training with his dad. > Jacobs describes using Odysseus contracts (aka Ulysses Contracts) to help keep him on his goals. If I remember correctly, this was also a tool he mentions using in A Year Of Living Biblically. What keeps me reading Jacobs' books is not only the education the reader is given from all the data this guy compiles with each project, but also the fact that he can writes these books with such great humor, often poking fun at his own shortcomings.I personally loved how he talked about being all gung ho for this particular experiment and then catches a cold shortly into the program X-P Also, his record of all his wife's reactions and responses to what he's doing or what he brings home is definitely bonus entertainment. The chapters are nicely laid out in a sort of log or journal form so all the science and such that Jacobs covers is not overwhelming for the reader. So if you're all about becoming a more knowledgeable person, I wholeheartedly recommend getting into some of his works. Even if it feels like a lot of information at once, you can do what I do and just take a chapter or two a day, process that and then go on to the next section. You'll be surprised at the wealth of info that sticks in your noggin!"
233,141659907X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/647117-nicole,4,"Wow--I really plowed through this book! I'm a big fan of AJ Jacobs, and have read all of his books, which all fall into the ""immersion-journalism"" category. As usual, AJ Jacobs wrote a highly entertaining and informative book documenting his 2 years of striving to become the healthiest man alive. As a bit of a health-nut myself, I didn't just read this book for entertainment purposes, I actually paid attention for health tips. So, here's some of what I found interesting: Meditation is extraordinarily good for your health. Yes, I already knew this, but I have a problem with what I call ""spazzy-brain syndrome"". But, I'm not alone here, and what AJ does is he meditates by watching the gently pulsating sleep-mode light on a Macbook and breathes in sync with it. I never noticed that the sleep light actually resembles the deep breathing of sleep. So I tried it. And it gave my brain some focus. Nice tip AJ.Something else that caught my attention as a ""dietaholic"" who has tried just about every diet out there, I was interested to read that the Mediterranean Diet is the most widely accepted diet with the most scientific backing. It's a diet that I haven't specifically tried, though it sounds right up my alley.Noise-pollution…a health hazard I have previously given very little thought to, although reading about it did encourage me to try on the Bose noise-canceling headphones that he talks about, and I must say they are WONDERFUL. Though I will not be buying them anytime soon with their $300 price tag. Still, I think my world is too noisy, and I actually have taken steps to quiet it a bit. Walking. I used to have a pedometer that I clipped on to my pants, and I made certain that I walked more than 10,000 steps every day. That often meant walking in circles around the playground my kids were playing on rather than sitting on a nearby bench to just watch. It's a little thing, but those steps do make a huge difference. Makes me want to pay attention to moving more, even though I am a frequent exerciser. Everything in moderation. People who go to ""health"" extremes are just as at-risk as those who ignore their health. For wrinkles, one of the only things that actually works is Retin-A. But, like the Bose noise-cancelling headphones, it's bloody expensive, so I probably won't be trying that one anytime soon either.Chew more. Breathe from your stomach. Give thanks. Try new foods like kale and quinoa. Yes, I actually did buy these things on my last shopping trip. The kale was delicious. Haven't tried the quinoa yet (pronounced keen-wah by the way…) High Intensity Interval Training is most effective (which is good news for us Zumba enthusiasts…) Fidget. Actually use a smaller plate. Drink more water, specifically 15 minutes prior to meals. Have protein for breakfast. Eat spicy foods--they curb your appetite for salty and sweet and give your metabolism a boost. LOVED hearing that one. Eat more veggies. Avoid simple carbs. Add crunch to your food. Shop the perimeter of the store. If you're going to eat meat, eat it as a side dish. Don't use anti-bacterial soap, just use regular soap. Stuff I've heard before, but great tips nonetheless. One thing I think the book lacked was before and after pics. He told us his beginning and ending weight and other various stats, but after 2 years of regular gym attendance after never going previously, I would've thought pictures would be telling. But the pics he did include were great. The book as a whole was great. I'd recommend it."
234,141659907X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2349088-roberto-scarlato,5,"When I first sat down to read this book on my kindle, I had a pretty clear idea of how committed this writer really is to experimentation and research. I've read The Know-it-all and The Year of Living biblically and enjoyed them both. This author has the perfect balance of facts and humor that I've ever read.Not only does he plunge himself into the subjects he tackles but he does so for months or even years, reading every book on the subject he intends to document.So when I heard that he was completing his, what he calls, ""Mind, Body and Soul Trilogy"", I had to buy it right away. Chances are I will read it again.Since this is a non-fiction book, I decided to review it in three ways: entertainment, interesting and what I've learned.Is it entertaining?Yes, extremely. I marveled at the wealth of facts he's unearthed on health myths and just how far some people will go to remain healthy. Some fanatics are so into their own health clicks that they don't even know they are causing more harm than good. Like his other books, there were times when I had to put the book down because I had to walk off a laugh-out-loud moment. My wife thought I was crazy. I was so immersed and interested in knowing these healthy weirdoes. I laughed at the fact that there are people out there in public parks running around like cavemen thinking that doing so is the pinnacle of healthy living. I doubled over in a giggle fit finding out that the writer hurt his shoulder kayaking on the Wii console, or through his misadventures during a Laugh-Yoga class, or finding out that cursing alleviates stubbed toe pain. Yes, the laughs are not on every single page but there were more than enough to keep me reading.Is it interesting?I would say so. I was particularly surprised at just how many Health habits aren't good for you. There are people addicted to exercising or never getting sick. There are people obsessed with Whole Foods when really you will still find sugar around every corner and the only thing getting slimmer is your own wallet. As for the diets, he's tried them all. He even covered the South Beach Diet which I was on at one point. Yes it made me slim down slightly but I felt miserable the whole time.What I've learned?Since reading this book, I've become a firm believer in Chewdism. While I won't spend a full minute chewing my food, I do find myself slowing down and chewing my food more. I know that chocolate, especially dark chocolate, is good for your heart. I've become more health conscious, joining weight watchers to track my meals and doing Power90 exercises (35 minutes on weekdays) and feeling good about it. Whenever I can, I get up and walk around. I'm actually interested in buying a pedometer to measure how many steps I take in a regular work day. I used to be part Hypochondriac and part OCD but now I'm actively taking steps to limit those stray thoughts and feeling less worrisome about it. I now make a list of things I know I should not have: No Soda, No Ice Cream, No Burritos. In short, this book motivated me to get fit quick.As for the people who try to knock this one man's efforts, I would say that they should know that it isn't really all that healthy leaving a bad review to a well-researched, two-year invested, delightful escape into one subject that is so easy to laugh about. I mean, come on, the guy wrote this entire book while on a treadmill, that's commitment right there."

I first bought this book for my boyfriend...actually I pre-order it; we got it the second day after it came out. Why? We are big fans of Jacobs and it was my boyfriend who introduced me to his books. Last year I read The Year of Living Biblically and in March of this year I read The Know-it-All. I was really excited to read it and, since I loved the other two, I had big expectations. Boy, did the book deliver. Jacobs spends 2 full years working on himself, taking care of this skin, meals, exercising, getting healthy...and happy. To quote the book: ""The key to making healthy decisions is to respect your future self. Honor him or her. Treat him or her like you would treat a friend or a loved one""As in his other books (I still have to read the Guinea Pig Diaries, but the order has been placed, and with 82% off!!!!) he doesn’t only talks about the “experiment” itself, but also how it affects him, his family and in smaller doses, about family in general. In the first book of the “series”, The Know-it-All, we learn about him and his wife trying to conceive, how his father also tried to read the whole Encyclopedia Britannica, and so on.In this book we meet his Grandfather, a remarkable 96 year old, with a lovely remark: ""You can retire, but you must find something you’re passionate about in your retirement. You need a reason to wake up in the morning""Something else that I really enjoy about his books, is the familiarity of the whole thing, I feel like a friend of mine is just telling me what he/she did during the week-end. The writing is fluid and casual, like a conversation. And I have to say, I love Julie, his wife. She has the patience of a saint, and her comments always make me smile. She tried some of the stuff with Jacobs in this book. I cannot blame her for not trying anything on the biblical year; at the same time, I loved her ""answer"" to a lot of the restrictions during that year...but I'm changing books here. Sorry.What did I learn with this book? That I’m doing fine, not great but fine in my own quest to be healthy. I watch my portions, and have also controlled a little of my roommate and my boyfriend; I’m lucky to work in an environment that is not highly noisy; I don’t wear as much sunscreen as is recommended, but the point I’ve been trying to carve in my friend’s brains was valid, it does make a difference to apply sunscreen in the morning; I love my Pilates class, even when it hurts the day after, “luckily” I cannot spend 8 hours sitting at the lab, since I have to move from one room to the other in order to finish my experiment. I could still be more active though.And finally, my favorite of them all: Reading before going to sleep, might actually be helpful to sleep better! (As long as is a non-electronic book J)Truth be told, I learnt about a ton of new tendencies, but the main point is that everything has to be done in moderation. From eating, to exercising, you cannot...should not exaggerate. Did I like this book? Oh yes! I think is my favorite book from Jacobs...we will see how it goes with the Guinea Pig Diaries."
236,141659907X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/125347-donovan,4,"Funny, loaded with great tips, easy to read and applicable to me - an overweight health conscience individual who wants to make health a priority, but constantly find himself overwhelmed with all of the opinions, contrary advice and amount of research (not to mention miss guided priorities and laziness).Recently, I spend close to a thousand dollars for an initial appointment with a naturopathic doctor. While I'm still in the evaluation process, I can't help looking skeptically at a number of his recommendations, some very contrary to other things I've read (excessive fat is ok, eat lots of meat, etc). What I loved about A. J. is he shares this healthy skepticism and he looks at things practically and methodically, but with an open mind and a willingness to try everything. I felt like he did it for the rest of us. His book project and advance gave him the time to do what the rest of us want to know, but don't have time to do (oh wait, he also is an editor for Esquire...so I guess that is another excuse). Anyway, he confirmed my thoughts on many issues and I'm happy to just following along with his conclusions - and in others situations I want to do a little more research before forming an opinion, but his practical advice definitely gives me a head start.His wit and writing make the book easy to follow. I read the first half on a cross country flight and the only thing that made me put it down was the passengers getting up all around me. The rest I finished during my brief period of reading before bed - a tip I've taken from A.J. that I'm determined to make a habit.Much of the advice is stuff you already know, but it serves as a great reminder. Exercise more - eat less - sleep more - relax - smile often, etc. Other things were less intuitive - don't read on toilet - observe Sabbath - avoid pedicures like the plague - etc.One of the most delightful things about the book is his sense of humor - it helped a book on health flow. Here's some quotes to give you a flavor of his under toned, slightly sarcastic, humor.""I did get a colonic, but I've decided not write about it at length. I didn't find it helpful or enlightening. I can tell you want it felt like, though: It felt like someone shooting water up your butt.""""Cigarettes' cost far outweigh any resulting trimness, just as asphyxiation outweighs the benefits of stretching out the spine when you hang yourself from a shower curtain rod.""""The MRI has a repertoire of noises that resemble, in no particular order: a game-show buzzer for a wrong answer, urgent knocking, a modem from 1992, a grizzly-bear growl, and a man with a raspy voice shouting what sounds like ""mother cooler!""""After decimating several vegetables, I decide juicing is my favorite form of food preparation. There's something perversely appealing about subjecting an innocent plant to that much violence.""""The dehydrator blows warm air on your food for hours, sometimes days. It reminds me of the temperature and intensity of dog's breath. So imagine a German shepherd exhaling on your fruit for a weekend.""""So, if weight loss is your goal, and you have impressive self-control, raw food is something to consider.""""Step back for a minute. Pretend you're from Mars. From a coldly rational point of view, pedestrian helmets aren't a crazy idea."""
237,141659907X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/879591-sara,4,"I won an advanced copy of this book through the First Reads program. The author has written previous books about various life experiments he's conducted; I'd previously read his book about living biblically for a year, trying to follow all the numerous, and sometimes conflicting, rules in the Bible. This book is along the same lines, following his adventures over the course of two years as he strives to be the healthiest person in the world. This means changing his lifestyle to adopt healthier habits, working out in various ways that are supposed to be best for your health, eating a better diet, and so on.I wouldn't call this book ""hilarious,"" but it's definitely amusing. Not only are his adventures in the name of health entertaining, but his writing is extremely witty. Even though you might begin reading the book with the thought that he's simply doing this healthy experiment to write a book about it, the results are so interesting and he does so much research about it, throwing himself into this fully, that you can't help but enjoy. I loved all the descriptions of the ways in which he tries to work out, and the diets he follows, even for brief periods of time. As he points out, there is so much conflicting advice out there about how to be healthy, how to work out properly, how to eat your way to health... it's exhausting. And yet he attempts to follow many of the regiments in the name of science. One of my favorite parts of the book came when he follows the ""Caveman Workout"", exercising the way cavemen supposedly did, shirtless and barefoot in Central Park, lifting logs in lieu of boulders with a handful of other men in this Paleo Movement. He paints such a vivid picture of what he's doing, and you can't help but laugh at some of the ridiculousness he encounters, with devoted followers to each and every movement.It was also entertaining to hear his adventures following some of the diets that have been hyped up as the way to health - the raw food diet, the no-carb diet, the juice cleanse... He not only describes what the diet entails, but he goes on to talk about what different scientists and health professionals have said about the diet, and then describes his own experiences following it. One of the more memorable parts for me was his description of the juice cleanse, buying the way expensive juices touted by B-list celebrities, then trying to starve off hunger as he craved anything solid to eat. For all the entertainment found in this book, there is also some advice about health and ways that you really can make a difference in your own life without going completely overboard. I enjoyed the balance of everything, as it never felt as if I was reading a self-help book, but simply an entertaining social experiment that left me with some helpful advice. I imagine that not everyone will like this book, as its dry humor and ridiculous situations could seem off-putting at first. However, if you're interested in reading about someone's adventures participating in all sorts of health fads - some that you've heard of, others that are completely strange - and hearing about it all from a self-deprecating but witty narrator, this is a great book. I'd easily recommend it."
238,141659907X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/68833154-zack-wussow,2,"It's ok. I found this one less interesting than his others, but that may be because I was already familiar with a lot of the material already, unlike his biblical and encyclopedic books. And the last third is a totally useless index. For example: incidental exercise (fidgeting), and on the page listed the only reference is '...even fidgeting (or as so and so calls it, incidental exercise) can be good exercise...' No one needs an index for that!"
239,141659907X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1288876-julie-g,4,"Remember that time I read The Year of Living Biblically and raved about it and then A.J. Jacobs EMAILED ME??? Me too. I was a brand-new blogger and almost died when I realized that authors actually read blogger reviews and respond to them. So basically, besides the fact that The Year of Living Biblically was incredibly well done, the fact that A.J. Jacobs actually replied to my review (which, let's be honest, was not that great) made me a fan for life. I was dying to read this one and the perfect opportunity arose when Jennie got a copy from Goodreads (I think). She passed it on to me and I'm supposed to pass it on to Jacki, which I really do intend to do one day in the very near future. Really.So Drop Dead Healthy is similar to Jacobs' other books in terms of the whole guinea-pig thing. Basically his style is to choose something and learn all about it by using his life as an experiment. In The Year of Living Biblically, he spends an entire year living as close as he can to Old Testament law. In The Know It All he reads through an entire set of encyclopedias. In Drop Dead Healthy, the theme is phsyical fitness and how to achieve it. Jacobs goes through all of the body systems, one by one, and tries out different methods, diets, and fitness regimes and chronicles their success.WritingI, for one, think Jacobs is hilarious. His sense of humor is spot on with my tastes and I spent most of the book laughing out loud. It's written like a memoir and it's about his personal experiences, but he also includes good background information from a scientific standpoint and references many other texts that offer the data and research information that is missing from his own personal experiences. I probably added ten or so books to my to-be-read list based on Jacobs' references. I think he did a great job of balancing the scientific information with humor and his own personal anecdotes. Entertainment ValueAgain, the book was really funny. I like humor and I like learning new things, and Jacobs combines both in his books. I'm also interested right now in dieting and fitness, so this gave me some insight into what worked and what didn't, for Jacobs at least, as well as what the current trends are - and what I ought to avoid. The caveman workout, for example, isn't one I'm anxious to try any time soon.OverallI highly recommend picking this one up. It's a fast read, informative and funny. I think it's a good jumping off place for those who enjoy humor or memoir and are interested in non-fiction, as well as those who are interested in health and fitness. It's a good way to ease your way into more hard-core scientific reads (and provides a great list of those more in-depth books as well). Thank you, Jennie, for sending me your copy and I promise I'll have it on its way to Jacki ASAP!"
240,141659907X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6182210-krista,3,"I read this book on a whim after my mom recommended it to me - we're a very healthy family, so it was more for the comic value of it more than anything else. I can't say I learned a lot that I didn't already know, but it was certainly interesting and entertaining at times reading A.J.'s chronicles of health experiments - some logical, some a bit absurd (hence, the funny bit). Read it for the journey, not the destination."

This is a great book because of what we can learn about health, but also because Jacobs is funny, and the information is presented in a way that is accessible. If you have ever wondered about certain fad diets, what kind of exercise is ""best"" or just want to enjoy a book, I recommend this. (The audio version is incredibly enjoyable!)"

I appreciated the humor (especially his wife's jabs) and learned a few things, but was hoping for more holistic health advice than the body part specific tips.

257,141659907X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/12497233-karen,4,"September feels like a ""new year,"" even though I've been out of school for two decades, and so I read this thinking, I need to lose several pounds and just generally get up and get out more. But where to start? And what's the best, most effective way to do so? There are entire libraries out there devoted to the subject, but this book is actually an entertaining look - and for that, it gets 4-stars. To actually make healthy living - with advice based on science and sound, rational reasoning - into a book that can be read without making the reader feel bad, obese or on death's door? Well, that's a true feat.A.J. Jacobs does this by making himself the guinea pig, a gimmick he's used on the Bible and on Internet-level knowledge. In this case, he goes through body parts, looking at the science and what it says about how to achieve maximum healthfulness, which in this case doesn't mean model-thinness. The book's real message is how little we know about how the body works and what can and will make it work better. There's too many complicating factors to know for sure what makes carrots good for us, for example, because there's just as many complicating factors that make carrots bad for us. (Smoking seems to be that one exception.)My quibble with this book is that we spend lots of time on A.J.'s time with cavemen fitness freaks, for example, because it's a cutesy story, but very little time with almost everything else. There's so much stuffed in here and some of the stories/appointments/tests/trials are reduced to a paragraph. Eating raw food for a week, for example, gets about a half page. Still, I found the advice in the book helpful and somewhat obvious. (It's nice to have it confirmed.) Move more, make that movement a pattern of intensity and moderation, steer clear of white foods and get a good night's sleep. It's already gotten me up off the couch, combing through my pantry and doing 5-minute workouts for 4 cycles. That good night's sleep remains elusive! "
258,141659907X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1499157-rod-hilton,3,"I'm a big fan of A.J. Jacobs, I've read all of his other books and I generally find him to be a humorous and engaging writer. Drop Dead Healthy is no exception to this, it's interesting and funny throughout, but it's not as good as his other books.Jacobs wrote a book where he read the entire Encyclopedia, and one where he decided to follow the Bible literally for a year (both great books), both of which were long-term, very focused experiments with his life. Then he wrote a book which was more a collection of random, short experiments (The Guinea Pig Diaries), more or less a collection of short articles about doing random crap for a month or so. This third book is the weakest of the set because it lacks the focus of the first two books.So when I saw his new book was about trying to become healthy, it seemed to me like a return to form: a focused, directed book again. He even tries to link this book to his earlier two, by claiming that the first was about the mind, the second the spirit, and this the body, making something of a trilogy out of them. Unfortunately, that's not really how the book turned out.Drop Dead Healthy is, once again, a collection of short experiments, with one experiment per chapter. He tries the gym for one, he tries dieting for one, he goes Paleo for one, he focuses on germs for one, he focuses on getting peace and quiet for one (seriously?), he tries to have more sex for one, he focuses on toxins in his home for one, he works on his teeth for one, etc. He devotes chapters to posture, smell, sleeping, eyesight, and many more. Most of the chapters just have A.J. moving from random study to random study, trying it out for a bit and humorously talking about the impact on his life.What the book lacks is a focus like his first two similar outings. An entire book focused on A.J. trying to eat right and work out would have been great. He could have included his Paleo experiments, his experiments with different kinds of workout routines, free-running, treadmills, etc. Most of this material is instead relegated to a handful of chapters, and the rest is focused on stuff only barely related to the book's concept of trying to live healthy. The conclusion I came to was that A.J. didn't like eating healthy and working out, so he didn't stick to it very well for the full 2 years of the book, and instead had to pad the book with a bunch of random crap about massage treatments and smelling better and improving his posture to reach book length. I particularly hated his insistence on giving equal (or more) time to new agey nonsense, largely inspired by his Aunt. This sort of thing makes for perhaps an interesting article or two in Esquire, but it seems barely related to the concept of the book.It's unfortunate, the chapters that actually relate to HEALTHY living are interesting, so an entire book devoted to them would have been great. A.J.'s usual wit and charm make the chapters about random junk interesting and fun to read, but they make the overall book seem muddled and directionless. The book is also, unfortunately, not terribly informative. A.J. doesn't do much to distinguish between what actually works in terms of getting healthy and what doesn't. Someone looking to get healthy will be ENTERTAINED by this book, but won't learn anything from it. Finally, I'd like to make special mention of Jacob's wife, who really comes off like a pain in the ass in this book. As a person who lost a lot of weight I can tell you having your spouse be encouraging when you lose weight makes a huge difference. At one point after A.J. has been working hard on changing his eating habits and losing a few pounds, Julie tells him he went from looking 4 months pregnant to 3.5. If my wife had told me that after working hard I'd have had my motivation totally sapped. His wife usually comes off as a tolerant but somewhat disapproving person, graciously putting up with A.J.'s craziness while making occasional offhand remarks (she's the stereotypical ""sane wife married to a hilarious manchild"" so common in crappy sitcoms). In this book, she comes off like a real jerk, constantly making obnoxious remarks about the author.Overall, it's better than Guinea Pig Diaries, but nowhere near as good as Know-It-All or Living Biblically."
259,141659907X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3312882-rachel-p,4,"I won this book as a goodreads giveaway and I am so glad I did! In his novel, “Drop Dead Healthy”, A.J. Jacobs documents his 2 year long journey to become the healthiest man alive. He does a tremendous amount of research and reads a vast amount of studies from a variety of sources on the subject of human health. I appreciate how he makes this book about total health instead of just about diet and exercise. He breaks down the story by body part; focusing on a different part of the body in each chapter.**SPOILER ALERT**I actually rate this book 4.5 stars. I really enjoyed how he went for it; fitness crazes, fad diets, alternative medicine, etc. Out of the mountain of research he selected a few key studies to relate and expert advice to pursue. I took pleasure in learning about the calorie restrictive diet (living on the edge of starvation), the Paleo Movement (living like a cavemen), walking and running barefoot, replacing manufactured beauty products (such as shampoo and soap) with natural alternatives (such as baking soda and vinegar). Somethings I tried out with great success (like deskercising – desk exercising) and somethings I wouldn’t go near unless I got my own book deal (like acupuncture). It is a spectacular read but there are a few issues that prevent me from giving it the full 5 stars. For instance, there are two chapters on the stomach in which A.J. discusses different diets he’s trying but the diet is an ever-present element of the entire journey and I don’t feel like he always devotes as much attention to it as he should. For example, the author mentions at the end of a chapter he started eating steel cut oatmeal but doesn’t mention why or how this came about. I know that he didn’t want to make this book too long and perhaps in the interest of prioritization he couldn’t explain every food/diet choice and how it came about but I personally would have been interested in learning much more. He does sum up key points in the appendices but I still think it’s not enough. There are also no consistent measurements reported at the end of each chapter except weight. Granted, I don’t expect a whole long list of measurement indices but more consistency would’ve been better.Here are a few key highlights that I took away: - Eat on smaller plates because we tend to eat everything that’s on our plates. - Chew your food thoroughly and eat with family and friends instead of watching TV or reading. You will eat slower and thus give your body the 20 minutes it needs to feel full. - Stand more and choose activities (or modify existing ones) that put you in motion. Studies show that spending 1 hour at the gym and the rest of the day at a desk or on the couch is not much better for you than if you spent the whole day stationary. - There’s no such thing as superfoods. All fruits and veggies are equally good for you. Just make sure you wash non-organic produce in hot water and vinegar and let sit for 5 minutes. - Set fitness goals. Buy a pedometer and complete against yourself or a partner to see how many steps you can walk in a day (the recommended amount is 10,000 steps or 5 miles per day). Also, registering for a marathon and then having to train for it is great motivation to get or stay in shape. - Keep your brain fit by challenging yourself and trying new things.  - Enjoy life. Don’t let your health become a preoccupation to the exclusion of all other aspects of your life. Enjoy spending time with people that you love and you are happy to be around. Don’t waste time stressing over getting enough exercise or counting calories. This novel is packed with so much quality information it is definitely a keeper for me. A.J. is very relatable starting out as your average out of shape American male. He includes his family in his health project and intersperses his story with personal anecdotes which I think make his experience more real. And his writing is hilarious; I’m talking LAUGH OUT LOUD funny. So I actually burned calories while reading this book especially when I was doing it while iPloding on my treadmill desk. Thanks A.J.!"
260,141659907X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4962920-jill-furedy,4,"A.J. Jacobs is amusing as always, and had I come away feeling that I'd learned some relevant health tips, I'd have given the book more stars. Part of that may be my personal issues though, reading about a mostly healthy, if somewhat neurotic and underexercised man pursue ultimate health doesn't necessarily translate to a nutritionally challenged woman with Crohn's disease! So when he's talking about dried mangoes as his vice and I'm eating cheetos, I'm thinking he's already ahead of me in the dietary department. And when he's eating walnuts or apples, I'm wishing I could eat those without getting sick. And in a twist of odd timing, I read the stomach revistied section in the waiting room for my follow up appointment to get a b12 shot, to try and get back to normal levels, and where I was instructed to pick up calcium citrate and vitamin D, both of which were areas I'm a bit low on, as well and being told to cut back on sugars as I'm not yet prediabetic, but still too high. So maybe that's why his giving up dried mangoes seemed unimpressive, when I know how much more I need to change my diet! Though I did like his Odysseus contract to give them up.  Anyway, Jacobs clearly needed more exercise, but basically it was pneumonia that motivated him to begin the project, rather than a chronic health issue or doctors orders. Reminded me a bit of the Happiness Project, where a woman who was not unhappy nevertheless sets about to improve her happiness levels. On the one hand, I agree with her theory...work on it before you HAVE to and it will be easier should circumstances change. Which definately applies to health as well. But it still makes their self imposed challenges seem less impressive than those overcoming more severe obstacles.  But Jacobs is fun to read, so I was willing to see where he went with this. I hoped to pick up a few health tips, but I don't think I came away with much. He wasn't on either his vegan or his protein-heavy diets long enough to really see any differences (I believe he gave two weeks to each). Moderation and portion control have always been my go-to diet method. He writes about his adventures with juicers and dehydrators, but only mentions his introductions of quinoa, bok choy, and other foods in his statistic notes. Did he know how to cook this stuff that he'd never eaten before? Or did his wife know? Did he actually like it, or just eat it because it's healthy? And the chronolgy isn't as straight forward as his chapters imply, so things overlapped or happened in different orders, which sometimes threw me off. I liked that he had a team of experts he was relying on, but he looks into so many things and mentions the kooky alongside the scientifically backed, all of it told in his humorous storytelling format, so that not a lot of it stuck with me.  As with his religion book (I haven't read The Know It All), I think someone looking for straight up humor might find his books too fact heavy, and someone looking for tips or wisdom might find his books a little too specific to his life to be applied generally, or might find the treatment a bit too light. The publisher category is biography which is the probably the only way to classify it in order to meet expectations of genre: You have to be looking for a mix of the humor and info for his adventures to resonate. His stories of his wife, grandpa, aunt Marti help balance the humor and his obsession, so that you can tell he is living a real life while assigning himself these odd tasks. And I can see how his health lessons will disappear from my mind since I hear so much of it in magazines, TV shows, etc, but if anything sticks with me about the book it will probably be the elements involving his family or even those side characters who reappear, like his trainer or the Cave Man. I usually judge a book by how original or memorable it is, and those characters don't carry quite enough of this book for me to think I'll be able to tell you much about it next year. But it hit a few touching moments, was a quick fun read, had an occasional look into something unfamiliar, and plenty of humor, so it was all I expected of it. "
261,141659907X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1270609-brittany,3,"How I Came To Read This Book: I'm guessing I heard about it in Entertainment Weekly. I've always been fascinated by biology and the human body, and A.J. Jacobs' (semi-serious) quest to become the healthiest man alive was intriguing - and turned out to be quite different than what I'd bargained for, in a good way.The Plot: A.J. Jacobs is sort of the Morgan Spurlock of the nonfiction / journalism world. His past two books were all about taking on epic, life-altering projects (reading the encyclopaedia and following the rules of the Bible to the letter), and this one is no different. After exercising his mind and exploring his faith, this book is focused on all the crazy ways we try to get and stay healthy - from the inside out, top down. Each chapter is centered on a particular body part, and Jacobs' forays into speaking with experts, trying out routines, and somewhat attempting to bust myths by separating the fact from fiction in those medical claims (i.e. blueberries are not the world's best superfruit. If you believe it, the Maine marketing folks have done a good job). The Good & The Bad: Like I said, this book was really different than I anticipated. It was more of an intellectual and experiential smorgasbord of anecdotes and experiences, some given no more weight than a sentence, as opposed to a deep-digging day-by-day progress story (although there is some chronology to the book). On the plus side, it made for a quite light and easy read, filled with those bite-sized snippets of information our generation so craves. On the negative, I never felt like the book really went particularly deep into any one direction - although perhaps rightfully so. By the end of the book, Jacobs' himself acknowledges we still don't know so much, and that what worked for him might not work for you. The main takeaway here is to at least be aware of some of the major hazards we are exposed to, and see if changing some behaviours will have a positive impact on your life. If it does, great - I can say myself, I've been sampling ideas from the book over the last week and have enjoyed them / have many more I want to try out (drinking ice water *burns* calories!) My favourite is the advice to try standing for (at least) an hour or two during your workday - I leave work feeling way less mushy in the brain and the legs. At the same time, I also appreciated that some of the extremist examples Jacobs' references - many of which were more amusing than anything - probably aren't for everyone. It was amazing how often peoples behaviours' were inconclusively linked to their health, or how many contradictory studies exist out there. You get the sense that Jacobs may have gone into this looking for a foolproof guide to healthiness by examining all angles, and what he ends up with is a hedgehog of ideas that's hard to conceptualize into anything tangible. I'm not saying I went into this book expecting a miracle health book - that's definitely not the intent. But it's so surface and skims through so much at times, it's hard to rate this higher than a 3. I did enjoy it, and I think anyone with a passing interest in biology and health will enjoy it as much as I did, but I wish - not for lack of Jacobs' trying - it gave me a little more conclusive insight. The Bottom Line: A bit of a lark, but has some real insight you can incorporate into your everyday life. Anything Memorable?: I found it weird that Jacobs frequently - I mean every chapter practically - talked about advocating a plant-based diet yet didn't actual delve into it in any real form, other than a brief foray into raw veganism (not for me). That was one of the weaknesses of the book I suppose - it delved into extremes, which, while amusing and enlightening, wasn't all that practical. 60-book Challenge?: Book #43 in 2012"
262,141659907X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/10093055-angie-fehl,4,"I'm revisiting Jacobs' work in experimental journalism -- a process where he gives himself one monumental project, usually for a year or so, and writes a whole book about the process. The first of these I read was his book A Year Of Living Biblically, where he attempted to live by biblical era standards of clothing, diet, etc as literally as possible. I believe Drop Dead Healthy was written before that one, though. In this book, Jacobs, inspired by his own health scare, decides to take on a slew of popular diets, exercise programs and health fads, equipment, technology, treatments. Each chapter covers one specific area of his body (heart health, lung improvement, leg strength, etc.), detailing what all he got into to improve that particular area. Since he's writing from a male perspective, he even gets looks into how to improve testicular health. Just some of the topics he researches (and what he discovers in the process):> Vitamin C helps fight peridontal disease, but citrus is rough on tooth enamel.. soo... > ""Orthorexia"" is a term coined by Dr. Steven Bratman to describe when people fixate SO hard on dieting, to the point of the stress actually outweighing any nutritional benefits. Jacobs himself also refers to this mode of thinking as ""health food fetishism"". That said, Jacobs also puts himself on a few of the trendiest diet plans -- Paleo, Raw, No Sugar, and juice cleanse routines -- just to see how he fares and what it does for his body. At the time he was writing this book, he also managed to snag an interview with health guru Jack Lalanne (who has since passed away, age 96).> Jacobs researches the benefits of acupuncture, laugh yoga, and ""worry exchange"", where you literally team up with someone else -- they worry about your problems, you worry about theirs. He also looks at ""neurobic exercise"" for the brain: doing your daily tasks but doing them in the reverse order you naturally would (ie. taking a different route to work, using your non-dominant hand as your dominant for a time, etc.). He also looks into some of the newer trends like anti-gravity yoga (Sky Gym type places) and Strollercise for new moms, as well as programs for the more hardcore minded -- CrossFit and the Roman Legionnaire workout, which apparently involves smashing logs out in the woods with iron mallets?! Jacobs even takes on pole dancing classes! He also attempts to make it family get-together time when he does treadmill work and Pilates class with his mom and weight training with his dad. > Jacobs describes using Odysseus contracts (aka Ulysses Contracts) to help keep him on his goals. If I remember correctly, this was also a tool he mentions using in A Year Of Living Biblically. What keeps me reading Jacobs' books is not only the education the reader is given from all the data this guy compiles with each project, but also the fact that he can writes these books with such great humor, often poking fun at his own shortcomings.I personally loved how he talked about being all gung ho for this particular experiment and then catches a cold shortly into the program X-P Also, his record of all his wife's reactions and responses to what he's doing or what he brings home is definitely bonus entertainment. The chapters are nicely laid out in a sort of log or journal form so all the science and such that Jacobs covers is not overwhelming for the reader. So if you're all about becoming a more knowledgeable person, I wholeheartedly recommend getting into some of his works. Even if it feels like a lot of information at once, you can do what I do and just take a chapter or two a day, process that and then go on to the next section. You'll be surprised at the wealth of info that sticks in your noggin!"
263,141659907X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/647117-nicole,4,"Wow--I really plowed through this book! I'm a big fan of AJ Jacobs, and have read all of his books, which all fall into the ""immersion-journalism"" category. As usual, AJ Jacobs wrote a highly entertaining and informative book documenting his 2 years of striving to become the healthiest man alive. As a bit of a health-nut myself, I didn't just read this book for entertainment purposes, I actually paid attention for health tips. So, here's some of what I found interesting: Meditation is extraordinarily good for your health. Yes, I already knew this, but I have a problem with what I call ""spazzy-brain syndrome"". But, I'm not alone here, and what AJ does is he meditates by watching the gently pulsating sleep-mode light on a Macbook and breathes in sync with it. I never noticed that the sleep light actually resembles the deep breathing of sleep. So I tried it. And it gave my brain some focus. Nice tip AJ.Something else that caught my attention as a ""dietaholic"" who has tried just about every diet out there, I was interested to read that the Mediterranean Diet is the most widely accepted diet with the most scientific backing. It's a diet that I haven't specifically tried, though it sounds right up my alley.Noise-pollution…a health hazard I have previously given very little thought to, although reading about it did encourage me to try on the Bose noise-canceling headphones that he talks about, and I must say they are WONDERFUL. Though I will not be buying them anytime soon with their $300 price tag. Still, I think my world is too noisy, and I actually have taken steps to quiet it a bit. Walking. I used to have a pedometer that I clipped on to my pants, and I made certain that I walked more than 10,000 steps every day. That often meant walking in circles around the playground my kids were playing on rather than sitting on a nearby bench to just watch. It's a little thing, but those steps do make a huge difference. Makes me want to pay attention to moving more, even though I am a frequent exerciser. Everything in moderation. People who go to ""health"" extremes are just as at-risk as those who ignore their health. For wrinkles, one of the only things that actually works is Retin-A. But, like the Bose noise-cancelling headphones, it's bloody expensive, so I probably won't be trying that one anytime soon either.Chew more. Breathe from your stomach. Give thanks. Try new foods like kale and quinoa. Yes, I actually did buy these things on my last shopping trip. The kale was delicious. Haven't tried the quinoa yet (pronounced keen-wah by the way…) High Intensity Interval Training is most effective (which is good news for us Zumba enthusiasts…) Fidget. Actually use a smaller plate. Drink more water, specifically 15 minutes prior to meals. Have protein for breakfast. Eat spicy foods--they curb your appetite for salty and sweet and give your metabolism a boost. LOVED hearing that one. Eat more veggies. Avoid simple carbs. Add crunch to your food. Shop the perimeter of the store. If you're going to eat meat, eat it as a side dish. Don't use anti-bacterial soap, just use regular soap. Stuff I've heard before, but great tips nonetheless. One thing I think the book lacked was before and after pics. He told us his beginning and ending weight and other various stats, but after 2 years of regular gym attendance after never going previously, I would've thought pictures would be telling. But the pics he did include were great. The book as a whole was great. I'd recommend it."
264,141659907X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2349088-roberto-scarlato,5,"When I first sat down to read this book on my kindle, I had a pretty clear idea of how committed this writer really is to experimentation and research. I've read The Know-it-all and The Year of Living biblically and enjoyed them both. This author has the perfect balance of facts and humor that I've ever read.Not only does he plunge himself into the subjects he tackles but he does so for months or even years, reading every book on the subject he intends to document.So when I heard that he was completing his, what he calls, ""Mind, Body and Soul Trilogy"", I had to buy it right away. Chances are I will read it again.Since this is a non-fiction book, I decided to review it in three ways: entertainment, interesting and what I've learned.Is it entertaining?Yes, extremely. I marveled at the wealth of facts he's unearthed on health myths and just how far some people will go to remain healthy. Some fanatics are so into their own health clicks that they don't even know they are causing more harm than good. Like his other books, there were times when I had to put the book down because I had to walk off a laugh-out-loud moment. My wife thought I was crazy. I was so immersed and interested in knowing these healthy weirdoes. I laughed at the fact that there are people out there in public parks running around like cavemen thinking that doing so is the pinnacle of healthy living. I doubled over in a giggle fit finding out that the writer hurt his shoulder kayaking on the Wii console, or through his misadventures during a Laugh-Yoga class, or finding out that cursing alleviates stubbed toe pain. Yes, the laughs are not on every single page but there were more than enough to keep me reading.Is it interesting?I would say so. I was particularly surprised at just how many Health habits aren't good for you. There are people addicted to exercising or never getting sick. There are people obsessed with Whole Foods when really you will still find sugar around every corner and the only thing getting slimmer is your own wallet. As for the diets, he's tried them all. He even covered the South Beach Diet which I was on at one point. Yes it made me slim down slightly but I felt miserable the whole time.What I've learned?Since reading this book, I've become a firm believer in Chewdism. While I won't spend a full minute chewing my food, I do find myself slowing down and chewing my food more. I know that chocolate, especially dark chocolate, is good for your heart. I've become more health conscious, joining weight watchers to track my meals and doing Power90 exercises (35 minutes on weekdays) and feeling good about it. Whenever I can, I get up and walk around. I'm actually interested in buying a pedometer to measure how many steps I take in a regular work day. I used to be part Hypochondriac and part OCD but now I'm actively taking steps to limit those stray thoughts and feeling less worrisome about it. I now make a list of things I know I should not have: No Soda, No Ice Cream, No Burritos. In short, this book motivated me to get fit quick.As for the people who try to knock this one man's efforts, I would say that they should know that it isn't really all that healthy leaving a bad review to a well-researched, two-year invested, delightful escape into one subject that is so easy to laugh about. I mean, come on, the guy wrote this entire book while on a treadmill, that's commitment right there."
265,141659907X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/8213107-carolina,5,"Originally posted at: A Girl that Likes Books Who doesn’t want to be healthy? Specially now a days. I first bought this book for my boyfriend...actually I pre-order it; we got it the second day after it came out. Why? We are big fans of Jacobs and it was my boyfriend who introduced me to his books. Last year I read The Year of Living Biblically and in March of this year I read The Know-it-All. I was really excited to read it and, since I loved the other two, I had big expectations. Boy, did the book deliver. Jacobs spends 2 full years working on himself, taking care of this skin, meals, exercising, getting healthy...and happy. To quote the book: ""The key to making healthy decisions is to respect your future self. Honor him or her. Treat him or her like you would treat a friend or a loved one""As in his other books (I still have to read the Guinea Pig Diaries, but the order has been placed, and with 82% off!!!!) he doesn’t only talks about the “experiment” itself, but also how it affects him, his family and in smaller doses, about family in general. In the first book of the “series”, The Know-it-All, we learn about him and his wife trying to conceive, how his father also tried to read the whole Encyclopedia Britannica, and so on.In this book we meet his Grandfather, a remarkable 96 year old, with a lovely remark: ""You can retire, but you must find something you’re passionate about in your retirement. You need a reason to wake up in the morning""Something else that I really enjoy about his books, is the familiarity of the whole thing, I feel like a friend of mine is just telling me what he/she did during the week-end. The writing is fluid and casual, like a conversation. And I have to say, I love Julie, his wife. She has the patience of a saint, and her comments always make me smile. She tried some of the stuff with Jacobs in this book. I cannot blame her for not trying anything on the biblical year; at the same time, I loved her ""answer"" to a lot of the restrictions during that year...but I'm changing books here. Sorry.What did I learn with this book? That I’m doing fine, not great but fine in my own quest to be healthy. I watch my portions, and have also controlled a little of my roommate and my boyfriend; I’m lucky to work in an environment that is not highly noisy; I don’t wear as much sunscreen as is recommended, but the point I’ve been trying to carve in my friend’s brains was valid, it does make a difference to apply sunscreen in the morning; I love my Pilates class, even when it hurts the day after, “luckily” I cannot spend 8 hours sitting at the lab, since I have to move from one room to the other in order to finish my experiment. I could still be more active though.And finally, my favorite of them all: Reading before going to sleep, might actually be helpful to sleep better! (As long as is a non-electronic book J)Truth be told, I learnt about a ton of new tendencies, but the main point is that everything has to be done in moderation. From eating, to exercising, you cannot...should not exaggerate. Did I like this book? Oh yes! I think is my favorite book from Jacobs...we will see how it goes with the Guinea Pig Diaries."
266,141659907X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/125347-donovan,4,"Funny, loaded with great tips, easy to read and applicable to me - an overweight health conscience individual who wants to make health a priority, but constantly find himself overwhelmed with all of the opinions, contrary advice and amount of research (not to mention miss guided priorities and laziness).Recently, I spend close to a thousand dollars for an initial appointment with a naturopathic doctor. While I'm still in the evaluation process, I can't help looking skeptically at a number of his recommendations, some very contrary to other things I've read (excessive fat is ok, eat lots of meat, etc). What I loved about A. J. is he shares this healthy skepticism and he looks at things practically and methodically, but with an open mind and a willingness to try everything. I felt like he did it for the rest of us. His book project and advance gave him the time to do what the rest of us want to know, but don't have time to do (oh wait, he also is an editor for Esquire...so I guess that is another excuse). Anyway, he confirmed my thoughts on many issues and I'm happy to just following along with his conclusions - and in others situations I want to do a little more research before forming an opinion, but his practical advice definitely gives me a head start.His wit and writing make the book easy to follow. I read the first half on a cross country flight and the only thing that made me put it down was the passengers getting up all around me. The rest I finished during my brief period of reading before bed - a tip I've taken from A.J. that I'm determined to make a habit.Much of the advice is stuff you already know, but it serves as a great reminder. Exercise more - eat less - sleep more - relax - smile often, etc. Other things were less intuitive - don't read on toilet - observe Sabbath - avoid pedicures like the plague - etc.One of the most delightful things about the book is his sense of humor - it helped a book on health flow. Here's some quotes to give you a flavor of his under toned, slightly sarcastic, humor.""I did get a colonic, but I've decided not write about it at length. I didn't find it helpful or enlightening. I can tell you want it felt like, though: It felt like someone shooting water up your butt.""""Cigarettes' cost far outweigh any resulting trimness, just as asphyxiation outweighs the benefits of stretching out the spine when you hang yourself from a shower curtain rod.""""The MRI has a repertoire of noises that resemble, in no particular order: a game-show buzzer for a wrong answer, urgent knocking, a modem from 1992, a grizzly-bear growl, and a man with a raspy voice shouting what sounds like ""mother cooler!""""After decimating several vegetables, I decide juicing is my favorite form of food preparation. There's something perversely appealing about subjecting an innocent plant to that much violence.""""The dehydrator blows warm air on your food for hours, sometimes days. It reminds me of the temperature and intensity of dog's breath. So imagine a German shepherd exhaling on your fruit for a weekend.""""So, if weight loss is your goal, and you have impressive self-control, raw food is something to consider.""""Step back for a minute. Pretend you're from Mars. From a coldly rational point of view, pedestrian helmets aren't a crazy idea."""
267,141659907X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/879591-sara,4,"I won an advanced copy of this book through the First Reads program. The author has written previous books about various life experiments he's conducted; I'd previously read his book about living biblically for a year, trying to follow all the numerous, and sometimes conflicting, rules in the Bible. This book is along the same lines, following his adventures over the course of two years as he strives to be the healthiest person in the world. This means changing his lifestyle to adopt healthier habits, working out in various ways that are supposed to be best for your health, eating a better diet, and so on.I wouldn't call this book ""hilarious,"" but it's definitely amusing. Not only are his adventures in the name of health entertaining, but his writing is extremely witty. Even though you might begin reading the book with the thought that he's simply doing this healthy experiment to write a book about it, the results are so interesting and he does so much research about it, throwing himself into this fully, that you can't help but enjoy. I loved all the descriptions of the ways in which he tries to work out, and the diets he follows, even for brief periods of time. As he points out, there is so much conflicting advice out there about how to be healthy, how to work out properly, how to eat your way to health... it's exhausting. And yet he attempts to follow many of the regiments in the name of science. One of my favorite parts of the book came when he follows the ""Caveman Workout"", exercising the way cavemen supposedly did, shirtless and barefoot in Central Park, lifting logs in lieu of boulders with a handful of other men in this Paleo Movement. He paints such a vivid picture of what he's doing, and you can't help but laugh at some of the ridiculousness he encounters, with devoted followers to each and every movement.It was also entertaining to hear his adventures following some of the diets that have been hyped up as the way to health - the raw food diet, the no-carb diet, the juice cleanse... He not only describes what the diet entails, but he goes on to talk about what different scientists and health professionals have said about the diet, and then describes his own experiences following it. One of the more memorable parts for me was his description of the juice cleanse, buying the way expensive juices touted by B-list celebrities, then trying to starve off hunger as he craved anything solid to eat. For all the entertainment found in this book, there is also some advice about health and ways that you really can make a difference in your own life without going completely overboard. I enjoyed the balance of everything, as it never felt as if I was reading a self-help book, but simply an entertaining social experiment that left me with some helpful advice. I imagine that not everyone will like this book, as its dry humor and ridiculous situations could seem off-putting at first. However, if you're interested in reading about someone's adventures participating in all sorts of health fads - some that you've heard of, others that are completely strange - and hearing about it all from a self-deprecating but witty narrator, this is a great book. I'd easily recommend it."
268,141659907X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/68833154-zack-wussow,2,"It's ok. I found this one less interesting than his others, but that may be because I was already familiar with a lot of the material already, unlike his biblical and encyclopedic books. And the last third is a totally useless index. For example: incidental exercise (fidgeting), and on the page listed the only reference is '...even fidgeting (or as so and so calls it, incidental exercise) can be good exercise...' No one needs an index for that!"
269,141659907X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1288876-julie-g,4,"Remember that time I read The Year of Living Biblically and raved about it and then A.J. Jacobs EMAILED ME??? Me too. I was a brand-new blogger and almost died when I realized that authors actually read blogger reviews and respond to them. So basically, besides the fact that The Year of Living Biblically was incredibly well done, the fact that A.J. Jacobs actually replied to my review (which, let's be honest, was not that great) made me a fan for life. I was dying to read this one and the perfect opportunity arose when Jennie got a copy from Goodreads (I think). She passed it on to me and I'm supposed to pass it on to Jacki, which I really do intend to do one day in the very near future. Really.So Drop Dead Healthy is similar to Jacobs' other books in terms of the whole guinea-pig thing. Basically his style is to choose something and learn all about it by using his life as an experiment. In The Year of Living Biblically, he spends an entire year living as close as he can to Old Testament law. In The Know It All he reads through an entire set of encyclopedias. In Drop Dead Healthy, the theme is phsyical fitness and how to achieve it. Jacobs goes through all of the body systems, one by one, and tries out different methods, diets, and fitness regimes and chronicles their success.WritingI, for one, think Jacobs is hilarious. His sense of humor is spot on with my tastes and I spent most of the book laughing out loud. It's written like a memoir and it's about his personal experiences, but he also includes good background information from a scientific standpoint and references many other texts that offer the data and research information that is missing from his own personal experiences. I probably added ten or so books to my to-be-read list based on Jacobs' references. I think he did a great job of balancing the scientific information with humor and his own personal anecdotes. Entertainment ValueAgain, the book was really funny. I like humor and I like learning new things, and Jacobs combines both in his books. I'm also interested right now in dieting and fitness, so this gave me some insight into what worked and what didn't, for Jacobs at least, as well as what the current trends are - and what I ought to avoid. The caveman workout, for example, isn't one I'm anxious to try any time soon.OverallI highly recommend picking this one up. It's a fast read, informative and funny. I think it's a good jumping off place for those who enjoy humor or memoir and are interested in non-fiction, as well as those who are interested in health and fitness. It's a good way to ease your way into more hard-core scientific reads (and provides a great list of those more in-depth books as well). Thank you, Jennie, for sending me your copy and I promise I'll have it on its way to Jacki ASAP!"
270,141659907X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6182210-krista,3,"I read this book on a whim after my mom recommended it to me - we're a very healthy family, so it was more for the comic value of it more than anything else. I can't say I learned a lot that I didn't already know, but it was certainly interesting and entertaining at times reading A.J.'s chronicles of health experiments - some logical, some a bit absurd (hence, the funny bit). Read it for the journey, not the destination."

286,141659907X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3934710-camille-maio,4,Another AJ Jacobs winner in which his long-term experimenting is both entertaining and educational. Lots to mull over in the field of getting healthier! 
287,141659907X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/12497233-karen,4,"September feels like a ""new year,"" even though I've been out of school for two decades, and so I read this thinking, I need to lose several pounds and just generally get up and get out more. But where to start? And what's the best, most effective way to do so? There are entire libraries out there devoted to the subject, but this book is actually an entertaining look - and for that, it gets 4-stars. To actually make healthy living - with advice based on science and sound, rational reasoning - into a book that can be read without making the reader feel bad, obese or on death's door? Well, that's a true feat.A.J. Jacobs does this by making himself the guinea pig, a gimmick he's used on the Bible and on Internet-level knowledge. In this case, he goes through body parts, looking at the science and what it says about how to achieve maximum healthfulness, which in this case doesn't mean model-thinness. The book's real message is how little we know about how the body works and what can and will make it work better. There's too many complicating factors to know for sure what makes carrots good for us, for example, because there's just as many complicating factors that make carrots bad for us. (Smoking seems to be that one exception.)My quibble with this book is that we spend lots of time on A.J.'s time with cavemen fitness freaks, for example, because it's a cutesy story, but very little time with almost everything else. There's so much stuffed in here and some of the stories/appointments/tests/trials are reduced to a paragraph. Eating raw food for a week, for example, gets about a half page. Still, I found the advice in the book helpful and somewhat obvious. (It's nice to have it confirmed.) Move more, make that movement a pattern of intensity and moderation, steer clear of white foods and get a good night's sleep. It's already gotten me up off the couch, combing through my pantry and doing 5-minute workouts for 4 cycles. That good night's sleep remains elusive! "
288,141659907X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1499157-rod-hilton,3,"I'm a big fan of A.J. Jacobs, I've read all of his other books and I generally find him to be a humorous and engaging writer. Drop Dead Healthy is no exception to this, it's interesting and funny throughout, but it's not as good as his other books.Jacobs wrote a book where he read the entire Encyclopedia, and one where he decided to follow the Bible literally for a year (both great books), both of which were long-term, very focused experiments with his life. Then he wrote a book which was more a collection of random, short experiments (The Guinea Pig Diaries), more or less a collection of short articles about doing random crap for a month or so. This third book is the weakest of the set because it lacks the focus of the first two books.So when I saw his new book was about trying to become healthy, it seemed to me like a return to form: a focused, directed book again. He even tries to link this book to his earlier two, by claiming that the first was about the mind, the second the spirit, and this the body, making something of a trilogy out of them. Unfortunately, that's not really how the book turned out.Drop Dead Healthy is, once again, a collection of short experiments, with one experiment per chapter. He tries the gym for one, he tries dieting for one, he goes Paleo for one, he focuses on germs for one, he focuses on getting peace and quiet for one (seriously?), he tries to have more sex for one, he focuses on toxins in his home for one, he works on his teeth for one, etc. He devotes chapters to posture, smell, sleeping, eyesight, and many more. Most of the chapters just have A.J. moving from random study to random study, trying it out for a bit and humorously talking about the impact on his life.What the book lacks is a focus like his first two similar outings. An entire book focused on A.J. trying to eat right and work out would have been great. He could have included his Paleo experiments, his experiments with different kinds of workout routines, free-running, treadmills, etc. Most of this material is instead relegated to a handful of chapters, and the rest is focused on stuff only barely related to the book's concept of trying to live healthy. The conclusion I came to was that A.J. didn't like eating healthy and working out, so he didn't stick to it very well for the full 2 years of the book, and instead had to pad the book with a bunch of random crap about massage treatments and smelling better and improving his posture to reach book length. I particularly hated his insistence on giving equal (or more) time to new agey nonsense, largely inspired by his Aunt. This sort of thing makes for perhaps an interesting article or two in Esquire, but it seems barely related to the concept of the book.It's unfortunate, the chapters that actually relate to HEALTHY living are interesting, so an entire book devoted to them would have been great. A.J.'s usual wit and charm make the chapters about random junk interesting and fun to read, but they make the overall book seem muddled and directionless. The book is also, unfortunately, not terribly informative. A.J. doesn't do much to distinguish between what actually works in terms of getting healthy and what doesn't. Someone looking to get healthy will be ENTERTAINED by this book, but won't learn anything from it. Finally, I'd like to make special mention of Jacob's wife, who really comes off like a pain in the ass in this book. As a person who lost a lot of weight I can tell you having your spouse be encouraging when you lose weight makes a huge difference. At one point after A.J. has been working hard on changing his eating habits and losing a few pounds, Julie tells him he went from looking 4 months pregnant to 3.5. If my wife had told me that after working hard I'd have had my motivation totally sapped. His wife usually comes off as a tolerant but somewhat disapproving person, graciously putting up with A.J.'s craziness while making occasional offhand remarks (she's the stereotypical ""sane wife married to a hilarious manchild"" so common in crappy sitcoms). In this book, she comes off like a real jerk, constantly making obnoxious remarks about the author.Overall, it's better than Guinea Pig Diaries, but nowhere near as good as Know-It-All or Living Biblically."
289,141659907X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3312882-rachel-p,4,"I won this book as a goodreads giveaway and I am so glad I did! In his novel, “Drop Dead Healthy”, A.J. Jacobs documents his 2 year long journey to become the healthiest man alive. He does a tremendous amount of research and reads a vast amount of studies from a variety of sources on the subject of human health. I appreciate how he makes this book about total health instead of just about diet and exercise. He breaks down the story by body part; focusing on a different part of the body in each chapter.**SPOILER ALERT**I actually rate this book 4.5 stars. I really enjoyed how he went for it; fitness crazes, fad diets, alternative medicine, etc. Out of the mountain of research he selected a few key studies to relate and expert advice to pursue. I took pleasure in learning about the calorie restrictive diet (living on the edge of starvation), the Paleo Movement (living like a cavemen), walking and running barefoot, replacing manufactured beauty products (such as shampoo and soap) with natural alternatives (such as baking soda and vinegar). Somethings I tried out with great success (like deskercising – desk exercising) and somethings I wouldn’t go near unless I got my own book deal (like acupuncture). It is a spectacular read but there are a few issues that prevent me from giving it the full 5 stars. For instance, there are two chapters on the stomach in which A.J. discusses different diets he’s trying but the diet is an ever-present element of the entire journey and I don’t feel like he always devotes as much attention to it as he should. For example, the author mentions at the end of a chapter he started eating steel cut oatmeal but doesn’t mention why or how this came about. I know that he didn’t want to make this book too long and perhaps in the interest of prioritization he couldn’t explain every food/diet choice and how it came about but I personally would have been interested in learning much more. He does sum up key points in the appendices but I still think it’s not enough. There are also no consistent measurements reported at the end of each chapter except weight. Granted, I don’t expect a whole long list of measurement indices but more consistency would’ve been better.Here are a few key highlights that I took away: - Eat on smaller plates because we tend to eat everything that’s on our plates. - Chew your food thoroughly and eat with family and friends instead of watching TV or reading. You will eat slower and thus give your body the 20 minutes it needs to feel full. - Stand more and choose activities (or modify existing ones) that put you in motion. Studies show that spending 1 hour at the gym and the rest of the day at a desk or on the couch is not much better for you than if you spent the whole day stationary. - There’s no such thing as superfoods. All fruits and veggies are equally good for you. Just make sure you wash non-organic produce in hot water and vinegar and let sit for 5 minutes. - Set fitness goals. Buy a pedometer and complete against yourself or a partner to see how many steps you can walk in a day (the recommended amount is 10,000 steps or 5 miles per day). Also, registering for a marathon and then having to train for it is great motivation to get or stay in shape. - Keep your brain fit by challenging yourself and trying new things.  - Enjoy life. Don’t let your health become a preoccupation to the exclusion of all other aspects of your life. Enjoy spending time with people that you love and you are happy to be around. Don’t waste time stressing over getting enough exercise or counting calories. This novel is packed with so much quality information it is definitely a keeper for me. A.J. is very relatable starting out as your average out of shape American male. He includes his family in his health project and intersperses his story with personal anecdotes which I think make his experience more real. And his writing is hilarious; I’m talking LAUGH OUT LOUD funny. So I actually burned calories while reading this book especially when I was doing it while iPloding on my treadmill desk. Thanks A.J.!"
290,141659907X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4962920-jill-furedy,4,"A.J. Jacobs is amusing as always, and had I come away feeling that I'd learned some relevant health tips, I'd have given the book more stars. Part of that may be my personal issues though, reading about a mostly healthy, if somewhat neurotic and underexercised man pursue ultimate health doesn't necessarily translate to a nutritionally challenged woman with Crohn's disease! So when he's talking about dried mangoes as his vice and I'm eating cheetos, I'm thinking he's already ahead of me in the dietary department. And when he's eating walnuts or apples, I'm wishing I could eat those without getting sick. And in a twist of odd timing, I read the stomach revistied section in the waiting room for my follow up appointment to get a b12 shot, to try and get back to normal levels, and where I was instructed to pick up calcium citrate and vitamin D, both of which were areas I'm a bit low on, as well and being told to cut back on sugars as I'm not yet prediabetic, but still too high. So maybe that's why his giving up dried mangoes seemed unimpressive, when I know how much more I need to change my diet! Though I did like his Odysseus contract to give them up.  Anyway, Jacobs clearly needed more exercise, but basically it was pneumonia that motivated him to begin the project, rather than a chronic health issue or doctors orders. Reminded me a bit of the Happiness Project, where a woman who was not unhappy nevertheless sets about to improve her happiness levels. On the one hand, I agree with her theory...work on it before you HAVE to and it will be easier should circumstances change. Which definately applies to health as well. But it still makes their self imposed challenges seem less impressive than those overcoming more severe obstacles.  But Jacobs is fun to read, so I was willing to see where he went with this. I hoped to pick up a few health tips, but I don't think I came away with much. He wasn't on either his vegan or his protein-heavy diets long enough to really see any differences (I believe he gave two weeks to each). Moderation and portion control have always been my go-to diet method. He writes about his adventures with juicers and dehydrators, but only mentions his introductions of quinoa, bok choy, and other foods in his statistic notes. Did he know how to cook this stuff that he'd never eaten before? Or did his wife know? Did he actually like it, or just eat it because it's healthy? And the chronolgy isn't as straight forward as his chapters imply, so things overlapped or happened in different orders, which sometimes threw me off. I liked that he had a team of experts he was relying on, but he looks into so many things and mentions the kooky alongside the scientifically backed, all of it told in his humorous storytelling format, so that not a lot of it stuck with me.  As with his religion book (I haven't read The Know It All), I think someone looking for straight up humor might find his books too fact heavy, and someone looking for tips or wisdom might find his books a little too specific to his life to be applied generally, or might find the treatment a bit too light. The publisher category is biography which is the probably the only way to classify it in order to meet expectations of genre: You have to be looking for a mix of the humor and info for his adventures to resonate. His stories of his wife, grandpa, aunt Marti help balance the humor and his obsession, so that you can tell he is living a real life while assigning himself these odd tasks. And I can see how his health lessons will disappear from my mind since I hear so much of it in magazines, TV shows, etc, but if anything sticks with me about the book it will probably be the elements involving his family or even those side characters who reappear, like his trainer or the Cave Man. I usually judge a book by how original or memorable it is, and those characters don't carry quite enough of this book for me to think I'll be able to tell you much about it next year. But it hit a few touching moments, was a quick fun read, had an occasional look into something unfamiliar, and plenty of humor, so it was all I expected of it. "
291,141659907X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1270609-brittany,3,"How I Came To Read This Book: I'm guessing I heard about it in Entertainment Weekly. I've always been fascinated by biology and the human body, and A.J. Jacobs' (semi-serious) quest to become the healthiest man alive was intriguing - and turned out to be quite different than what I'd bargained for, in a good way.The Plot: A.J. Jacobs is sort of the Morgan Spurlock of the nonfiction / journalism world. His past two books were all about taking on epic, life-altering projects (reading the encyclopaedia and following the rules of the Bible to the letter), and this one is no different. After exercising his mind and exploring his faith, this book is focused on all the crazy ways we try to get and stay healthy - from the inside out, top down. Each chapter is centered on a particular body part, and Jacobs' forays into speaking with experts, trying out routines, and somewhat attempting to bust myths by separating the fact from fiction in those medical claims (i.e. blueberries are not the world's best superfruit. If you believe it, the Maine marketing folks have done a good job). The Good & The Bad: Like I said, this book was really different than I anticipated. It was more of an intellectual and experiential smorgasbord of anecdotes and experiences, some given no more weight than a sentence, as opposed to a deep-digging day-by-day progress story (although there is some chronology to the book). On the plus side, it made for a quite light and easy read, filled with those bite-sized snippets of information our generation so craves. On the negative, I never felt like the book really went particularly deep into any one direction - although perhaps rightfully so. By the end of the book, Jacobs' himself acknowledges we still don't know so much, and that what worked for him might not work for you. The main takeaway here is to at least be aware of some of the major hazards we are exposed to, and see if changing some behaviours will have a positive impact on your life. If it does, great - I can say myself, I've been sampling ideas from the book over the last week and have enjoyed them / have many more I want to try out (drinking ice water *burns* calories!) My favourite is the advice to try standing for (at least) an hour or two during your workday - I leave work feeling way less mushy in the brain and the legs. At the same time, I also appreciated that some of the extremist examples Jacobs' references - many of which were more amusing than anything - probably aren't for everyone. It was amazing how often peoples behaviours' were inconclusively linked to their health, or how many contradictory studies exist out there. You get the sense that Jacobs may have gone into this looking for a foolproof guide to healthiness by examining all angles, and what he ends up with is a hedgehog of ideas that's hard to conceptualize into anything tangible. I'm not saying I went into this book expecting a miracle health book - that's definitely not the intent. But it's so surface and skims through so much at times, it's hard to rate this higher than a 3. I did enjoy it, and I think anyone with a passing interest in biology and health will enjoy it as much as I did, but I wish - not for lack of Jacobs' trying - it gave me a little more conclusive insight. The Bottom Line: A bit of a lark, but has some real insight you can incorporate into your everyday life. Anything Memorable?: I found it weird that Jacobs frequently - I mean every chapter practically - talked about advocating a plant-based diet yet didn't actual delve into it in any real form, other than a brief foray into raw veganism (not for me). That was one of the weaknesses of the book I suppose - it delved into extremes, which, while amusing and enlightening, wasn't all that practical. 60-book Challenge?: Book #43 in 2012"
292,141659907X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/10093055-angie-fehl,4,"I'm revisiting Jacobs' work in experimental journalism -- a process where he gives himself one monumental project, usually for a year or so, and writes a whole book about the process. The first of these I read was his book A Year Of Living Biblically, where he attempted to live by biblical era standards of clothing, diet, etc as literally as possible. I believe Drop Dead Healthy was written before that one, though. In this book, Jacobs, inspired by his own health scare, decides to take on a slew of popular diets, exercise programs and health fads, equipment, technology, treatments. Each chapter covers one specific area of his body (heart health, lung improvement, leg strength, etc.), detailing what all he got into to improve that particular area. Since he's writing from a male perspective, he even gets looks into how to improve testicular health. Just some of the topics he researches (and what he discovers in the process):> Vitamin C helps fight peridontal disease, but citrus is rough on tooth enamel.. soo... > ""Orthorexia"" is a term coined by Dr. Steven Bratman to describe when people fixate SO hard on dieting, to the point of the stress actually outweighing any nutritional benefits. Jacobs himself also refers to this mode of thinking as ""health food fetishism"". That said, Jacobs also puts himself on a few of the trendiest diet plans -- Paleo, Raw, No Sugar, and juice cleanse routines -- just to see how he fares and what it does for his body. At the time he was writing this book, he also managed to snag an interview with health guru Jack Lalanne (who has since passed away, age 96).> Jacobs researches the benefits of acupuncture, laugh yoga, and ""worry exchange"", where you literally team up with someone else -- they worry about your problems, you worry about theirs. He also looks at ""neurobic exercise"" for the brain: doing your daily tasks but doing them in the reverse order you naturally would (ie. taking a different route to work, using your non-dominant hand as your dominant for a time, etc.). He also looks into some of the newer trends like anti-gravity yoga (Sky Gym type places) and Strollercise for new moms, as well as programs for the more hardcore minded -- CrossFit and the Roman Legionnaire workout, which apparently involves smashing logs out in the woods with iron mallets?! Jacobs even takes on pole dancing classes! He also attempts to make it family get-together time when he does treadmill work and Pilates class with his mom and weight training with his dad. > Jacobs describes using Odysseus contracts (aka Ulysses Contracts) to help keep him on his goals. If I remember correctly, this was also a tool he mentions using in A Year Of Living Biblically. What keeps me reading Jacobs' books is not only the education the reader is given from all the data this guy compiles with each project, but also the fact that he can writes these books with such great humor, often poking fun at his own shortcomings.I personally loved how he talked about being all gung ho for this particular experiment and then catches a cold shortly into the program X-P Also, his record of all his wife's reactions and responses to what he's doing or what he brings home is definitely bonus entertainment. The chapters are nicely laid out in a sort of log or journal form so all the science and such that Jacobs covers is not overwhelming for the reader. So if you're all about becoming a more knowledgeable person, I wholeheartedly recommend getting into some of his works. Even if it feels like a lot of information at once, you can do what I do and just take a chapter or two a day, process that and then go on to the next section. You'll be surprised at the wealth of info that sticks in your noggin!"
293,141659907X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/647117-nicole,4,"Wow--I really plowed through this book! I'm a big fan of AJ Jacobs, and have read all of his books, which all fall into the ""immersion-journalism"" category. As usual, AJ Jacobs wrote a highly entertaining and informative book documenting his 2 years of striving to become the healthiest man alive. As a bit of a health-nut myself, I didn't just read this book for entertainment purposes, I actually paid attention for health tips. So, here's some of what I found interesting: Meditation is extraordinarily good for your health. Yes, I already knew this, but I have a problem with what I call ""spazzy-brain syndrome"". But, I'm not alone here, and what AJ does is he meditates by watching the gently pulsating sleep-mode light on a Macbook and breathes in sync with it. I never noticed that the sleep light actually resembles the deep breathing of sleep. So I tried it. And it gave my brain some focus. Nice tip AJ.Something else that caught my attention as a ""dietaholic"" who has tried just about every diet out there, I was interested to read that the Mediterranean Diet is the most widely accepted diet with the most scientific backing. It's a diet that I haven't specifically tried, though it sounds right up my alley.Noise-pollution…a health hazard I have previously given very little thought to, although reading about it did encourage me to try on the Bose noise-canceling headphones that he talks about, and I must say they are WONDERFUL. Though I will not be buying them anytime soon with their $300 price tag. Still, I think my world is too noisy, and I actually have taken steps to quiet it a bit. Walking. I used to have a pedometer that I clipped on to my pants, and I made certain that I walked more than 10,000 steps every day. That often meant walking in circles around the playground my kids were playing on rather than sitting on a nearby bench to just watch. It's a little thing, but those steps do make a huge difference. Makes me want to pay attention to moving more, even though I am a frequent exerciser. Everything in moderation. People who go to ""health"" extremes are just as at-risk as those who ignore their health. For wrinkles, one of the only things that actually works is Retin-A. But, like the Bose noise-cancelling headphones, it's bloody expensive, so I probably won't be trying that one anytime soon either.Chew more. Breathe from your stomach. Give thanks. Try new foods like kale and quinoa. Yes, I actually did buy these things on my last shopping trip. The kale was delicious. Haven't tried the quinoa yet (pronounced keen-wah by the way…) High Intensity Interval Training is most effective (which is good news for us Zumba enthusiasts…) Fidget. Actually use a smaller plate. Drink more water, specifically 15 minutes prior to meals. Have protein for breakfast. Eat spicy foods--they curb your appetite for salty and sweet and give your metabolism a boost. LOVED hearing that one. Eat more veggies. Avoid simple carbs. Add crunch to your food. Shop the perimeter of the store. If you're going to eat meat, eat it as a side dish. Don't use anti-bacterial soap, just use regular soap. Stuff I've heard before, but great tips nonetheless. One thing I think the book lacked was before and after pics. He told us his beginning and ending weight and other various stats, but after 2 years of regular gym attendance after never going previously, I would've thought pictures would be telling. But the pics he did include were great. The book as a whole was great. I'd recommend it."
294,141659907X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2349088-roberto-scarlato,5,"When I first sat down to read this book on my kindle, I had a pretty clear idea of how committed this writer really is to experimentation and research. I've read The Know-it-all and The Year of Living biblically and enjoyed them both. This author has the perfect balance of facts and humor that I've ever read.Not only does he plunge himself into the subjects he tackles but he does so for months or even years, reading every book on the subject he intends to document.So when I heard that he was completing his, what he calls, ""Mind, Body and Soul Trilogy"", I had to buy it right away. Chances are I will read it again.Since this is a non-fiction book, I decided to review it in three ways: entertainment, interesting and what I've learned.Is it entertaining?Yes, extremely. I marveled at the wealth of facts he's unearthed on health myths and just how far some people will go to remain healthy. Some fanatics are so into their own health clicks that they don't even know they are causing more harm than good. Like his other books, there were times when I had to put the book down because I had to walk off a laugh-out-loud moment. My wife thought I was crazy. I was so immersed and interested in knowing these healthy weirdoes. I laughed at the fact that there are people out there in public parks running around like cavemen thinking that doing so is the pinnacle of healthy living. I doubled over in a giggle fit finding out that the writer hurt his shoulder kayaking on the Wii console, or through his misadventures during a Laugh-Yoga class, or finding out that cursing alleviates stubbed toe pain. Yes, the laughs are not on every single page but there were more than enough to keep me reading.Is it interesting?I would say so. I was particularly surprised at just how many Health habits aren't good for you. There are people addicted to exercising or never getting sick. There are people obsessed with Whole Foods when really you will still find sugar around every corner and the only thing getting slimmer is your own wallet. As for the diets, he's tried them all. He even covered the South Beach Diet which I was on at one point. Yes it made me slim down slightly but I felt miserable the whole time.What I've learned?Since reading this book, I've become a firm believer in Chewdism. While I won't spend a full minute chewing my food, I do find myself slowing down and chewing my food more. I know that chocolate, especially dark chocolate, is good for your heart. I've become more health conscious, joining weight watchers to track my meals and doing Power90 exercises (35 minutes on weekdays) and feeling good about it. Whenever I can, I get up and walk around. I'm actually interested in buying a pedometer to measure how many steps I take in a regular work day. I used to be part Hypochondriac and part OCD but now I'm actively taking steps to limit those stray thoughts and feeling less worrisome about it. I now make a list of things I know I should not have: No Soda, No Ice Cream, No Burritos. In short, this book motivated me to get fit quick.As for the people who try to knock this one man's efforts, I would say that they should know that it isn't really all that healthy leaving a bad review to a well-researched, two-year invested, delightful escape into one subject that is so easy to laugh about. I mean, come on, the guy wrote this entire book while on a treadmill, that's commitment right there."
295,141659907X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/8213107-carolina,5,"Originally posted at: A Girl that Likes Books Who doesn’t want to be healthy? Specially now a days. I first bought this book for my boyfriend...actually I pre-order it; we got it the second day after it came out. Why? We are big fans of Jacobs and it was my boyfriend who introduced me to his books. Last year I read The Year of Living Biblically and in March of this year I read The Know-it-All. I was really excited to read it and, since I loved the other two, I had big expectations. Boy, did the book deliver. Jacobs spends 2 full years working on himself, taking care of this skin, meals, exercising, getting healthy...and happy. To quote the book: ""The key to making healthy decisions is to respect your future self. Honor him or her. Treat him or her like you would treat a friend or a loved one""As in his other books (I still have to read the Guinea Pig Diaries, but the order has been placed, and with 82% off!!!!) he doesn’t only talks about the “experiment” itself, but also how it affects him, his family and in smaller doses, about family in general. In the first book of the “series”, The Know-it-All, we learn about him and his wife trying to conceive, how his father also tried to read the whole Encyclopedia Britannica, and so on.In this book we meet his Grandfather, a remarkable 96 year old, with a lovely remark: ""You can retire, but you must find something you’re passionate about in your retirement. You need a reason to wake up in the morning""Something else that I really enjoy about his books, is the familiarity of the whole thing, I feel like a friend of mine is just telling me what he/she did during the week-end. The writing is fluid and casual, like a conversation. And I have to say, I love Julie, his wife. She has the patience of a saint, and her comments always make me smile. She tried some of the stuff with Jacobs in this book. I cannot blame her for not trying anything on the biblical year; at the same time, I loved her ""answer"" to a lot of the restrictions during that year...but I'm changing books here. Sorry.What did I learn with this book? That I’m doing fine, not great but fine in my own quest to be healthy. I watch my portions, and have also controlled a little of my roommate and my boyfriend; I’m lucky to work in an environment that is not highly noisy; I don’t wear as much sunscreen as is recommended, but the point I’ve been trying to carve in my friend’s brains was valid, it does make a difference to apply sunscreen in the morning; I love my Pilates class, even when it hurts the day after, “luckily” I cannot spend 8 hours sitting at the lab, since I have to move from one room to the other in order to finish my experiment. I could still be more active though.And finally, my favorite of them all: Reading before going to sleep, might actually be helpful to sleep better! (As long as is a non-electronic book J)Truth be told, I learnt about a ton of new tendencies, but the main point is that everything has to be done in moderation. From eating, to exercising, you cannot...should not exaggerate. Did I like this book? Oh yes! I think is my favorite book from Jacobs...we will see how it goes with the Guinea Pig Diaries."

While I'm still in the evaluation process, I can't help looking skeptically at a number of his recommendations, some very contrary to other things I've read (excessive fat is ok, eat lots of meat, etc). What I loved about A. J. is he shares this healthy skepticism and he looks at things practically and methodically, but with an open mind and a willingness to try everything. I felt like he did it for the rest of us. His book project and advance gave him the time to do what the rest of us want to know, but don't have time to do (oh wait, he also is an editor for Esquire...so I guess that is another excuse). Anyway, he confirmed my thoughts on many issues and I'm happy to just following along with his conclusions - and in others situations I want to do a little more research before forming an opinion, but his practical advice definitely gives me a head start.His wit and writing make the book easy to follow. I read the first half on a cross country flight and the only thing that made me put it down was the passengers getting up all around me. The rest I finished during my brief period of reading before bed - a tip I've taken from A.J. that I'm determined to make a habit.Much of the advice is stuff you already know, but it serves as a great reminder. Exercise more - eat less - sleep more - relax - smile often, etc. Other things were less intuitive - don't read on toilet - observe Sabbath - avoid pedicures like the plague - etc.One of the most delightful things about the book is his sense of humor - it helped a book on health flow. Here's some quotes to give you a flavor of his under toned, slightly sarcastic, humor.""I did get a colonic, but I've decided not write about it at length. I didn't find it helpful or enlightening. I can tell you want it felt like, though: It felt like someone shooting water up your butt.""""Cigarettes' cost far outweigh any resulting trimness, just as asphyxiation outweighs the benefits of stretching out the spine when you hang yourself from a shower curtain rod.""""The MRI has a repertoire of noises that resemble, in no particular order: a game-show buzzer for a wrong answer, urgent knocking, a modem from 1992, a grizzly-bear growl, and a man with a raspy voice shouting what sounds like ""mother cooler!""""After decimating several vegetables, I decide juicing is my favorite form of food preparation. There's something perversely appealing about subjecting an innocent plant to that much violence.""""The dehydrator blows warm air on your food for hours, sometimes days. It reminds me of the temperature and intensity of dog's breath. So imagine a German shepherd exhaling on your fruit for a weekend.""""So, if weight loss is your goal, and you have impressive self-control, raw food is something to consider.""""Step back for a minute. Pretend you're from Mars. From a coldly rational point of view, pedestrian helmets aren't a crazy idea."""
297,141659907X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/879591-sara,4,"I won an advanced copy of this book through the First Reads program. The author has written previous books about various life experiments he's conducted; I'd previously read his book about living biblically for a year, trying to follow all the numerous, and sometimes conflicting, rules in the Bible. This book is along the same lines, following his adventures over the course of two years as he strives to be the healthiest person in the world. This means changing his lifestyle to adopt healthier habits, working out in various ways that are supposed to be best for your health, eating a better diet, and so on.I wouldn't call this book ""hilarious,"" but it's definitely amusing. Not only are his adventures in the name of health entertaining, but his writing is extremely witty. Even though you might begin reading the book with the thought that he's simply doing this healthy experiment to write a book about it, the results are so interesting and he does so much research about it, throwing himself into this fully, that you can't help but enjoy. I loved all the descriptions of the ways in which he tries to work out, and the diets he follows, even for brief periods of time. As he points out, there is so much conflicting advice out there about how to be healthy, how to work out properly, how to eat your way to health... it's exhausting. And yet he attempts to follow many of the regiments in the name of science. One of my favorite parts of the book came when he follows the ""Caveman Workout"", exercising the way cavemen supposedly did, shirtless and barefoot in Central Park, lifting logs in lieu of boulders with a handful of other men in this Paleo Movement. He paints such a vivid picture of what he's doing, and you can't help but laugh at some of the ridiculousness he encounters, with devoted followers to each and every movement.It was also entertaining to hear his adventures following some of the diets that have been hyped up as the way to health - the raw food diet, the no-carb diet, the juice cleanse... He not only describes what the diet entails, but he goes on to talk about what different scientists and health professionals have said about the diet, and then describes his own experiences following it. One of the more memorable parts for me was his description of the juice cleanse, buying the way expensive juices touted by B-list celebrities, then trying to starve off hunger as he craved anything solid to eat. For all the entertainment found in this book, there is also some advice about health and ways that you really can make a difference in your own life without going completely overboard. I enjoyed the balance of everything, as it never felt as if I was reading a self-help book, but simply an entertaining social experiment that left me with some helpful advice. I imagine that not everyone will like this book, as its dry humor and ridiculous situations could seem off-putting at first. However, if you're interested in reading about someone's adventures participating in all sorts of health fads - some that you've heard of, others that are completely strange - and hearing about it all from a self-deprecating but witty narrator, this is a great book. I'd easily recommend it."

I found this one less interesting than his others, but that may be because I was already familiar with a lot of the material already, unlike his biblical and encyclopedic books. And the last third is a totally useless index. For example: incidental exercise (fidgeting), and on the page listed the only reference is '...even fidgeting (or as so and so calls it, incidental exercise) can be good exercise...' No one needs an index for that!"
299,141659907X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1288876-julie-g,4,"Remember that time I read The Year of Living Biblically and raved about it and then A.J. Jacobs EMAILED ME??? Me too. I was a brand-new blogger and almost died when I realized that authors actually read blogger reviews and respond to them. So basically, besides the fact that The Year of Living Biblically was incredibly well done, the fact that A.J. Jacobs actually replied to my review (which, let's be honest, was not that great) made me a fan for life. I was dying to read this one and the perfect opportunity arose when Jennie got a copy from Goodreads (I think). She passed it on to me and I'm supposed to pass it on to Jacki, which I really do intend to do one day in the very near future. Really.So Drop Dead Healthy is similar to Jacobs' other books in terms of the whole guinea-pig thing. Basically his style is to choose something and learn all about it by using his life as an experiment. In The Year of Living Biblically, he spends an entire year living as close as he can to Old Testament law. In The Know It All he reads through an entire set of encyclopedias. In Drop Dead Healthy, the theme is phsyical fitness and how to achieve it. Jacobs goes through all of the body systems, one by one, and tries out different methods, diets, and fitness regimes and chronicles their success.WritingI, for one, think Jacobs is hilarious. His sense of humor is spot on with my tastes and I spent most of the book laughing out loud. It's written like a memoir and it's about his personal experiences, but he also includes good background information from a scientific standpoint and references many other texts that offer the data and research information that is missing from his own personal experiences. I probably added ten or so books to my to-be-read list based on Jacobs' references. I think he did a great job of balancing the scientific information with humor and his own personal anecdotes. Entertainment ValueAgain, the book was really funny. I like humor and I like learning new things, and Jacobs combines both in his books. I'm also interested right now in dieting and fitness, so this gave me some insight into what worked and what didn't, for Jacobs at least, as well as what the current trends are - and what I ought to avoid. The caveman workout, for example, isn't one I'm anxious to try any time soon.OverallI highly recommend picking this one up. It's a fast read, informative and funny. I think it's a good jumping off place for those who enjoy humor or memoir and are interested in non-fiction, as well as those who are interested in health and fitness. It's a good way to ease your way into more hard-core scientific reads (and provides a great list of those more in-depth books as well). Thank you, Jennie, for sending me your copy and I promise I'll have it on its way to Jacki ASAP!"
