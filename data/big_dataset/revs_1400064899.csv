0,1400064899,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1526851-will-byrnes,4,"Preston looks at the very tallest trees on our planet and the people who seek them out, climb them and study them. This was a very engaging trip into a very unfamiliar territory. One amazing thing was that knowledge of the whereabouts of earth’s wooden giants is held by a very few individuals. The people on whom Preston reports range from Phd biologists to obsessives with no particular scientific background. He looks closely at tree-climbing methodologies (being a tree-climber himself) and at the extant technologies that support such endeavors. I learned things here, and got a far greater sense of what is lost when land is clear cut. Well worthwhile, educational and engaging.==============================EXTRA STUFFI first saw the article here, Lofty Aspirations, in Smithsonian Magazine back in 2002.

1,1400064899,http://goodreads.com/user/show/375171-joseph,1,"The idea that there is an entire unexplored world lurking in the canopy of what's left of our nation's redwood forests is intriguing. It seems unfathomable that in our modern life, with all our GPS systems and Google maps, there are still areas of planet Earth just waiting to be explored.The Wild Trees is at its best when describing this hidden world. Sadly, that's not what the book is about. This is really a story about the people involved in the exploration of that world, with a few interesting details about the trees themselves scattered throughout. Although it's unfortunate that most of that description is wasted on the rather uninteresting question of precisely how tall each tree is. I'm sure that's an important question for the purposes of scientific research, but on the other hand, why should I really care if one tree is four feet taller than another tree?I'll be honest, I heard about this book for the first time when the author made an appearance on The Colbert Report, and it sounded interesting ... until I heard the subtitle. ""A Story of Passion and Daring""? Really? Preston finds these people fascinating, which is not terribly surprising since they're his friends and peers, but I found them tedious and obnoxious. Preston's frequent detours into narrating events and dialog are completely embarrassing, and I found his habit of using what a friend called ""purple prose"" highly irritating. The book does not benefit from Preston's description of a guy urinating. And for a book describing a secret world that most people will never have the chance to see to not have any photographs is just a travesty.There's a fascinating book waiting to be written about tall trees. There may even be a fascinating book waiting to be written about the people researching them. This book is neither."
2,1400064899,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4659464-jessaka,5,"Climbing Widow MakersWhen I was a child I loved climbing into our apricot and French plum trees. Climbing was fun, eating the fruit was better. My dog Rex would sit under the plum tree waiting for me to give him some fruit. Yes, a dog eating plums. But I grew out of the desire to climb trees after my preteen years,while the botanists and other men and women in this book continued to climb, sometimes to their deaths.This book is about finding the tallest tree in the redwoods, but why they had to then climb them after measuring them from the ground, I do not know. It is just that I don’t understand this desire, except to say that they had found huckleberry bushes growing in them as well as bonsais. This would make them worth climbing, that is, if it were not so dangerous. The author spends a few beginning chapters talking about the deaths of people who had climbed these tall trees, and he was very graphic in giving these details. I could have gone without this. If you are squeamish, you may wish to skip the reading of this section in the book. It rather goes like this, kind of:1.	You can fall on your head, and then your head will split open, and your brains will scatter on the ground, everywhere. Your spine will be broken. 2.	If you fall on your belly, your guts will come streaming out of your belly button in what will look like a very gruesome umbilical cord. Your spine will be broken.3.	If you land on your feet, your feet will fly off in all directions by the force of it all. Your spine will be broken.4.	If you land on your knees your kneecaps will spin around and end up in the back of said knees. Your spine will be broken.The climbers in this book prefer trees to relationships, or so it seemed, but when they married, trees were still the biggest part of their lives.A forest, to me, is a place to walk, not climb unless it is over a boulder, a small one. It is a place to enjoy nature, not put myself in danger. Speaking of which, the climbers never talked about seeing bears. That would keep me out of the woods, unless I was with some people who knew how to handle bears. Still, even though I have no desire to climb a tree, this book was fascinating. The climbers sometimes slept in the trees. One mooring one awoke to flying squirrels climbing all over him. Animals in the wild, at least those who have never seen a human, have less fear of them, and in this case they had no fear at all.And I liked that they had found huckleberry bushes and bonsai trees growing in the redwood trees, and there were strange insects as well. Then in Australia, when they were checking out other kinds of trees, they had problems with ground leeches. One man put his jacket on the ground and sat on it, but before long leeches were all over it and him. I must say, Australia has the strangest creatures. The more I read a about Australia’s strange and dangerous creatures, the less I wish to visit the place. So, if you love nature and trees, this is a good book to read. "
3,1400064899,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1777325-julia,3,"The sections about the redwoods in this book were 5 star for me--but then, trees have always fascinated me, and Preston brings his intense focus on detail to these giants. However, the sections on the PEOPLE in this book moved it down to a 2 star for me, since FAR too much time was spent on the soap opera details of their lives rather than on the trees themselves. And their lives seemed self-centered and crass.Stephen Sillett is the first holder of the endowed Chair in Redwood Forest Ecology at Humboldt State University (the only university Chair dedicated to one tree species). Michael Taylor was his co-founder of many of the tallest trees. However, their personal stories (like many of our own, I'm sure) seemed petty and tiny compared to the gigantic wonders they study. Even Preston himself comes across as a tagalong when he gets into the climbing himself.Since I'm a LORD OF THE RINGS fan,I was touched by the references to these works. ILUVATAR, in Tolkien, is the major god in the SILMARILLION, so giving that name to the third tallest tree in the Atlas Grove showed how MUCH Sillett cares--not just about the redwoods but about the world of imagination.Preston should have stuck to the TREES--because, in this book, they are FAR superior beings to the people who study them. "
4,1400064899,http://goodreads.com/user/show/27304766-kay,4,"Great book about Redwood trees. These trees exist along the coast of northern California and southern Oregon, they need fog, but not the salt so they are somewhat inland. The tallest one is named Hyperion 379.7 feet (115.7 m) tall and about 600 years old. It is fascinating that it was only discovered in 2006! These trees can live to 2000 years and has been around for over 240 million years!"
5,1400064899,http://goodreads.com/user/show/374456-kerri-anne,5,"This book. I adore this book. Mostly because I adore talking about, learning about, geeking out about trees. Any trees. But especially redwood trees. And this book is fantastic in its breadth and scope and coverage of the history of studying the redwoods, and all the stops and starts and madness therein. Did I know there was an entire subset of people who spend (and have spent) their days climbing redwoods, and Doug Firs, and countless other species of trees? Not really. I really had no idea the history of studying the redwoods, but I love it. This is the very thing, the very book, I would have loved to talk about with my grandfather and my dad. I really had no idea the sort of biodiversity lying in wait in the canopies of redwoods, though it's easily one of the most thrilling images of a reality I've ever conjured: finding ripe huckleberry bushes 200-feet above the forest floor. That I read this days after finishing Rare Bird (which is a fantastic companion piece to this book) is the best sort of literary luck. [Four-point-five stars for so many interwoven stories that'll stick to my bones for so many years to come.]"
6,1400064899,http://goodreads.com/user/show/892350-m-d,5,"The book was good enough to get me to explore deeper into the dense Jedediah Smith Redwoods and find the Titans myself. Read the book early January, and found the Grove of Titans and Lost Monarch on January 15, 2008.See > M.D. Vaden's hunt for The Wild Trees RedwoodsUnlike the book, I supplied one color photo of a titan. That's one desire for that book, which was lacking. If even but one nice color photograph.There was more in the book than I expected about people, but after I read it, it was understandable that more about the trees was not practical. It's not a story about trees.Someone wrote earlier that some parts had a cut and paste feel, and I felt some transitions were so abrupt, that it did feel that way sometimes.For the fact that the book was interesting enough to hold for hours at a time, and for the large amount of research included, I gave it 5 stars. For other reasons, I could give it 3 or 4 stars. But the presentation and facts and history included merit making up for deficiencies. I've taught tree care, and the stuff in The Wild Trees directly related to trees and forests could fill one or two class sessions. Some reviews I've read, stated that the book needed more about trees and forests. I'd suggest to go back, reread, and write down every fact and bit of history, and realize just how many aspects were woven into the entire book.My mother is from the area mentioned in The Wild Trees where Marie Antoine grew up. The description is right-on-the-money.As a profession, I work with trees, and nothing caught my eye in the botany category as factually distorted.So the book gets the facts right, best I can tell.For the more part, I found details about the people interesting. Others might find it mundane. But I appreciated to see how others too, have progressed through life from stage to stage.Someone criticized details like eating Fruit Loops being mentioned or urinating - what else do they want, a sentence that says the character was ""standing there""? Like that would be better?Besides, even the critics must admit they remember the part about urinating or ""Fruit Loops"" !! Because they wrote about it. Had something like ""standing"" been written instead, they may not have remembered.That's an interesting aspect of the book that deserves a second read - look at all those unique comments and descriptions that were used, and consider how well they cause readers to remember those parts."
7,1400064899,http://goodreads.com/user/show/125347-donovan,4,"This isn't a book for everyone, but I really enjoyed it and would recommend it to anyone who enjoys a fast paced(although somewhat tedious at times) book. It is a window into the lives of those whose passion is climbing trees, and not just any trees - the tallest trees in the world, the coastal Redwoods of northern CA. The cover caught my eye and then as I read the jacket, I knew I had to read it, as the setting is near where I grew up. The book is the story - over about a twenty year period - of a number of individuals who are passionate about finding, climbing and scientificially documenting the tops of these majestic giants. Climbing trees was a passion of mine as a kid and while these""explorers"" were grown men and women, there were so many times when I paused and had flashbacks to my own childhood - climbing through the treetops - building forts and treehouses and stringing ropes between trees. I've always loved trees. I just counted and I have about half a dozen paintings of trees in my house, including one I climbed all the time as a kid - the largest madrone tree in the world, until it came down in a storm in 2001.It was also exciting to peer into the passions of others. It reminded me of the ""Orchid Thief"" - this is a story about individuals who are so passionate about trees that their lives take second place. The passion is so strong that it becomes their life, their career, their reason for living. This passion leads to death, divorce and heartache, but also life-long and deep relationships, marriage and incredible adventure.I will definitely remember this story for a long time and the next time I'm visiting the family farm in the backwoods of Humboldt County, I may even climb a tree."
8,1400064899,http://goodreads.com/user/show/929238-hbalikov,3,"I am of two minds about this book. When Preston is giving us the impressions of actually climbing into these gigantic trees, I am transported to a world where new species abound high above earth in ecosystems ""similar to the ocean's coral reefs.""When he is lecturing us or creating the tension of personal relationships, I find myself more conscious of his prose --- his lack of fluidity and attempts at a compelling style. The ""story of passion and daring,"" promised in the title, comes through but is mitigated by the latter."
9,1400064899,http://goodreads.com/user/show/24216320-misty-wilson-read-fine-print,5,"I don’t read nonfiction. I’m not interested in trees. I can’t remember the last time I climbed a tree or even THOUGHT about a tree and I’m not really very interested in botany or even science, yet I really liked this book called The Wild Trees by Richard Preston.•This is a book about trees, but it is fascinating because the author tells the stories of the quirky, fearless people that study them, beginning in the 1970s to present day. Whole other worlds exist at the top of these gigantic Redwoods and Douglas firs, and these people had the determination and intelligence to figure out how to scale the trees and then how to study their findings.•Some were obsessed with finding the tallest tree, some were obsessed with climbing the trees, some were obsessed with the plants in the trees. Will they ever find each other and work together? Will these massive trees ever be mapped and appreciated by our world? These are the questions that kept me turning pages, and also the facts about trees that made my mouth drop open in awe, and also the suspense that goes into reading about someone climbing a tree that is over thirty stories tall. Some people do fall. That’s all I’ll say.•I’m so excited for our trip to the Redwood National Forest in June now! I’m brainstorming on how to find some of the biggest trees mentioned in this book, but I know they remain hidden for the safety of the tree. But we can still look, right? How big can the forest be?😂•This book actually does contain some adult content, about three pages to be exact, and let’s just say things can be done 400 feet up in a tree that you maybe wouldn’t have thought of😳. I would still let my young adult read it but be aware."
10,1400064899,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3488439-daphne,2,"I don't think this was a bad book per say. I think that many would actually enjoy the method of story telling, but for several reasons - it just did not work for me. I love nature writing generally, and find giant trees endlessly fascinating, but this dealt much less with the biology and nature of them and it focused on the stories of some dudes that climbed and studied them. I found much of it and their stories quite boring outside of the actual climbing. If I want to read about someone bagging groceries and having a crush on a girl that shops there, then I'll pick up some chick lit."
11,1400064899,http://goodreads.com/user/show/285438-flori,5,"This was the most fascinating read I've had in a long time. I loved learning about the old-growth forests of the northwest (which I previously knew nothing about). I loved learning about the science behind forest ecology (which I knew nothing about). I felt inspired by the people who developed ways to climb these giant trees and figured out that there's a whole world up there to explore. In short, I felt like I really learned a lot and enjoyed it too!"
12,1400064899,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1291915-lauren,4,"This book would have been near-perfect if it had cut off the last few chapters... I thought the author went off on a tangent writing about himself and his own tree-climbing. The first 3/4 of the book were amazingly educational, and I relished reading through the chapters. "
13,1400064899,http://goodreads.com/user/show/49278684-matthew-stocek,4,"Once you get past Richard Preston’s somewhat long, pedantic and oftentimes unnecessary explanatory writing, there’s a fascinating story here about the world’s largest trees and the scientists and eccentrics who spent their lives studying them.

14,1400064899,http://goodreads.com/user/show/14208457-wendy-kiang-spray,5,I'm planning a trip to see the California redwoods and wanted to read a good book that would get me excited for the experience. The Wild Trees was an excellent blend of stories of interesting people and their connections to nature/trees and facts about redwoods (like their amazing canopies) that I'll be happy to share with my family as we're hiking through the forests.

I admit I didn't read the blurb very closely, and I thought it was more about the ecology of the giant redwoods. As it turns out, it was kind of a biography-by-proxy of a number of different 'tall tree hunters', and Steve Sillett in particular.It was entertaining, but not exactly what I was after - my favourite parts were when it DID dip into ecology, the interesting environments that develop within the crowns of redwoods and so on, rather than all the touchy feely people stuff of the climbers themselvesAlso a quite detailed description of how to have sex in a hammock hanging hundreds of feet above the ground while tied to a tree was something I probably could have done without."
17,1400064899,http://goodreads.com/user/show/37673352-ashley-lehman,5,I was truly sad when this book ended...I wanted more. A great mix of information about the trees themselves (fascinating) and the stories of the people who explored their canopies (equally gripping). Inspirational to say the least. Other wordly at times. It just made me want to be up in a tree - I'll be taking a course in branch walking as soon as I can!! An excellent read!
18,1400064899,http://goodreads.com/user/show/18251574-glenn-roberts,4,"Who are these daring individuals? A fun and interesting account of those who climb redwoods and other tall trees for fun and fame. I had a friend plant a eucalyptus tree and ten years later he was surprised to see it towering over his yard. Now I know why that was. And many other things I don't really need to know, but enjoyed climbing though them. "
19,1400064899,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4117491-suzanne,4,"Two hundred and fifty feet up, the light became brighter, although I still couldn't see the sky, and the crown of Adventure billowed into a riot of living branches. By then, the ground had disappeared completely, hidden below decks of foliage in the lower parts of the canopy. This was the deep canopy -- a world between the ground and the sky, an intermediary realm, neither fully solid nor purely air, an ever-changing scaffold joining heaven and earth, ruled by the forces of gravity, wind, fire, and time.It's incredible to think that for as long as the redwoods have been there, so much of them remains unexplored. Preston describes the discovery of some of the largest redwoods and profiles the scientists (and enthusiasts) who developed the methods for safely and carefully exploring their upper tiers.There is a healthy dose of biology in the book (lichen diversity = so cool), but it is mainly about the people and how their obsession with trees impacted their lives and pushed forward canopy science. There's also adrenaline to be had because tall tree climbing is dangerous, but in different ways than mountain-climbing. Mistakes on a mountain may take time to catch up with a person. Mistakes in a tree = you're done.I enjoyed the writing, too. Preston does well in describing both the action and the science, which shouldn't have surprised me given how gripping I remember The Hot Zone: A Terrifying True Story being, back in the day. I haven't read that one since it came out, but I'm tempted now to pluck it off the shelf and see how it holds up.And finally, a nugget of trivia I did not know. Preston dedicated the book to his brother, Douglas Preston. I had no idea they were brothers!"
20,1400064899,http://goodreads.com/user/show/10139432-jennifer,3,"I listened to this book on Audible, and I wonder if I'd have liked it more if I'd read it instead. Most of the book was pretty engaging; I felt Preston introduced us to the various players in a way that made me care about them and root for their success. However, toward the last few chapters I began to feel that the author seemed to be laboring unnecessarily on the specifics of the ropework and climbing. As I've never seen -- much less used -- a so-called 'spider' setup or whatever it is, about 70% of the last three chapters were more or less lost on me. I get that they were in this tree, and then swung to that one and at various points were probably in danger, but the elaborate descriptions of how this was done lost me. I needed a diagram to understand any of what was happening.That said, I did enjoy it, and I think arborists and people who enjoy extreme climbing would appreciate that last part far better than I did. I did, of course, love hearing about the coastal redwoods and the incredible biodiversity they foster. "
21,1400064899,http://goodreads.com/user/show/114849-susan,4,"Think the trees you see on the tours of Redwood National Forest are the granddaddies of them all? Guess again.A really interesting look at the group of tree-groupies (arborists, naturalists, botanists, and so on) who dedicate themselves to identifying, documenting and preserving the Giant Redwoods and other behemoth trees. The story gets a bit hokey when Preston starts recounting the personal lives and relationships of and between his characters. It seems like quite a detour, is unnecessary and downright distracting. But the descriptions of the various trees and the reverence for them made me overlook this slight foible. The trees truly become characters and take on lives of their own. You can envision them in some alluvial fan somewhere, born before Christ, witnesses to history. I'd love to see them and drink them in, but I guess it's better that the tree-groupies keep them safe from prying eyes, tour buses and lumber companies."
22,1400064899,http://goodreads.com/user/show/369112-melody,3,"Preston was very involved and present throughout this book, so much so I'm not sure if I would classify it as nature memoir rather than narrative nonfiction. His presence added information about the feeling of climbing a giant tree, so I'm not condemning it. The focus of this book was rather more on the interesting people who become obsessed with redwoods and slightly less on the trees themselves. Donald Culross Peattie has probably ruined me for anyone else. Preston's an involving writer, though, and his scenes of derring-do are pulse-pounding and breathtaking. I loved best the descriptions of the little groves, little ecosystems at the tops of the redwoods' canopies. Recommended for tree-huggers everywhere. 3.5"

But their true calling lies 350-feet-plus above the ground mapping the landscapes of coastal redwoods. The discoverers of these trees have the privilege of naming them, usually for characters in mythology or Tolkien; but not always, as in the case of the ""Dry Heaves Tree"". The author goes native, as the reader will be tempted to do. There's a disclaimer at the end: don't climb big trees without proper training."

27,1400064899,http://goodreads.com/user/show/22306206-neil-r-coulter,3,"One of my students recommended this book to me, and it seemed like the right time to read it. My youngest son and I just finished watching a documentary series about the national parks, so with the words of John Muir and other parks advocates fresh in my mind, I opened up The Wild Trees to venture into the redwoods (vicariously) once more.Richard Preston’s book is unlike any other book I’ve read. It’s a mix of scientific information, history, and the personal lives of the people who made the important discoveries in the redwood canopies of the American West. I think Preston’s idea is to include all the details, to show that all life is interconnected. The failed marriages and everyday disappointments of the researchers are just as much a part of the world as the new species being discovered 370 feet above the earth’s surface.Unfortunately, I found myself far, far less interested in the mundane everyday of the researchers than I was in the scientific discoveries. I would have preferred that the book be weighted much more toward the history and science, and much less on the personal lives of a group of extraordinarily socially awkward people. In addition, Preston uses a lot of words to describe the intricate climbing systems devised by the central characters of the story—but that would have been a lot clearer and quicker if this were a documentary film rather than a book. In fact, I think this whole project would have been more engrossing as a film.As I read the book, I never felt that Preston justified people's desperation in trying to find the world's tallest tree. What's the difference between a 360-foot-tall redwood and a 370-foot-tall redwood, exactly? I felt a little sad for the people the book follows as they frantically try to prove that they've located the world's tallest tree.Those criticisms aside, however, the writing style is smooth and breezy, and the history and science are quite fascinating. I was amazed to learn how little was known of the redwood canopies until the 1980s. Though the book is no substitute for actually swinging around in the trees, it is a beautiful glimpse into a part of the natural world that most of us will never experience, but which is vital for our survival. Reading this and watching Ken Burns’s national parks documentary affirm what a fantastic idea America had to set aside areas of the country as off-limits to industrial development. The Wild Trees hints at the same tension Burns explores in his documentary: how do you discover pristine natural locations and study them without exploiting them to their ruin?One final wish for The Wild Trees: why couldn’t it have included photographs? The only illustrations are hand-drawn images. Photographs would have helped so much!"
28,1400064899,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3037001-pamela,4,"This book is mainly about tree climbers. Well, one could say it’s also about canopy science, perhaps the early days. Certainly the beginning of canopy science of Redwood Trees. (I have to use upper case for them, I love Redwood Trees.)Much of the book talks about several different people, but not how they connect, or at least not in the first part of the book. These people turn out to help develop science about some of the oldest, and largest living organisms on earth. The beginning parts of the book were somewhat confusing on why these specific people were given a biography, of their early years and development. I guessed their paths would meet up somewhere later in the book, but it was a little awkward in the beginning not knowing the connections.There is a lot about tree climbing here, and sometimes a bit technical. It reminds me of my own forays into trees. Funny I don't climb them anymore. I did spend quite a lot of time climbing trees while growing up, mainly in pines in the forest. The book mentions that most kids are natural tree climbers but we grow out of it as adults. Certainly true for me. Sometimes I do miss it.Overall the book is good, interesting, at least if you like really tall trees. It’s mainly about the Redwoods, which are my favorite tree, and I learned more about them, so that’s good."

I started the book thinking it may be a bit boring, just a bunch of science that would be yes, interesting, but not exactly exciting reading and I would just skim through it and learn a few things. Well, I was hooked in the first chapter as it started out just like a good novel, with great character development and grabbing me into a what's going to happen! The author writes what seems to be a really good ""novel"" but it is a true story. I read onward wanting to know what the characters would do, plus the science and education was thrown in so well and was so interesting that I wanted to re-read it instead of skim over it. It really is a story of Passion. "

A great example of scientific narrative non-fiction and one that I know I will come back to again. I didn't want to put it down but also didn't want it to end. A few of my favorite passages:""Botanists make a distinction between the height of a tree and its overall size, which is measured by the amount of wood the tree has in its trunk and limbs. The largest redwoods, which are called redwood giants or titans, are usually not the very tallest ones. In this way, they are rather like people. A football player is often bigger than a basketball player – more massive, that is. The basketball player is taller and more slender. So it is with redwoods."" (pg. 6)""They passed a Carl's Jr. fast-food restaurant, and a lumber mill, and bars and taverns, dark in daylight, where you could get a beer for a dollar and maybe get a fractured skull for nothing."" (pg. 7)""Poe had a passion for botany, too. She often used the scientific names of plants when she talked with the boys. To Poe, the buttercup was Ranunculus. Poe was not particularly fond of Homo sapiens."" (pg. 11)"" A person who is dropping in free fall through space often turns upside down and falls headfirst. This happens because, with most people, the upper half of the body is heavier than the lower half, and so the person tips over and plunges head-downward, like an arrow with a weighted point. In a headfirst landing after a fifty-foot fall, the shock crushed the skull and breaks the neck, destroying the brain and shearing the spinal cord off at the base of the skull. Instant death. No matter which way the victim lands, the impact normally breaks the victim's back, leaving him paralyzed (if he survives). If the person happens to land feetfirst, a shockwave travels up the legs, breaking them in many places, shattering the lower spine, and cutting the spinal cord. The lungs can collapse from the force of the impact, or they can be punctured by broken ribs, and the flattened or torn lungs can fill up with blood, causing the victim to drown in his blood. Major internal organs, including the liver, the kidneys, the spleen, and the bladder, as well as the aorta, can burst during the impact. If they split apart, they flood the body cavity with blood – catastrophic internal hemorrhage."" (pg. 15)""The branch on the big redwood looked delicate. Steve couldn't really tell if it was strong enough to support his weight. The lowest branches on the truck of a redwood are called epicormic branches. Epicormic branches occur on many kinds of trees. They often arise out in fan-shaped sprays called epi sprays. In redwoods, these branches are not solidly attached to the trunk, and can easily break or fall off the tree. Steve Sillett didn't know what an epicormic branch was."" (pg. 16)""As a redwood enters middle age, it typically loses its leader. Its top spire dies back. I suppose this is a little like a man going bald. The top spire turns into a bleached skeleton, and it falls off the tree. The bark of a redwood is usually a reddish-brown color, but as some redwoods get old their bark can turn stony gray. Even when its top falls off and its bark turns gray, a redwood is still growing and, in fact, may have hardly begun to grow. In this respect, it is not like a person at all."" (pg. 20)""In a lichen, the fungus part of the organism is like a landlord who builds a house, and the alga or cyanobacterium is the tenant, who pays rent to the landlord. The landlord uses the rent to build a larger house for more tenants."" (pg. 24)""At the time that Steve Sillett and Marwood Harris made the first ascent of Nameless, there was a general belief among biologists that the redwood forest canopy was what they called a redwood desert. That is, the redwood canopy was believed to be essentially empty of life other than the branches of redwood trees. In any case, biologists regarded coast redwoods as unreachable towers, remote and bare. Steve Sillett encountered something quite different. He found what amounted to coral reefs in the air."" (pg. 25)""The air was heavy with the sharp smell of California bay laurel trees, which grew around the ankles of the redwoods."" (pg. 41)""It was much darker in the Douglas-fir canopy than it was in the fields and meadows around the stand of trees. Hillery thought that it was adult dark but not kid dark. Adult dark is when the adults tell you that you have to stop throwing the ball around and come indoors. Kid dark is so dark that you can't see the ball anymore, and you have to stop plating."" (pg. 105)""The coast redwood is a so-called relict species. It is a tiny remnant population of a life form that once spread in splendor and power across the face of nature. The redwood has settled down in California to live near the sea, the way many retired people do."" (pg. 218)"
34,1400064899,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2023262-lois,3,"This book was both a biography of the people who pioneered climbing the huge redwoods, and a description of the redwoods themselves and the communities that live in their crowns. I felt that the sections that succeeded best were those in which the author describes his own experiences and observations while climbing in trees. Those passages were very engaging and held my interest; some were lyrical. But the biography part felt very superficial. I never had a sense that I understood the people, yet they were such a large part of the book."

Part novel, part exploration chronicle and part science text, this book really delivers on the passion and science of the tall tree canopy. I loved that there were/are still unknown places on the North American map. I appreciate the necessity of keeping these places secret and unnamed. We are better off knowing only that they exist and are properly explored and defined. God forbid the tree climbing enthusiasts feel compelled to ""bag"" these these trees so they can brag about it over a couple of IPA's in some north coast tavern. These world heritage sites deserve a better a fate. This book provides all the reasons why they should be left alone to exist as they have prior to contact with homo sapiens. Too much of our natural heritage has been lost to history, leave these trees alone. "
37,1400064899,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2127981-steve,5,"This book is a love story. It's a story about a small circle of people (mostly men) who love the world's tallest trees; and it's a story about how - in finding the trees - they find one another. A ""wild tree"" is a tree that has never been climbed by anyone else, and these folks existence is justified by finding such wild trees.But these are folks obsessed with finding, and then climbing, the tallest living things - the Coastal Redwoods. Most of these giants are located in highly inaccessible places - sadly, one of the main reasons why they haven't been logged already - and the (mostly) men who look for them, , find them, climb them, and map them (!) are unlike most of us. They spend most of their free time alone, in harsh, isolated, and unforgiving spaces. Preston, like author John McPhee, tells us the personal stories of these people in order to heighten our appreciation of the the trees with which their lives are intertwined.These people are pioneers in the development of methods of climbing trees that do no damage to the trees, as well as methods of mapping their canopies. Most of us who remain on the ground view these trees as massive trunks with lower branches that can be seen sprouting from the main trunks of the trees at the height of a twelve-story building, or higher. So it comes as a revelation to discover how verdant and thick the canopies of the Coastal Redwoods actually are. We are told that the canopy of one tall tree was so thick that people wearing snowshoes could literally walk around on top of it, throwing Frisbees. We learn that these canopies are diverse ecosystems of their own - with berry bushes, ferns, and even other trees rooted in soil (often TONS of soil) that form and accumulate in the spacious crotches of ""branches"" (often with a diameter larger than the trunks of most eastern hardwoods) hundreds of feet above the ground. Like the new worlds that were discovered when Jacques Cousteau developed the suits that enabled exploration of the sea, the tools and methods developed by the climbers of these tall trees allowed them to discover a world which had up until then remained completely unknown and uncharted. If you are interested in learning about this world and those who have taken the time to discover it for us, read this book. If you love the mystery of trees, read this book. If you want a new perspective of the beauty and mystery of the diversity of life, read this book.Read this book!"

39,1400064899,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1189388-karen,3,"I love being introduced to real worlds that I never knew (or thought about) existed. The canopies of the highest trees on earth is one of the truly unexplored frontiers. Because of the originality of the subject and the fact that it introduces you to this world, it deserves three stars. However, this isn't really the story of trees, though you do learn a lot about them. Instead it is the story of people who climb these trees. The problem is, these people really aren't that interesting. The author added tension and suspense where he could and tried to delve into these characters. This would make a fantastic setting for a work of fiction.My main criticism of the book, however, has to do with ethics. I love scuba diving and have confronted a similar issue. The very act of humans exploring and touching the forest canopy (much like coral reefs) inherently means that damage occurs. The author deliberately does not reveal the location of certain redwoods to avoid ""recreational"" treeclimbers discovering and damaging the trees. The problem is that at times each of the botanists, scientists, etc..., including himself, climb trees ""recreationally."" He brings up the ethical issue of climbing, but never pursues it. Taking his teenagers on a trip to Scotland to climb the oldest and tallest grove in the country seems to present no ethical dilemma. Similarly, one of the main characters in the book, a botanist, does not seem to have any qualms about climbing the tallest and oldest trees in Australia recreationally. It seems that if you love and study trees you are inherently immune to the ethical dilemma of wanting to explore that which you want to protect from others. I don't think these people shouldn't be climbing the trees, just that the author should have talked about this tension. "
40,1400064899,http://goodreads.com/user/show/363289-patty,4,"Richard Preston is a science writer with a gift for turning complex biology into riveting page-turners. In The Wild Trees, he describes old-growth forests, mostly redwoods, that have managed to evade the timber industry's blades and still live along the coast of northern California. Preston assures us that, amazingly, until the past two decades the ecosystem formed by the intertwining limbs of these ancient, gargantuan living things had never really been studied. Preston introduces us to several researchers, most prominently botanist Stephen C. Sillett, who are probing the mysteries of the skyscraper-high forest canopy. In addition to Sillett, there's Michael Taylor, a millionaire's son and speed-chess champion who is afraid of heights but downsizes his life to work as a grocery clerk while he searches for the world's tallest tree, and Marie Antoine, who became a scholar of lichens. Eventually, Preston, who took up tree-climbing as a respite from writing, joins them up in the treetops.My husband read this book years ago and told me many of the incredible incidents. We always planned on visiting the Calif. Redwoods and finally did it. Of course we had to listen to the Wild Trees on CD while driving up Hwy. 1 and going through the towns and groves of trees where you will find the tallest of the tall trees. It was neck-aching to look up at these trees as Michael Taylor must have done to estimate the height of the trees and incredible to know that professionals climbed to the tip top of these trees to measure them precisely and study the diversity in the canopy. I could imagine them swaying in their beds as the breeze came up and could not imagine how one researcher fell and lived to climb them again. I love it when a non-fiction book reads like a fiction thriller. A must read."
41,1400064899,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4637681-carl-nelson,3,"3.5 stars. The Wild Trees: A Story of Passion and Daring is a narrative nonfiction account of researchers who climb to the tops of the largest living organisms on the planet, the giant redwoods. Or perhaps it's the tale of people so obsessed with climbing these trees that they became researchers; I'm not quite certain which it is. Richard Preston starts with an electric account of a first climb up one of these giant trees, replete with white-knuckled fear, a foolhardy leap of faith, and an encounter with hornets.Had the whole book kept pace with that searing opening, this would have been a fantastic read. As it was, the book soon went off on the tawdry doings of its cast, who were largely so blinded by their obsession with trees that everything else was discarded in their lives. Their exploits, successes, and failures at climbing would have been much better than the neglects of their social lives.I also would have enjoyed this book much more had it focused on the trees, especially what they found in them and what it felt like to climb up one. Too much of the text was taken up with the quest for the tallest redwood, seemingly replacing knowledge and science with a world record quest. Some pictures would have been a valuable addition as well!I certainly enjoyed and learned from The Wild Trees, but it could have been so much more."
42,1400064899,http://goodreads.com/user/show/82840-laura,4,"I had never imagined that there are people whose lifelong passion is to study and climb redwood trees.... specifically Titan redwoods which are the world's longest (and some of the oldest) trees measuring in at a minimum height of 360 feet. I fell in love with redwoods and tree climbing through this book, and I thoroughly enjoyed learning about something that I knew nothing about and that I found fascinating. That said, the material is fantastic, and had it been in the hands of a skillful writer, the book would have been absolutely exquisite.... something legendary. Preston's writing is so bad, it's actually funny.... and encouraging for anyone who thinks that maybe their own writing isn't so great. His portrayal of the botanists and climbers involved in these tree escapades is flat. The quotes that he uses add nothing to the substance and sound like quotes that a 4th grader might coax out of an unwilling interviewee. His sentence structure is dull and full of too many linking verbs.All in all, I loved the topic and found the story of these trees and the lives of those who study them to be compelling. Maybe I will give this book to my students and make them rewrite it as an exercise in descriptive writing?"
43,1400064899,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2294085-david,4,"I'll admit, I had my reservations when deciding on this -- a book about trees. Much to my delighted surprise, my fears were laid to rest as the vivid, delicate writing of Richard Preston weaved a compelling story, for why trees should be much heralded.The book follows a series of amateur and professional arborists/botanists on their journey of discovering the world's largest trees. Along the way, many of the stories become intertwined as the protagonists meet one another and cross paths, sharing stories and, together, uncovering the lush bio-systems of the tree canopies. Add to the mix harrowing accounts of death and near-death, romance, and the author's own introduction to tree climbing, the book becomes more than just a story about trees; it's a story of the precarious balance of life on Earth.By the end, the book both piqued my interest in visiting the Redwood trees of the Pacific Northwest, and imbued in me a strong sense of wanting to protect these ancient living organisms."
44,1400064899,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6936459-gabrielle-lawrence,5,"Great book about the noble Redwoods and a few interesting people who study them, and end up becoming quite emotionally attached to the trees.There's some science, too! I loved learning about all the incredible biology. On the tops of these trees, the climbers discover ""gardens of ferns, fruiting huckleberries, flowering rhododendrons, fully grown bay laurels. Miniature salamanders live in water captured by the giant ferns, as do tiny crustaceans. Preston describes a 60-foot wide platform of branches in the broken-off top of a tree named Kronos, with 22 auxiliary redwood trunks 80 to 100 feet tall and a yard and a half across at their bases."" Incredible. Preston describes scenes with such clarity I could pretend I was standing in the forest, breathing in that smell so specific to the Redwoods. There is also a very quiet and sweet love story that weaves thru this book, but overall is was the descriptions of climbing and living in trees over 350 feet tall that held me. Made me thankful to have lived in Humboldt county."
45,1400064899,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7617066-jenny-gb,4,"This book was so refreshing after reading Preston's other books about horrible diseases and the descriptions in there that make your skin crawl. Instead, this was a story about a strange group of people who really love the largest and tallest trees in the world (including himself). As someone who has never climbed a tree, this made me curious to try it if I could cure my fear of heights. The stories about the people were sometimes interesting and sometimes annoying, but I appreciated knowing more about the few people in the world studying and climbing these trees. A lot of the descriptions of tree biology and climbing techniques went a bit above my head. I tried my best to understand them, but unfortunately it's way outside of my realm of knowledge. I think more pictures of both trees and climbing would have helped, although I know the trees and the climbing techniques are secret to help preserve these trees. Reading this book was usually a peaceful experience of thinking about huge trees and ancient forests. I hope Preston write more books like this in the future."
46,1400064899,http://goodreads.com/user/show/398118-rich-flammer,1,"Fascinating topic... I was so excited to begin this book, knowing it was about an incredible world of life that exists in the treetops that we know so little about. But the writing is really terrible. Poor flow, and too much detail about things that have nothing to do with the implied focus and subject matter of the text. I don't care if the scientist has a pimple on his knee and eats Fruit Loops every other day for breakfast... This sort of detail really bogged down the writing. I don't like giving bad reviews, but considering what the writer had to work with, the incredible skill and courage it takes to climb these giants, the captivating biological activity that occurs in the upper reaches of these magnificent trees, I was entirely letdown with how he put together and presented the information. No matter how alluring the subject is, I just can't stay interested when the writing is so heavy and inelegant. "
47,1400064899,http://goodreads.com/user/show/30710811-jan-smitowicz,5,"This book is absolute essential reading for anybody who cares about the natural world, climate change, and all related issues. And anyone interested in nature, trees, ecology, redwoods, natural history, and so on. It totally reads like a thriller; Preston makes you deeply invested in the real people whose lives populate this book. I came away having learned about the search for the tallest and biggest redwoods, as well as the general ecology of forests and redwood forests in particular, yet never once felt like I was being tasked with a chore. I've had the unbelievable honor to be able to meet some of the amazing hidden giants talked about in this book--like Illuvatar, Isaac Newton, and others--and that only made subsequent readings that much better. One of my all-time favorite books involving nature/natural history!"
48,1400064899,http://goodreads.com/user/show/733624-al,4," This book follows the lives and adventures of a number of young adventurers who have sought out and climbed the highest giant redwoods in California. Part daredevils, part mystics, part scientists, they have developed new climbing techniques and collected data from the trees they have climbed. Evidently some of the areas they have visited are so inaccessible that they have never been previously visited -- and the author steadfastly refuses to disclose the locations, for fear that recreational climbers will ruin the trees. The story is exciting, fraught with danger, and full of useful information. Recommended"
49,1400064899,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6164581-joe-bolin,3,"I enjoyed The Wild Trees and did find it to be A Story of Passion and Daring. Had the author been able to keep an appropriate distance from his subjects, though, I would've enjoyed it more. Once Preston entered the story--as a writer for The New Yorker magazine--the book became a fawning tribute to Steve Sillett. Up to that point, he had been presented as a flawed scientist whose single-minded passion for trees--and coastal redwoods, in particular--had consumed every other aspect of his life. If you are interested in the life of a redwood forest, this book is well worth reading, however."

It lead me into a world in which the trees are ancient, wise, and have worlds within themselves. It introduced me to the people who explore those worlds and build their lives around them. And it introduced some main characters who change and grow as they learn more and more about the ancient redwoods. I recommend this book to anyone who loves learning about nature, and especially to those who have roots in the Western USA and are familiar with the enormous redwoods and their beauty. "

I loved The Hot Zone, it was so well-written and intense and I thought that Preston would do the same thing for the tree canopy that he did for Ebola. Unfortunately, this turned out to be a combination of the most boring science lecture on biology I've ever sat through and a study of some of the most self-centered, maladjusted people I think I've ever read about. I stopped reading about halfway through--I may have bailed out early--but none of the disparate threads of story ever seemed to come together. "
52,1400064899,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1821855-doris,1,"The technical content was interesting, but the efforts at expanding a magazine article into a book felt obvious.

Steve couldn't really tell if it was strong enough to support his weight. The lowest branches on the truck of a redwood are called epicormic branches. Epicormic branches occur on many kinds of trees. They often arise out in fan-shaped sprays called epi sprays. In redwoods, these branches are not solidly attached to the trunk, and can easily break or fall off the tree. Steve Sillett didn't know what an epicormic branch was."" (pg. 16)""As a redwood enters middle age, it typically loses its leader. Its top spire dies back. I suppose this is a little like a man going bald. The top spire turns into a bleached skeleton, and it falls off the tree. The bark of a redwood is usually a reddish-brown color, but as some redwoods get old their bark can turn stony gray. Even when its top falls off and its bark turns gray, a redwood is still growing and, in fact, may have hardly begun to grow. In this respect, it is not like a person at all."" (pg. 20)""In a lichen, the fungus part of the organism is like a landlord who builds a house, and the alga or cyanobacterium is the tenant, who pays rent to the landlord. The landlord uses the rent to build a larger house for more tenants."" (pg. 24)""At the time that Steve Sillett and Marwood Harris made the first ascent of Nameless, there was a general belief among biologists that the redwood forest canopy was what they called a redwood desert. That is, the redwood canopy was believed to be essentially empty of life other than the branches of redwood trees. In any case, biologists regarded coast redwoods as unreachable towers, remote and bare. Steve Sillett encountered something quite different. He found what amounted to coral reefs in the air."" (pg. 25)""The air was heavy with the sharp smell of California bay laurel trees, which grew around the ankles of the redwoods."" (pg. 41)""It was much darker in the Douglas-fir canopy than it was in the fields and meadows around the stand of trees. Hillery thought that it was adult dark but not kid dark. Adult dark is when the adults tell you that you have to stop throwing the ball around and come indoors. Kid dark is so dark that you can't see the ball anymore, and you have to stop plating."" (pg. 105)""The coast redwood is a so-called relict species. It is a tiny remnant population of a life form that once spread in splendor and power across the face of nature. The redwood has settled down in California to live near the sea, the way many retired people do."" (pg. 218)"

67,1400064899,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2127981-steve,5,"This book is a love story. It's a story about a small circle of people (mostly men) who love the world's tallest trees; and it's a story about how - in finding the trees - they find one another. A ""wild tree"" is a tree that has never been climbed by anyone else, and these folks existence is justified by finding such wild trees.But these are folks obsessed with finding, and then climbing, the tallest living things - the Coastal Redwoods. Most of these giants are located in highly inaccessible places - sadly, one of the main reasons why they haven't been logged already - and the (mostly) men who look for them, , find them, climb them, and map them (!) are unlike most of us. They spend most of their free time alone, in harsh, isolated, and unforgiving spaces. Preston, like author John McPhee, tells us the personal stories of these people in order to heighten our appreciation of the the trees with which their lives are intertwined.These people are pioneers in the development of methods of climbing trees that do no damage to the trees, as well as methods of mapping their canopies. Most of us who remain on the ground view these trees as massive trunks with lower branches that can be seen sprouting from the main trunks of the trees at the height of a twelve-story building, or higher. So it comes as a revelation to discover how verdant and thick the canopies of the Coastal Redwoods actually are. We are told that the canopy of one tall tree was so thick that people wearing snowshoes could literally walk around on top of it, throwing Frisbees. We learn that these canopies are diverse ecosystems of their own - with berry bushes, ferns, and even other trees rooted in soil (often TONS of soil) that form and accumulate in the spacious crotches of ""branches"" (often with a diameter larger than the trunks of most eastern hardwoods) hundreds of feet above the ground. Like the new worlds that were discovered when Jacques Cousteau developed the suits that enabled exploration of the sea, the tools and methods developed by the climbers of these tall trees allowed them to discover a world which had up until then remained completely unknown and uncharted. If you are interested in learning about this world and those who have taken the time to discover it for us, read this book. If you love the mystery of trees, read this book. If you want a new perspective of the beauty and mystery of the diversity of life, read this book.Read this book!"

69,1400064899,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1189388-karen,3,"I love being introduced to real worlds that I never knew (or thought about) existed. The canopies of the highest trees on earth is one of the truly unexplored frontiers. Because of the originality of the subject and the fact that it introduces you to this world, it deserves three stars. However, this isn't really the story of trees, though you do learn a lot about them. Instead it is the story of people who climb these trees. The problem is, these people really aren't that interesting. The author added tension and suspense where he could and tried to delve into these characters. This would make a fantastic setting for a work of fiction.My main criticism of the book, however, has to do with ethics. I love scuba diving and have confronted a similar issue. The very act of humans exploring and touching the forest canopy (much like coral reefs) inherently means that damage occurs. The author deliberately does not reveal the location of certain redwoods to avoid ""recreational"" treeclimbers discovering and damaging the trees. The problem is that at times each of the botanists, scientists, etc..., including himself, climb trees ""recreationally."" He brings up the ethical issue of climbing, but never pursues it. Taking his teenagers on a trip to Scotland to climb the oldest and tallest grove in the country seems to present no ethical dilemma. Similarly, one of the main characters in the book, a botanist, does not seem to have any qualms about climbing the tallest and oldest trees in Australia recreationally. It seems that if you love and study trees you are inherently immune to the ethical dilemma of wanting to explore that which you want to protect from others. I don't think these people shouldn't be climbing the trees, just that the author should have talked about this tension. "
70,1400064899,http://goodreads.com/user/show/363289-patty,4,"Richard Preston is a science writer with a gift for turning complex biology into riveting page-turners. In The Wild Trees, he describes old-growth forests, mostly redwoods, that have managed to evade the timber industry's blades and still live along the coast of northern California. Preston assures us that, amazingly, until the past two decades the ecosystem formed by the intertwining limbs of these ancient, gargantuan living things had never really been studied. Preston introduces us to several researchers, most prominently botanist Stephen C. Sillett, who are probing the mysteries of the skyscraper-high forest canopy. In addition to Sillett, there's Michael Taylor, a millionaire's son and speed-chess champion who is afraid of heights but downsizes his life to work as a grocery clerk while he searches for the world's tallest tree, and Marie Antoine, who became a scholar of lichens. Eventually, Preston, who took up tree-climbing as a respite from writing, joins them up in the treetops.My husband read this book years ago and told me many of the incredible incidents. We always planned on visiting the Calif. Redwoods and finally did it. Of course we had to listen to the Wild Trees on CD while driving up Hwy. 1 and going through the towns and groves of trees where you will find the tallest of the tall trees. It was neck-aching to look up at these trees as Michael Taylor must have done to estimate the height of the trees and incredible to know that professionals climbed to the tip top of these trees to measure them precisely and study the diversity in the canopy. I could imagine them swaying in their beds as the breeze came up and could not imagine how one researcher fell and lived to climb them again. I love it when a non-fiction book reads like a fiction thriller. A must read."
71,1400064899,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4637681-carl-nelson,3,"3.5 stars. The Wild Trees: A Story of Passion and Daring is a narrative nonfiction account of researchers who climb to the tops of the largest living organisms on the planet, the giant redwoods. Or perhaps it's the tale of people so obsessed with climbing these trees that they became researchers; I'm not quite certain which it is. Richard Preston starts with an electric account of a first climb up one of these giant trees, replete with white-knuckled fear, a foolhardy leap of faith, and an encounter with hornets.Had the whole book kept pace with that searing opening, this would have been a fantastic read. As it was, the book soon went off on the tawdry doings of its cast, who were largely so blinded by their obsession with trees that everything else was discarded in their lives. Their exploits, successes, and failures at climbing would have been much better than the neglects of their social lives.I also would have enjoyed this book much more had it focused on the trees, especially what they found in them and what it felt like to climb up one. Too much of the text was taken up with the quest for the tallest redwood, seemingly replacing knowledge and science with a world record quest. Some pictures would have been a valuable addition as well!I certainly enjoyed and learned from The Wild Trees, but it could have been so much more."
72,1400064899,http://goodreads.com/user/show/82840-laura,4,"I had never imagined that there are people whose lifelong passion is to study and climb redwood trees.... specifically Titan redwoods which are the world's longest (and some of the oldest) trees measuring in at a minimum height of 360 feet. I fell in love with redwoods and tree climbing through this book, and I thoroughly enjoyed learning about something that I knew nothing about and that I found fascinating. That said, the material is fantastic, and had it been in the hands of a skillful writer, the book would have been absolutely exquisite.... something legendary. Preston's writing is so bad, it's actually funny.... and encouraging for anyone who thinks that maybe their own writing isn't so great. His portrayal of the botanists and climbers involved in these tree escapades is flat. The quotes that he uses add nothing to the substance and sound like quotes that a 4th grader might coax out of an unwilling interviewee. His sentence structure is dull and full of too many linking verbs.All in all, I loved the topic and found the story of these trees and the lives of those who study them to be compelling. Maybe I will give this book to my students and make them rewrite it as an exercise in descriptive writing?"
73,1400064899,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2294085-david,4,"I'll admit, I had my reservations when deciding on this -- a book about trees. Much to my delighted surprise, my fears were laid to rest as the vivid, delicate writing of Richard Preston weaved a compelling story, for why trees should be much heralded.The book follows a series of amateur and professional arborists/botanists on their journey of discovering the world's largest trees. Along the way, many of the stories become intertwined as the protagonists meet one another and cross paths, sharing stories and, together, uncovering the lush bio-systems of the tree canopies. Add to the mix harrowing accounts of death and near-death, romance, and the author's own introduction to tree climbing, the book becomes more than just a story about trees; it's a story of the precarious balance of life on Earth.By the end, the book both piqued my interest in visiting the Redwood trees of the Pacific Northwest, and imbued in me a strong sense of wanting to protect these ancient living organisms."
74,1400064899,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6936459-gabrielle-lawrence,5,"Great book about the noble Redwoods and a few interesting people who study them, and end up becoming quite emotionally attached to the trees.There's some science, too! I loved learning about all the incredible biology. On the tops of these trees, the climbers discover ""gardens of ferns, fruiting huckleberries, flowering rhododendrons, fully grown bay laurels. Miniature salamanders live in water captured by the giant ferns, as do tiny crustaceans. Preston describes a 60-foot wide platform of branches in the broken-off top of a tree named Kronos, with 22 auxiliary redwood trunks 80 to 100 feet tall and a yard and a half across at their bases."" Incredible. Preston describes scenes with such clarity I could pretend I was standing in the forest, breathing in that smell so specific to the Redwoods. There is also a very quiet and sweet love story that weaves thru this book, but overall is was the descriptions of climbing and living in trees over 350 feet tall that held me. Made me thankful to have lived in Humboldt county."
75,1400064899,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7617066-jenny-gb,4,"This book was so refreshing after reading Preston's other books about horrible diseases and the descriptions in there that make your skin crawl. Instead, this was a story about a strange group of people who really love the largest and tallest trees in the world (including himself). As someone who has never climbed a tree, this made me curious to try it if I could cure my fear of heights. The stories about the people were sometimes interesting and sometimes annoying, but I appreciated knowing more about the few people in the world studying and climbing these trees. A lot of the descriptions of tree biology and climbing techniques went a bit above my head. I tried my best to understand them, but unfortunately it's way outside of my realm of knowledge. I think more pictures of both trees and climbing would have helped, although I know the trees and the climbing techniques are secret to help preserve these trees. Reading this book was usually a peaceful experience of thinking about huge trees and ancient forests. I hope Preston write more books like this in the future."
76,1400064899,http://goodreads.com/user/show/398118-rich-flammer,1,"Fascinating topic... I was so excited to begin this book, knowing it was about an incredible world of life that exists in the treetops that we know so little about. But the writing is really terrible. Poor flow, and too much detail about things that have nothing to do with the implied focus and subject matter of the text. I don't care if the scientist has a pimple on his knee and eats Fruit Loops every other day for breakfast... This sort of detail really bogged down the writing. I don't like giving bad reviews, but considering what the writer had to work with, the incredible skill and courage it takes to climb these giants, the captivating biological activity that occurs in the upper reaches of these magnificent trees, I was entirely letdown with how he put together and presented the information. No matter how alluring the subject is, I just can't stay interested when the writing is so heavy and inelegant. "

And anyone interested in nature, trees, ecology, redwoods, natural history, and so on. It totally reads like a thriller; Preston makes you deeply invested in the real people whose lives populate this book. I came away having learned about the search for the tallest and biggest redwoods, as well as the general ecology of forests and redwood forests in particular, yet never once felt like I was being tasked with a chore. I've had the unbelievable honor to be able to meet some of the amazing hidden giants talked about in this book--like Illuvatar, Isaac Newton, and others--and that only made subsequent readings that much better. One of my all-time favorite books involving nature/natural history!"
78,1400064899,http://goodreads.com/user/show/733624-al,4," This book follows the lives and adventures of a number of young adventurers who have sought out and climbed the highest giant redwoods in California. Part daredevils, part mystics, part scientists, they have developed new climbing techniques and collected data from the trees they have climbed. Evidently some of the areas they have visited are so inaccessible that they have never been previously visited -- and the author steadfastly refuses to disclose the locations, for fear that recreational climbers will ruin the trees. The story is exciting, fraught with danger, and full of useful information. Recommended"
79,1400064899,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6164581-joe-bolin,3,"I enjoyed The Wild Trees and did find it to be A Story of Passion and Daring. Had the author been able to keep an appropriate distance from his subjects, though, I would've enjoyed it more. Once Preston entered the story--as a writer for The New Yorker magazine--the book became a fawning tribute to Steve Sillett. Up to that point, he had been presented as a flawed scientist whose single-minded passion for trees--and coastal redwoods, in particular--had consumed every other aspect of his life. If you are interested in the life of a redwood forest, this book is well worth reading, however."

It lead me into a world in which the trees are ancient, wise, and have worlds within themselves. It introduced me to the people who explore those worlds and build their lives around them. And it introduced some main characters who change and grow as they learn more and more about the ancient redwoods. I recommend this book to anyone who loves learning about nature, and especially to those who have roots in the Western USA and are familiar with the enormous redwoods and their beauty. "

I loved The Hot Zone, it was so well-written and intense and I thought that Preston would do the same thing for the tree canopy that he did for Ebola. Unfortunately, this turned out to be a combination of the most boring science lecture on biology I've ever sat through and a study of some of the most self-centered, maladjusted people I think I've ever read about. I stopped reading about halfway through--I may have bailed out early--but none of the disparate threads of story ever seemed to come together. "
82,1400064899,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1821855-doris,1,"The technical content was interesting, but the efforts at expanding a magazine article into a book felt obvious.

A great example of scientific narrative non-fiction and one that I know I will come back to again. I didn't want to put it down but also didn't want it to end. A few of my favorite passages:""Botanists make a distinction between the height of a tree and its overall size, which is measured by the amount of wood the tree has in its trunk and limbs. The largest redwoods, which are called redwood giants or titans, are usually not the very tallest ones. In this way, they are rather like people. A football player is often bigger than a basketball player – more massive, that is. The basketball player is taller and more slender. So it is with redwoods."" (pg. 6)""They passed a Carl's Jr. fast-food restaurant, and a lumber mill, and bars and taverns, dark in daylight, where you could get a beer for a dollar and maybe get a fractured skull for nothing."" (pg. 7)""Poe had a passion for botany, too. She often used the scientific names of plants when she talked with the boys. To Poe, the buttercup was Ranunculus. Poe was not particularly fond of Homo sapiens."" (pg. 11)"" A person who is dropping in free fall through space often turns upside down and falls headfirst. This happens because, with most people, the upper half of the body is heavier than the lower half, and so the person tips over and plunges head-downward, like an arrow with a weighted point. In a headfirst landing after a fifty-foot fall, the shock crushed the skull and breaks the neck, destroying the brain and shearing the spinal cord off at the base of the skull. Instant death. No matter which way the victim lands, the impact normally breaks the victim's back, leaving him paralyzed (if he survives). If the person happens to land feetfirst, a shockwave travels up the legs, breaking them in many places, shattering the lower spine, and cutting the spinal cord. The lungs can collapse from the force of the impact, or they can be punctured by broken ribs, and the flattened or torn lungs can fill up with blood, causing the victim to drown in his blood. Major internal organs, including the liver, the kidneys, the spleen, and the bladder, as well as the aorta, can burst during the impact. If they split apart, they flood the body cavity with blood – catastrophic internal hemorrhage."" (pg. 15)""The branch on the big redwood looked delicate. Steve couldn't really tell if it was strong enough to support his weight. The lowest branches on the truck of a redwood are called epicormic branches. Epicormic branches occur on many kinds of trees. They often arise out in fan-shaped sprays called epi sprays. In redwoods, these branches are not solidly attached to the trunk, and can easily break or fall off the tree. Steve Sillett didn't know what an epicormic branch was."" (pg. 16)""As a redwood enters middle age, it typically loses its leader. Its top spire dies back. I suppose this is a little like a man going bald. The top spire turns into a bleached skeleton, and it falls off the tree. The bark of a redwood is usually a reddish-brown color, but as some redwoods get old their bark can turn stony gray. Even when its top falls off and its bark turns gray, a redwood is still growing and, in fact, may have hardly begun to grow. In this respect, it is not like a person at all.""

A ""wild tree"" is a tree that has never been climbed by anyone else, and these folks existence is justified by finding such wild trees.But these are folks obsessed with finding, and then climbing, the tallest living things - the Coastal Redwoods. Most of these giants are located in highly inaccessible places - sadly, one of the main reasons why they haven't been logged already - and the (mostly) men who look for them, , find them, climb them, and map them (!) are unlike most of us. They spend most of their free time alone, in harsh, isolated, and unforgiving spaces. Preston, like author John McPhee, tells us the personal stories of these people in order to heighten our appreciation of the the trees with which their lives are intertwined.These people are pioneers in the development of methods of climbing trees that do no damage to the trees, as well as methods of mapping their canopies. Most of us who remain on the ground view these trees as massive trunks with lower branches that can be seen sprouting from the main trunks of the trees at the height of a twelve-story building, or higher. So it comes as a revelation to discover how verdant and thick the canopies of the Coastal Redwoods actually are. We are told that the canopy of one tall tree was so thick that people wearing snowshoes could literally walk around on top of it, throwing Frisbees. We learn that these canopies are diverse ecosystems of their own - with berry bushes, ferns, and even other trees rooted in soil (often TONS of soil) that form and accumulate in the spacious crotches of ""branches"" (often with a diameter larger than the trunks of most eastern hardwoods) hundreds of feet above the ground. Like the new worlds that were discovered when Jacques Cousteau developed the suits that enabled exploration of the sea, the tools and methods developed by the climbers of these tall trees allowed them to discover a world which had up until then remained completely unknown and uncharted. If you are interested in learning about this world and those who have taken the time to discover it for us, read this book. If you love the mystery of trees, read this book. If you want a new perspective of the beauty and mystery of the diversity of life, read this book.Read this book!"

The problem is that at times each of the botanists, scientists, etc..., including himself, climb trees ""recreationally."" He brings up the ethical issue of climbing, but never pursues it. Taking his teenagers on a trip to Scotland to climb the oldest and tallest grove in the country seems to present no ethical dilemma. Similarly, one of the main characters in the book, a botanist, does not seem to have any qualms about climbing the tallest and oldest trees in Australia recreationally.

100,1400064899,http://goodreads.com/user/show/363289-patty,4,"Richard Preston is a science writer with a gift for turning complex biology into riveting page-turners. In The Wild Trees, he describes old-growth forests, mostly redwoods, that have managed to evade the timber industry's blades and still live along the coast of northern California. Preston assures us that, amazingly, until the past two decades the ecosystem formed by the intertwining limbs of these ancient, gargantuan living things had never really been studied. Preston introduces us to several researchers, most prominently botanist Stephen C. Sillett, who are probing the mysteries of the skyscraper-high forest canopy. In addition to Sillett, there's Michael Taylor, a millionaire's son and speed-chess champion who is afraid of heights but downsizes his life to work as a grocery clerk while he searches for the world's tallest tree, and Marie Antoine, who became a scholar of lichens. Eventually, Preston, who took up tree-climbing as a respite from writing, joins them up in the treetops.My husband read this book years ago and told me many of the incredible incidents. We always planned on visiting the Calif. Redwoods and finally did it. Of course we had to listen to the Wild Trees on CD while driving up Hwy. 1 and going through the towns and groves of trees where you will find the tallest of the tall trees. It was neck-aching to look up at these trees as Michael Taylor must have done to estimate the height of the trees and incredible to know that professionals climbed to the tip top of these trees to measure them precisely and study the diversity in the canopy. I could imagine them swaying in their beds as the breeze came up and could not imagine how one researcher fell and lived to climb them again. I love it when a non-fiction book reads like a fiction thriller. A must read."

The Wild Trees: A Story of Passion and Daring is a narrative nonfiction account of researchers who climb to the tops of the largest living organisms on the planet, the giant redwoods. Or perhaps it's the tale of people so obsessed with climbing these trees that they became researchers; I'm not quite certain which it is. Richard Preston starts with an electric account of a first climb up one of these giant trees, replete with white-knuckled fear, a foolhardy leap of faith, and an encounter with hornets.Had the whole book kept pace with that searing opening, this would have been a fantastic read. As it was, the book soon went off on the tawdry doings of its cast, who were largely so blinded by their obsession with trees that everything else was discarded in their lives. Their exploits, successes, and failures at climbing would have been much better than the neglects of their social lives.I also would have enjoyed this book much more had it focused on the trees, especially what they found in them and what it felt like to climb up one. Too much of the text was taken up with the quest for the tallest redwood, seemingly replacing knowledge and science with a world record quest. Some pictures would have been a valuable addition as well!I certainly enjoyed and learned from The Wild Trees, but it could have been so much more."
102,1400064899,http://goodreads.com/user/show/82840-laura,4,"I had never imagined that there are people whose lifelong passion is to study and climb redwood trees.... specifically Titan redwoods which are the world's longest (and some of the oldest) trees measuring in at a minimum height of 360 feet. I fell in love with redwoods and tree climbing through this book, and I thoroughly enjoyed learning about something that I knew nothing about and that I found fascinating. That said, the material is fantastic, and had it been in the hands of a skillful writer, the book would have been absolutely exquisite.... something legendary. Preston's writing is so bad, it's actually funny.... and encouraging for anyone who thinks that maybe their own writing isn't so great. His portrayal of the botanists and climbers involved in these tree escapades is flat. The quotes that he uses add nothing to the substance and sound like quotes that a 4th grader might coax out of an unwilling interviewee. His sentence structure is dull and full of too many linking verbs.All in all, I loved the topic and found the story of these trees and the lives of those who study them to be compelling. Maybe I will give this book to my students and make them rewrite it as an exercise in descriptive writing?"
103,1400064899,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2294085-david,4,"I'll admit, I had my reservations when deciding on this -- a book about trees. Much to my delighted surprise, my fears were laid to rest as the vivid, delicate writing of Richard Preston weaved a compelling story, for why trees should be much heralded.The book follows a series of amateur and professional arborists/botanists on their journey of discovering the world's largest trees. Along the way, many of the stories become intertwined as the protagonists meet one another and cross paths, sharing stories and, together, uncovering the lush bio-systems of the tree canopies. Add to the mix harrowing accounts of death and near-death, romance, and the author's own introduction to tree climbing, the book becomes more than just a story about trees; it's a story of the precarious balance of life on Earth.By the end, the book both piqued my interest in visiting the Redwood trees of the Pacific Northwest, and imbued in me a strong sense of wanting to protect these ancient living organisms."
104,1400064899,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6936459-gabrielle-lawrence,5,"Great book about the noble Redwoods and a few interesting people who study them, and end up becoming quite emotionally attached to the trees.There's some science, too! I loved learning about all the incredible biology. On the tops of these trees, the climbers discover ""gardens of ferns, fruiting huckleberries, flowering rhododendrons, fully grown bay laurels. Miniature salamanders live in water captured by the giant ferns, as do tiny crustaceans. Preston describes a 60-foot wide platform of branches in the broken-off top of a tree named Kronos, with 22 auxiliary redwood trunks 80 to 100 feet tall and a yard and a half across at their bases."" Incredible. Preston describes scenes with such clarity I could pretend I was standing in the forest, breathing in that smell so specific to the Redwoods. There is also a very quiet and sweet love story that weaves thru this book, but overall is was the descriptions of climbing and living in trees over 350 feet tall that held me. Made me thankful to have lived in Humboldt county."
105,1400064899,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7617066-jenny-gb,4,"This book was so refreshing after reading Preston's other books about horrible diseases and the descriptions in there that make your skin crawl. Instead, this was a story about a strange group of people who really love the largest and tallest trees in the world (including himself). As someone who has never climbed a tree, this made me curious to try it if I could cure my fear of heights. The stories about the people were sometimes interesting and sometimes annoying, but I appreciated knowing more about the few people in the world studying and climbing these trees. A lot of the descriptions of tree biology and climbing techniques went a bit above my head. I tried my best to understand them, but unfortunately it's way outside of my realm of knowledge. I think more pictures of both trees and climbing would have helped, although I know the trees and the climbing techniques are secret to help preserve these trees. Reading this book was usually a peaceful experience of thinking about huge trees and ancient forests. I hope Preston write more books like this in the future."

I was so excited to begin this book, knowing it was about an incredible world of life that exists in the treetops that we know so little about. But the writing is really terrible. Poor flow, and too much detail about things that have nothing to do with the implied focus and subject matter of the text. I don't care if the scientist has a pimple on his knee and eats Fruit Loops every other day for breakfast... This sort of detail really bogged down the writing. I don't like giving bad reviews, but considering what the writer had to work with, the incredible skill and courage it takes to climb these giants, the captivating biological activity that occurs in the upper reaches of these magnificent trees, I was entirely letdown with how he put together and presented the information. No matter how alluring the subject is, I just can't stay interested when the writing is so heavy and inelegant. "

And anyone interested in nature, trees, ecology, redwoods, natural history, and so on. It totally reads like a thriller; Preston makes you deeply invested in the real people whose lives populate this book. I came away having learned about the search for the tallest and biggest redwoods, as well as the general ecology of forests and redwood forests in particular, yet never once felt like I was being tasked with a chore. I've had the unbelievable honor to be able to meet some of the amazing hidden giants talked about in this book--like Illuvatar, Isaac Newton, and others--and that only made subsequent readings that much better. One of my all-time favorite books involving nature/natural history!"
108,1400064899,http://goodreads.com/user/show/733624-al,4," This book follows the lives and adventures of a number of young adventurers who have sought out and climbed the highest giant redwoods in California. Part daredevils, part mystics, part scientists, they have developed new climbing techniques and collected data from the trees they have climbed. Evidently some of the areas they have visited are so inaccessible that they have never been previously visited -- and the author steadfastly refuses to disclose the locations, for fear that recreational climbers will ruin the trees. The story is exciting, fraught with danger, and full of useful information. Recommended"

Had the author been able to keep an appropriate distance from his subjects, though, I would've enjoyed it more. Once Preston entered the story--as a writer for The New Yorker magazine--the book became a fawning tribute to Steve Sillett. Up to that point, he had been presented as a flawed scientist whose single-minded passion for trees--and coastal redwoods, in particular--had consumed every other aspect of his life. If you are interested in the life of a redwood forest, this book is well worth reading, however."

It lead me into a world in which the trees are ancient, wise, and have worlds within themselves. It introduced me to the people who explore those worlds and build their lives around them. And it introduced some main characters who change and grow as they learn more and more about the ancient redwoods. I recommend this book to anyone who loves learning about nature, and especially to those who have roots in the Western USA and are familiar with the enormous redwoods and their beauty. "

I loved The Hot Zone, it was so well-written and intense and I thought that Preston would do the same thing for the tree canopy that he did for Ebola. Unfortunately, this turned out to be a combination of the most boring science lecture on biology I've ever sat through and a study of some of the most self-centered, maladjusted people I think I've ever read about. I stopped reading about halfway through--I may have bailed out early--but none of the disparate threads of story ever seemed to come together. "
112,1400064899,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1821855-doris,1,"The technical content was interesting, but the efforts at expanding a magazine article into a book felt obvious. The author's attempts at fleshing out the parade of climbers were awkward and stilted, and the prose became somewhat Victorian in tone when he was dealing with romantic relationships.

Only a small (?) batch of them survive the loggers. These have never been explored. Their tree tops are 20-30 stories in the air and the trees have multiple tree trunks. It is possible to get lost in them! They are one of the rare places on earth that has yet to be really explored. This book tells about some of the pioneer climbers that have made it into their branches. 
115,1400064899,http://goodreads.com/user/show/10289957-audrey,3,"A moderately interesting read about scientists and others who study the canopies of the biggest trees in the world. Told as a story, you also get a look at the (sometimes dysfunctional) private lives of the people involved in these discoveries. These trees are more like coral reef ecosystems than anything else because of the incredible diversity of life found in them. If you have a fear of heights, this book will probably make your hair stand on end."

A great example of scientific narrative non-fiction and one that I know I will come back to again. I didn't want to put it down but also didn't want it to end. A few of my favorite passages:""Botanists make a distinction between the height of a tree and its overall size, which is measured by the amount of wood the tree has in its trunk and limbs. The largest redwoods, which are called redwood giants or titans, are usually not the very tallest ones. In this way, they are rather like people. A football player is often bigger than a basketball player – more massive, that is. The basketball player is taller and more slender. So it is with redwoods."" (pg. 6)""They passed a Carl's Jr. fast-food restaurant, and a lumber mill, and bars and taverns, dark in daylight, where you could get a beer for a dollar and maybe get a fractured skull for nothing."" (pg. 7)""Poe had a passion for botany, too. She often used the scientific names of plants when she talked with the boys. To Poe, the buttercup was Ranunculus. Poe was not particularly fond of Homo sapiens."" (pg. 11)"" A person who is dropping in free fall through space often turns upside down and falls headfirst. This happens because, with most people, the upper half of the body is heavier than the lower half, and so the person tips over and plunges head-downward, like an arrow with a weighted point. In a headfirst landing after a fifty-foot fall, the shock crushed the skull and breaks the neck, destroying the brain and shearing the spinal cord off at the base of the skull. Instant death. No matter which way the victim lands, the impact normally breaks the victim's back, leaving him paralyzed (if he survives). If the person happens to land feetfirst, a shockwave travels up the legs, breaking them in many places, shattering the lower spine, and cutting the spinal cord. The lungs can collapse from the force of the impact, or they can be punctured by broken ribs, and the flattened or torn lungs can fill up with blood, causing the victim to drown in his blood. Major internal organs, including the liver, the kidneys, the spleen, and the bladder, as well as the aorta, can burst during the impact. If they split apart, they flood the body cavity with blood – catastrophic internal hemorrhage."" (pg. 15)""The branch on the big redwood looked delicate. Steve couldn't really tell if it was strong enough to support his weight. The lowest branches on the truck of a redwood are called epicormic branches. Epicormic branches occur on many kinds of trees. They often arise out in fan-shaped sprays called epi sprays. In redwoods, these branches are not solidly attached to the trunk, and can easily break or fall off the tree. Steve Sillett didn't know what an epicormic branch was."" (pg. 16)""As a redwood enters middle age, it typically loses its leader. Its top spire dies back. I suppose this is a little like a man going bald. The top spire turns into a bleached skeleton, and it falls off the tree. The bark of a redwood is usually a reddish-brown color, but as some redwoods get old their bark can turn stony gray. Even when its top falls off and its bark turns gray, a redwood is still growing and, in fact, may have hardly begun to grow. In this respect, it is not like a person at all."" (pg. 20)""In a lichen, the fungus part of the organism is like a landlord who builds a house, and the alga or cyanobacterium is the tenant, who pays rent to the landlord. The landlord uses the rent to build a larger house for more tenants."" (pg. 24)""At the time that Steve Sillett and Marwood Harris made the first ascent of Nameless, there was a general belief among biologists that the redwood forest canopy was what they called a redwood desert. That is, the redwood canopy was believed to be essentially empty of life other than the branches of redwood trees. In any case, biologists regarded coast redwoods as unreachable towers, remote and bare. Steve Sillett encountered something quite different. He found what amounted to coral reefs in the air."" (pg. 25)""The air was heavy with the sharp smell of California bay laurel trees, which grew around the ankles of the redwoods."" (pg. 41)""It was much darker in the Douglas-fir canopy than it was in the fields and meadows around the stand of trees. Hillery thought that it was adult dark but not kid dark. Adult dark is when the adults tell you that you have to stop throwing the ball around and come indoors. Kid dark is so dark that you can't see the ball anymore, and you have to stop plating."" (pg. 105)""The coast redwood is a so-called relict species. It is a tiny remnant population of a life form that once spread in splendor and power across the face of nature. The redwood has settled down in California to live near the sea, the way many retired people do."" (pg. 218)"

I felt that the sections that succeeded best were those in which the author describes his own experiences and observations while climbing in trees.

We are better off knowing only that they exist and are properly explored and defined. God forbid the tree climbing enthusiasts feel compelled to ""bag"" these these trees so they can brag about it over a couple of IPA's in some north coast tavern.

In The Wild Trees, he describes old-growth forests, mostly redwoods, that have managed to evade the timber industry's blades and still live along the coast of northern California. Preston assures us that, amazingly, until the past two decades the ecosystem formed by the intertwining limbs of these ancient, gargantuan living things had never really been studied. Preston introduces us to several researchers, most prominently botanist Stephen C. Sillett, who are probing the mysteries of the skyscraper-high forest canopy. In addition to Sillett, there's Michael Taylor, a millionaire's son and speed-chess champion who is afraid of heights but downsizes his life to work as a grocery clerk while he searches for the world's tallest tree, and Marie Antoine, who became a scholar of lichens. Eventually, Preston, who took up tree-climbing as a respite from writing, joins them up in the treetops.My husband read this book years ago and told me many of the incredible incidents. We always planned on visiting the Calif. Redwoods and finally did it. Of course we had to listen to the Wild Trees on CD while driving up Hwy. 1 and going through the towns and groves of trees where you will find the tallest of the tall trees. It was neck-aching to look up at these trees as Michael Taylor must have done to estimate the height of the trees and incredible to know that professionals climbed to the tip top of these trees to measure them precisely and study the diversity in the canopy. I could imagine them swaying in their beds as the breeze came up and could not imagine how one researcher fell and lived to climb them again. I love it when a non-fiction book reads like a fiction thriller. A must read."

The Wild Trees: A Story of Passion and Daring is a narrative nonfiction account of researchers who climb to the tops of the largest living organisms on the planet, the giant redwoods. Or perhaps it's the tale of people so obsessed with climbing these trees that they became researchers; I'm not quite certain which it is. Richard Preston starts with an electric account of a first climb up one of these giant trees, replete with white-knuckled fear, a foolhardy leap of faith, and an encounter with hornets.Had the whole book kept pace with that searing opening, this would have been a fantastic read. As it was, the book soon went off on the tawdry doings of its cast, who were largely so blinded by their obsession with trees that everything else was discarded in their lives. Their exploits, successes, and failures at climbing would have been much better than the neglects of their social lives.I also would have enjoyed this book much more had it focused on the trees, especially what they found in them and what it felt like to climb up one. Too much of the text was taken up with the quest for the tallest redwood, seemingly replacing knowledge and science with a world record quest.

Much to my delighted surprise, my fears were laid to rest as the vivid, delicate writing of Richard Preston weaved a compelling story, for why trees should be much heralded.The book follows a series of amateur and professional arborists/botanists on their journey of discovering the world's largest trees. Along the way, many of the stories become intertwined as the protagonists meet one another and cross paths, sharing stories and, together, uncovering the lush bio-systems of the tree canopies. Add to the mix harrowing accounts of death and near-death, romance, and the author's own introduction to tree climbing, the book becomes more than just a story about trees; it's a story of the precarious balance of life on Earth.By the end, the book both piqued my interest in visiting the Redwood trees of the Pacific Northwest, and imbued in me a strong sense of wanting to protect these ancient living organisms."

I loved learning about all the incredible biology. On the tops of these trees, the climbers discover ""gardens of ferns, fruiting huckleberries, flowering rhododendrons, fully grown bay laurels. Miniature salamanders live in water captured by the giant ferns, as do tiny crustaceans. Preston describes a 60-foot wide platform of branches in the broken-off top of a tree named Kronos, with 22 auxiliary redwood trunks 80 to 100 feet tall and a yard and a half across at their bases."" Incredible. Preston describes scenes with such clarity I could pretend I was standing in the forest, breathing in that smell so specific to the Redwoods. There is also a very quiet and sweet love story that weaves thru this book, but overall is was the descriptions of climbing and living in trees over 350 feet tall that held me. Made me thankful to have lived in Humboldt county."
135,1400064899,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7617066-jenny-gb,4,"This book was so refreshing after reading Preston's other books about horrible diseases and the descriptions in there that make your skin crawl. Instead, this was a story about a strange group of people who really love the largest and tallest trees in the world (including himself). As someone who has never climbed a tree, this made me curious to try it if I could cure my fear of heights. The stories about the people were sometimes interesting and sometimes annoying, but I appreciated knowing more about the few people in the world studying and climbing these trees. A lot of the descriptions of tree biology and climbing techniques went a bit above my head. I tried my best to understand them, but unfortunately it's way outside of my realm of knowledge. I think more pictures of both trees and climbing would have helped, although I know the trees and the climbing techniques are secret to help preserve these trees. Reading this book was usually a peaceful experience of thinking about huge trees and ancient forests. I hope Preston write more books like this in the future."
136,1400064899,http://goodreads.com/user/show/398118-rich-flammer,1,"Fascinating topic... I was so excited to begin this book, knowing it was about an incredible world of life that exists in the treetops that we know so little about. But the writing is really terrible. Poor flow, and too much detail about things that have nothing to do with the implied focus and subject matter of the text. I don't care if the scientist has a pimple on his knee and eats Fruit Loops every other day for breakfast... This sort of detail really bogged down the writing. I don't like giving bad reviews, but considering what the writer had to work with, the incredible skill and courage it takes to climb these giants, the captivating biological activity that occurs in the upper reaches of these magnificent trees, I was entirely letdown with how he put together and presented the information. No matter how alluring the subject is, I just can't stay interested when the writing is so heavy and inelegant. "
137,1400064899,http://goodreads.com/user/show/30710811-jan-smitowicz,5,"This book is absolute essential reading for anybody who cares about the natural world, climate change, and all related issues. And anyone interested in nature, trees, ecology, redwoods, natural history, and so on. It totally reads like a thriller; Preston makes you deeply invested in the real people whose lives populate this book. I came away having learned about the search for the tallest and biggest redwoods, as well as the general ecology of forests and redwood forests in particular, yet never once felt like I was being tasked with a chore. I've had the unbelievable honor to be able to meet some of the amazing hidden giants talked about in this book--like Illuvatar, Isaac Newton, and others--and that only made subsequent readings that much better. One of my all-time favorite books involving nature/natural history!"
138,1400064899,http://goodreads.com/user/show/733624-al,4," This book follows the lives and adventures of a number of young adventurers who have sought out and climbed the highest giant redwoods in California. Part daredevils, part mystics, part scientists, they have developed new climbing techniques and collected data from the trees they have climbed. Evidently some of the areas they have visited are so inaccessible that they have never been previously visited -- and the author steadfastly refuses to disclose the locations, for fear that recreational climbers will ruin the trees. The story is exciting, fraught with danger, and full of useful information. Recommended"
139,1400064899,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6164581-joe-bolin,3,"I enjoyed The Wild Trees and did find it to be A Story of Passion and Daring. Had the author been able to keep an appropriate distance from his subjects, though, I would've enjoyed it more. Once Preston entered the story--as a writer for The New Yorker magazine--the book became a fawning tribute to Steve Sillett. Up to that point, he had been presented as a flawed scientist whose single-minded passion for trees--and coastal redwoods, in particular--had consumed every other aspect of his life. If you are interested in the life of a redwood forest, this book is well worth reading, however."
140,1400064899,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7967883-sarah,5,"I listened to this book, which was helpful because I may not have been able to push through if I'd been reading it in print, but it was so beautiful. It lead me into a world in which the trees are ancient, wise, and have worlds within themselves. It introduced me to the people who explore those worlds and build their lives around them. And it introduced some main characters who change and grow as they learn more and more about the ancient redwoods. I recommend this book to anyone who loves learning about nature, and especially to those who have roots in the Western USA and are familiar with the enormous redwoods and their beauty. "

I loved The Hot Zone, it was so well-written and intense and I thought that Preston would do the same thing for the tree canopy that he did for Ebola. Unfortunately, this turned out to be a combination of the most boring science lecture on biology I've ever sat through and a study of some of the most self-centered, maladjusted people I think I've ever read about. I stopped reading about halfway through--I may have bailed out early--but none of the disparate threads of story ever seemed to come together. "
142,1400064899,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1821855-doris,1,"The technical content was interesting, but the efforts at expanding a magazine article into a book felt obvious. The author's attempts at fleshing out the parade of climbers were awkward and stilted, and the prose became somewhat Victorian in tone when he was dealing with romantic relationships.

Only a small (?) batch of them survive the loggers. These have never been explored. Their tree tops are 20-30 stories in the air and the trees have multiple tree trunks. It is possible to get lost in them! They are one of the rare places on earth that has yet to be really explored. This book tells about some of the pioneer climbers that have made it into their branches. 
145,1400064899,http://goodreads.com/user/show/10289957-audrey,3,"A moderately interesting read about scientists and others who study the canopies of the biggest trees in the world. Told as a story, you also get a look at the (sometimes dysfunctional) private lives of the people involved in these discoveries. These trees are more like coral reef ecosystems than anything else because of the incredible diversity of life found in them. If you have a fear of heights, this book will probably make your hair stand on end."

153,1400064899,http://goodreads.com/user/show/22934895-nick-d,5,"I love trees and science and I loved this book. Often the writing was clunky but at other times it was brilliant. A great example of scientific narrative non-fiction and one that I know I will come back to again. I didn't want to put it down but also didn't want it to end. A few of my favorite passages:""Botanists make a distinction between the height of a tree and its overall size, which is measured by the amount of wood the tree has in its trunk and limbs. The largest redwoods, which are called redwood giants or titans, are usually not the very tallest ones. In this way, they are rather like people. A football player is often bigger than a basketball player – more massive, that is. The basketball player is taller and more slender. So it is with redwoods."" (pg. 6)""They passed a Carl's Jr. fast-food restaurant, and a lumber mill, and bars and taverns, dark in daylight, where you could get a beer for a dollar and maybe get a fractured skull for nothing."" (pg. 7)""Poe had a passion for botany, too. She often used the scientific names of plants when she talked with the boys. To Poe, the buttercup was Ranunculus. Poe was not particularly fond of Homo sapiens."" (pg. 11)"" A person who is dropping in free fall through space often turns upside down and falls headfirst. This happens because, with most people, the upper half of the body is heavier than the lower half, and so the person tips over and plunges head-downward, like an arrow with a weighted point. In a headfirst landing after a fifty-foot fall, the shock crushed the skull and breaks the neck, destroying the brain and shearing the spinal cord off at the base of the skull. Instant death. No matter which way the victim lands, the impact normally breaks the victim's back, leaving him paralyzed (if he survives). If the person happens to land feetfirst, a shockwave travels up the legs, breaking them in many places, shattering the lower spine, and cutting the spinal cord. The lungs can collapse from the force of the impact, or they can be punctured by broken ribs, and the flattened or torn lungs can fill up with blood, causing the victim to drown in his blood. Major internal organs, including the liver, the kidneys, the spleen, and the bladder, as well as the aorta, can burst during the impact. If they split apart, they flood the body cavity with blood – catastrophic internal hemorrhage."" (pg. 15)""The branch on the big redwood looked delicate. Steve couldn't really tell if it was strong enough to support his weight. The lowest branches on the truck of a redwood are called epicormic branches. Epicormic branches occur on many kinds of trees. They often arise out in fan-shaped sprays called epi sprays. In redwoods, these branches are not solidly attached to the trunk, and can easily break or fall off the tree. Steve Sillett didn't know what an epicormic branch was."" (pg. 16)""As a redwood enters middle age, it typically loses its leader. Its top spire dies back. I suppose this is a little like a man going bald. The top spire turns into a bleached skeleton, and it falls off the tree. The bark of a redwood is usually a reddish-brown color, but as some redwoods get old their bark can turn stony gray. Even when its top falls off and its bark turns gray, a redwood is still growing and, in fact, may have hardly begun to grow. In this respect, it is not like a person at all."" (pg. 20)""In a lichen, the fungus part of the organism is like a landlord who builds a house, and the alga or cyanobacterium is the tenant, who pays rent to the landlord. The landlord uses the rent to build a larger house for more tenants."" (pg. 24)""At the time that Steve Sillett and Marwood Harris made the first ascent of Nameless, there was a general belief among biologists that the redwood forest canopy was what they called a redwood desert. That is, the redwood canopy was believed to be essentially empty of life other than the branches of redwood trees. In any case, biologists regarded coast redwoods as unreachable towers, remote and bare. Steve Sillett encountered something quite different. He found what amounted to coral reefs in the air."" (pg. 25)""The air was heavy with the sharp smell of California bay laurel trees, which grew around the ankles of the redwoods."" (pg. 41)""It was much darker in the Douglas-fir canopy than it was in the fields and meadows around the stand of trees. Hillery thought that it was adult dark but not kid dark. Adult dark is when the adults tell you that you have to stop throwing the ball around and come indoors. Kid dark is so dark that you can't see the ball anymore, and you have to stop plating."" (pg. 105)""The coast redwood is a so-called relict species. It is a tiny remnant population of a life form that once spread in splendor and power across the face of nature. The redwood has settled down in California to live near the sea, the way many retired people do."" (pg. 218)"
154,1400064899,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2023262-lois,3,"This book was both a biography of the people who pioneered climbing the huge redwoods, and a description of the redwoods themselves and the communities that live in their crowns. I felt that the sections that succeeded best were those in which the author describes his own experiences and observations while climbing in trees. Those passages were very engaging and held my interest; some were lyrical. But the biography part felt very superficial. I never had a sense that I understood the people, yet they were such a large part of the book."

Part novel, part exploration chronicle and part science text, this book really delivers on the passion and science of the tall tree canopy. I loved that there were/are still unknown places on the North American map. I appreciate the necessity of keeping these places secret and unnamed. We are better off knowing only that they exist and are properly explored and defined. God forbid the tree climbing enthusiasts feel compelled to ""bag"" these these trees so they can brag about it over a couple of IPA's in some north coast tavern. These world heritage sites deserve a better a fate. This book provides all the reasons why they should be left alone to exist as they have prior to contact with homo sapiens. Too much of our natural heritage has been lost to history, leave these trees alone. "
157,1400064899,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2127981-steve,5,"This book is a love story. It's a story about a small circle of people (mostly men) who love the world's tallest trees; and it's a story about how - in finding the trees - they find one another. A ""wild tree"" is a tree that has never been climbed by anyone else, and these folks existence is justified by finding such wild trees.But these are folks obsessed with finding, and then climbing, the tallest living things - the Coastal Redwoods. Most of these giants are located in highly inaccessible places - sadly, one of the main reasons why they haven't been logged already - and the (mostly) men who look for them, , find them, climb them, and map them (!) are unlike most of us. They spend most of their free time alone, in harsh, isolated, and unforgiving spaces. Preston, like author John McPhee, tells us the personal stories of these people in order to heighten our appreciation of the the trees with which their lives are intertwined.These people are pioneers in the development of methods of climbing trees that do no damage to the trees, as well as methods of mapping their canopies. Most of us who remain on the ground view these trees as massive trunks with lower branches that can be seen sprouting from the main trunks of the trees at the height of a twelve-story building, or higher. So it comes as a revelation to discover how verdant and thick the canopies of the Coastal Redwoods actually are. We are told that the canopy of one tall tree was so thick that people wearing snowshoes could literally walk around on top of it, throwing Frisbees. We learn that these canopies are diverse ecosystems of their own - with berry bushes, ferns, and even other trees rooted in soil (often TONS of soil) that form and accumulate in the spacious crotches of ""branches"" (often with a diameter larger than the trunks of most eastern hardwoods) hundreds of feet above the ground. Like the new worlds that were discovered when Jacques Cousteau developed the suits that enabled exploration of the sea, the tools and methods developed by the climbers of these tall trees allowed them to discover a world which had up until then remained completely unknown and uncharted. If you are interested in learning about this world and those who have taken the time to discover it for us, read this book. If you love the mystery of trees, read this book. If you want a new perspective of the beauty and mystery of the diversity of life, read this book.Read this book!"

The canopies of the highest trees on earth is one of the truly unexplored frontiers. Because of the originality of the subject and the fact that it introduces you to this world, it deserves three stars. However, this isn't really the story of trees, though you do learn a lot about them. Instead it is the story of people who climb these trees. The problem is, these people really aren't that interesting. The author added tension and suspense where he could and tried to delve into these characters. This would make a fantastic setting for a work of fiction.My main criticism of the book, however, has to do with ethics. I love scuba diving and have confronted a similar issue. The very act of humans exploring and touching the forest canopy (much like coral reefs) inherently means that damage occurs. The author deliberately does not reveal the location of certain redwoods to avoid ""recreational"" treeclimbers discovering and damaging the trees. The problem is that at times each of the botanists, scientists, etc..., including himself, climb trees ""recreationally."" He brings up the ethical issue of climbing, but never pursues it. Taking his teenagers on a trip to Scotland to climb the oldest and tallest grove in the country seems to present no ethical dilemma. Similarly, one of the main characters in the book, a botanist, does not seem to have any qualms about climbing the tallest and oldest trees in Australia recreationally. It seems that if you love and study trees you are inherently immune to the ethical dilemma of wanting to explore that which you want to protect from others. I don't think these people shouldn't be climbing the trees, just that the author should have talked about this tension. "

The stories about the people were sometimes interesting and sometimes annoying, but I appreciated knowing more about the few people in the world studying and climbing these trees. A lot of the descriptions of tree biology and climbing techniques went a bit above my head. I tried my best to understand them, but unfortunately it's way outside of my realm of knowledge.

And anyone interested in nature, trees, ecology, redwoods, natural history, and so on. It totally reads like a thriller; Preston makes you deeply invested in the real people whose lives populate this book. I came away having learned about the search for the tallest and biggest redwoods, as well as the general ecology of forests and redwood forests in particular, yet never once felt like I was being tasked with a chore. I've had the unbelievable honor to be able to meet some of the amazing hidden giants talked about in this book--like Illuvatar, Isaac Newton, and others--and that only made subsequent readings that much better. One of my all-time favorite books involving nature/natural history!"
168,1400064899,http://goodreads.com/user/show/733624-al,4," This book follows the lives and adventures of a number of young adventurers who have sought out and climbed the highest giant redwoods in California. Part daredevils, part mystics, part scientists, they have developed new climbing techniques and collected data from the trees they have climbed. Evidently some of the areas they have visited are so inaccessible that they have never been previously visited -- and the author steadfastly refuses to disclose the locations, for fear that recreational climbers will ruin the trees. The story is exciting, fraught with danger, and full of useful information. Recommended"

Had the author been able to keep an appropriate distance from his subjects, though, I would've enjoyed it more. Once Preston entered the story--as a writer for The New Yorker magazine--the book became a fawning tribute to Steve Sillett. Up to that point, he had been presented as a flawed scientist whose single-minded passion for trees--and coastal redwoods, in particular--had consumed every other aspect of his life. If you are interested in the life of a redwood forest, this book is well worth reading, however."

It lead me into a world in which the trees are ancient, wise, and have worlds within themselves. It introduced me to the people who explore those worlds and build their lives around them. And it introduced some main characters who change and grow as they learn more and more about the ancient redwoods. I recommend this book to anyone who loves learning about nature, and especially to those who have roots in the Western USA and are familiar with the enormous redwoods and their beauty. "

I loved The Hot Zone, it was so well-written and intense and I thought that Preston would do the same thing for the tree canopy that he did for Ebola. Unfortunately, this turned out to be a combination of the most boring science lecture on biology I've ever sat through and a study of some of the most self-centered, maladjusted people I think I've ever read about. I stopped reading about halfway through--I may have bailed out early--but none of the disparate threads of story ever seemed to come together. "

It is possible to get lost in them! They are one of the rare places on earth that has yet to be really explored. This book tells about some of the pioneer climbers that have made it into their branches.

A great example of scientific narrative non-fiction and one that I know I will come back to again. I didn't want to put it down but also didn't want it to end. A few of my favorite passages:""Botanists make a distinction between the height of a tree and its overall size, which is measured by the amount of wood the tree has in its trunk and limbs. The largest redwoods, which are called redwood giants or titans, are usually not the very tallest ones. In this way, they are rather like people. A football player is often bigger than a basketball player – more massive, that is. The basketball player is taller and more slender. So it is with redwoods."" (pg. 6)""They passed a Carl's Jr. fast-food restaurant, and a lumber mill, and bars and taverns, dark in daylight, where you could get a beer for a dollar and maybe get a fractured skull for nothing."" (pg. 7)""Poe had a passion for botany, too. She often used the scientific names of plants when she talked with the boys. To Poe, the buttercup was Ranunculus. Poe was not particularly fond of Homo sapiens."" (pg. 11)"" A person who is dropping in free fall through space often turns upside down and falls headfirst. This happens because, with most people, the upper half of the body is heavier than the lower half, and so the person tips over and plunges head-downward, like an arrow with a weighted point. In a headfirst landing after a fifty-foot fall, the shock crushed the skull and breaks the neck, destroying the brain and shearing the spinal cord off at the base of the skull. Instant death. No matter which way the victim lands, the impact normally breaks the victim's back, leaving him paralyzed (if he survives). If the person happens to land feetfirst, a shockwave travels up the legs, breaking them in many places, shattering the lower spine, and cutting the spinal cord. The lungs can collapse from the force of the impact, or they can be punctured by broken ribs, and the flattened or torn lungs can fill up with blood, causing the victim to drown in his blood. Major internal organs, including the liver, the kidneys, the spleen, and the bladder, as well as the aorta, can burst during the impact. If they split apart, they flood the body cavity with blood – catastrophic internal hemorrhage."" (pg. 15)""The branch on the big redwood looked delicate. Steve couldn't really tell if it was strong enough to support his weight. The lowest branches on the truck of a redwood are called epicormic branches. Epicormic branches occur on many kinds of trees. They often arise out in fan-shaped sprays called epi sprays. In redwoods, these branches are not solidly attached to the trunk, and can easily break or fall off the tree. Steve Sillett didn't know what an epicormic branch was."" (pg. 16)""As a redwood enters middle age, it typically loses its leader. Its top spire dies back. I suppose this is a little like a man going bald. The top spire turns into a bleached skeleton, and it falls off the tree. The bark of a redwood is usually a reddish-brown color, but as some redwoods get old their bark can turn stony gray. Even when its top falls off and its bark turns gray, a redwood is still growing and, in fact, may have hardly begun to grow. In this respect, it is not like a person at all."" (pg. 20)""In a lichen, the fungus part of the organism is like a landlord who builds a house, and the alga or cyanobacterium is the tenant, who pays rent to the landlord. The landlord uses the rent to build a larger house for more tenants."" (pg. 24)""At the time that Steve Sillett and Marwood Harris made the first ascent of Nameless, there was a general belief among biologists that the redwood forest canopy was what they called a redwood desert. That is, the redwood canopy was believed to be essentially empty of life other than the branches of redwood trees. In any case, biologists regarded coast redwoods as unreachable towers, remote and bare. Steve Sillett encountered something quite different. He found what amounted to coral reefs in the air."" (pg. 25)""The air was heavy with the sharp smell of California bay laurel trees, which grew around the ankles of the redwoods."" (pg. 41)""It was much darker in the Douglas-fir canopy than it was in the fields and meadows around the stand of trees. Hillery thought that it was adult dark but not kid dark. Adult dark is when the adults tell you that you have to stop throwing the ball around and come indoors. Kid dark is so dark that you can't see the ball anymore, and you have to stop plating."" (pg. 105)""The coast redwood is a so-called relict species. It is a tiny remnant population of a life form that once spread in splendor and power across the face of nature. The redwood has settled down in California to live near the sea, the way many retired people do."" (pg. 218)"
184,1400064899,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2023262-lois,3,"This book was both a biography of the people who pioneered climbing the huge redwoods, and a description of the redwoods themselves and the communities that live in their crowns. I felt that the sections that succeeded best were those in which the author describes his own experiences and observations while climbing in trees. Those passages were very engaging and held my interest; some were lyrical. But the biography part felt very superficial. I never had a sense that I understood the people, yet they were such a large part of the book."

Part novel, part exploration chronicle and part science text, this book really delivers on the passion and science of the tall tree canopy. I loved that there were/are still unknown places on the North American map. I appreciate the necessity of keeping these places secret and unnamed. We are better off knowing only that they exist and are properly explored and defined. God forbid the tree climbing enthusiasts feel compelled to ""bag"" these these trees so they can brag about it over a couple of IPA's in some north coast tavern. These world heritage sites deserve a better a fate. This book provides all the reasons why they should be left alone to exist as they have prior to contact with homo sapiens. Too much of our natural heritage has been lost to history, leave these trees alone. "
187,1400064899,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2127981-steve,5,"This book is a love story. It's a story about a small circle of people (mostly men) who love the world's tallest trees; and it's a story about how - in finding the trees - they find one another. A ""wild tree"" is a tree that has never been climbed by anyone else, and these folks existence is justified by finding such wild trees.But these are folks obsessed with finding, and then climbing, the tallest living things - the Coastal Redwoods. Most of these giants are located in highly inaccessible places - sadly, one of the main reasons why they haven't been logged already - and the (mostly) men who look for them, , find them, climb them, and map them (!) are unlike most of us. They spend most of their free time alone, in harsh, isolated, and unforgiving spaces. Preston, like author John McPhee, tells us the personal stories of these people in order to heighten our appreciation of the the trees with which their lives are intertwined.These people are pioneers in the development of methods of climbing trees that do no damage to the trees, as well as methods of mapping their canopies. Most of us who remain on the ground view these trees as massive trunks with lower branches that can be seen sprouting from the main trunks of the trees at the height of a twelve-story building, or higher. So it comes as a revelation to discover how verdant and thick the canopies of the Coastal Redwoods actually are. We are told that the canopy of one tall tree was so thick that people wearing snowshoes could literally walk around on top of it, throwing Frisbees. We learn that these canopies are diverse ecosystems of their own - with berry bushes, ferns, and even other trees rooted in soil (often TONS of soil) that form and accumulate in the spacious crotches of ""branches"" (often with a diameter larger than the trunks of most eastern hardwoods) hundreds of feet above the ground. Like the new worlds that were discovered when Jacques Cousteau developed the suits that enabled exploration of the sea, the tools and methods developed by the climbers of these tall trees allowed them to discover a world which had up until then remained completely unknown and uncharted. If you are interested in learning about this world and those who have taken the time to discover it for us, read this book. If you love the mystery of trees, read this book. If you want a new perspective of the beauty and mystery of the diversity of life, read this book.Read this book!"

189,1400064899,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1189388-karen,3,"I love being introduced to real worlds that I never knew (or thought about) existed. The canopies of the highest trees on earth is one of the truly unexplored frontiers. Because of the originality of the subject and the fact that it introduces you to this world, it deserves three stars. However, this isn't really the story of trees, though you do learn a lot about them. Instead it is the story of people who climb these trees. The problem is, these people really aren't that interesting. The author added tension and suspense where he could and tried to delve into these characters. This would make a fantastic setting for a work of fiction.My main criticism of the book, however, has to do with ethics. I love scuba diving and have confronted a similar issue. The very act of humans exploring and touching the forest canopy (much like coral reefs) inherently means that damage occurs. The author deliberately does not reveal the location of certain redwoods to avoid ""recreational"" treeclimbers discovering and damaging the trees. The problem is that at times each of the botanists, scientists, etc..., including himself, climb trees ""recreationally."" He brings up the ethical issue of climbing, but never pursues it. Taking his teenagers on a trip to Scotland to climb the oldest and tallest grove in the country seems to present no ethical dilemma. Similarly, one of the main characters in the book, a botanist, does not seem to have any qualms about climbing the tallest and oldest trees in Australia recreationally. It seems that if you love and study trees you are inherently immune to the ethical dilemma of wanting to explore that which you want to protect from others. I don't think these people shouldn't be climbing the trees, just that the author should have talked about this tension. "
190,1400064899,http://goodreads.com/user/show/363289-patty,4,"Richard Preston is a science writer with a gift for turning complex biology into riveting page-turners. In The Wild Trees, he describes old-growth forests, mostly redwoods, that have managed to evade the timber industry's blades and still live along the coast of northern California. Preston assures us that, amazingly, until the past two decades the ecosystem formed by the intertwining limbs of these ancient, gargantuan living things had never really been studied. Preston introduces us to several researchers, most prominently botanist Stephen C. Sillett, who are probing the mysteries of the skyscraper-high forest canopy. In addition to Sillett, there's Michael Taylor, a millionaire's son and speed-chess champion who is afraid of heights but downsizes his life to work as a grocery clerk while he searches for the world's tallest tree, and Marie Antoine, who became a scholar of lichens. Eventually, Preston, who took up tree-climbing as a respite from writing, joins them up in the treetops.My husband read this book years ago and told me many of the incredible incidents. We always planned on visiting the Calif. Redwoods and finally did it. Of course we had to listen to the Wild Trees on CD while driving up Hwy. 1 and going through the towns and groves of trees where you will find the tallest of the tall trees. It was neck-aching to look up at these trees as Michael Taylor must have done to estimate the height of the trees and incredible to know that professionals climbed to the tip top of these trees to measure them precisely and study the diversity in the canopy. I could imagine them swaying in their beds as the breeze came up and could not imagine how one researcher fell and lived to climb them again. I love it when a non-fiction book reads like a fiction thriller. A must read."
191,1400064899,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4637681-carl-nelson,3,"3.5 stars. The Wild Trees: A Story of Passion and Daring is a narrative nonfiction account of researchers who climb to the tops of the largest living organisms on the planet, the giant redwoods. Or perhaps it's the tale of people so obsessed with climbing these trees that they became researchers; I'm not quite certain which it is. Richard Preston starts with an electric account of a first climb up one of these giant trees, replete with white-knuckled fear, a foolhardy leap of faith, and an encounter with hornets.Had the whole book kept pace with that searing opening, this would have been a fantastic read. As it was, the book soon went off on the tawdry doings of its cast, who were largely so blinded by their obsession with trees that everything else was discarded in their lives. Their exploits, successes, and failures at climbing would have been much better than the neglects of their social lives.I also would have enjoyed this book much more had it focused on the trees, especially what they found in them and what it felt like to climb up one. Too much of the text was taken up with the quest for the tallest redwood, seemingly replacing knowledge and science with a world record quest. Some pictures would have been a valuable addition as well!I certainly enjoyed and learned from The Wild Trees, but it could have been so much more."

I fell in love with redwoods and tree climbing through this book, and I thoroughly enjoyed learning about something that I knew nothing about and that I found fascinating. That said, the material is fantastic, and had it been in the hands of a skillful writer, the book would have been absolutely exquisite.... something legendary. Preston's writing is so bad, it's actually funny.... and encouraging for anyone who thinks that maybe their own writing isn't so great. His portrayal of the botanists and climbers involved in these tree escapades is flat. The quotes that he uses add nothing to the substance and sound like quotes that a 4th grader might coax out of an unwilling interviewee.

A great example of scientific narrative non-fiction and one that I know I will come back to again. I didn't want to put it down but also didn't want it to end. A few of my favorite passages:""Botanists make a distinction between the height of a tree and its overall size, which is measured by the amount of wood the tree has in its trunk and limbs. The largest redwoods, which are called redwood giants or titans, are usually not the very tallest ones. In this way, they are rather like people. A football player is often bigger than a basketball player – more massive, that is. The basketball player is taller and more slender. So it is with redwoods."" (pg. 6)""They passed a Carl's Jr. fast-food restaurant, and a lumber mill, and bars and taverns, dark in daylight, where you could get a beer for a dollar and maybe get a fractured skull for nothing."" (pg. 7)""Poe had a passion for botany, too. She often used the scientific names of plants when she talked with the boys. To Poe, the buttercup was Ranunculus. Poe was not particularly fond of Homo sapiens."" (pg. 11)"" A person who is dropping in free fall through space often turns upside down and falls headfirst. This happens because, with most people, the upper half of the body is heavier than the lower half, and so the person tips over and plunges head-downward, like an arrow with a weighted point. In a headfirst landing after a fifty-foot fall, the shock crushed the skull and breaks the neck, destroying the brain and shearing the spinal cord off at the base of the skull. Instant death. No matter which way the victim lands, the impact normally breaks the victim's back, leaving him paralyzed (if he survives). If the person happens to land feetfirst, a shockwave travels up the legs, breaking them in many places, shattering the lower spine, and cutting the spinal cord. The lungs can collapse from the force of the impact, or they can be punctured by broken ribs, and the flattened or torn lungs can fill up with blood, causing the victim to drown in his blood. Major internal organs, including the liver, the kidneys, the spleen, and the bladder, as well as the aorta, can burst during the impact. If they split apart, they flood the body cavity with blood – catastrophic internal hemorrhage."" (pg. 15)""The branch on the big redwood looked delicate. Steve couldn't really tell if it was strong enough to support his weight. The lowest branches on the truck of a redwood are called epicormic branches. Epicormic branches occur on many kinds of trees. They often arise out in fan-shaped sprays called epi sprays. In redwoods, these branches are not solidly attached to the trunk, and can easily break or fall off the tree. Steve Sillett didn't know what an epicormic branch was."" (pg. 16)""As a redwood enters middle age, it typically loses its leader. Its top spire dies back. I suppose this is a little like a man going bald. The top spire turns into a bleached skeleton, and it falls off the tree. The bark of a redwood is usually a reddish-brown color, but as some redwoods get old their bark can turn stony gray. Even when its top falls off and its bark turns gray, a redwood is still growing and, in fact, may have hardly begun to grow. In this respect, it is not like a person at all."" (pg. 20)""In a lichen, the fungus part of the organism is like a landlord who builds a house, and the alga or cyanobacterium is the tenant, who pays rent to the landlord. The landlord uses the rent to build a larger house for more tenants."" (pg. 24)""At the time that Steve Sillett and Marwood Harris made the first ascent of Nameless, there was a general belief among biologists that the redwood forest canopy was what they called a redwood desert. That is, the redwood canopy was believed to be essentially empty of life other than the branches of redwood trees. In any case, biologists regarded coast redwoods as unreachable towers, remote and bare. Steve Sillett encountered something quite different. He found what amounted to coral reefs in the air."" (pg. 25)""The air was heavy with the sharp smell of California bay laurel trees, which grew around the ankles of the redwoods."" (pg. 41)""It was much darker in the Douglas-fir canopy than it was in the fields and meadows around the stand of trees. Hillery thought that it was adult dark but not kid dark. Adult dark is when the adults tell you that you have to stop throwing the ball around and come indoors. Kid dark is so dark that you can't see the ball anymore, and you have to stop plating."" (pg. 105)""The coast redwood is a so-called relict species. It is a tiny remnant population of a life form that once spread in splendor and power across the face of nature. The redwood has settled down in California to live near the sea, the way many retired people do."" (pg. 218)"
214,1400064899,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2023262-lois,3,"This book was both a biography of the people who pioneered climbing the huge redwoods, and a description of the redwoods themselves and the communities that live in their crowns. I felt that the sections that succeeded best were those in which the author describes his own experiences and observations while climbing in trees. Those passages were very engaging and held my interest; some were lyrical. But the biography part felt very superficial. I never had a sense that I understood the people, yet they were such a large part of the book."

216,1400064899,http://goodreads.com/user/show/8179963-john,5,"What an excellent and exciting book! Part novel, part exploration chronicle and part science text, this book really delivers on the passion and science of the tall tree canopy. I loved that there were/are still unknown places on the North American map. I appreciate the necessity of keeping these places secret and unnamed. We are better off knowing only that they exist and are properly explored and defined. God forbid the tree climbing enthusiasts feel compelled to ""bag"" these these trees so they can brag about it over a couple of IPA's in some north coast tavern. These world heritage sites deserve a better a fate. This book provides all the reasons why they should be left alone to exist as they have prior to contact with homo sapiens. Too much of our natural heritage has been lost to history, leave these trees alone. "
217,1400064899,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2127981-steve,5,"This book is a love story. It's a story about a small circle of people (mostly men) who love the world's tallest trees; and it's a story about how - in finding the trees - they find one another. A ""wild tree"" is a tree that has never been climbed by anyone else, and these folks existence is justified by finding such wild trees.But these are folks obsessed with finding, and then climbing, the tallest living things - the Coastal Redwoods. Most of these giants are located in highly inaccessible places - sadly, one of the main reasons why they haven't been logged already - and the (mostly) men who look for them, , find them, climb them, and map them (!) are unlike most of us. They spend most of their free time alone, in harsh, isolated, and unforgiving spaces. Preston, like author John McPhee, tells us the personal stories of these people in order to heighten our appreciation of the the trees with which their lives are intertwined.These people are pioneers in the development of methods of climbing trees that do no damage to the trees, as well as methods of mapping their canopies. Most of us who remain on the ground view these trees as massive trunks with lower branches that can be seen sprouting from the main trunks of the trees at the height of a twelve-story building, or higher. So it comes as a revelation to discover how verdant and thick the canopies of the Coastal Redwoods actually are. We are told that the canopy of one tall tree was so thick that people wearing snowshoes could literally walk around on top of it, throwing Frisbees. We learn that these canopies are diverse ecosystems of their own - with berry bushes, ferns, and even other trees rooted in soil (often TONS of soil) that form and accumulate in the spacious crotches of ""branches"" (often with a diameter larger than the trunks of most eastern hardwoods) hundreds of feet above the ground. Like the new worlds that were discovered when Jacques Cousteau developed the suits that enabled exploration of the sea, the tools and methods developed by the climbers of these tall trees allowed them to discover a world which had up until then remained completely unknown and uncharted. If you are interested in learning about this world and those who have taken the time to discover it for us, read this book. If you love the mystery of trees, read this book. If you want a new perspective of the beauty and mystery of the diversity of life, read this book.Read this book!"
218,1400064899,http://goodreads.com/user/show/24678224-bob,5,Amazing how trees can grow. 
219,1400064899,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1189388-karen,3,"I love being introduced to real worlds that I never knew (or thought about) existed. The canopies of the highest trees on earth is one of the truly unexplored frontiers. Because of the originality of the subject and the fact that it introduces you to this world, it deserves three stars. However, this isn't really the story of trees, though you do learn a lot about them. Instead it is the story of people who climb these trees. The problem is, these people really aren't that interesting. The author added tension and suspense where he could and tried to delve into these characters. This would make a fantastic setting for a work of fiction.My main criticism of the book, however, has to do with ethics. I love scuba diving and have confronted a similar issue. The very act of humans exploring and touching the forest canopy (much like coral reefs) inherently means that damage occurs. The author deliberately does not reveal the location of certain redwoods to avoid ""recreational"" treeclimbers discovering and damaging the trees. The problem is that at times each of the botanists, scientists, etc..., including himself, climb trees ""recreationally."" He brings up the ethical issue of climbing, but never pursues it. Taking his teenagers on a trip to Scotland to climb the oldest and tallest grove in the country seems to present no ethical dilemma. Similarly, one of the main characters in the book, a botanist, does not seem to have any qualms about climbing the tallest and oldest trees in Australia recreationally. It seems that if you love and study trees you are inherently immune to the ethical dilemma of wanting to explore that which you want to protect from others. I don't think these people shouldn't be climbing the trees, just that the author should have talked about this tension. "
220,1400064899,http://goodreads.com/user/show/363289-patty,4,"Richard Preston is a science writer with a gift for turning complex biology into riveting page-turners. In The Wild Trees, he describes old-growth forests, mostly redwoods, that have managed to evade the timber industry's blades and still live along the coast of northern California. Preston assures us that, amazingly, until the past two decades the ecosystem formed by the intertwining limbs of these ancient, gargantuan living things had never really been studied. Preston introduces us to several researchers, most prominently botanist Stephen C. Sillett, who are probing the mysteries of the skyscraper-high forest canopy. In addition to Sillett, there's Michael Taylor, a millionaire's son and speed-chess champion who is afraid of heights but downsizes his life to work as a grocery clerk while he searches for the world's tallest tree, and Marie Antoine, who became a scholar of lichens. Eventually, Preston, who took up tree-climbing as a respite from writing, joins them up in the treetops.My husband read this book years ago and told me many of the incredible incidents. We always planned on visiting the Calif. Redwoods and finally did it. Of course we had to listen to the Wild Trees on CD while driving up Hwy. 1 and going through the towns and groves of trees where you will find the tallest of the tall trees. It was neck-aching to look up at these trees as Michael Taylor must have done to estimate the height of the trees and incredible to know that professionals climbed to the tip top of these trees to measure them precisely and study the diversity in the canopy. I could imagine them swaying in their beds as the breeze came up and could not imagine how one researcher fell and lived to climb them again. I love it when a non-fiction book reads like a fiction thriller. A must read."
221,1400064899,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4637681-carl-nelson,3,"3.5 stars. The Wild Trees: A Story of Passion and Daring is a narrative nonfiction account of researchers who climb to the tops of the largest living organisms on the planet, the giant redwoods. Or perhaps it's the tale of people so obsessed with climbing these trees that they became researchers; I'm not quite certain which it is. Richard Preston starts with an electric account of a first climb up one of these giant trees, replete with white-knuckled fear, a foolhardy leap of faith, and an encounter with hornets.Had the whole book kept pace with that searing opening, this would have been a fantastic read. As it was, the book soon went off on the tawdry doings of its cast, who were largely so blinded by their obsession with trees that everything else was discarded in their lives. Their exploits, successes, and failures at climbing would have been much better than the neglects of their social lives.I also would have enjoyed this book much more had it focused on the trees, especially what they found in them and what it felt like to climb up one. Too much of the text was taken up with the quest for the tallest redwood, seemingly replacing knowledge and science with a world record quest. Some pictures would have been a valuable addition as well!I certainly enjoyed and learned from The Wild Trees, but it could have been so much more."
222,1400064899,http://goodreads.com/user/show/82840-laura,4,"I had never imagined that there are people whose lifelong passion is to study and climb redwood trees.... specifically Titan redwoods which are the world's longest (and some of the oldest) trees measuring in at a minimum height of 360 feet. I fell in love with redwoods and tree climbing through this book, and I thoroughly enjoyed learning about something that I knew nothing about and that I found fascinating. That said, the material is fantastic, and had it been in the hands of a skillful writer, the book would have been absolutely exquisite.... something legendary. Preston's writing is so bad, it's actually funny.... and encouraging for anyone who thinks that maybe their own writing isn't so great. His portrayal of the botanists and climbers involved in these tree escapades is flat. The quotes that he uses add nothing to the substance and sound like quotes that a 4th grader might coax out of an unwilling interviewee. His sentence structure is dull and full of too many linking verbs.All in all, I loved the topic and found the story of these trees and the lives of those who study them to be compelling. Maybe I will give this book to my students and make them rewrite it as an exercise in descriptive writing?"
223,1400064899,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2294085-david,4,"I'll admit, I had my reservations when deciding on this -- a book about trees. Much to my delighted surprise, my fears were laid to rest as the vivid, delicate writing of Richard Preston weaved a compelling story, for why trees should be much heralded.The book follows a series of amateur and professional arborists/botanists on their journey of discovering the world's largest trees. Along the way, many of the stories become intertwined as the protagonists meet one another and cross paths, sharing stories and, together, uncovering the lush bio-systems of the tree canopies. Add to the mix harrowing accounts of death and near-death, romance, and the author's own introduction to tree climbing, the book becomes more than just a story about trees; it's a story of the precarious balance of life on Earth.By the end, the book both piqued my interest in visiting the Redwood trees of the Pacific Northwest, and imbued in me a strong sense of wanting to protect these ancient living organisms."
224,1400064899,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6936459-gabrielle-lawrence,5,"Great book about the noble Redwoods and a few interesting people who study them, and end up becoming quite emotionally attached to the trees.There's some science, too! I loved learning about all the incredible biology. On the tops of these trees, the climbers discover ""gardens of ferns, fruiting huckleberries, flowering rhododendrons, fully grown bay laurels. Miniature salamanders live in water captured by the giant ferns, as do tiny crustaceans. Preston describes a 60-foot wide platform of branches in the broken-off top of a tree named Kronos, with 22 auxiliary redwood trunks 80 to 100 feet tall and a yard and a half across at their bases."" Incredible. Preston describes scenes with such clarity I could pretend I was standing in the forest, breathing in that smell so specific to the Redwoods. There is also a very quiet and sweet love story that weaves thru this book, but overall is was the descriptions of climbing and living in trees over 350 feet tall that held me. Made me thankful to have lived in Humboldt county."
225,1400064899,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7617066-jenny-gb,4,"This book was so refreshing after reading Preston's other books about horrible diseases and the descriptions in there that make your skin crawl. Instead, this was a story about a strange group of people who really love the largest and tallest trees in the world (including himself). As someone who has never climbed a tree, this made me curious to try it if I could cure my fear of heights. The stories about the people were sometimes interesting and sometimes annoying, but I appreciated knowing more about the few people in the world studying and climbing these trees. A lot of the descriptions of tree biology and climbing techniques went a bit above my head. I tried my best to understand them, but unfortunately it's way outside of my realm of knowledge. I think more pictures of both trees and climbing would have helped, although I know the trees and the climbing techniques are secret to help preserve these trees. Reading this book was usually a peaceful experience of thinking about huge trees and ancient forests. I hope Preston write more books like this in the future."

I was so excited to begin this book, knowing it was about an incredible world of life that exists in the treetops that we know so little about. But the writing is really terrible. Poor flow, and too much detail about things that have nothing to do with the implied focus and subject matter of the text. I don't care if the scientist has a pimple on his knee and eats Fruit Loops every other day for breakfast... This sort of detail really bogged down the writing.

243,1400064899,http://goodreads.com/user/show/22934895-nick-d,5,"I love trees and science and I loved this book. Often the writing was clunky but at other times it was brilliant. A great example of scientific narrative non-fiction and one that I know I will come back to again. I didn't want to put it down but also didn't want it to end. A few of my favorite passages:""Botanists make a distinction between the height of a tree and its overall size, which is measured by the amount of wood the tree has in its trunk and limbs. The largest redwoods, which are called redwood giants or titans, are usually not the very tallest ones. In this way, they are rather like people. A football player is often bigger than a basketball player – more massive, that is. The basketball player is taller and more slender. So it is with redwoods."" (pg. 6)""They passed a Carl's Jr. fast-food restaurant, and a lumber mill, and bars and taverns, dark in daylight, where you could get a beer for a dollar and maybe get a fractured skull for nothing."" (pg. 7)""Poe had a passion for botany, too. She often used the scientific names of plants when she talked with the boys. To Poe, the buttercup was Ranunculus. Poe was not particularly fond of Homo sapiens."" (pg. 11)"" A person who is dropping in free fall through space often turns upside down and falls headfirst. This happens because, with most people, the upper half of the body is heavier than the lower half, and so the person tips over and plunges head-downward, like an arrow with a weighted point. In a headfirst landing after a fifty-foot fall, the shock crushed the skull and breaks the neck, destroying the brain and shearing the spinal cord off at the base of the skull. Instant death. No matter which way the victim lands, the impact normally breaks the victim's back, leaving him paralyzed (if he survives). If the person happens to land feetfirst, a shockwave travels up the legs, breaking them in many places, shattering the lower spine, and cutting the spinal cord. The lungs can collapse from the force of the impact, or they can be punctured by broken ribs, and the flattened or torn lungs can fill up with blood, causing the victim to drown in his blood. Major internal organs, including the liver, the kidneys, the spleen, and the bladder, as well as the aorta, can burst during the impact. If they split apart, they flood the body cavity with blood – catastrophic internal hemorrhage."" (pg. 15)""The branch on the big redwood looked delicate. Steve couldn't really tell if it was strong enough to support his weight. The lowest branches on the truck of a redwood are called epicormic branches. Epicormic branches occur on many kinds of trees. They often arise out in fan-shaped sprays called epi sprays. In redwoods, these branches are not solidly attached to the trunk, and can easily break or fall off the tree. Steve Sillett didn't know what an epicormic branch was."" (pg. 16)""As a redwood enters middle age, it typically loses its leader. Its top spire dies back. I suppose this is a little like a man going bald. The top spire turns into a bleached skeleton, and it falls off the tree. The bark of a redwood is usually a reddish-brown color, but as some redwoods get old their bark can turn stony gray. Even when its top falls off and its bark turns gray, a redwood is still growing and, in fact, may have hardly begun to grow. In this respect, it is not like a person at all."" (pg. 20)""In a lichen, the fungus part of the organism is like a landlord who builds a house, and the alga or cyanobacterium is the tenant, who pays rent to the landlord. The landlord uses the rent to build a larger house for more tenants."" (pg. 24)""At the time that Steve Sillett and Marwood Harris made the first ascent of Nameless, there was a general belief among biologists that the redwood forest canopy was what they called a redwood desert. That is, the redwood canopy was believed to be essentially empty of life other than the branches of redwood trees. In any case, biologists regarded coast redwoods as unreachable towers, remote and bare. Steve Sillett encountered something quite different. He found what amounted to coral reefs in the air."" (pg. 25)""The air was heavy with the sharp smell of California bay laurel trees, which grew around the ankles of the redwoods."" (pg. 41)""It was much darker in the Douglas-fir canopy than it was in the fields and meadows around the stand of trees. Hillery thought that it was adult dark but not kid dark. Adult dark is when the adults tell you that you have to stop throwing the ball around and come indoors. Kid dark is so dark that you can't see the ball anymore, and you have to stop plating."" (pg. 105)""The coast redwood is a so-called relict species. It is a tiny remnant population of a life form that once spread in splendor and power across the face of nature. The redwood has settled down in California to live near the sea, the way many retired people do."" (pg. 218)"
244,1400064899,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2023262-lois,3,"This book was both a biography of the people who pioneered climbing the huge redwoods, and a description of the redwoods themselves and the communities that live in their crowns. I felt that the sections that succeeded best were those in which the author describes his own experiences and observations while climbing in trees. Those passages were very engaging and held my interest; some were lyrical. But the biography part felt very superficial. I never had a sense that I understood the people, yet they were such a large part of the book."

246,1400064899,http://goodreads.com/user/show/8179963-john,5,"What an excellent and exciting book! Part novel, part exploration chronicle and part science text, this book really delivers on the passion and science of the tall tree canopy. I loved that there were/are still unknown places on the North American map. I appreciate the necessity of keeping these places secret and unnamed. We are better off knowing only that they exist and are properly explored and defined. God forbid the tree climbing enthusiasts feel compelled to ""bag"" these these trees so they can brag about it over a couple of IPA's in some north coast tavern. These world heritage sites deserve a better a fate. This book provides all the reasons why they should be left alone to exist as they have prior to contact with homo sapiens. Too much of our natural heritage has been lost to history, leave these trees alone. "
247,1400064899,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2127981-steve,5,"This book is a love story. It's a story about a small circle of people (mostly men) who love the world's tallest trees; and it's a story about how - in finding the trees - they find one another. A ""wild tree"" is a tree that has never been climbed by anyone else, and these folks existence is justified by finding such wild trees.But these are folks obsessed with finding, and then climbing, the tallest living things - the Coastal Redwoods. Most of these giants are located in highly inaccessible places - sadly, one of the main reasons why they haven't been logged already - and the (mostly) men who look for them, , find them, climb them, and map them (!) are unlike most of us. They spend most of their free time alone, in harsh, isolated, and unforgiving spaces. Preston, like author John McPhee, tells us the personal stories of these people in order to heighten our appreciation of the the trees with which their lives are intertwined.These people are pioneers in the development of methods of climbing trees that do no damage to the trees, as well as methods of mapping their canopies. Most of us who remain on the ground view these trees as massive trunks with lower branches that can be seen sprouting from the main trunks of the trees at the height of a twelve-story building, or higher. So it comes as a revelation to discover how verdant and thick the canopies of the Coastal Redwoods actually are. We are told that the canopy of one tall tree was so thick that people wearing snowshoes could literally walk around on top of it, throwing Frisbees. We learn that these canopies are diverse ecosystems of their own - with berry bushes, ferns, and even other trees rooted in soil (often TONS of soil) that form and accumulate in the spacious crotches of ""branches"" (often with a diameter larger than the trunks of most eastern hardwoods) hundreds of feet above the ground. Like the new worlds that were discovered when Jacques Cousteau developed the suits that enabled exploration of the sea, the tools and methods developed by the climbers of these tall trees allowed them to discover a world which had up until then remained completely unknown and uncharted. If you are interested in learning about this world and those who have taken the time to discover it for us, read this book. If you love the mystery of trees, read this book. If you want a new perspective of the beauty and mystery of the diversity of life, read this book.Read this book!"

249,1400064899,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1189388-karen,3,"I love being introduced to real worlds that I never knew (or thought about) existed. The canopies of the highest trees on earth is one of the truly unexplored frontiers. Because of the originality of the subject and the fact that it introduces you to this world, it deserves three stars. However, this isn't really the story of trees, though you do learn a lot about them. Instead it is the story of people who climb these trees. The problem is, these people really aren't that interesting. The author added tension and suspense where he could and tried to delve into these characters. This would make a fantastic setting for a work of fiction.My main criticism of the book, however, has to do with ethics. I love scuba diving and have confronted a similar issue. The very act of humans exploring and touching the forest canopy (much like coral reefs) inherently means that damage occurs. The author deliberately does not reveal the location of certain redwoods to avoid ""recreational"" treeclimbers discovering and damaging the trees. The problem is that at times each of the botanists, scientists, etc..., including himself, climb trees ""recreationally."" He brings up the ethical issue of climbing, but never pursues it. Taking his teenagers on a trip to Scotland to climb the oldest and tallest grove in the country seems to present no ethical dilemma. Similarly, one of the main characters in the book, a botanist, does not seem to have any qualms about climbing the tallest and oldest trees in Australia recreationally. It seems that if you love and study trees you are inherently immune to the ethical dilemma of wanting to explore that which you want to protect from others. I don't think these people shouldn't be climbing the trees, just that the author should have talked about this tension. "
250,1400064899,http://goodreads.com/user/show/363289-patty,4,"Richard Preston is a science writer with a gift for turning complex biology into riveting page-turners. In The Wild Trees, he describes old-growth forests, mostly redwoods, that have managed to evade the timber industry's blades and still live along the coast of northern California. Preston assures us that, amazingly, until the past two decades the ecosystem formed by the intertwining limbs of these ancient, gargantuan living things had never really been studied. Preston introduces us to several researchers, most prominently botanist Stephen C. Sillett, who are probing the mysteries of the skyscraper-high forest canopy. In addition to Sillett, there's Michael Taylor, a millionaire's son and speed-chess champion who is afraid of heights but downsizes his life to work as a grocery clerk while he searches for the world's tallest tree, and Marie Antoine, who became a scholar of lichens. Eventually, Preston, who took up tree-climbing as a respite from writing, joins them up in the treetops.My husband read this book years ago and told me many of the incredible incidents. We always planned on visiting the Calif. Redwoods and finally did it. Of course we had to listen to the Wild Trees on CD while driving up Hwy. 1 and going through the towns and groves of trees where you will find the tallest of the tall trees. It was neck-aching to look up at these trees as Michael Taylor must have done to estimate the height of the trees and incredible to know that professionals climbed to the tip top of these trees to measure them precisely and study the diversity in the canopy. I could imagine them swaying in their beds as the breeze came up and could not imagine how one researcher fell and lived to climb them again. I love it when a non-fiction book reads like a fiction thriller. A must read."
251,1400064899,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4637681-carl-nelson,3,"3.5 stars. The Wild Trees: A Story of Passion and Daring is a narrative nonfiction account of researchers who climb to the tops of the largest living organisms on the planet, the giant redwoods. Or perhaps it's the tale of people so obsessed with climbing these trees that they became researchers; I'm not quite certain which it is. Richard Preston starts with an electric account of a first climb up one of these giant trees, replete with white-knuckled fear, a foolhardy leap of faith, and an encounter with hornets.Had the whole book kept pace with that searing opening, this would have been a fantastic read. As it was, the book soon went off on the tawdry doings of its cast, who were largely so blinded by their obsession with trees that everything else was discarded in their lives. Their exploits, successes, and failures at climbing would have been much better than the neglects of their social lives.I also would have enjoyed this book much more had it focused on the trees, especially what they found in them and what it felt like to climb up one. Too much of the text was taken up with the quest for the tallest redwood, seemingly replacing knowledge and science with a world record quest. Some pictures would have been a valuable addition as well!I certainly enjoyed and learned from The Wild Trees, but it could have been so much more."
252,1400064899,http://goodreads.com/user/show/82840-laura,4,"I had never imagined that there are people whose lifelong passion is to study and climb redwood trees.... specifically Titan redwoods which are the world's longest (and some of the oldest) trees measuring in at a minimum height of 360 feet. I fell in love with redwoods and tree climbing through this book, and I thoroughly enjoyed learning about something that I knew nothing about and that I found fascinating. That said, the material is fantastic, and had it been in the hands of a skillful writer, the book would have been absolutely exquisite.... something legendary. Preston's writing is so bad, it's actually funny.... and encouraging for anyone who thinks that maybe their own writing isn't so great. His portrayal of the botanists and climbers involved in these tree escapades is flat. The quotes that he uses add nothing to the substance and sound like quotes that a 4th grader might coax out of an unwilling interviewee. His sentence structure is dull and full of too many linking verbs.All in all, I loved the topic and found the story of these trees and the lives of those who study them to be compelling. Maybe I will give this book to my students and make them rewrite it as an exercise in descriptive writing?"
253,1400064899,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2294085-david,4,"I'll admit, I had my reservations when deciding on this -- a book about trees. Much to my delighted surprise, my fears were laid to rest as the vivid, delicate writing of Richard Preston weaved a compelling story, for why trees should be much heralded.The book follows a series of amateur and professional arborists/botanists on their journey of discovering the world's largest trees. Along the way, many of the stories become intertwined as the protagonists meet one another and cross paths, sharing stories and, together, uncovering the lush bio-systems of the tree canopies. Add to the mix harrowing accounts of death and near-death, romance, and the author's own introduction to tree climbing, the book becomes more than just a story about trees; it's a story of the precarious balance of life on Earth.By the end, the book both piqued my interest in visiting the Redwood trees of the Pacific Northwest, and imbued in me a strong sense of wanting to protect these ancient living organisms."
254,1400064899,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6936459-gabrielle-lawrence,5,"Great book about the noble Redwoods and a few interesting people who study them, and end up becoming quite emotionally attached to the trees.There's some science, too! I loved learning about all the incredible biology. On the tops of these trees, the climbers discover ""gardens of ferns, fruiting huckleberries, flowering rhododendrons, fully grown bay laurels. Miniature salamanders live in water captured by the giant ferns, as do tiny crustaceans. Preston describes a 60-foot wide platform of branches in the broken-off top of a tree named Kronos, with 22 auxiliary redwood trunks 80 to 100 feet tall and a yard and a half across at their bases."" Incredible. Preston describes scenes with such clarity I could pretend I was standing in the forest, breathing in that smell so specific to the Redwoods. There is also a very quiet and sweet love story that weaves thru this book, but overall is was the descriptions of climbing and living in trees over 350 feet tall that held me. Made me thankful to have lived in Humboldt county."
255,1400064899,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7617066-jenny-gb,4,"This book was so refreshing after reading Preston's other books about horrible diseases and the descriptions in there that make your skin crawl. Instead, this was a story about a strange group of people who really love the largest and tallest trees in the world (including himself). As someone who has never climbed a tree, this made me curious to try it if I could cure my fear of heights. The stories about the people were sometimes interesting and sometimes annoying, but I appreciated knowing more about the few people in the world studying and climbing these trees. A lot of the descriptions of tree biology and climbing techniques went a bit above my head. I tried my best to understand them, but unfortunately it's way outside of my realm of knowledge. I think more pictures of both trees and climbing would have helped, although I know the trees and the climbing techniques are secret to help preserve these trees. Reading this book was usually a peaceful experience of thinking about huge trees and ancient forests. I hope Preston write more books like this in the future."
256,1400064899,http://goodreads.com/user/show/398118-rich-flammer,1,"Fascinating topic... I was so excited to begin this book, knowing it was about an incredible world of life that exists in the treetops that we know so little about. But the writing is really terrible. Poor flow, and too much detail about things that have nothing to do with the implied focus and subject matter of the text. I don't care if the scientist has a pimple on his knee and eats Fruit Loops every other day for breakfast... This sort of detail really bogged down the writing. I don't like giving bad reviews, but considering what the writer had to work with, the incredible skill and courage it takes to climb these giants, the captivating biological activity that occurs in the upper reaches of these magnificent trees, I was entirely letdown with how he put together and presented the information. No matter how alluring the subject is, I just can't stay interested when the writing is so heavy and inelegant. "
257,1400064899,http://goodreads.com/user/show/30710811-jan-smitowicz,5,"This book is absolute essential reading for anybody who cares about the natural world, climate change, and all related issues. And anyone interested in nature, trees, ecology, redwoods, natural history, and so on. It totally reads like a thriller; Preston makes you deeply invested in the real people whose lives populate this book. I came away having learned about the search for the tallest and biggest redwoods, as well as the general ecology of forests and redwood forests in particular, yet never once felt like I was being tasked with a chore. I've had the unbelievable honor to be able to meet some of the amazing hidden giants talked about in this book--like Illuvatar, Isaac Newton, and others--and that only made subsequent readings that much better.

Part daredevils, part mystics, part scientists, they have developed new climbing techniques and collected data from the trees they have climbed. Evidently some of the areas they have visited are so inaccessible that they have never been previously visited -- and the author steadfastly refuses to disclose the locations, for fear that recreational climbers will ruin the trees. The story is exciting, fraught with danger, and full of useful information. Recommended"

Had the author been able to keep an appropriate distance from his subjects, though, I would've enjoyed it more. Once Preston entered the story--as a writer for The New Yorker magazine--the book became a fawning tribute to Steve Sillett. Up to that point, he had been presented as a flawed scientist whose single-minded passion for trees--and coastal redwoods, in particular--had consumed every other aspect of his life. If you are interested in the life of a redwood forest, this book is well worth reading, however."

It lead me into a world in which the trees are ancient, wise, and have worlds within themselves. It introduced me to the people who explore those worlds and build their lives around them. And it introduced some main characters who change and grow as they learn more and more about the ancient redwoods. I recommend this book to anyone who loves learning about nature, and especially to those who have roots in the Western USA and are familiar with the enormous redwoods and their beauty. "

Unfortunately, this turned out to be a combination of the most boring science lecture on biology I've ever sat through and a study of some of the most self-centered, maladjusted people I think I've ever read about.

273,1400064899,http://goodreads.com/user/show/22934895-nick-d,5,"I love trees and science and I loved this book. Often the writing was clunky but at other times it was brilliant. A great example of scientific narrative non-fiction and one that I know I will come back to again. I didn't want to put it down but also didn't want it to end. A few of my favorite passages:""Botanists make a distinction between the height of a tree and its overall size, which is measured by the amount of wood the tree has in its trunk and limbs. The largest redwoods, which are called redwood giants or titans, are usually not the very tallest ones. In this way, they are rather like people. A football player is often bigger than a basketball player – more massive, that is. The basketball player is taller and more slender. So it is with redwoods."" (pg. 6)""They passed a Carl's Jr. fast-food restaurant, and a lumber mill, and bars and taverns, dark in daylight, where you could get a beer for a dollar and maybe get a fractured skull for nothing."" (pg. 7)""Poe had a passion for botany, too. She often used the scientific names of plants when she talked with the boys. To Poe, the buttercup was Ranunculus. Poe was not particularly fond of Homo sapiens."" (pg. 11)"" A person who is dropping in free fall through space often turns upside down and falls headfirst. This happens because, with most people, the upper half of the body is heavier than the lower half, and so the person tips over and plunges head-downward, like an arrow with a weighted point. In a headfirst landing after a fifty-foot fall, the shock crushed the skull and breaks the neck, destroying the brain and shearing the spinal cord off at the base of the skull. Instant death. No matter which way the victim lands, the impact normally breaks the victim's back, leaving him paralyzed (if he survives). If the person happens to land feetfirst, a shockwave travels up the legs, breaking them in many places, shattering the lower spine, and cutting the spinal cord. The lungs can collapse from the force of the impact, or they can be punctured by broken ribs, and the flattened or torn lungs can fill up with blood, causing the victim to drown in his blood. Major internal organs, including the liver, the kidneys, the spleen, and the bladder, as well as the aorta, can burst during the impact. If they split apart, they flood the body cavity with blood – catastrophic internal hemorrhage."" (pg. 15)""The branch on the big redwood looked delicate. Steve couldn't really tell if it was strong enough to support his weight. The lowest branches on the truck of a redwood are called epicormic branches. Epicormic branches occur on many kinds of trees. They often arise out in fan-shaped sprays called epi sprays. In redwoods, these branches are not solidly attached to the trunk, and can easily break or fall off the tree. Steve Sillett didn't know what an epicormic branch was."" (pg. 16)""As a redwood enters middle age, it typically loses its leader. Its top spire dies back. I suppose this is a little like a man going bald. The top spire turns into a bleached skeleton, and it falls off the tree. The bark of a redwood is usually a reddish-brown color, but as some redwoods get old their bark can turn stony gray. Even when its top falls off and its bark turns gray, a redwood is still growing and, in fact, may have hardly begun to grow. In this respect, it is not like a person at all."" (pg. 20)""In a lichen, the fungus part of the organism is like a landlord who builds a house, and the alga or cyanobacterium is the tenant, who pays rent to the landlord. The landlord uses the rent to build a larger house for more tenants."" (pg. 24)""At the time that Steve Sillett and Marwood Harris made the first ascent of Nameless, there was a general belief among biologists that the redwood forest canopy was what they called a redwood desert. That is, the redwood canopy was believed to be essentially empty of life other than the branches of redwood trees. In any case, biologists regarded coast redwoods as unreachable towers, remote and bare. Steve Sillett encountered something quite different. He found what amounted to coral reefs in the air."" (pg. 25)""The air was heavy with the sharp smell of California bay laurel trees, which grew around the ankles of the redwoods."" (pg. 41)""It was much darker in the Douglas-fir canopy than it was in the fields and meadows around the stand of trees. Hillery thought that it was adult dark but not kid dark. Adult dark is when the adults tell you that you have to stop throwing the ball around and come indoors. Kid dark is so dark that you can't see the ball anymore, and you have to stop plating."" (pg. 105)""The coast redwood is a so-called relict species. It is a tiny remnant population of a life form that once spread in splendor and power across the face of nature. The redwood has settled down in California to live near the sea, the way many retired people do."" (pg. 218)"
274,1400064899,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2023262-lois,3,"This book was both a biography of the people who pioneered climbing the huge redwoods, and a description of the redwoods themselves and the communities that live in their crowns. I felt that the sections that succeeded best were those in which the author describes his own experiences and observations while climbing in trees. Those passages were very engaging and held my interest; some were lyrical. But the biography part felt very superficial. I never had a sense that I understood the people, yet they were such a large part of the book."
275,1400064899,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5678733-zully-bartley,4,"As a lover of nature and trees, this was a great read in how people immersed themselves in the discovery, climbing and finding passion in trees. A beautiful and passionate story between humans and trees."
276,1400064899,http://goodreads.com/user/show/8179963-john,5,"What an excellent and exciting book! Part novel, part exploration chronicle and part science text, this book really delivers on the passion and science of the tall tree canopy. I loved that there were/are still unknown places on the North American map. I appreciate the necessity of keeping these places secret and unnamed. We are better off knowing only that they exist and are properly explored and defined. God forbid the tree climbing enthusiasts feel compelled to ""bag"" these these trees so they can brag about it over a couple of IPA's in some north coast tavern. These world heritage sites deserve a better a fate. This book provides all the reasons why they should be left alone to exist as they have prior to contact with homo sapiens. Too much of our natural heritage has been lost to history, leave these trees alone. "
277,1400064899,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2127981-steve,5,"This book is a love story. It's a story about a small circle of people (mostly men) who love the world's tallest trees; and it's a story about how - in finding the trees - they find one another. A ""wild tree"" is a tree that has never been climbed by anyone else, and these folks existence is justified by finding such wild trees.But these are folks obsessed with finding, and then climbing, the tallest living things - the Coastal Redwoods. Most of these giants are located in highly inaccessible places - sadly, one of the main reasons why they haven't been logged already - and the (mostly) men who look for them, , find them, climb them, and map them (!) are unlike most of us. They spend most of their free time alone, in harsh, isolated, and unforgiving spaces. Preston, like author John McPhee, tells us the personal stories of these people in order to heighten our appreciation of the the trees with which their lives are intertwined.These people are pioneers in the development of methods of climbing trees that do no damage to the trees, as well as methods of mapping their canopies. Most of us who remain on the ground view these trees as massive trunks with lower branches that can be seen sprouting from the main trunks of the trees at the height of a twelve-story building, or higher. So it comes as a revelation to discover how verdant and thick the canopies of the Coastal Redwoods actually are. We are told that the canopy of one tall tree was so thick that people wearing snowshoes could literally walk around on top of it, throwing Frisbees. We learn that these canopies are diverse ecosystems of their own - with berry bushes, ferns, and even other trees rooted in soil (often TONS of soil) that form and accumulate in the spacious crotches of ""branches"" (often with a diameter larger than the trunks of most eastern hardwoods) hundreds of feet above the ground. Like the new worlds that were discovered when Jacques Cousteau developed the suits that enabled exploration of the sea, the tools and methods developed by the climbers of these tall trees allowed them to discover a world which had up until then remained completely unknown and uncharted. If you are interested in learning about this world and those who have taken the time to discover it for us, read this book. If you love the mystery of trees, read this book. If you want a new perspective of the beauty and mystery of the diversity of life, read this book.Read this book!"

279,1400064899,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1189388-karen,3,"I love being introduced to real worlds that I never knew (or thought about) existed. The canopies of the highest trees on earth is one of the truly unexplored frontiers. Because of the originality of the subject and the fact that it introduces you to this world, it deserves three stars. However, this isn't really the story of trees, though you do learn a lot about them. Instead it is the story of people who climb these trees. The problem is, these people really aren't that interesting. The author added tension and suspense where he could and tried to delve into these characters. This would make a fantastic setting for a work of fiction.My main criticism of the book, however, has to do with ethics. I love scuba diving and have confronted a similar issue. The very act of humans exploring and touching the forest canopy (much like coral reefs) inherently means that damage occurs. The author deliberately does not reveal the location of certain redwoods to avoid ""recreational"" treeclimbers discovering and damaging the trees. The problem is that at times each of the botanists, scientists, etc..., including himself, climb trees ""recreationally."" He brings up the ethical issue of climbing, but never pursues it. Taking his teenagers on a trip to Scotland to climb the oldest and tallest grove in the country seems to present no ethical dilemma. Similarly, one of the main characters in the book, a botanist, does not seem to have any qualms about climbing the tallest and oldest trees in Australia recreationally. It seems that if you love and study trees you are inherently immune to the ethical dilemma of wanting to explore that which you want to protect from others. I don't think these people shouldn't be climbing the trees, just that the author should have talked about this tension. "
280,1400064899,http://goodreads.com/user/show/363289-patty,4,"Richard Preston is a science writer with a gift for turning complex biology into riveting page-turners. In The Wild Trees, he describes old-growth forests, mostly redwoods, that have managed to evade the timber industry's blades and still live along the coast of northern California. Preston assures us that, amazingly, until the past two decades the ecosystem formed by the intertwining limbs of these ancient, gargantuan living things had never really been studied. Preston introduces us to several researchers, most prominently botanist Stephen C. Sillett, who are probing the mysteries of the skyscraper-high forest canopy. In addition to Sillett, there's Michael Taylor, a millionaire's son and speed-chess champion who is afraid of heights but downsizes his life to work as a grocery clerk while he searches for the world's tallest tree, and Marie Antoine, who became a scholar of lichens. Eventually, Preston, who took up tree-climbing as a respite from writing, joins them up in the treetops.My husband read this book years ago and told me many of the incredible incidents. We always planned on visiting the Calif. Redwoods and finally did it. Of course we had to listen to the Wild Trees on CD while driving up Hwy. 1 and going through the towns and groves of trees where you will find the tallest of the tall trees. It was neck-aching to look up at these trees as Michael Taylor must have done to estimate the height of the trees and incredible to know that professionals climbed to the tip top of these trees to measure them precisely and study the diversity in the canopy. I could imagine them swaying in their beds as the breeze came up and could not imagine how one researcher fell and lived to climb them again. I love it when a non-fiction book reads like a fiction thriller. A must read."
281,1400064899,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4637681-carl-nelson,3,"3.5 stars. The Wild Trees: A Story of Passion and Daring is a narrative nonfiction account of researchers who climb to the tops of the largest living organisms on the planet, the giant redwoods. Or perhaps it's the tale of people so obsessed with climbing these trees that they became researchers; I'm not quite certain which it is. Richard Preston starts with an electric account of a first climb up one of these giant trees, replete with white-knuckled fear, a foolhardy leap of faith, and an encounter with hornets.Had the whole book kept pace with that searing opening, this would have been a fantastic read. As it was, the book soon went off on the tawdry doings of its cast, who were largely so blinded by their obsession with trees that everything else was discarded in their lives. Their exploits, successes, and failures at climbing would have been much better than the neglects of their social lives.I also would have enjoyed this book much more had it focused on the trees, especially what they found in them and what it felt like to climb up one. Too much of the text was taken up with the quest for the tallest redwood, seemingly replacing knowledge and science with a world record quest. Some pictures would have been a valuable addition as well!I certainly enjoyed and learned from The Wild Trees, but it could have been so much more."
282,1400064899,http://goodreads.com/user/show/82840-laura,4,"I had never imagined that there are people whose lifelong passion is to study and climb redwood trees.... specifically Titan redwoods which are the world's longest (and some of the oldest) trees measuring in at a minimum height of 360 feet. I fell in love with redwoods and tree climbing through this book, and I thoroughly enjoyed learning about something that I knew nothing about and that I found fascinating. That said, the material is fantastic, and had it been in the hands of a skillful writer, the book would have been absolutely exquisite.... something legendary. Preston's writing is so bad, it's actually funny.... and encouraging for anyone who thinks that maybe their own writing isn't so great. His portrayal of the botanists and climbers involved in these tree escapades is flat. The quotes that he uses add nothing to the substance and sound like quotes that a 4th grader might coax out of an unwilling interviewee. His sentence structure is dull and full of too many linking verbs.All in all, I loved the topic and found the story of these trees and the lives of those who study them to be compelling. Maybe I will give this book to my students and make them rewrite it as an exercise in descriptive writing?"
283,1400064899,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2294085-david,4,"I'll admit, I had my reservations when deciding on this -- a book about trees. Much to my delighted surprise, my fears were laid to rest as the vivid, delicate writing of Richard Preston weaved a compelling story, for why trees should be much heralded.The book follows a series of amateur and professional arborists/botanists on their journey of discovering the world's largest trees. Along the way, many of the stories become intertwined as the protagonists meet one another and cross paths, sharing stories and, together, uncovering the lush bio-systems of the tree canopies. Add to the mix harrowing accounts of death and near-death, romance, and the author's own introduction to tree climbing, the book becomes more than just a story about trees; it's a story of the precarious balance of life on Earth.By the end, the book both piqued my interest in visiting the Redwood trees of the Pacific Northwest, and imbued in me a strong sense of wanting to protect these ancient living organisms."
284,1400064899,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6936459-gabrielle-lawrence,5,"Great book about the noble Redwoods and a few interesting people who study them, and end up becoming quite emotionally attached to the trees.There's some science, too! I loved learning about all the incredible biology. On the tops of these trees, the climbers discover ""gardens of ferns, fruiting huckleberries, flowering rhododendrons, fully grown bay laurels. Miniature salamanders live in water captured by the giant ferns, as do tiny crustaceans. Preston describes a 60-foot wide platform of branches in the broken-off top of a tree named Kronos, with 22 auxiliary redwood trunks 80 to 100 feet tall and a yard and a half across at their bases."" Incredible. Preston describes scenes with such clarity I could pretend I was standing in the forest, breathing in that smell so specific to the Redwoods. There is also a very quiet and sweet love story that weaves thru this book, but overall is was the descriptions of climbing and living in trees over 350 feet tall that held me. Made me thankful to have lived in Humboldt county."
285,1400064899,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7617066-jenny-gb,4,"This book was so refreshing after reading Preston's other books about horrible diseases and the descriptions in there that make your skin crawl. Instead, this was a story about a strange group of people who really love the largest and tallest trees in the world (including himself). As someone who has never climbed a tree, this made me curious to try it if I could cure my fear of heights. The stories about the people were sometimes interesting and sometimes annoying, but I appreciated knowing more about the few people in the world studying and climbing these trees. A lot of the descriptions of tree biology and climbing techniques went a bit above my head. I tried my best to understand them, but unfortunately it's way outside of my realm of knowledge. I think more pictures of both trees and climbing would have helped, although I know the trees and the climbing techniques are secret to help preserve these trees. Reading this book was usually a peaceful experience of thinking about huge trees and ancient forests. I hope Preston write more books like this in the future."
286,1400064899,http://goodreads.com/user/show/398118-rich-flammer,1,"Fascinating topic... I was so excited to begin this book, knowing it was about an incredible world of life that exists in the treetops that we know so little about. But the writing is really terrible. Poor flow, and too much detail about things that have nothing to do with the implied focus and subject matter of the text. I don't care if the scientist has a pimple on his knee and eats Fruit Loops every other day for breakfast... This sort of detail really bogged down the writing. I don't like giving bad reviews, but considering what the writer had to work with, the incredible skill and courage it takes to climb these giants, the captivating biological activity that occurs in the upper reaches of these magnificent trees, I was entirely letdown with how he put together and presented the information. No matter how alluring the subject is, I just can't stay interested when the writing is so heavy and inelegant. "
287,1400064899,http://goodreads.com/user/show/30710811-jan-smitowicz,5,"This book is absolute essential reading for anybody who cares about the natural world, climate change, and all related issues. And anyone interested in nature, trees, ecology, redwoods, natural history, and so on. It totally reads like a thriller; Preston makes you deeply invested in the real people whose lives populate this book. I came away having learned about the search for the tallest and biggest redwoods, as well as the general ecology of forests and redwood forests in particular, yet never once felt like I was being tasked with a chore. I've had the unbelievable honor to be able to meet some of the amazing hidden giants talked about in this book--like Illuvatar, Isaac Newton, and others--and that only made subsequent readings that much better. One of my all-time favorite books involving nature/natural history!"
288,1400064899,http://goodreads.com/user/show/733624-al,4," This book follows the lives and adventures of a number of young adventurers who have sought out and climbed the highest giant redwoods in California. Part daredevils, part mystics, part scientists, they have developed new climbing techniques and collected data from the trees they have climbed. Evidently some of the areas they have visited are so inaccessible that they have never been previously visited -- and the author steadfastly refuses to disclose the locations, for fear that recreational climbers will ruin the trees. The story is exciting, fraught with danger, and full of useful information. Recommended"
289,1400064899,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6164581-joe-bolin,3,"I enjoyed The Wild Trees and did find it to be A Story of Passion and Daring. Had the author been able to keep an appropriate distance from his subjects, though, I would've enjoyed it more. Once Preston entered the story--as a writer for The New Yorker magazine--the book became a fawning tribute to Steve Sillett. Up to that point, he had been presented as a flawed scientist whose single-minded passion for trees--and coastal redwoods, in particular--had consumed every other aspect of his life. If you are interested in the life of a redwood forest, this book is well worth reading, however."
290,1400064899,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7967883-sarah,5,"I listened to this book, which was helpful because I may not have been able to push through if I'd been reading it in print, but it was so beautiful. It lead me into a world in which the trees are ancient, wise, and have worlds within themselves. It introduced me to the people who explore those worlds and build their lives around them. And it introduced some main characters who change and grow as they learn more and more about the ancient redwoods. I recommend this book to anyone who loves learning about nature, and especially to those who have roots in the Western USA and are familiar with the enormous redwoods and their beauty. "
291,1400064899,http://goodreads.com/user/show/745598-christine,1,"I was really excited about this. I loved The Hot Zone, it was so well-written and intense and I thought that Preston would do the same thing for the tree canopy that he did for Ebola. Unfortunately, this turned out to be a combination of the most boring science lecture on biology I've ever sat through and a study of some of the most self-centered, maladjusted people I think I've ever read about. I stopped reading about halfway through--I may have bailed out early--but none of the disparate threads of story ever seemed to come together. "
292,1400064899,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1821855-doris,1,"The technical content was interesting, but the efforts at expanding a magazine article into a book felt obvious. The author's attempts at fleshing out the parade of climbers were awkward and stilted, and the prose became somewhat Victorian in tone when he was dealing with romantic relationships. Does anyone under 60 'take a lover' these days? With apologies to J.K., I think that I shall never read another book about a tree! "

I knew nothing of the ecosystems that live in the canopies of redwoods trees; of course, up until 30 or so years ago, no one did! My wild hair has definitely been tweaked. Tree Climbers International's headquarters is right here in Atlanta. . . hmm."
294,1400064899,http://goodreads.com/user/show/21759773-phil-breidenbach,5,Great book. The giant redwoods have been on this earth for thousands of years. Only a small (?) batch of them survive the loggers. These have never been explored. Their tree tops are 20-30 stories in the air and the trees have multiple tree trunks. It is possible to get lost in them! They are one of the rare places on earth that has yet to be really explored. This book tells about some of the pioneer climbers that have made it into their branches. 
295,1400064899,http://goodreads.com/user/show/10289957-audrey,3,"A moderately interesting read about scientists and others who study the canopies of the biggest trees in the world. Told as a story, you also get a look at the (sometimes dysfunctional) private lives of the people involved in these discoveries. These trees are more like coral reef ecosystems than anything else because of the incredible diversity of life found in them. If you have a fear of heights, this book will probably make your hair stand on end."
296,1400064899,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1084151-julie,4,"Having read this book on the heels of hiking through the redwoods in northern CA, I am somewhat influenced by the experience. (I was dying to have known the trees the way the people in this book have...)

297,1400064899,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1123480-maryfrances,4,"This is a wonderful story about the climbers and the trees that they love. Richard Preston offers lots of facts about redwoods and tree climbing without sounding like a textbook. It maintains a narrative thread through the story of its major climbers: Steve Stillett, Marie Antoine, and Michael Taylor. I found much of the information fascinating and a worthwhile read."
298,1400064899,http://goodreads.com/user/show/14618377-karen-snyder,5,"This book explores the personal and tangible yet scientific lure of the trees. Absolutely fascinating to learn what is in the tree tops and data from these beauties.

299,1400064899,http://goodreads.com/user/show/10928659-christy,1,"Hated it. I got to the point where I couldn't even finish the last 20 or so pages. It had some good information, but I really didn't need to know about what people where wearing or who they were having an affair with. I wanted to read about the trees, not the personal lives of the people who explored them."
