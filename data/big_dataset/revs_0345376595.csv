0,0345376595,http://goodreads.com/user/show/21675244-stian,5,"For the majority of my life, reading was never an interest. At all. I spent most of my childhood watching movies and playing video games and football. Reading was boring, time-consuming and pointless. But then, when I was around sixteen or so, something happened that changed my life drastically. I discovered Carl Sagan. I still remember buying Cosmos, unpacking it, excitedly starting it, and turning the volume up to the max. I watched all the episodes in a day: I couldn't stop. And then it happened. For the first time in my life, I ordered some books. The first three books I ever bought were all by Carl. The Demon-Haunted World: Science as a Candle in the Dark, Billions & Billions: Thoughts on Life and Death at the Brink of the Millennium, and finally, Pale Blue Dot: A Vision of the Human Future in Space.Pale Blue Dot was the first I read, and it was mindblowing for me at the time. It was so illuminating. It's hard to describe the impact it had on me. Coupled with Cosmos and a number of videos on Youtube of Carl speaking, it completely changed my life - for the better. When I discovered Carl (and in extension, books, science, philosophy) I was horribly depressed and struggling a lot with a variety of things. Upon discovering him, I realised that there is more to life than bad movies, football, and wasteful video games.I still remember reading him, or watching Cosmos, or watching a lecture of his on Youtube, and listening attentively; I would then go to my parents and sit there for an hour or more, lecturing them about what I just heard or read. Probably I did not convey everything accurately but that wasn't the point either. I bought a telescope, and stayed up all night looking at the stars and the moon and listening to him on my MP3. Somehow, looking at those stars, and listening to him, and not only listening but finding what he said logical, reasonable -- an explanation as to why we are here that isn't religious or superstitious, but still much more beautiful than what any religion can come up with -- it gave some much-needed meaning to my life. It's strange how you can be punched in the gut by the vast meaninglessness of it all, and that's exactly where you find meaning.This is where it all started for me. Because of Carl (and yes, I will persist in calling him 'Carl', damn it), I discovered Richard P. Feynman. Because of Feynman I discovered Paul Dirac. All of this science-related. This led me to Arthur C. Clarke and 2001: A Space Odyssey. Eventually I discovered George Orwell, Fyodor Dostoyevsky, Albert Camus, and all those other writers who have enriched my life ever since. So it was Carl, and this book in combination with Cosmos, that paved way for it all. My entire intellectual life is all because of him. It is almost certain that had I not come across Carl when I did, I would have remained depressed. Although my interest in science has waned (primarily because of my lack of proficiency in mathematics more than anything else), and my opinions and thoughts have changed (and continue to change all the time) I am still eternally grateful to Carl for opening the door for me to, well, thought. Most importantly, though, he showed me that life might be worth living after all. “A book is made from a tree. It is an assemblage of flat, flexible parts (still called ""leaves"") imprinted with dark pigmented squiggles. One glance at it and you hear the voice of another person, perhaps someone dead for thousands of years. Across the millennia, the author is speaking, clearly and silently, inside your head, directly to you. Writing is perhaps the greatest of human inventions, binding together people, citizens of distant epochs, who never knew one another. Books break the shackles of time ― proof that humans can work magic."""
1,0345376595,http://goodreads.com/user/show/32419-ben,4,"I recently came across several references to this book while reading the superb God Delusion. I was intrigued, and since it had been quite a while since I read Cosmos, I decided to give Carl Sagan another go.Besides his beautiful evocative descriptions of moons and worlds in our own Solar system, Sagan gave us a surplus of inspirational and cautionary passages in this work which--even as an adult--make you want to grow up to be an astronaut."
2,0345376595,http://goodreads.com/user/show/14046996-roy-lotz,4,"Once, in German class, I recommended Carl Sagan’s magnificent Cosmos television series to a classmate. “Wow,” she said. “That’s the first time somebody suggested Carl Sagan to me who wasn’t a pothead.” I wasn’t sure if that was an insult or a compliment; I said “thanks” anyway.Although I’m sure Carl Sagan can be enjoyed in a variety of altered states, he can be enjoyable for those of us here on earth too. In fact, the message of this book can (if one can stomach the cliché) justly be described as “sobering.” It is, at the very least, serious.There are several components to Sagan’s message, though they are all intertwined. The first is simply to bring home how huge, how tremendously large, how stunningly vast, is the universe. The cosmos is bigger and more complex than anyone had dared thought. Humans are wont to place themselves in the center of things. We have invented a thousand cosmologies, full of heroes and villains, gods and beasts; yet, fecund as it is, the human imagination seems particularly unable (or perhaps unwilling) to imagine ourselves as we are: insignificant.Sagan goes through every human conceit he can get his hands on, and (not without a smile of satisfaction) proceeds to knock them all down. The universe appears to be sublimely indifferent to our survival. This is scary. At least, Sagan thinks so; and he wants you to think so too. Sagan would have us do our best, despite our reluctance, to think of the earth, not as the stage of our petty dramas, but as it appears from the outside: a speck in space.This leads Sagan to his next general point: we are all in this together. As we contemplate our cosmic insignificance, our various provincial loyalties seem even more insignificant still. If the universe is indifferent to human life, it is surely indifferent to this year’s election results, to religious struggles, to racist conceits. We are, in short, on our own; and since no help is coming from outside, we have to help one another. The earth is not the mighty center of things we had once thought; it is, instead, fragile. And faced with this infinite dark, we must realize that what unites humans far outweighs what divides us.But added to the general hazards that come with living on a bit of cosmic dust, we have invented hazards for ourselves. For the first time in our species’s history, we have developed technologies capable of destroying human life altogether. Some of these are intentionally malicious, such as nuclear warheads; but others result from a lack of prudence, such as our enthusiastic fossil-fuel burning. Sagan sees the human race at present as a bunch of pre-teens playing with daddy’s gun; he wants us to keep the safety on.Technology isn't, however, all bad; we have also used our technology to make great strides. We have explored the solar system, sending out probes to distant planets; and this information has allowed scientists to better understand our own planet. It is because of our space exploration that we now understand our own fragility. But space exploration has not only yielded knowledge; it has created opportunities. Sagan is very optimistic about the human future in space. Not only does he think it can happen, but he thinks it must happen, if we are to survive in the long run. The dinosaurs were destroyed by an asteroid; why not us? We need to spread ourselves out, as a kind of cosmic insurance policy. We will travel throughout the solar system and beyond, carving out hospitable environments for human life on other worlds.This is the final piece of the puzzle. Technology is, in itself, indifferent; it can be used creatively or destructively. We have, at present, weapons unimaginable to people living just 100 years ago; we have also medicine incomparably better. What will make the difference in the long run, says Sagan, is not technology per se, but technology combined with good judgment. And how does one cultivate good judgment? It has many facets: a skeptical attitude, a willingness to learn, a pragmatic approach, and a readiness to place truth over dogma, facts over wishes. And all these are embodied in the scientific attitude. That’s why books like this are so important: they teach science to the world.So there’s his argument. It doesn’t require any drugs to appreciate that, right?As a side note, I’d like to recommend the audiobook version of this work. It is (mainly) narrated by Sagan, whose deep, booming voice never fails to give me goosebumps. Annoyingly, Sagan sometimes trades off with another voice actor, who has a very nasal and uninspiring voice; but Sagan does read most of the lyrical bits.Speaking of lyrical bits, there are some parts of this book that are quite simply beautiful. Sagan is a consistently strong writer; but he is occasionally able to reach remarkable heights. What is, I think, the secret of his eloquence is his awe for the natural world. “Wonder” is simply not a strong enough word for the breathless astonishment he feels when looking up at the night sky. Sagan manages to combine a sense of both religious reverence and scientific scrutiny. This is no mean feat. For my part, I find the two feelings opposed to one another.I could go on about the fascinating descriptions of other worlds, the interesting facts about NASA’s various missions, Sagan’s remarkable breadth of knowledge, and his love of aliens; but I think I’ll leave that for my fellow reviewers. After all, Goodreads, like the International Space Station, is a cooperative venture, international in scope, and exploratory in nature."

4,0345376595,http://goodreads.com/user/show/28470777-mackey,4,"There was a time when I simply could NOT get enough of Carl Sagan. I read everything he wrote, watched every documentary that he made. I adore him still. Pale Blue Dot is NOT like Cosmos, the book with which most people are familiar. Cosmos dealt with astronomy and gave you a basic understanding of the entire ""cosmos"" in a way that you would understand. It's one of the reasons it is so popular. In Pale Blue Dot, Sagan is speaking to those who love the Earth, love its relationship to the Cosmos, how it is all interconnected together and how the ""pale blue dot"" has to survive in order for the rest of the cosmos to survive. It is a book about space, the future of space exploration and our future there and whether it will save us all. This book is truly Carl Sagan at his very best and, if you are Sagan fan, I dare you to read it without hearing the words, ""Billllions and Billlions of years ago...."" in a way only he could do. "
5,0345376595,http://goodreads.com/user/show/297618-joshua,5,"WOW....WOW....WOW. Carl Sagan, what a champ. Fiction from scientists/astrologists may be a bummer (see Contact), but Carl drops the BOMB in this work. Truly ahead of his time and a great american. A great intro into science/astrology and really helped me understand a lot about all the planets and their make-up. Once we kill earth (pretty soon), perhaps we aren't TOTALLY fucked, their are other options out there if we get with it...but hey, we killed earth so why listen to Sagan. I drive an SUV, i'm totally an asshole....but whatver you may be a fat capitalist.Here is a great quote from the book that I spread around on Earth Day.""By this point your expedition to the Earth must be considered highly successful. You've characterized the enviroment; you've detected life; you've found manifestations of intelligent beings' you may even have identified the dominant species, the one transfixed with geometry and rectilinearity. Surely this planet is worth a longer and more detailed study. That's why you've now inserted your spacecraft into orbit around the Earth.Looking down on the planet, you uncover new puzzles. All over the Earth, smokestacks are pouring carbon dioxide and toxic chemicals into the air. So are the dominant beings who run on the roadways. But carbon dioxide is a greenhouse gas. As you watch, the of it in the atmosphere increases steadily, year after year. The same is true of methane and other greenhouse gases. If this keeps up, the temperature of the planet is going to increase. Spectroscopically, you discover another class of molecules being injected into the air, the chlorofluorocarbons. Not only are they greenhouses gases, but they are also devastatingly effective in destroying the protective ozone layer.You look more closely at the center of the South American continent, which (as you know by now) is a vast rain forest. Every night you see thousands of fires. In the daytime, you find the region covered with smoke. Over the years, all over the planet, you find less and less forest and more and more scrub desert.You look down on the large island of Madagascar. The rivers are colored brown, generating a vast stain in the surrounding ocean. This is topsoil being washed out to sea at a rate so high that in another few decades there will be none left. The same thing is happening, you note, at the mouths of rivers all over the planet.But no topsoil means no agriculture. In another century, what will they eat? What will they breathe? How will they cope with a changing and more dangerous enviroment?From your orbital perspective, you can see that something has unmistakably gone wrong. The dominant organisms, whoever they are (who have gone to so much trouble to rework the surface) are simultaneously destroying their ozone layer and their forests, eroding their topsoil, and performing massive, uncontrolled experiments on the planet's climate. Haven't they noticed what's happening? Are they oblivious to their fate? Are they unable to work together on behalf of the enviroment that sustains them all?Perhaps, you think, it's time to reassess the conjecture that there's intelligent life on Earth."" "
6,0345376595,http://goodreads.com/user/show/342436-chris-friend,5,"I was impressed by how much I enjoyed this one. I've not read any Sagan before, so I didn't know what to expect, but he's one of those brilliant scientists who understands how to clearly explain things to laypeople. His story (I use the term though it reads more like a collection of journal entries or brief reports) covers wide-ranging topics about the implications and necessity of space travel, posing questions frequently, answering them occasionally, and leading inexorably to a single conclusion: the human species must press outward into space.Though not nearly as reactionary or thrill-seeking as a recent string of fiction films dealing with space flight (specifically, ""Mission to Mars"" and ""Armageddon"" come to mind while reading this book), a case is made for the urgent need and dangerous potentials of further human spaceflight. Appropriately balanced, however, Sagan's conclusions bring an optimism not often found in the writings of modern scientists focused on a global perspective."
7,0345376595,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4528129-ade-reads,5,"The title of the book, Pale Blue Dot, was taken from the instantly infamous Pale Blue Dot photograph taken by Voyager 1 in 1990. The back story to that image is worth describing before actually talking about the book itself.Here is the image,Can you see Earth? Can you see our tiny little Earth? Look harder. There, ‘suspended in a sunbeam,’ is a tiny pale blue dot.This is what Sagan had to say:
From this distant vantage point, the Earth might not seem of any particular interest. But for us, it’s different. Consider again that dot. That’s here. That’s home. That’s us. On it everyone you love, everyone you know, everyone you ever heard of, every human being who ever was, lived out their lives. The aggregate of our joy and suffering, thousands of confident religions, ideologies, and economic doctrines, every hunter and forager, every hero and coward, every creator and destroyer of civilization, every king and peasant, every young couple in love, every mother and father, hopeful child, inventor and explorer, every teacher of morals, every corrupt politician, every “superstar,” every “supreme leader,” every saint and sinner in the history of our species lived there – on a mote of dust suspended in a sunbeam.
A great book. It's worth every page. Highly recommend reading."
8,0345376595,http://goodreads.com/user/show/14880227-alej,1,"I brought this book to work with me during the incredibly slow weeks of the holiday season. The book was repetitive, full of purple prose, and overly sentimental about ""science"" in a way that reminded me of my parochial school days. I had expected a good book explaining stuff about astronomy, science, whathaveyou, but it was mostly emotional pandering to atheists who think they're morally/intellectually superior to non-atheists. There was a whole lot of nothing for a couple hundred pages that can be summarised with: ""The world and universe is super great and I don't understand why religion is a thing."" Which, like, congrats, I s'pose. You could've just said it once instead of wanking over it for a million pages. It was kind of silly, which was pretty sad, seeing as I'm a huge fan of some of Sagan's other works and his show, ""Cosmos."" "
9,0345376595,http://goodreads.com/user/show/51089-jamie,5,"Take Carl’s revered “Pale Blue Dot” speech, and multiply it by, say, the power of ten. That’s Pale Blue Dot. And the fact that it’s only by the power of ten... well, that’s how great that speech is."
10,0345376595,http://goodreads.com/user/show/318324-kurt,4,"Pale Blue Dot refers to the Earth as photographed from the Voyager craft at a point beyond the orbit of Neptune. Of course at that distance, the Earth is barely discernible - a very small, unremarkable, pale blue dot among a myriad of billions of other unremarkable points of light. Yet all our history, civilization, and culture that we have ever known has occurred on that dot.Even though our ingrained geo-centric and ethno-centric biases cause us to become deflated and even depressed at the realization of the truth of our insignificance in the vast universe, this book is actually meant to inspire hope in all of us. Its subtitle, A Vision of the Human Future in Space, is what this book is all about. Carl Sagan was a big believer in space exploration, and he inspired millions of others to be also.There are two reasons why I find it really difficult to have the optimism that Carl Sagan has. First, he talks of traveling the vast distances from star to star and eventually even to other galaxies. The reality of the limit of the speed of light and the extreme difficulty and power requirements to just achieve a fraction of that speed, just seem to be insurmountable obstacles. Second, the human race is obviously incapable of even responsibly managing its own affairs on its own home planet, and we are likewise extremely resistant to even subtle changes that require collective mandates (examples: American attempts to implement the metric system, dollar coins, or more fair and cost-saving health care reform, not to mention our inability to address far more pressing crises like population control and global warming).Overall, I loved this book. It is the best of the five Carl Sagan books I have read yet, and I recommend it for everyone."
11,0345376595,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4215097-john,3,"Pale Blue Dot was Carl's last book, written while he was battling cancer and published after his death. Sagan was responsible for having NASA rotate a Voyager spacecraft (as it was leaving the solar system) and photograph the planets, including of course the Earth, which was appeared as a pale blue dot. I think Carl Sagan is a must read for any person who wants to be educated. Carl was a true Renascence Man, and his best gift ( of many) was teaching us about perspective. Perspective makes us wise, and humane. We need perspective and Sagan gives us that not just with science, but with history, and deep time and evolution, and, of course, space. Sagan gets us outside of out heads and out of our very limited little worlds which normally rotate around, us. Pale Blue Dot is not Sagan's best book and if you haven't read Sagan I'd suggest you start with ""Shadows of Forgotten Ancestors"" or ""Demon Haunted World,"" both of which are marvels. This book takes the reader through a tour of our Solar System and then the last chapters are Carl's speculations on our future and his desire to see humans resume their nomadic wanderings and colonize Mars and the asteroids and venture into the Universe. I miss Carl Sagan a lot and we should all miss his humour, insight, clarity and optimism."
12,0345376595,http://goodreads.com/user/show/695116-jim,5,"I read this shortly after it came out back in the mid-90s & really liked it, so when I found an audio edition, I jumped on it. Glad I did! This edition was made partially with the original audio that Carl narrated, but there is progressively more narration by his wife filling in gaps left by time. Both were excellent & really have a lot of enthusiasm. They're slow, though. This is one of the few books where I went up to 2x rather than 1.5x, my normal listening speed.There wasn't much new to me, but I was really impressed by his knowledge that's now over 2 decades out of date. He was really up on things, though. It's such a shame he died so young, only 62 back in 1996. He would really be thrilled with where the space program is today since it was at a nadir when he wrote this. It was obviously frustrating to him & yet he gave good reasons for it. He seemed to realize that it would turn around.On the downside, he does tend to go on at times. Even I was mentally wandering at times, especially toward the end. Still, the main thing this book brings back is just how cool space is. Sagan could really make that clear. This is highly recommended to anyone who is just learning about space from mid teens & up. "
13,0345376595,http://goodreads.com/user/show/10916182-kirti-upreti,5,"The greatest experience you get by reading a book is to plunge into the mind of the author. When you understand someone so closely, you tend to develop a strong connection with them.The authors that I've read - I find some of them closer to my heart than most of the people I've known in my life. They are always there by my side - guiding me, opening my mind and giving me strength. Carl Sagan is one of those few, now..."
14,0345376595,http://goodreads.com/user/show/10470164-shruti-badole,5,"Pale Blue Dot: literally one of the best books I have read. You might think I am enlisting the book in that category because I am an Astrophysics student. I won’t deny that I might be ‘biased’ that way, but in all honesty, I feel that this is one book that every person should give a read. Having watched and thoroughly enjoyed the Cosmos series by Carl Sagan, I couldn’t wait to read his books (although, I did wait. I watched that series more than three years ago!). Insightful, inspiring and refreshing. Was the Pale Blue Dot just what I had expected? No, it was much more.This is one of the richest books I have read, in terms of content, style and language. Sagan has the ability to capture the imagination of even those people who are least interested in space science. His words are arresting, his style intelligent (what else could you expect from a world-renowned astrophysicist and science communicator?). This beautiful excerpt from the book, known to probably every science enthusiast, is just an example. ""Look again at that dot. That's here. That's home. That's us. On it everyone you love, everyone you know, everyone you ever heard of, every human being who ever was, lived out their lives. The aggregate of our joy and suffering, thousands of confident religions, ideologies, and economic doctrines, every hunter and forager, every hero and coward, every creator and destroyer of civilization, every king and peasant, every young couple in love, every mother and father, hopeful child, inventor and explorer, every teacher of morals, every corrupt politician, every ""superstar,"" every ""supreme leader,"" every saint and sinner in the history of our species lived there-on a mote of dust suspended in a sunbeam.""  (Follow the link https://www.goodreads.com/quotes/2300... for the full quote. It’s breathtaking.) In the 380+ pages-long journey that Sagan takes us, he talks about a variety of things. The central theme of the book is the human race: our past, present and future in the cosmic arena. He talks about our ‘wandering’ ancestors, the times of Copernicus and Galileo when the geocentric theory was popular, the various advances humankind has made in technology and space science, and what the future is expected to hold for us. He also addresses a point that would concern any ethical person: the use and misuse of science and technology, and its repercussions. Is it right to spend billions of taxpayer money on space research that does not guarantee immediate tangible positive outcomes? Is space travel really important? Are we, as humans, capable of preserving this pale blue dot we call our home? Are we prudent enough to settle on other worlds, not destroy them and form another civilization off-Earth? Questions of human race, questions of science, and answers to them. This is what Sagan talks about. Needless to say, Sagan was a brilliant astrophysicist and a visionary. He was aware of the follies and complexities of human race, our incredible potential to achieve things unimagined before and also our great capability to destroy ourselves. As a budding astrophysicist and an advocate of science, I think everyone needs to hear what Sagan has to say. I greatly recommend the Pale Blue Dot: A Vision of the Human Future in Space."
15,0345376595,http://goodreads.com/user/show/10449878-naomi,4,"This book was very well written by an excellent physicist. It was one of those books that really makes you consider the world around you and the massive scale of the Universe.The first chapter contemplated the arrogance and self-centred nature of humans, and presented the notion that humans are exceedingly small compared to the vast Universe. For the first time I really comprehended how tiny our species are. It is quite an obvious concept that gets lost in everyday worries, fears and troubles. Now everytime I am stressed or anxious I think of how insignificant it is compared to the world, compared to the Universe, and perhaps how some far-off civilisation would view our world and its problems. Another thing the book did was allowed the reader to take an objective perspective of the Earth, for example, it made me realise how irrelevant political and social problems such as war and money are; the Universe is so much bigger, so much more significant than the miniscule conflicts that we create here on Earth. But it also made me realise the grandeur of the human race: how much we have accomplished, how much we still don't know, how far we're willing to go to find answers to scientific problems. The book also touched on the Solar System and the many diverse environments close to our planet, which was well explained. It was amusing to see that little information was available regarding what Titan is like since the probe would reach there in 2004 (the book was written in 1995)! I had to seek reference in another book to find the answers and alleviate my curiosity about this strange moon. However, the positive to this lack of information is that it elucidated the fact that science is always growing; new phenomena are constantly being discovered so that books written almost 20 years ago are immediately out of date. Carl Sagan also discussed the prospect of sending robots to Mars, which again made me laugh given Curiosity's recent successful landing. As the book went on, I found that it lost momentum. The last 8 or so chapters were quite repetitive and tedious; Sagan was mainly speculating about future possibilities instead of introducing new facts. Nevertheless, I found it quite interesting to read about potential trips to other galaxies, or terra-forming of Mars and asteroids - it would make for an excellent science fiction novel! The last chapter recapitulated much of the whole book so that I was left feeling that sense of awe and wonder at the majestic of the Universe and of humanity's scientific advancement.In conclusion, this was a fantastic book that really makes the reader contemplate the vastness of the Universe, feel patriotic towards Earth and want to make exploration of the Universe a possibility."

One might think that it is a pure scientific text which goes on and on about facts and numbers and laws and whatsoever that can drag the soul out of you - not denying that it isn't - but seriously, look at the title - A Pale Blue Dot - isn't poetic enough? As the writer suggests ""Knowing how things work doesn't make them less romantic"". Of course, the style of writing matters, and this book is so well-written that will make your mind digesting its contents, gladly and with ease, most of the time anyway. Are you interested in understanding the location of Earth, in the sea of space and on the timeline of creation? Are you interested in the objects of the darkness; the emptiness and how they affect and be affected by your blue world? Do you want to know the possibilities of new realms, new lives, at different corners of the solar system? Do you want to see the beauty of Venus, Mars, Titan or Uranus? Do you want to know how far we humans have gone, and how further we can even go? THIS BOOK IS FOR YOU. ""There is a new world next door. And we know how to get there."" Carl Sagan not only highlights details of the universe and the interrelations of its floating bodies. He raises a number of good questions and outlines the consequences of each course of action humanity will take. Is it important to explore outer space? Is it possible to terraform Mars or the moons of the Jovian Planets? ""Can we, who have made such a mess of this world, be trusted with others?"". You want answers. What is also more interesting, because this book was published more than a decade a half ago, some unanswered questions have already seen the light today. You are encouraged to learn more and more. It is exactly like excitedly holding a negative film, wanting to see those images with their real colors, only to realize later, that those images are already printed and stored somewhere in your room! you found your sequel of the story, even before it ends. I admit, some ideas got me lost, others were to far-fetched to grasp. Perhaps, because I am new to this kind of books. or perhaps, it is not a book you read only once. It is a mixture of Science and Poetry; ""They will gaze up and strain to find the blue dot in their skies. They will love it no less for its obscurity and fragility."" "

Sagan had a really compelling, engaging and precious way of writing. It's something that definitely makes the reading experience much more attractive and delighting. I am not a huge fan of the topic, but after reading this, I can't deny that is utterly interesting.The book is clearly out of date, but I like the undertone that it has. Further, it's not totally focused on space travelling itself, but also on the political/ethical/social issues behind it. It's also interesting how he questions the reasons for extraterrestrial exploration, are those reasons good enough that matter risking people's lives/institution's prestige/state money? he offers really good reasons in favor of it, but I feel it's a question that is still up in the air."

“... humans are inconsequential, a thin film of life on an obscure and solitary lump of rock and metal.”
This was the first audio book I've listened to. Frankly, I was a little skeptic about audio books, at first, only to discover how amazing it is to have your book read to you especially if it's the author himself. In the first few chapters, the narrator had to take audible breaths between phrases it was a bit annoying but other than that, it was impeccable. I took all my time to slowly absorb each and every word. I didn't want to listen to all of it at once. I played it during the sleepless nights when I needed something to fill the deafening silence when I edited my irritating Latex files. Sometimes I would end up leaving the file and jolting down notes from the book and contemplate the ideas Sagan introduced. I loved loved loved it. Pale Blue Dot (I tend to call it ""A Pale Blue Dot"") reveals, piece by piece, the scientific discoveries Earthlings have made and how they shape what we may envision for our future as a civilisation, as a living species, and as curious individuals in search of awe. Space exploration is cleverly studied and added to the lot such as to highlight the position we hold on Earth as perceived on the scale of the Universe and the opportunities presented to us to explore more and perhaps expand our presence onto other planets and/or moons (looking at Mars and Titan).I was very delighted to discover all the subtle antiwar messages that Sagan subtly introduces within the chapters. They're important reminders of noble, humane values without which we would just blow ourselves into extinction with all the technological progress we are making. It was beautiful to see how much the author cared about the longevity of the human civilisation whilst it protected the environment and took civilized, conscious, and wise decisions. I might add to this late on... 
“It has been said that astronomy is a humbling and character-building experience. There is perhaps no better demonstration of the folly of human conceits than this distant image of our tiny world. To me, it underscores our responsibility to deal more kindly with one another, and to preserve and cherish the pale blue dot, the only home we've ever known.”

I remember, in 2014 I watched this short film called Wanderers, and you know I loved it. I have read few more books by Carl Sagan, but I got to know about this book after  watching this video.And after reading this book, I can say that it was my favorite book of the year 2015 and I'm very happy that I ended my year with this book.If I talk about Carl Sagan, do you know what separate him or distinguish him from other brilliant people out there? His excitement and enthusiasm with which he express himself. You can feel it in his writing. And I liked how he can explain things with such simplicity, while maintaining the beauty.I would say this book is glorious and it makes me wonder, it illuminates me, through a light on the significance of our lives, and how special we are.He quoted in the book: 
""The Universe seems designed for human beings. It's difficult to contemplate these circumstances without experiencing stirrings of pride and reassurance. The entire Universe, made for us! We must really be something.""
In this world, as of now we are the only living, thinking beings and we should really be happy with all that we have and all that surrounds us!Pale Blue Dot refers to the Earth in the great vastness of the Universe. However small it may appear from that distance, but it is so much more to us. For us it's our world,the only known world which harbors life, sustain life, and it's our home. 
 From this distant vantage point, the Earth might not seem of any particular interest. But for us, it's different. Look again at that dot. That's here. That's home. That's us. In it everyone we love, everyone you know, everyone you ever heard of, every human being, who ever was, lived out their lives. The aggregate of our joy and suffering, thousands of confident religions, ideologies, and economic doctrines, every hunter and forager, every hero and coward, every creator and destroyer of civilization, every king and peasant, every young couple in love, every mother and father, hopeful child, inventor and explorer, every teacher of morals, every corrupt politician, every ""superstar,"" every ""supreme leader,"" every saint and sinner in the history of species lived there-on a mote of dust suspended in a sunbeam... ...The Earth is the only world known so far to harbor life. There is nowhere else, at least in the near future, to which our species could migrate. Visit, yes. Settle, not yet. Like it or not, for the moment the Earth is where we make our stand.
Think of how fucked up we will be, if we destroy this planet.You know when ever I feel sad or depressed, I always listen to him, watch those videos that are available on YouTube and for some reason after listening to him I feel good, there is certain hope that he instill in me and then I just feel wonderful.I love him and I'll always remember him, for he made a huge impact in my life. He is truly irreplaceable.These are few other quotes that I really like:
""We can judge our progress by the courage of our questions and the depth of our answers, out willingness to embrace what is true rather than what feels good.""""The Universe is a pretty big place. If it's just us, seems like an awful waste of space.""It pays to keep an open mind, but not so open that your brain falls out.""""Imagination will often carry us to the worlds that never were, but without it we go nowhere.""""The beauty of a living thing is not the atoms that go into it, but the way those atoms are put together .""""If it can be destroyed by the truth, it deserve to be destroyed by the truth.""""In all our searching, the only thing we've found that makes the emptiness bearable is each other.""
And there are many more...So the conclusion is, read this book and then read his other books, and then watch those videos that are available on YouTube and then just enjoy the Universe.Read it, you won't be disappointed!Happy Reading!"
22,0345376595,http://goodreads.com/user/show/858949-chris,4,"I miss Carl Sagan. I really do.There are no shortage of brilliant scientists out there, imaginative and innovative people who are dedicated to the advancement of science and the betterment of the human race.The difference between Sagan and the rest of them is that he was able to make it beautiful. When he talked, you could feel his excitement, his joy at knowing that there was a wonderful universe out there, waiting for us to discover it. In his most famous work, Cosmos, he introduced the wonders of science to people who had never thought about it before.Through his eyes, the cold, vast emptiness of space was a limitless field of discovery, an infinite storehouse of wonders for us to find.In this book, he tries to chart the future of space travel for humankind. He talks about the possibilities of moving to Mars, taking up homes in the asteroid belt, making our way through the solar system and outward. He believes that we have within us the potential to spread throughout the galaxy, given the will and the fortitude to do it. He marvels at the technological fortitude of the Voyager probes and the Apollo missions, and he sorrows at our timidity in no longer stepping outside our own orbit.He's not a - forgive the pun - starry-eyed optimist. He's very well aware of the history of the human race, our potential for self-destruction and our congenital short-sightedness. The same technology that would allow us to terraform is also destroying our own planet. The methods we could use to safeguard our world against meteor impacts could also turn those meteors against ourselves. A world as splintered and chaotic as ours may not be ready to take those next steps out into the greater Cosmos. We may even obliterate ourselves before we have the chance to find out.But one way or the other, he says, we have to go. The impulse for exploration is hard-wired into our DNA, and if we all stay on this one world, our chances for survival as a species are next to none.Sagan was a fantastic scientist, and more than that, he was an excellent communicator. He knew how to cut through the apparent soullessness of science and bring wonder to the hearts and minds of ordinary people. And, frankly, I think we need that right now. There's such a.... resistance to science these days, a fear of the universe, and people are starting to backslide to irrationality.If there's someone out there like that, we need that person desperately right now. So, you know, speak up."
23,0345376595,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2266055-daniel-villines,4,"It's been my experience that people express themselves best when they are discussing the most exciting aspects of their lives. Give me an inch of enthusiasm for engineering and I can throw back a mile's worth of discussion regarding hydrology, hydraulics, and past projects. By opening Pale Blue Dot, the reader might as well be asking Sagan about his career as a scientist. And unlike engineering, Sagan's career has been amazing.For most inquisitors, and probably to the discouragement of Sagan, his reply of scientific knowledge would likely send the casual conversationalist looking for a different partner. However, for a few, Sagan's reply signals an opportunity to discover the truth about our existence and to learn about the realities that surround us. So with the passion of a scientist, Sagan tells us about where we all collectively live and continues with the passion of a human to explain why our days here on Earth are numbered.The result is an impassioned narrative told by man that holds the truth in the highest level of regard. While not an autobiography in the traditional sense, Pale Blue Dot is an account of Sagan's scientific life, boiled down to the essentials that gave his life purpose and the message that he wanted to send forth into humanity's future.As for content, Pale Blue Dot presents a relatively concise point in time. The narrative presents a summary of humanity's knowledge of our home world, our fellow planets, and their moons as we knew them near the end Sagan's life. But more importantly to Sagan, this information is what humanity knew when we collectively achieved the technological enlightenment needed to affect our own extinction.Sagan, the eternal scientist, also presents his hope for our future in true scientific fashion. While the future cannot be known, qualitative factors that could affect our future are presented and weighed by Sagan. He presents the evidence against us but he also presents the ideas needed to move beyond this perilous time in our existence."
24,0345376595,http://goodreads.com/user/show/30090987-syed-fathi,5,"This book is part planetary science and part imagination. The ideas are really captivating, it makes you wanna pack your bag and bought your space flight ticket and wander in the cosmic darkness. It is really hard to put it down, I hope that my daughter will grow up fast, so she could read this book.The early chapter discussed about cosmic vastness and how insignificant our planet when we compare with the infinite darkness. This insignificance is captured by Voyager 2 during its mission in Neptune. The iconic picture showed us that out there, our planet is just a single pixel, a pale blue dot in the sunbeam. The universe noted by Sagan, is clearly not made for us. Sagan elaborate on how science take over religion on humans view of the space. He brought the Galileo's heliocentric case against the fallacy of geocentric view championed by the Catholic Church.The later chapter discussed more technically on how our spacefaring activities could be. How in the future me might colonized other planets such as Mars and create a dome habitat for human to settle. Also the prospect of re-engineering the environment of other planets or moon so that it would be habitable to earth's life. This can be done using terraforming, which maybe can be done in theory, but yet to be done practically. Sagan made it clear that space flight in the future is not a luxury but rather our mean of survival. As the earth might in future deteriorate and obliterate by asteroids, it just a matter of time before we made our journey into the interstellar journey. For Sagan, we have only two options in future, space flight or extinction."

I don't think no one can ever change that attitude unless taking our perception beyond the cosmic level. Maybe Multiversal and I know for sure that even that person must be inspired from Sagan.The book has some of the best gem of Sagan. So many excerpts left me overflowing with tears and joys of being able to witness and face such frontier. ""We who cannot even put our planetary home in order, riven with rivalries and hatred, are we to venture out into space?"" At Some passages, i felt it's more than a book of knowledge. It's a book of spirituality where realising our profound duties and connectedness felt overwhelmingly humane. Getting to know about Carl Sagan is the sweetest thing that had ever happened in my life till now. Words he says has more wisdom than knowledge, blending the Science with Philosophy and maybr that's why i love Astronomy for which they can be easily related to philosophy."

Our remote descendants, safely arrayed on many worlds throughout the Solar System and beyond, will be unified by their common heritage, by their regard for their home planet, and by the knowledge that, whatever other life may be, the only humans in all the Universe come from Earth.” —Carl Sagan, Pale Blue Dot: A Vision of the Human Future in SpaceA very enjoyable and exciting read. Essential for any Carl Sagan fan, and a must-read for anyone wanting to know more about why the exploration and eventual settlement of other worlds is a necessity for the long term survival of the human species. Actually, this is one of those books that I think everyone should read at least once. "
27,0345376595,http://goodreads.com/user/show/27152942-john,5,"A wonderful and inspirational look at the cosmos and our exploration of it. It may seem even perhaps dated now because this book was written 25 years ago. But Sagan is a timeless philosopher about our place in the cosmos. By turns technical and scientific, with a nice mix of inquiry and evocation. The retelling of the Voyager missions was also very interesting. The Voyagers are now sailing in the interstellar regions and will one day be the only indicators that life once existed on earth, thanks to the vision of Sagan and others."
28,0345376595,http://goodreads.com/user/show/15976841-anamaria-tkanc,5,"This marvelously written book is perfect for people who want to know more about space and time.Carl Sagan in a unique, simple but beautiful and poetic way explains some subjects that some people might have find odifficult to understand.I've read few books about space in general, but they weren't even close to this one and without any fear I can tell that this book is my favourite so far."
29,0345376595,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7552897-sebastian,5,"The first book I ever read cover to cover, word by word, was Cosmos.That was also, inexplicably, the last book by Carl Sagan I actually read to date, despite the profound impact it had on my thoughts, interests and worldview. Having grown up a bit in the interim, I decided to take a look at the book where Sagan, as far as I could gather from the comments, also kinda “grew up” and looked at spaceflight and space exploration with less of a rosy tint, taking a more realistic view of the situation and prospects.The impression I get is that while Sagan “grew up” in realizing that not everybody shares our enthusiasm and unswerving dedication to all things spacy, he somehow managed to remain hopelessly, naively romantic about many, many issues that surround space exploration. From the nature of humans on the individual and social level, through the inevitability of “wisdom” and good-naturedness of potential advanced alien life forms, to the very form and substrate such alien intelligences could exist in. I guess that in the interim, while he was busy reading the classics, I was busy reading some bleeding-edge dark-ass science fiction, and our worldviews have diverged significantly.That does not mean that I disliked the book, quite the contrary. Putting aside the gorgeous style that Sagan is well known and praised for, this level of childish wonder and enthusiasm is welcome – nay - necessary in some of us to drive us forward – and outward – as a species, to push us into unknown territories full of wonders while people brought up on more cautionary tales look carefully left and right for potential (bug-eyed) tigers hiding in the bushes. Diversity and diversification is key to surviving and thriving, and that, to me, ended up being the main point of the book."
30,0345376595,http://goodreads.com/user/show/20202380-molly,4,"Marvelous look at what humanity can achieve if we put our minds to it. This book should be read by every lawmaker and statesperson in the world, and by every high school student looking to their future career."

32,0345376595,http://goodreads.com/user/show/57263951-nacho-santos,4,"Pale Blue Dot by Carl SaganListening to the first two chapters of this book, I was astonished. It was thought provoking, mind boggling, brilliant. It made me think about existence and the nature of this world. It made me look up and look around myself. It made me look at things I otherwise wouldn’t have paid attention to. (If you are a fan of Sapiens by Yuval Noah Harari, you’ll love it.) Though the first two chapters were amazing, sadly I had to drag myself to finish the other twenty. It was mostly about other planets, space exploration, and delves into related questions regarding it."
33,0345376595,http://goodreads.com/user/show/41735508-noah-goats,3,"Carl Sagan was a gifted thinker and writer, and all his talents are on display in Pale Blue Dot. He writes with more warmth and humanity than most science writers I've read, and it's easy to see how he became the preeminent popularizer of space related science of his day.Of course, his day was a few decades ago now, and as you read this book it soon becomes clear that astronomy and space exploration have made significant advances in the interim period (the number of exoplanets we know of, info from Curiosity and other probes, the age of the universe, all sorts of crap about Titan... our knowledge just keeps growing but this book cannot). Pale Blue Dot is a book that is beginning to show its age, and in many details this it is seriously out of date.I also wish Sagan didn't spend so much time in the first couple chapters talking about how finding out that we are not the literal center of the universe is some kind of blow to human self esteem. People believed earth was the center for a long time, and religions adopted this idea that appeared to be so obvious. But despite what Sagan and those science writers who followed him have to say, I don't believe many people have ever thought they were special because the earth was the center of the universe. Historically, people have been down on earth. For Christians the earth isn't much more than a dirty crust that barely does an adequate job of preventing us from falling straight into hell. Heaven is where it's at. Jesus ascended to the stars when he was done here. And (for pagans) when Julius Caesar was declared a god, a comet passing after his death was said to be his soul rising to take its place among the heavens. I wish Sagan hadn't spent so much time pummeling this particular straw man. Nevertheless, this is still a pretty good book, filled with ideas and arguments about the universe and our place in it that are unfailingly engaging. Sagan's knowledge and passion for his subject are matched by his ability as a writer. He makes the case for space exploration, including manned exploration without ignoring the costs, trade-offs, and dangers. It is in the chapters where Sagan argues for man's expansion into space that the book is at it's best. "
34,0345376595,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1959519-max-maxwell,5,"For the general part of this brief review, I should say that I think that this book was way ahead of its time. Some people will object to this, call it just another pop-sci book, and move on, decrying the science in it for already being out of date, a mere 15 years after publication. ""Obsolescence,"" however, ""is a fate devoutly to be wished,"" reminds Stephen Jay Gould. So what if some of this science is old hat? The vast, and I mean that, vast, majority of Sagan's predictions are already fact, especially his thoughts on the then, and now, burgeoning field of exoplanetary science. I say that Sagan was ahead of his time not because of any particular science in question, though, but because centuries from now, when we have colonized the solar system and its myriad worlds are known to us, we will be able to look at Sagan as the one guy who was on the right track at the end of the twentieth century, whereas most people even at the start of the twenty-first were finding excuses not to spacefar and search for extraterrestrial life. ""SETI,"" remarks Sagan, ""costs less than one attack helicopter a year."" We spend so much on killing each other and so little on exploring together, on being human. Read this book like some people read the Bible and spread the word in the same way; baby steps, eh?As for the edition, it was convenient for me, listening on an iPod at work in a kitchen. But it consists of Sagan reading the abridged edition and J. Charles, an OK, but not noteworthy, narrator, rounding out the remainder, that is, 3 hours of Sagan, 7 of Charles. Go for the illustrated copy of the paperback if you have more time on your hands; I also own that one and turned to it as an augmentation of my listening here."
35,0345376595,http://goodreads.com/user/show/38148349-benjamin-atkinson,5,"To say Carl Sagan is under-rated is probably a stretch for most people; not me. He is one of the most rare of intellectuals; a genius who is grounded and can explain incredibly complicated concepts in simple language without losing information. He is a humane man that does not denigrate others beliefs while strongly espousing his own. Pale Blue Dot is once again very deep but incredibly simple. The farther we go out in space to photograph the planet we all share the signifcance the smaller it appears. The artificial lines that we shortsightedly fight over disappear from this perspective. He really emphasizes the importance of uniting through this realization and take care of our shared home. He talks about the history of physics and astronomy and how religion has distorted and perverted in some cases what are the true natural laws that truly rule our lives. Like many of his books, I strongly recommend this one. It is an academic education and a spiritual enlightenment. I have read all of his books and love them all. If I had to pick two books by Carl Sagan that I think everyone should read it would be ""In a Demon-Haunted World-Science as a Candle in the Dark"" and then this one in that order. Great."
36,0345376595,http://goodreads.com/user/show/13249932-fred,4,"This book represents my first toe-dip into Sagan's writing. He was, as we all know, brilliant. And he was quite the gifted writer. This book may not be enjoyable to the sternly devout religious readers whose belief systems rigidly tether them to unwavering dogma. In fact, I wager most of that segment of the population won't make it through the first chapter before tossing this book in the trash bin. For the rest of us, Sagan leads us through an elegant tour of scientific inquiry into the origins of the universe, of man and his place in it. This reader found it very easy to apply Sagan's thoughts to an assessment of current perceptions and misconceptions about our own importance and our own behaviors as inhabitants of Earth.If there is a downside to this book, it is that Dr. Sagan may go to greater lengths than necessary to make his points. Being a man of science, he was careful to supply lots of supporting evidence. Occasionally in this book, he comes across as pounding home the point that could have easily been laid out before moving on. It's an interesting read. "
37,0345376595,http://goodreads.com/user/show/44354532-simo-ibourki,5,"This is my second book by Carl Sagan (the first was his novel Contact)If Marx's The Capital is communism manifesto, Pale Blue Dot is space exploration manifesto. Sagan talks about nearly everything related to the universe, the place of humans in it, what we have discovered and what we are still searching for (From the formation of our solar system to the apearance of humans to the beginings of space exploration and the future possibilities)Carl Sagan knows how to explain complex scientific concepts and methods in a readable style that any normal non-scientific human like me can understand.Reading about Sagan's vision of the future of humanity was for me the best part of this book, it really makes conflicts and misjudgements futile and non-sense. Space exploration and colonisation will help humans unify their powers and technologies to serve one big goal which is the survival of humanity. "
38,0345376595,http://goodreads.com/user/show/10013767-jeff-mauch,5,"Carl Sagan has this way of describing the moons, planets and vastness of the universe in a way that makes the reader feel like anything is possible for the human race. Sagan had such a sense of wonder when it came to his prose that you couldn't help but be moved by it. In Pale Blue Dot, Sagan summarizes the discoveries and wonders of the universe up to the late 90s and then ponders and describes his view of the coming decades and millennia. Even though this book is 20 years old, its still a much read for anyone interested in space or the possible future of the human race. It's a shame Sagan is no longer with us, while I enjoy the likes of Neil Degrasse Tyson and Bill Nye, nobody expresses the true wonders of the universe in the same way that Sagan did. He was one of a kind and this is probably his greatest work. "
39,0345376595,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3002008-joshua-woodbury,3,"The first part of this book really bugged me. Sagan explains how ridiculous it is for humans to believe that we have a purpose. That is just part of egocentric human nature trying to put itself at the center of the universe. I mean, people once thought the sun rotated around the earth. That wasn't true, so it logically follows that there is no designer to the universe. I don't care that he holds his beliefs, I just do not see what spending so much time on them had to do with our future of space exploration.His look at the planets in our solar system and the future terraforming and space travel were interesting. However, I don't think the case was very strong for the main thrust of his book - that space exploration needs to be a strong priority for us."
40,0345376595,http://goodreads.com/user/show/8303742-subbu,5,"An excellent read.Hadn't read any other books by Sagan before; so wasn't sure what to expect, but impressed by how simply he puts things across. Infectious enthusiasm for curiosity, a great tour of the planets and their moons - and tempered with caution.Brilliant vision about man's possible steps in the future out there among the planets and stars : but before which, we need to set our own home - our insignificant pale blue dot, other than which we have no home as of now - in order, and need to make changes to our institutions - political, economic, religious - whether we like it or not, and stand united, and gain wisdom and not just smartness - if we are not to destroy ourselves before ever stepping out."
41,0345376595,http://goodreads.com/user/show/15862910-steve-granger,5,"Carl Sagan stirs within his readers a passion to adventure and learn, to never stop being curious, and to ultimately reach for the stars. When you listen to the ramblings of dreamers and wanderers about galavanting over the universe, you can't help but be skeptical. But having the benefit of hindsight, it is amazing to have seen so many of Sagan's ideas come to reality. It was as though I was reading a manual for explorers from 1994 to present day. This has to have been by far my favourite book by Sagan, as his passion and genius jumps out at you in every chapter, whether he is exploring distant galaxies to our very egos. A must read for the curious."
42,0345376595,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1444324-leela,5,"It is a visual marvel. Carl Sagan takes us out of our small planet to the edges of Solar System, Andromeda, Oort Clouds, M33, Milky Way and worlds that we either do not know exist or do not enough about those. I do not think I can do justice to this book in this review. I have never been a big reader of space books but boy, thanks to a dear friend, I took my first step with a giant in the field. Read it, it will open your eyes to possibilities beyond our imagination. To top it all off, the language, phew! So compelling, so vivid, so masterful and so moving. I have to now find my way to other works of Carl Sagan."

If hiking up a mountain makes one feel small and impressed by the sublimity of massive things, then the realization and contemplation of these massive massive balls of fire and metal, of astronomical dimensions and masses, will do no less than sending a thrill down one's spine.Read more astronomy and be less of a country bumpkin."

This book is mad intelligent. When a world renowned astronomer, astrophysicist, cosmologist... (the list goes on) happens to be an amazing writer and science communicator, he brings to this world nothing but genius works and ideas that hold so much value until this day (PBD is 26 years old which is very old for a scientific informative book, yet still a highly recommended one for all space enthusiasts). The marriage of science, history and politics (just a little bit, only the important, necessary facts were included) was finely executed. This book complements Cosmos very well, they give you the answers to the many space questions you ask yourself. I also love that Ann Druyan, a woman I look up to a lot, worked on this masterpiece too. We are immensely lucky that the universe created these people with their beautiful minds and their amazing work. We are also crazy lucky for this Pale Blue Dot (aslo known as Earth) of ours. "

If only we could come together as a race and work towards a common goal, we could achieve so much more. An absolute jewel of a book. "
54,0345376595,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3744803-chris,3,"The title of this book gets its name from the famous photograph taken by Voyager 1 in 1990 as the spacecraft was leaving our Solar System. Due to Carl Sagan's urging, NASA agreed to point Voyager 1's camera toward Earth when it was about 3.7 billion miles from our planet and capture the image. The photo shows our planet Earth as a minuscule dot in the vast expanse of space. Sagan was trying to show how small our home is and at the same time emphasize the vastness of the universe in which we live. Pale Blue Dot is the sequel to Cosmos and devotes time to describing the Solar System and characteristics of several of the planets and moons. Sagan discusses ways in which humans could travel to, and potentially inhabit these planets and moons."

“It is sometimes said that scientists are unromantic, that their passion to figure out robs the world of beauty and mystery. But is it not stirring to understand how the world actually works — that white light is made of colors, that color is the way we perceive the wavelengths of light, that transparent air reflects light, that in so doing it discriminates among the waves, and that the sky is blue for the same reason that the sunset is red? It does no harm to the romance of the sunset to know a little bit about it.”
I’ll be honest – I wish I could quote almost the entirety of this book just to show how wonderfully  Carl Sagan marries science, philosophy, and a sense of wonderment, and molds it all into literary poetry.Most widely known for the television series Cosmos, Sagan was a beloved planetary scientist and astronomer who popularized science, raised awareness for global warming, and did a myriad of other things that inspired people from all around the world.Where his book  Cosmos read as a more scientific journey throughout the universe, explaining core concepts of planetology and astronomy,  Pale Blue Dot takes a broader approach – and dives into the history and future of humanity’s journey into space.Every one of his works has a slightly philosophical approach; Sagan never examines things out of their context, and takes into careful consideration the history, environment, mindset, intent, and even global politics of his topics. He tackles complex issues – from the origins of Venus’ atmosphere to Cold War mindsets that contributed to the smooth and successful funding of Apollo II – and in an easy, accessible way without ever using too much technical jargon.His intelligence and insight give the exploration of the wanderlust in us humans a realistic tone, and he remains optimistic throughout. Even as he examines humanity’s lesser moments, our faults and our frailty, he calls us to action and allows us to hope; if we realize what we’re doing to ourselves, the environment, and the Earth itself, we can choose to do what’s right for all of us. There is no bleakness as Sagan looks out to the stars, and you realize that we might yet scale heaven sometime in the future. And below that all is science that propels his arguments and clarifies his train of thought.It’s illuminating, it’s mind-blowing, and it’s just such a damn joy to read. I’ve never met a writer who could do this – capture the joy, the wonder, the uttermost bedazzlement at how small you are in such a big universe, and how beautiful that realization is.To me, science could never be cold and unromantic. And Sagan can tell you why."
56,0345376595,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1271545-david,4,"Carl Sagan has a wonderful ability to share his passion for science and the natural world. He's an excellent writer, and does a very good job of making astronomy accessible without dumbing it down. Reading this took me back to my childhood and the wonder I felt when I thought about the natural world (universe) and how incredible it is. It also reminded me that science can be fun, regardless of how dull most schooling makes it. A wonderful book, and I would highly recommend it to EVERYONE. My only issue with the book, and the only thing keeping me from giving it 5 stars, is that Sagan gives the human race too much credit. For most of the book, he talks about the universe, what we know, and what is actually there. For the last 50 or so pages, he speculates on where human space travel will go over the next few thousand years. Now Carl, you're obviously a brilliant man, and I have endless respect for your scientific mind and accomplishments, but doesn't that strike you as a bit naive? I mean, humans can't wait to kill each other. Most countries put more into defense (or offense, depending on how you look at it) than education, which means that if we don't manage to destroy each other with our big guns, we'll be too stupid to avoid destroying ourselves some other way. I mean, in the thousands of years we've had, we've been unable to get our shit together within individual homes, much less the planet as a whole. Even if we gained the capability to move onto other planets/asteroids, I don't think that'd solve anything. Then there would just be new, larger targets for our guns. Grr. Okay, human-hating rant aside, it's a great book. Read it. If you're less cynical than I am, you'll like it all the more. "
57,0345376595,http://goodreads.com/user/show/52241811-reed-melvin,5,"There are countless writers out there providing us with insights on nature's mysteries. None of them, however, quite reach the breadth of view or magical feeling that Carl Sagan gives. His writings explained topics ranging from quantum particles to the extent of the cosmos. Along the way, he addressed evolution, space engineering and countless other facets of science and technology. Even fiction wasn't beyond his grasp. Pale Blue Dot is a journey in time and space. Beginning with the assertion that we're natural wanderers, being the only species to settle across our world, it continues with a plea to extend further our exploration of space. The early chapters challenge restrictions on our desire to explore and learn. Sagan demonstrates how foolish minds have restrained our quest for knowledge of the cosmos. He then takes us on a tour of the solar system, exhibiting the wonders revealed by the fleet of robot probes. He reminds us of the forces the cosmos can unleash, sometimes right in our neighborhood. Sagan was awed by the collision of a comet with the Jovian gas giant. It was a hint of what might lay in store for us if we fail to understand the universe better than we do now. The space probes also returned images of worlds invalidating existing theories of planetary formation. If our own neighbors can present such bizarre structures, what kinds of worlds lay out beyond our own planetary community? Anyone even slightly interested in space sciences, or just curious about a potential future and other perspectives, should definitely read this book."
58,0345376595,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5882124-kevin-cecil,4,"Sagan spends the first part of PALE BLUE DOT reminding us of the insignificance of Earth and it's denizens within the enormity of our universe. The second part looks at what we've done to expand our existence beyond one planet, with special attention to the Voyager missions. The third part becomes more speculative, acknowledging that the Sun and Earth are not infinite. That, if we want to survive, we will eventually - in about 7 billon years - have to leave Earth if we don't want to get swallowed up by the Sun. His argument being that it is never too early to start thinking about Plan(et) B.The first chapter, where Sagan describes the Pale Blue Dot image of Earth as captured by Voyager while leaving Saturn's orbit, is simply my favorite written passage in all of human history. The prose is beautiful, the ideas astonishing in their complexity, the message profound in its simplicity. I have listened to that passage well over a hundred times. The book as a whole though, while fantastic, doesn't quite live up to it's opening. The arguments, history and sci-fi predictions are laid out in greater depth, with Sagan's typical poetic accessibility; but nothing else resonates like that astonishing passage. That is to say, if you read nothing else in your entire life, at least read the first chapter of PALE BLUE DOT. And if you have plenty of life and reading plans left, the rest is certainly worth catching up with. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XH7ZR..."

So in addition to the rigorous scientific accuracy and sense of wonder common to all Sagan's writing, there's also a palpable sense of wistfulness. ""I know I won't make it with you"", he seems to be saying, ""but you should start here...""The beauty and the wistfulness of Pale Blue Dot has had a curious side effect on our culture. The language of the book is so beautiful, so full of hope, that in recent years a small cottage industry has grown up around producing ""Carl Sagan"" videos: examples of digital animations showing the wonders of the universe, narrated by Sagan's audiobook recording of Pale Blue Dot. Those of us who write wish our books to be read while we're still alive. Sagan's are inspiring art, 20 years after he died. "

It was thought provoking, mind boggling, brilliant. It made me think about existence and the nature of this world. It made me look up and look around myself. It made me look at things I otherwise wouldn’t have paid attention to. (If you are a fan of Sapiens by Yuval Noah Harari, you’ll love it.) Though the first two chapters were amazing, sadly I had to drag myself to finish the other twenty. It was mostly about other planets, space exploration, and delves into related questions regarding it."
63,0345376595,http://goodreads.com/user/show/41735508-noah-goats,3,"Carl Sagan was a gifted thinker and writer, and all his talents are on display in Pale Blue Dot. He writes with more warmth and humanity than most science writers I've read, and it's easy to see how he became the preeminent popularizer of space related science of his day.Of course, his day was a few decades ago now, and as you read this book it soon becomes clear that astronomy and space exploration have made significant advances in the interim period (the number of exoplanets we know of, info from Curiosity and other probes, the age of the universe, all sorts of crap about Titan... our knowledge just keeps growing but this book cannot). Pale Blue Dot is a book that is beginning to show its age, and in many details this it is seriously out of date.I also wish Sagan didn't spend so much time in the first couple chapters talking about how finding out that we are not the literal center of the universe is some kind of blow to human self esteem. People believed earth was the center for a long time, and religions adopted this idea that appeared to be so obvious. But despite what Sagan and those science writers who followed him have to say, I don't believe many people have ever thought they were special because the earth was the center of the universe. Historically, people have been down on earth. For Christians the earth isn't much more than a dirty crust that barely does an adequate job of preventing us from falling straight into hell. Heaven is where it's at. Jesus ascended to the stars when he was done here. And (for pagans) when Julius Caesar was declared a god, a comet passing after his death was said to be his soul rising to take its place among the heavens. I wish Sagan hadn't spent so much time pummeling this particular straw man. Nevertheless, this is still a pretty good book, filled with ideas and arguments about the universe and our place in it that are unfailingly engaging. Sagan's knowledge and passion for his subject are matched by his ability as a writer. He makes the case for space exploration, including manned exploration without ignoring the costs, trade-offs, and dangers. It is in the chapters where Sagan argues for man's expansion into space that the book is at it's best. "
64,0345376595,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1959519-max-maxwell,5,"For the general part of this brief review, I should say that I think that this book was way ahead of its time. Some people will object to this, call it just another pop-sci book, and move on, decrying the science in it for already being out of date, a mere 15 years after publication. ""Obsolescence,"" however, ""is a fate devoutly to be wished,"" reminds Stephen Jay Gould. So what if some of this science is old hat? The vast, and I mean that, vast, majority of Sagan's predictions are already fact, especially his thoughts on the then, and now, burgeoning field of exoplanetary science. I say that Sagan was ahead of his time not because of any particular science in question, though, but because centuries from now, when we have colonized the solar system and its myriad worlds are known to us, we will be able to look at Sagan as the one guy who was on the right track at the end of the twentieth century, whereas most people even at the start of the twenty-first were finding excuses not to spacefar and search for extraterrestrial life. ""SETI,"" remarks Sagan, ""costs less than one attack helicopter a year."" We spend so much on killing each other and so little on exploring together, on being human. Read this book like some people read the Bible and spread the word in the same way; baby steps, eh?As for the edition, it was convenient for me, listening on an iPod at work in a kitchen. But it consists of Sagan reading the abridged edition and J. Charles, an OK, but not noteworthy, narrator, rounding out the remainder, that is, 3 hours of Sagan, 7 of Charles. Go for the illustrated copy of the paperback if you have more time on your hands; I also own that one and turned to it as an augmentation of my listening here."
65,0345376595,http://goodreads.com/user/show/38148349-benjamin-atkinson,5,"To say Carl Sagan is under-rated is probably a stretch for most people; not me. He is one of the most rare of intellectuals; a genius who is grounded and can explain incredibly complicated concepts in simple language without losing information. He is a humane man that does not denigrate others beliefs while strongly espousing his own. Pale Blue Dot is once again very deep but incredibly simple. The farther we go out in space to photograph the planet we all share the signifcance the smaller it appears. The artificial lines that we shortsightedly fight over disappear from this perspective. He really emphasizes the importance of uniting through this realization and take care of our shared home. He talks about the history of physics and astronomy and how religion has distorted and perverted in some cases what are the true natural laws that truly rule our lives. Like many of his books, I strongly recommend this one. It is an academic education and a spiritual enlightenment. I have read all of his books and love them all. If I had to pick two books by Carl Sagan that I think everyone should read it would be ""In a Demon-Haunted World-Science as a Candle in the Dark"" and then this one in that order. Great."
66,0345376595,http://goodreads.com/user/show/13249932-fred,4,"This book represents my first toe-dip into Sagan's writing. He was, as we all know, brilliant. And he was quite the gifted writer. This book may not be enjoyable to the sternly devout religious readers whose belief systems rigidly tether them to unwavering dogma. In fact, I wager most of that segment of the population won't make it through the first chapter before tossing this book in the trash bin. For the rest of us, Sagan leads us through an elegant tour of scientific inquiry into the origins of the universe, of man and his place in it. This reader found it very easy to apply Sagan's thoughts to an assessment of current perceptions and misconceptions about our own importance and our own behaviors as inhabitants of Earth.If there is a downside to this book, it is that Dr. Sagan may go to greater lengths than necessary to make his points. Being a man of science, he was careful to supply lots of supporting evidence. Occasionally in this book, he comes across as pounding home the point that could have easily been laid out before moving on. It's an interesting read. "
67,0345376595,http://goodreads.com/user/show/44354532-simo-ibourki,5,"This is my second book by Carl Sagan (the first was his novel Contact)If Marx's The Capital is communism manifesto, Pale Blue Dot is space exploration manifesto. Sagan talks about nearly everything related to the universe, the place of humans in it, what we have discovered and what we are still searching for (From the formation of our solar system to the apearance of humans to the beginings of space exploration and the future possibilities)Carl Sagan knows how to explain complex scientific concepts and methods in a readable style that any normal non-scientific human like me can understand.Reading about Sagan's vision of the future of humanity was for me the best part of this book, it really makes conflicts and misjudgements futile and non-sense. Space exploration and colonisation will help humans unify their powers and technologies to serve one big goal which is the survival of humanity. "
68,0345376595,http://goodreads.com/user/show/10013767-jeff-mauch,5,"Carl Sagan has this way of describing the moons, planets and vastness of the universe in a way that makes the reader feel like anything is possible for the human race. Sagan had such a sense of wonder when it came to his prose that you couldn't help but be moved by it. In Pale Blue Dot, Sagan summarizes the discoveries and wonders of the universe up to the late 90s and then ponders and describes his view of the coming decades and millennia. Even though this book is 20 years old, its still a much read for anyone interested in space or the possible future of the human race. It's a shame Sagan is no longer with us, while I enjoy the likes of Neil Degrasse Tyson and Bill Nye, nobody expresses the true wonders of the universe in the same way that Sagan did. He was one of a kind and this is probably his greatest work. "
69,0345376595,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3002008-joshua-woodbury,3,"The first part of this book really bugged me. Sagan explains how ridiculous it is for humans to believe that we have a purpose. That is just part of egocentric human nature trying to put itself at the center of the universe. I mean, people once thought the sun rotated around the earth. That wasn't true, so it logically follows that there is no designer to the universe. I don't care that he holds his beliefs, I just do not see what spending so much time on them had to do with our future of space exploration.His look at the planets in our solar system and the future terraforming and space travel were interesting. However, I don't think the case was very strong for the main thrust of his book - that space exploration needs to be a strong priority for us."
70,0345376595,http://goodreads.com/user/show/8303742-subbu,5,"An excellent read.Hadn't read any other books by Sagan before; so wasn't sure what to expect, but impressed by how simply he puts things across. Infectious enthusiasm for curiosity, a great tour of the planets and their moons - and tempered with caution.Brilliant vision about man's possible steps in the future out there among the planets and stars : but before which, we need to set our own home - our insignificant pale blue dot, other than which we have no home as of now - in order, and need to make changes to our institutions - political, economic, religious - whether we like it or not, and stand united, and gain wisdom and not just smartness - if we are not to destroy ourselves before ever stepping out."
71,0345376595,http://goodreads.com/user/show/15862910-steve-granger,5,"Carl Sagan stirs within his readers a passion to adventure and learn, to never stop being curious, and to ultimately reach for the stars. When you listen to the ramblings of dreamers and wanderers about galavanting over the universe, you can't help but be skeptical. But having the benefit of hindsight, it is amazing to have seen so many of Sagan's ideas come to reality. It was as though I was reading a manual for explorers from 1994 to present day. This has to have been by far my favourite book by Sagan, as his passion and genius jumps out at you in every chapter, whether he is exploring distant galaxies to our very egos. A must read for the curious."

Read it, it will open your eyes to possibilities beyond our imagination. To top it all off, the language, phew! So compelling, so vivid, so masterful and so moving.

This book is mad intelligent. When a world renowned astronomer, astrophysicist, cosmologist... (the list goes on) happens to be an amazing writer and science communicator, he brings to this world nothing but genius works and ideas that hold so much value until this day (PBD is 26 years old which is very old for a scientific informative book, yet still a highly recommended one for all space enthusiasts). The marriage of science, history and politics (just a little bit, only the important, necessary facts were included) was finely executed. This book complements Cosmos very well, they give you the answers to the many space questions you ask yourself. I also love that Ann Druyan, a woman I look up to a lot, worked on this masterpiece too. We are immensely lucky that the universe created these people with their beautiful minds and their amazing work. We are also crazy lucky for this Pale Blue Dot (aslo known as Earth) of ours. "

83,0345376595,http://goodreads.com/user/show/11463357-suraj,5,"What can I say about this book, that hasn't already been said. Carl Sagan is a hero to a lot of people. Why wouldn't he be, he is a brilliant astrophysicist and an even better writer. Pale Blue Dot makes you think about the progress of life, the vastness of the universe, our place in the big picture. If only we could come together as a race and work towards a common goal, we could achieve so much more. An absolute jewel of a book. "
84,0345376595,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3744803-chris,3,"The title of this book gets its name from the famous photograph taken by Voyager 1 in 1990 as the spacecraft was leaving our Solar System. Due to Carl Sagan's urging, NASA agreed to point Voyager 1's camera toward Earth when it was about 3.7 billion miles from our planet and capture the image. The photo shows our planet Earth as a minuscule dot in the vast expanse of space. Sagan was trying to show how small our home is and at the same time emphasize the vastness of the universe in which we live. Pale Blue Dot is the sequel to Cosmos and devotes time to describing the Solar System and characteristics of several of the planets and moons. Sagan discusses ways in which humans could travel to, and potentially inhabit these planets and moons."

“It is sometimes said that scientists are unromantic, that their passion to figure out robs the world of beauty and mystery. But is it not stirring to understand how the world actually works — that white light is made of colors, that color is the way we perceive the wavelengths of light, that transparent air reflects light, that in so doing it discriminates among the waves, and that the sky is blue for the same reason that the sunset is red? It does no harm to the romance of the sunset to know a little bit about it.”
I’ll be honest – I wish I could quote almost the entirety of this book just to show how wonderfully  Carl Sagan marries science, philosophy, and a sense of wonderment, and molds it all into literary poetry.Most widely known for the television series Cosmos, Sagan was a beloved planetary scientist and astronomer who popularized science, raised awareness for global warming, and did a myriad of other things that inspired people from all around the world.Where his book  Cosmos read as a more scientific journey throughout the universe, explaining core concepts of planetology and astronomy,  Pale Blue Dot takes a broader approach – and dives into the history and future of humanity’s journey into space.Every one of his works has a slightly philosophical approach; Sagan never examines things out of their context, and takes into careful consideration the history, environment, mindset, intent, and even global politics of his topics. He tackles complex issues – from the origins of Venus’ atmosphere to Cold War mindsets that contributed to the smooth and successful funding of Apollo II – and in an easy, accessible way without ever using too much technical jargon.His intelligence and insight give the exploration of the wanderlust in us humans a realistic tone, and he remains optimistic throughout. Even as he examines humanity’s lesser moments, our faults and our frailty, he calls us to action and allows us to hope; if we realize what we’re doing to ourselves, the environment, and the Earth itself, we can choose to do what’s right for all of us. There is no bleakness as Sagan looks out to the stars, and you realize that we might yet scale heaven sometime in the future. And below that all is science that propels his arguments and clarifies his train of thought.It’s illuminating, it’s mind-blowing, and it’s just such a damn joy to read. I’ve never met a writer who could do this – capture the joy, the wonder, the uttermost bedazzlement at how small you are in such a big universe, and how beautiful that realization is.To me, science could never be cold and unromantic. And Sagan can tell you why."
86,0345376595,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1271545-david,4,"Carl Sagan has a wonderful ability to share his passion for science and the natural world. He's an excellent writer, and does a very good job of making astronomy accessible without dumbing it down. Reading this took me back to my childhood and the wonder I felt when I thought about the natural world (universe) and how incredible it is. It also reminded me that science can be fun, regardless of how dull most schooling makes it. A wonderful book, and I would highly recommend it to EVERYONE. My only issue with the book, and the only thing keeping me from giving it 5 stars, is that Sagan gives the human race too much credit. For most of the book, he talks about the universe, what we know, and what is actually there. For the last 50 or so pages, he speculates on where human space travel will go over the next few thousand years. Now Carl, you're obviously a brilliant man, and I have endless respect for your scientific mind and accomplishments, but doesn't that strike you as a bit naive? I mean, humans can't wait to kill each other. Most countries put more into defense (or offense, depending on how you look at it) than education, which means that if we don't manage to destroy each other with our big guns, we'll be too stupid to avoid destroying ourselves some other way. I mean, in the thousands of years we've had, we've been unable to get our shit together within individual homes, much less the planet as a whole. Even if we gained the capability to move onto other planets/asteroids, I don't think that'd solve anything. Then there would just be new, larger targets for our guns. Grr. Okay, human-hating rant aside, it's a great book. Read it. If you're less cynical than I am, you'll like it all the more. "
87,0345376595,http://goodreads.com/user/show/52241811-reed-melvin,5,"There are countless writers out there providing us with insights on nature's mysteries. None of them, however, quite reach the breadth of view or magical feeling that Carl Sagan gives. His writings explained topics ranging from quantum particles to the extent of the cosmos. Along the way, he addressed evolution, space engineering and countless other facets of science and technology. Even fiction wasn't beyond his grasp. Pale Blue Dot is a journey in time and space. Beginning with the assertion that we're natural wanderers, being the only species to settle across our world, it continues with a plea to extend further our exploration of space. The early chapters challenge restrictions on our desire to explore and learn. Sagan demonstrates how foolish minds have restrained our quest for knowledge of the cosmos. He then takes us on a tour of the solar system, exhibiting the wonders revealed by the fleet of robot probes. He reminds us of the forces the cosmos can unleash, sometimes right in our neighborhood. Sagan was awed by the collision of a comet with the Jovian gas giant. It was a hint of what might lay in store for us if we fail to understand the universe better than we do now. The space probes also returned images of worlds invalidating existing theories of planetary formation. If our own neighbors can present such bizarre structures, what kinds of worlds lay out beyond our own planetary community? Anyone even slightly interested in space sciences, or just curious about a potential future and other perspectives, should definitely read this book."
88,0345376595,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5882124-kevin-cecil,4,"Sagan spends the first part of PALE BLUE DOT reminding us of the insignificance of Earth and it's denizens within the enormity of our universe. The second part looks at what we've done to expand our existence beyond one planet, with special attention to the Voyager missions. The third part becomes more speculative, acknowledging that the Sun and Earth are not infinite. That, if we want to survive, we will eventually - in about 7 billon years - have to leave Earth if we don't want to get swallowed up by the Sun. His argument being that it is never too early to start thinking about Plan(et) B.The first chapter, where Sagan describes the Pale Blue Dot image of Earth as captured by Voyager while leaving Saturn's orbit, is simply my favorite written passage in all of human history. The prose is beautiful, the ideas astonishing in their complexity, the message profound in its simplicity. I have listened to that passage well over a hundred times. The book as a whole though, while fantastic, doesn't quite live up to it's opening. The arguments, history and sci-fi predictions are laid out in greater depth, with Sagan's typical poetic accessibility; but nothing else resonates like that astonishing passage. That is to say, if you read nothing else in your entire life, at least read the first chapter of PALE BLUE DOT. And if you have plenty of life and reading plans left, the rest is certainly worth catching up with. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XH7ZR..."

So in addition to the rigorous scientific accuracy and sense of wonder common to all Sagan's writing, there's also a palpable sense of wistfulness. ""I know I won't make it with you"", he seems to be saying, ""but you should start here...""The beauty and the wistfulness of Pale Blue Dot has had a curious side effect on our culture. The language of the book is so beautiful, so full of hope, that in recent years a small cottage industry has grown up around producing ""Carl Sagan"" videos: examples of digital animations showing the wonders of the universe, narrated by Sagan's audiobook recording of Pale Blue Dot. Those of us who write wish our books to be read while we're still alive. Sagan's are inspiring art, 20 years after he died. "

It was thought provoking, mind boggling, brilliant. It made me think about existence and the nature of this world. It made me look up and look around myself. It made me look at things I otherwise wouldn’t have paid attention to. (If you are a fan of Sapiens by Yuval Noah Harari, you’ll love it.) Though the first two chapters were amazing, sadly I had to drag myself to finish the other twenty. It was mostly about other planets, space exploration, and delves into related questions regarding it."
93,0345376595,http://goodreads.com/user/show/41735508-noah-goats,3,"Carl Sagan was a gifted thinker and writer, and all his talents are on display in Pale Blue Dot. He writes with more warmth and humanity than most science writers I've read, and it's easy to see how he became the preeminent popularizer of space related science of his day.Of course, his day was a few decades ago now, and as you read this book it soon becomes clear that astronomy and space exploration have made significant advances in the interim period (the number of exoplanets we know of, info from Curiosity and other probes, the age of the universe, all sorts of crap about Titan... our knowledge just keeps growing but this book cannot). Pale Blue Dot is a book that is beginning to show its age, and in many details this it is seriously out of date.I also wish Sagan didn't spend so much time in the first couple chapters talking about how finding out that we are not the literal center of the universe is some kind of blow to human self esteem. People believed earth was the center for a long time, and religions adopted this idea that appeared to be so obvious. But despite what Sagan and those science writers who followed him have to say, I don't believe many people have ever thought they were special because the earth was the center of the universe. Historically, people have been down on earth. For Christians the earth isn't much more than a dirty crust that barely does an adequate job of preventing us from falling straight into hell. Heaven is where it's at. Jesus ascended to the stars when he was done here. And (for pagans) when Julius Caesar was declared a god, a comet passing after his death was said to be his soul rising to take its place among the heavens. I wish Sagan hadn't spent so much time pummeling this particular straw man. Nevertheless, this is still a pretty good book, filled with ideas and arguments about the universe and our place in it that are unfailingly engaging. Sagan's knowledge and passion for his subject are matched by his ability as a writer. He makes the case for space exploration, including manned exploration without ignoring the costs, trade-offs, and dangers. It is in the chapters where Sagan argues for man's expansion into space that the book is at it's best. "
94,0345376595,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1959519-max-maxwell,5,"For the general part of this brief review, I should say that I think that this book was way ahead of its time. Some people will object to this, call it just another pop-sci book, and move on, decrying the science in it for already being out of date, a mere 15 years after publication. ""Obsolescence,"" however, ""is a fate devoutly to be wished,"" reminds Stephen Jay Gould. So what if some of this science is old hat? The vast, and I mean that, vast, majority of Sagan's predictions are already fact, especially his thoughts on the then, and now, burgeoning field of exoplanetary science. I say that Sagan was ahead of his time not because of any particular science in question, though, but because centuries from now, when we have colonized the solar system and its myriad worlds are known to us, we will be able to look at Sagan as the one guy who was on the right track at the end of the twentieth century, whereas most people even at the start of the twenty-first were finding excuses not to spacefar and search for extraterrestrial life. ""SETI,"" remarks Sagan, ""costs less than one attack helicopter a year."" We spend so much on killing each other and so little on exploring together, on being human. Read this book like some people read the Bible and spread the word in the same way; baby steps, eh?As for the edition, it was convenient for me, listening on an iPod at work in a kitchen. But it consists of Sagan reading the abridged edition and J. Charles, an OK, but not noteworthy, narrator, rounding out the remainder, that is, 3 hours of Sagan, 7 of Charles. Go for the illustrated copy of the paperback if you have more time on your hands; I also own that one and turned to it as an augmentation of my listening here."
95,0345376595,http://goodreads.com/user/show/38148349-benjamin-atkinson,5,"To say Carl Sagan is under-rated is probably a stretch for most people; not me. He is one of the most rare of intellectuals; a genius who is grounded and can explain incredibly complicated concepts in simple language without losing information. He is a humane man that does not denigrate others beliefs while strongly espousing his own. Pale Blue Dot is once again very deep but incredibly simple. The farther we go out in space to photograph the planet we all share the signifcance the smaller it appears. The artificial lines that we shortsightedly fight over disappear from this perspective. He really emphasizes the importance of uniting through this realization and take care of our shared home. He talks about the history of physics and astronomy and how religion has distorted and perverted in some cases what are the true natural laws that truly rule our lives. Like many of his books, I strongly recommend this one. It is an academic education and a spiritual enlightenment. I have read all of his books and love them all. If I had to pick two books by Carl Sagan that I think everyone should read it would be ""In a Demon-Haunted World-Science as a Candle in the Dark"" and then this one in that order. Great."
96,0345376595,http://goodreads.com/user/show/13249932-fred,4,"This book represents my first toe-dip into Sagan's writing. He was, as we all know, brilliant. And he was quite the gifted writer. This book may not be enjoyable to the sternly devout religious readers whose belief systems rigidly tether them to unwavering dogma. In fact, I wager most of that segment of the population won't make it through the first chapter before tossing this book in the trash bin. For the rest of us, Sagan leads us through an elegant tour of scientific inquiry into the origins of the universe, of man and his place in it. This reader found it very easy to apply Sagan's thoughts to an assessment of current perceptions and misconceptions about our own importance and our own behaviors as inhabitants of Earth.If there is a downside to this book, it is that Dr. Sagan may go to greater lengths than necessary to make his points. Being a man of science, he was careful to supply lots of supporting evidence. Occasionally in this book, he comes across as pounding home the point that could have easily been laid out before moving on. It's an interesting read. "
97,0345376595,http://goodreads.com/user/show/44354532-simo-ibourki,5,"This is my second book by Carl Sagan (the first was his novel Contact)If Marx's The Capital is communism manifesto, Pale Blue Dot is space exploration manifesto. Sagan talks about nearly everything related to the universe, the place of humans in it, what we have discovered and what we are still searching for (From the formation of our solar system to the apearance of humans to the beginings of space exploration and the future possibilities)Carl Sagan knows how to explain complex scientific concepts and methods in a readable style that any normal non-scientific human like me can understand.Reading about Sagan's vision of the future of humanity was for me the best part of this book, it really makes conflicts and misjudgements futile and non-sense. Space exploration and colonisation will help humans unify their powers and technologies to serve one big goal which is the survival of humanity. "
98,0345376595,http://goodreads.com/user/show/10013767-jeff-mauch,5,"Carl Sagan has this way of describing the moons, planets and vastness of the universe in a way that makes the reader feel like anything is possible for the human race. Sagan had such a sense of wonder when it came to his prose that you couldn't help but be moved by it. In Pale Blue Dot, Sagan summarizes the discoveries and wonders of the universe up to the late 90s and then ponders and describes his view of the coming decades and millennia. Even though this book is 20 years old, its still a much read for anyone interested in space or the possible future of the human race. It's a shame Sagan is no longer with us, while I enjoy the likes of Neil Degrasse Tyson and Bill Nye, nobody expresses the true wonders of the universe in the same way that Sagan did. He was one of a kind and this is probably his greatest work. "
99,0345376595,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3002008-joshua-woodbury,3,"The first part of this book really bugged me. Sagan explains how ridiculous it is for humans to believe that we have a purpose. That is just part of egocentric human nature trying to put itself at the center of the universe. I mean, people once thought the sun rotated around the earth. That wasn't true, so it logically follows that there is no designer to the universe. I don't care that he holds his beliefs, I just do not see what spending so much time on them had to do with our future of space exploration.His look at the planets in our solar system and the future terraforming and space travel were interesting. However, I don't think the case was very strong for the main thrust of his book - that space exploration needs to be a strong priority for us."
100,0345376595,http://goodreads.com/user/show/8303742-subbu,5,"An excellent read.Hadn't read any other books by Sagan before; so wasn't sure what to expect, but impressed by how simply he puts things across. Infectious enthusiasm for curiosity, a great tour of the planets and their moons - and tempered with caution.Brilliant vision about man's possible steps in the future out there among the planets and stars : but before which, we need to set our own home - our insignificant pale blue dot, other than which we have no home as of now - in order, and need to make changes to our institutions - political, economic, religious - whether we like it or not, and stand united, and gain wisdom and not just smartness - if we are not to destroy ourselves before ever stepping out."
101,0345376595,http://goodreads.com/user/show/15862910-steve-granger,5,"Carl Sagan stirs within his readers a passion to adventure and learn, to never stop being curious, and to ultimately reach for the stars. When you listen to the ramblings of dreamers and wanderers about galavanting over the universe, you can't help but be skeptical. But having the benefit of hindsight, it is amazing to have seen so many of Sagan's ideas come to reality. It was as though I was reading a manual for explorers from 1994 to present day. This has to have been by far my favourite book by Sagan, as his passion and genius jumps out at you in every chapter, whether he is exploring distant galaxies to our very egos. A must read for the curious."

I do not think I can do justice to this book in this review. I have never been a big reader of space books but boy, thanks to a dear friend, I took my first step with a giant in the field. Read it, it will open your eyes to possibilities beyond our imagination. To top it all off, the language, phew! So compelling, so vivid, so masterful and so moving.

It was a great loss to the world when he died, and I don’t believe that anyone has since filled his shoes, even Neil deGrasse Tyson’s attempts fall short. Pale Blue Dot starts out with the history of our initial exploration of the solar system with robotic probes visiting the 70 or so bodies that have been explored. It goes on to describe possible future exploration of the solar system by humans including the risks and rewards of venturing down that path. "

This book is mad intelligent. When a world renowned astronomer, astrophysicist, cosmologist... (the list goes on) happens to be an amazing writer and science communicator, he brings to this world nothing but genius works and ideas that hold so much value until this day (PBD is 26 years old which is very old for a scientific informative book, yet still a highly recommended one for all space enthusiasts). The marriage of science, history and politics (just a little bit, only the important, necessary facts were included) was finely executed. This book complements Cosmos very well, they give you the answers to the many space questions you ask yourself. I also love that Ann Druyan, a woman I look up to a lot, worked on this masterpiece too. We are immensely lucky that the universe created these people with their beautiful minds and their amazing work. We are also crazy lucky for this Pale Blue Dot (aslo known as Earth) of ours. "

113,0345376595,http://goodreads.com/user/show/11463357-suraj,5,"What can I say about this book, that hasn't already been said. Carl Sagan is a hero to a lot of people. Why wouldn't he be, he is a brilliant astrophysicist and an even better writer. Pale Blue Dot makes you think about the progress of life, the vastness of the universe, our place in the big picture. If only we could come together as a race and work towards a common goal, we could achieve so much more. An absolute jewel of a book. "
114,0345376595,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3744803-chris,3,"The title of this book gets its name from the famous photograph taken by Voyager 1 in 1990 as the spacecraft was leaving our Solar System. Due to Carl Sagan's urging, NASA agreed to point Voyager 1's camera toward Earth when it was about 3.7 billion miles from our planet and capture the image. The photo shows our planet Earth as a minuscule dot in the vast expanse of space. Sagan was trying to show how small our home is and at the same time emphasize the vastness of the universe in which we live. Pale Blue Dot is the sequel to Cosmos and devotes time to describing the Solar System and characteristics of several of the planets and moons. Sagan discusses ways in which humans could travel to, and potentially inhabit these planets and moons."

“It is sometimes said that scientists are unromantic, that their passion to figure out robs the world of beauty and mystery. But is it not stirring to understand how the world actually works — that white light is made of colors, that color is the way we perceive the wavelengths of light, that transparent air reflects light, that in so doing it discriminates among the waves, and that the sky is blue for the same reason that the sunset is red? It does no harm to the romance of the sunset to know a little bit about it.”
I’ll be honest – I wish I could quote almost the entirety of this book just to show how wonderfully  Carl Sagan marries science, philosophy, and a sense of wonderment, and molds it all into literary poetry.Most widely known for the television series Cosmos, Sagan was a beloved planetary scientist and astronomer who popularized science, raised awareness for global warming, and did a myriad of other things that inspired people from all around the world.Where his book  Cosmos read as a more scientific journey throughout the universe, explaining core concepts of planetology and astronomy,  Pale Blue Dot takes a broader approach – and dives into the history and future of humanity’s journey into space.Every one of his works has a slightly philosophical approach; Sagan never examines things out of their context, and takes into careful consideration the history, environment, mindset, intent, and even global politics of his topics. He tackles complex issues – from the origins of Venus’ atmosphere to Cold War mindsets that contributed to the smooth and successful funding of Apollo II – and in an easy, accessible way without ever using too much technical jargon.His intelligence and insight give the exploration of the wanderlust in us humans a realistic tone, and he remains optimistic throughout. Even as he examines humanity’s lesser moments, our faults and our frailty, he calls us to action and allows us to hope; if we realize what we’re doing to ourselves, the environment, and the Earth itself, we can choose to do what’s right for all of us. There is no bleakness as Sagan looks out to the stars, and you realize that we might yet scale heaven sometime in the future. And below that all is science that propels his arguments and clarifies his train of thought.It’s illuminating, it’s mind-blowing, and it’s just such a damn joy to read. I’ve never met a writer who could do this – capture the joy, the wonder, the uttermost bedazzlement at how small you are in such a big universe, and how beautiful that realization is.To me, science could never be cold and unromantic. And Sagan can tell you why."
116,0345376595,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1271545-david,4,"Carl Sagan has a wonderful ability to share his passion for science and the natural world. He's an excellent writer, and does a very good job of making astronomy accessible without dumbing it down. Reading this took me back to my childhood and the wonder I felt when I thought about the natural world (universe) and how incredible it is. It also reminded me that science can be fun, regardless of how dull most schooling makes it. A wonderful book, and I would highly recommend it to EVERYONE. My only issue with the book, and the only thing keeping me from giving it 5 stars, is that Sagan gives the human race too much credit. For most of the book, he talks about the universe, what we know, and what is actually there. For the last 50 or so pages, he speculates on where human space travel will go over the next few thousand years. Now Carl, you're obviously a brilliant man, and I have endless respect for your scientific mind and accomplishments, but doesn't that strike you as a bit naive? I mean, humans can't wait to kill each other. Most countries put more into defense (or offense, depending on how you look at it) than education, which means that if we don't manage to destroy each other with our big guns, we'll be too stupid to avoid destroying ourselves some other way. I mean, in the thousands of years we've had, we've been unable to get our shit together within individual homes, much less the planet as a whole. Even if we gained the capability to move onto other planets/asteroids, I don't think that'd solve anything. Then there would just be new, larger targets for our guns. Grr. Okay, human-hating rant aside, it's a great book. Read it. If you're less cynical than I am, you'll like it all the more. "
117,0345376595,http://goodreads.com/user/show/52241811-reed-melvin,5,"There are countless writers out there providing us with insights on nature's mysteries. None of them, however, quite reach the breadth of view or magical feeling that Carl Sagan gives. His writings explained topics ranging from quantum particles to the extent of the cosmos. Along the way, he addressed evolution, space engineering and countless other facets of science and technology. Even fiction wasn't beyond his grasp. Pale Blue Dot is a journey in time and space. Beginning with the assertion that we're natural wanderers, being the only species to settle across our world, it continues with a plea to extend further our exploration of space. The early chapters challenge restrictions on our desire to explore and learn. Sagan demonstrates how foolish minds have restrained our quest for knowledge of the cosmos. He then takes us on a tour of the solar system, exhibiting the wonders revealed by the fleet of robot probes. He reminds us of the forces the cosmos can unleash, sometimes right in our neighborhood. Sagan was awed by the collision of a comet with the Jovian gas giant. It was a hint of what might lay in store for us if we fail to understand the universe better than we do now. The space probes also returned images of worlds invalidating existing theories of planetary formation. If our own neighbors can present such bizarre structures, what kinds of worlds lay out beyond our own planetary community? Anyone even slightly interested in space sciences, or just curious about a potential future and other perspectives, should definitely read this book."
118,0345376595,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5882124-kevin-cecil,4,"Sagan spends the first part of PALE BLUE DOT reminding us of the insignificance of Earth and it's denizens within the enormity of our universe. The second part looks at what we've done to expand our existence beyond one planet, with special attention to the Voyager missions. The third part becomes more speculative, acknowledging that the Sun and Earth are not infinite. That, if we want to survive, we will eventually - in about 7 billon years - have to leave Earth if we don't want to get swallowed up by the Sun. His argument being that it is never too early to start thinking about Plan(et) B.The first chapter, where Sagan describes the Pale Blue Dot image of Earth as captured by Voyager while leaving Saturn's orbit, is simply my favorite written passage in all of human history. The prose is beautiful, the ideas astonishing in their complexity, the message profound in its simplicity. I have listened to that passage well over a hundred times. The book as a whole though, while fantastic, doesn't quite live up to it's opening. The arguments, history and sci-fi predictions are laid out in greater depth, with Sagan's typical poetic accessibility; but nothing else resonates like that astonishing passage. That is to say, if you read nothing else in your entire life, at least read the first chapter of PALE BLUE DOT. And if you have plenty of life and reading plans left, the rest is certainly worth catching up with. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XH7ZR..."

So in addition to the rigorous scientific accuracy and sense of wonder common to all Sagan's writing, there's also a palpable sense of wistfulness. ""I know I won't make it with you"", he seems to be saying, ""but you should start here...""The beauty and the wistfulness of Pale Blue Dot has had a curious side effect on our culture. The language of the book is so beautiful, so full of hope, that in recent years a small cottage industry has grown up around producing ""Carl Sagan"" videos: examples of digital animations showing the wonders of the universe, narrated by Sagan's audiobook recording of Pale Blue Dot. Those of us who write wish our books to be read while we're still alive. Sagan's are inspiring art, 20 years after he died. "

122,0345376595,http://goodreads.com/user/show/57263951-nacho-santos,4,"Pale Blue Dot by Carl SaganListening to the first two chapters of this book, I was astonished. It was thought provoking, mind boggling, brilliant. It made me think about existence and the nature of this world. It made me look up and look around myself. It made me look at things I otherwise wouldn’t have paid attention to. (If you are a fan of Sapiens by Yuval Noah Harari, you’ll love it.) Though the first two chapters were amazing, sadly I had to drag myself to finish the other twenty. It was mostly about other planets, space exploration, and delves into related questions regarding it."
123,0345376595,http://goodreads.com/user/show/41735508-noah-goats,3,"Carl Sagan was a gifted thinker and writer, and all his talents are on display in Pale Blue Dot. He writes with more warmth and humanity than most science writers I've read, and it's easy to see how he became the preeminent popularizer of space related science of his day.Of course, his day was a few decades ago now, and as you read this book it soon becomes clear that astronomy and space exploration have made significant advances in the interim period (the number of exoplanets we know of, info from Curiosity and other probes, the age of the universe, all sorts of crap about Titan... our knowledge just keeps growing but this book cannot). Pale Blue Dot is a book that is beginning to show its age, and in many details this it is seriously out of date.I also wish Sagan didn't spend so much time in the first couple chapters talking about how finding out that we are not the literal center of the universe is some kind of blow to human self esteem. People believed earth was the center for a long time, and religions adopted this idea that appeared to be so obvious. But despite what Sagan and those science writers who followed him have to say, I don't believe many people have ever thought they were special because the earth was the center of the universe. Historically, people have been down on earth. For Christians the earth isn't much more than a dirty crust that barely does an adequate job of preventing us from falling straight into hell. Heaven is where it's at. Jesus ascended to the stars when he was done here. And (for pagans) when Julius Caesar was declared a god, a comet passing after his death was said to be his soul rising to take its place among the heavens. I wish Sagan hadn't spent so much time pummeling this particular straw man. Nevertheless, this is still a pretty good book, filled with ideas and arguments about the universe and our place in it that are unfailingly engaging. Sagan's knowledge and passion for his subject are matched by his ability as a writer. He makes the case for space exploration, including manned exploration without ignoring the costs, trade-offs, and dangers. It is in the chapters where Sagan argues for man's expansion into space that the book is at it's best. "
124,0345376595,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1959519-max-maxwell,5,"For the general part of this brief review, I should say that I think that this book was way ahead of its time. Some people will object to this, call it just another pop-sci book, and move on, decrying the science in it for already being out of date, a mere 15 years after publication. ""Obsolescence,"" however, ""is a fate devoutly to be wished,"" reminds Stephen Jay Gould. So what if some of this science is old hat? The vast, and I mean that, vast, majority of Sagan's predictions are already fact, especially his thoughts on the then, and now, burgeoning field of exoplanetary science. I say that Sagan was ahead of his time not because of any particular science in question, though, but because centuries from now, when we have colonized the solar system and its myriad worlds are known to us, we will be able to look at Sagan as the one guy who was on the right track at the end of the twentieth century, whereas most people even at the start of the twenty-first were finding excuses not to spacefar and search for extraterrestrial life. ""SETI,"" remarks Sagan, ""costs less than one attack helicopter a year."" We spend so much on killing each other and so little on exploring together, on being human. Read this book like some people read the Bible and spread the word in the same way; baby steps, eh?As for the edition, it was convenient for me, listening on an iPod at work in a kitchen. But it consists of Sagan reading the abridged edition and J. Charles, an OK, but not noteworthy, narrator, rounding out the remainder, that is, 3 hours of Sagan, 7 of Charles. Go for the illustrated copy of the paperback if you have more time on your hands; I also own that one and turned to it as an augmentation of my listening here."
125,0345376595,http://goodreads.com/user/show/38148349-benjamin-atkinson,5,"To say Carl Sagan is under-rated is probably a stretch for most people; not me. He is one of the most rare of intellectuals; a genius who is grounded and can explain incredibly complicated concepts in simple language without losing information. He is a humane man that does not denigrate others beliefs while strongly espousing his own. Pale Blue Dot is once again very deep but incredibly simple. The farther we go out in space to photograph the planet we all share the signifcance the smaller it appears. The artificial lines that we shortsightedly fight over disappear from this perspective. He really emphasizes the importance of uniting through this realization and take care of our shared home. He talks about the history of physics and astronomy and how religion has distorted and perverted in some cases what are the true natural laws that truly rule our lives. Like many of his books, I strongly recommend this one. It is an academic education and a spiritual enlightenment. I have read all of his books and love them all. If I had to pick two books by Carl Sagan that I think everyone should read it would be ""In a Demon-Haunted World-Science as a Candle in the Dark"" and then this one in that order. Great."
126,0345376595,http://goodreads.com/user/show/13249932-fred,4,"This book represents my first toe-dip into Sagan's writing. He was, as we all know, brilliant. And he was quite the gifted writer. This book may not be enjoyable to the sternly devout religious readers whose belief systems rigidly tether them to unwavering dogma. In fact, I wager most of that segment of the population won't make it through the first chapter before tossing this book in the trash bin. For the rest of us, Sagan leads us through an elegant tour of scientific inquiry into the origins of the universe, of man and his place in it. This reader found it very easy to apply Sagan's thoughts to an assessment of current perceptions and misconceptions about our own importance and our own behaviors as inhabitants of Earth.If there is a downside to this book, it is that Dr. Sagan may go to greater lengths than necessary to make his points. Being a man of science, he was careful to supply lots of supporting evidence. Occasionally in this book, he comes across as pounding home the point that could have easily been laid out before moving on. It's an interesting read. "
127,0345376595,http://goodreads.com/user/show/44354532-simo-ibourki,5,"This is my second book by Carl Sagan (the first was his novel Contact)If Marx's The Capital is communism manifesto, Pale Blue Dot is space exploration manifesto. Sagan talks about nearly everything related to the universe, the place of humans in it, what we have discovered and what we are still searching for (From the formation of our solar system to the apearance of humans to the beginings of space exploration and the future possibilities)Carl Sagan knows how to explain complex scientific concepts and methods in a readable style that any normal non-scientific human like me can understand.Reading about Sagan's vision of the future of humanity was for me the best part of this book, it really makes conflicts and misjudgements futile and non-sense. Space exploration and colonisation will help humans unify their powers and technologies to serve one big goal which is the survival of humanity. "
128,0345376595,http://goodreads.com/user/show/10013767-jeff-mauch,5,"Carl Sagan has this way of describing the moons, planets and vastness of the universe in a way that makes the reader feel like anything is possible for the human race. Sagan had such a sense of wonder when it came to his prose that you couldn't help but be moved by it. In Pale Blue Dot, Sagan summarizes the discoveries and wonders of the universe up to the late 90s and then ponders and describes his view of the coming decades and millennia. Even though this book is 20 years old, its still a much read for anyone interested in space or the possible future of the human race. It's a shame Sagan is no longer with us, while I enjoy the likes of Neil Degrasse Tyson and Bill Nye, nobody expresses the true wonders of the universe in the same way that Sagan did. He was one of a kind and this is probably his greatest work. "
129,0345376595,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3002008-joshua-woodbury,3,"The first part of this book really bugged me. Sagan explains how ridiculous it is for humans to believe that we have a purpose. That is just part of egocentric human nature trying to put itself at the center of the universe. I mean, people once thought the sun rotated around the earth. That wasn't true, so it logically follows that there is no designer to the universe. I don't care that he holds his beliefs, I just do not see what spending so much time on them had to do with our future of space exploration.His look at the planets in our solar system and the future terraforming and space travel were interesting. However, I don't think the case was very strong for the main thrust of his book - that space exploration needs to be a strong priority for us."
130,0345376595,http://goodreads.com/user/show/8303742-subbu,5,"An excellent read.Hadn't read any other books by Sagan before; so wasn't sure what to expect, but impressed by how simply he puts things across. Infectious enthusiasm for curiosity, a great tour of the planets and their moons - and tempered with caution.Brilliant vision about man's possible steps in the future out there among the planets and stars : but before which, we need to set our own home - our insignificant pale blue dot, other than which we have no home as of now - in order, and need to make changes to our institutions - political, economic, religious - whether we like it or not, and stand united, and gain wisdom and not just smartness - if we are not to destroy ourselves before ever stepping out."
131,0345376595,http://goodreads.com/user/show/15862910-steve-granger,5,"Carl Sagan stirs within his readers a passion to adventure and learn, to never stop being curious, and to ultimately reach for the stars. When you listen to the ramblings of dreamers and wanderers about galavanting over the universe, you can't help but be skeptical. But having the benefit of hindsight, it is amazing to have seen so many of Sagan's ideas come to reality. It was as though I was reading a manual for explorers from 1994 to present day. This has to have been by far my favourite book by Sagan, as his passion and genius jumps out at you in every chapter, whether he is exploring distant galaxies to our very egos. A must read for the curious."

Read it, it will open your eyes to possibilities beyond our imagination. To top it all off, the language, phew! So compelling, so vivid, so masterful and so moving.

It was a great loss to the world when he died, and I don’t believe that anyone has since filled his shoes, even Neil deGrasse Tyson’s attempts fall short.

It goes on to describe possible future exploration of the solar system by humans including the risks and rewards of venturing down that path. "

This book is mad intelligent. When a world renowned astronomer, astrophysicist, cosmologist... (the list goes on) happens to be an amazing writer and science communicator, he brings to this world nothing but genius works and ideas that hold so much value until this day (PBD is 26 years old which is very old for a scientific informative book, yet still a highly recommended one for all space enthusiasts). The marriage of science, history and politics (just a little bit, only the important, necessary facts were included) was finely executed. This book complements Cosmos very well, they give you the answers to the many space questions you ask yourself. I also love that Ann Druyan, a woman I look up to a lot, worked on this masterpiece too. We are immensely lucky that the universe created these people with their beautiful minds and their amazing work. We are also crazy lucky for this Pale Blue Dot (aslo known as Earth) of ours. "

143,0345376595,http://goodreads.com/user/show/11463357-suraj,5,"What can I say about this book, that hasn't already been said. Carl Sagan is a hero to a lot of people. Why wouldn't he be, he is a brilliant astrophysicist and an even better writer. Pale Blue Dot makes you think about the progress of life, the vastness of the universe, our place in the big picture. If only we could come together as a race and work towards a common goal, we could achieve so much more. An absolute jewel of a book. "
144,0345376595,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3744803-chris,3,"The title of this book gets its name from the famous photograph taken by Voyager 1 in 1990 as the spacecraft was leaving our Solar System. Due to Carl Sagan's urging, NASA agreed to point Voyager 1's camera toward Earth when it was about 3.7 billion miles from our planet and capture the image. The photo shows our planet Earth as a minuscule dot in the vast expanse of space. Sagan was trying to show how small our home is and at the same time emphasize the vastness of the universe in which we live. Pale Blue Dot is the sequel to Cosmos and devotes time to describing the Solar System and characteristics of several of the planets and moons. Sagan discusses ways in which humans could travel to, and potentially inhabit these planets and moons."

“It is sometimes said that scientists are unromantic, that their passion to figure out robs the world of beauty and mystery. But is it not stirring to understand how the world actually works — that white light is made of colors, that color is the way we perceive the wavelengths of light, that transparent air reflects light, that in so doing it discriminates among the waves, and that the sky is blue for the same reason that the sunset is red? It does no harm to the romance of the sunset to know a little bit about it.”
I’ll be honest – I wish I could quote almost the entirety of this book just to show how wonderfully  Carl Sagan marries science, philosophy, and a sense of wonderment, and molds it all into literary poetry.Most widely known for the television series Cosmos, Sagan was a beloved planetary scientist and astronomer who popularized science, raised awareness for global warming, and did a myriad of other things that inspired people from all around the world.Where his book  Cosmos read as a more scientific journey throughout the universe, explaining core concepts of planetology and astronomy,  Pale Blue Dot takes a broader approach – and dives into the history and future of humanity’s journey into space.Every one of his works has a slightly philosophical approach; Sagan never examines things out of their context, and takes into careful consideration the history, environment, mindset, intent, and even global politics of his topics. He tackles complex issues – from the origins of Venus’ atmosphere to Cold War mindsets that contributed to the smooth and successful funding of Apollo II – and in an easy, accessible way without ever using too much technical jargon.His intelligence and insight give the exploration of the wanderlust in us humans a realistic tone, and he remains optimistic throughout. Even as he examines humanity’s lesser moments, our faults and our frailty, he calls us to action and allows us to hope; if we realize what we’re doing to ourselves, the environment, and the Earth itself, we can choose to do what’s right for all of us. There is no bleakness as Sagan looks out to the stars, and you realize that we might yet scale heaven sometime in the future. And below that all is science that propels his arguments and clarifies his train of thought.It’s illuminating, it’s mind-blowing, and it’s just such a damn joy to read. I’ve never met a writer who could do this – capture the joy, the wonder, the uttermost bedazzlement at how small you are in such a big universe, and how beautiful that realization is.To me, science could never be cold and unromantic. And Sagan can tell you why."
146,0345376595,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1271545-david,4,"Carl Sagan has a wonderful ability to share his passion for science and the natural world. He's an excellent writer, and does a very good job of making astronomy accessible without dumbing it down. Reading this took me back to my childhood and the wonder I felt when I thought about the natural world (universe) and how incredible it is. It also reminded me that science can be fun, regardless of how dull most schooling makes it. A wonderful book, and I would highly recommend it to EVERYONE. My only issue with the book, and the only thing keeping me from giving it 5 stars, is that Sagan gives the human race too much credit. For most of the book, he talks about the universe, what we know, and what is actually there. For the last 50 or so pages, he speculates on where human space travel will go over the next few thousand years. Now Carl, you're obviously a brilliant man, and I have endless respect for your scientific mind and accomplishments, but doesn't that strike you as a bit naive? I mean, humans can't wait to kill each other. Most countries put more into defense (or offense, depending on how you look at it) than education, which means that if we don't manage to destroy each other with our big guns, we'll be too stupid to avoid destroying ourselves some other way. I mean, in the thousands of years we've had, we've been unable to get our shit together within individual homes, much less the planet as a whole. Even if we gained the capability to move onto other planets/asteroids, I don't think that'd solve anything. Then there would just be new, larger targets for our guns. Grr. Okay, human-hating rant aside, it's a great book. Read it. If you're less cynical than I am, you'll like it all the more. "
147,0345376595,http://goodreads.com/user/show/52241811-reed-melvin,5,"There are countless writers out there providing us with insights on nature's mysteries. None of them, however, quite reach the breadth of view or magical feeling that Carl Sagan gives. His writings explained topics ranging from quantum particles to the extent of the cosmos. Along the way, he addressed evolution, space engineering and countless other facets of science and technology. Even fiction wasn't beyond his grasp. Pale Blue Dot is a journey in time and space. Beginning with the assertion that we're natural wanderers, being the only species to settle across our world, it continues with a plea to extend further our exploration of space. The early chapters challenge restrictions on our desire to explore and learn. Sagan demonstrates how foolish minds have restrained our quest for knowledge of the cosmos. He then takes us on a tour of the solar system, exhibiting the wonders revealed by the fleet of robot probes. He reminds us of the forces the cosmos can unleash, sometimes right in our neighborhood. Sagan was awed by the collision of a comet with the Jovian gas giant. It was a hint of what might lay in store for us if we fail to understand the universe better than we do now. The space probes also returned images of worlds invalidating existing theories of planetary formation. If our own neighbors can present such bizarre structures, what kinds of worlds lay out beyond our own planetary community? Anyone even slightly interested in space sciences, or just curious about a potential future and other perspectives, should definitely read this book."
148,0345376595,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5882124-kevin-cecil,4,"Sagan spends the first part of PALE BLUE DOT reminding us of the insignificance of Earth and it's denizens within the enormity of our universe. The second part looks at what we've done to expand our existence beyond one planet, with special attention to the Voyager missions. The third part becomes more speculative, acknowledging that the Sun and Earth are not infinite. That, if we want to survive, we will eventually - in about 7 billon years - have to leave Earth if we don't want to get swallowed up by the Sun. His argument being that it is never too early to start thinking about Plan(et) B.The first chapter, where Sagan describes the Pale Blue Dot image of Earth as captured by Voyager while leaving Saturn's orbit, is simply my favorite written passage in all of human history. The prose is beautiful, the ideas astonishing in their complexity, the message profound in its simplicity. I have listened to that passage well over a hundred times. The book as a whole though, while fantastic, doesn't quite live up to it's opening. The arguments, history and sci-fi predictions are laid out in greater depth, with Sagan's typical poetic accessibility; but nothing else resonates like that astonishing passage. That is to say, if you read nothing else in your entire life, at least read the first chapter of PALE BLUE DOT. And if you have plenty of life and reading plans left, the rest is certainly worth catching up with. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XH7ZR..."
149,0345376595,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5275261-patrick-dijusto,5,"Can you believe I've never read this before?The book is subtitled A Vision of the Human Future in Space, and if my dates are correct, this was written when Carl Sagan knew he had no future himself, being deep into the myelodysplasia that would eventually kill him. So in addition to the rigorous scientific accuracy and sense of wonder common to all Sagan's writing, there's also a palpable sense of wistfulness. ""I know I won't make it with you"", he seems to be saying, ""but you should start here...""The beauty and the wistfulness of Pale Blue Dot has had a curious side effect on our culture. The language of the book is so beautiful, so full of hope, that in recent years a small cottage industry has grown up around producing ""Carl Sagan"" videos: examples of digital animations showing the wonders of the universe, narrated by Sagan's audiobook recording of Pale Blue Dot. Those of us who write wish our books to be read while we're still alive. Sagan's are inspiring art, 20 years after he died. "
150,0345376595,http://goodreads.com/user/show/20202380-molly,4,"Marvelous look at what humanity can achieve if we put our minds to it. This book should be read by every lawmaker and statesperson in the world, and by every high school student looking to their future career."

152,0345376595,http://goodreads.com/user/show/57263951-nacho-santos,4,"Pale Blue Dot by Carl SaganListening to the first two chapters of this book, I was astonished. It was thought provoking, mind boggling, brilliant. It made me think about existence and the nature of this world. It made me look up and look around myself. It made me look at things I otherwise wouldn’t have paid attention to. (If you are a fan of Sapiens by Yuval Noah Harari, you’ll love it.) Though the first two chapters were amazing, sadly I had to drag myself to finish the other twenty. It was mostly about other planets, space exploration, and delves into related questions regarding it."
153,0345376595,http://goodreads.com/user/show/41735508-noah-goats,3,"Carl Sagan was a gifted thinker and writer, and all his talents are on display in Pale Blue Dot. He writes with more warmth and humanity than most science writers I've read, and it's easy to see how he became the preeminent popularizer of space related science of his day.Of course, his day was a few decades ago now, and as you read this book it soon becomes clear that astronomy and space exploration have made significant advances in the interim period (the number of exoplanets we know of, info from Curiosity and other probes, the age of the universe, all sorts of crap about Titan... our knowledge just keeps growing but this book cannot). Pale Blue Dot is a book that is beginning to show its age, and in many details this it is seriously out of date.I also wish Sagan didn't spend so much time in the first couple chapters talking about how finding out that we are not the literal center of the universe is some kind of blow to human self esteem. People believed earth was the center for a long time, and religions adopted this idea that appeared to be so obvious. But despite what Sagan and those science writers who followed him have to say, I don't believe many people have ever thought they were special because the earth was the center of the universe. Historically, people have been down on earth. For Christians the earth isn't much more than a dirty crust that barely does an adequate job of preventing us from falling straight into hell. Heaven is where it's at. Jesus ascended to the stars when he was done here. And (for pagans) when Julius Caesar was declared a god, a comet passing after his death was said to be his soul rising to take its place among the heavens. I wish Sagan hadn't spent so much time pummeling this particular straw man. Nevertheless, this is still a pretty good book, filled with ideas and arguments about the universe and our place in it that are unfailingly engaging. Sagan's knowledge and passion for his subject are matched by his ability as a writer. He makes the case for space exploration, including manned exploration without ignoring the costs, trade-offs, and dangers. It is in the chapters where Sagan argues for man's expansion into space that the book is at it's best. "
154,0345376595,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1959519-max-maxwell,5,"For the general part of this brief review, I should say that I think that this book was way ahead of its time. Some people will object to this, call it just another pop-sci book, and move on, decrying the science in it for already being out of date, a mere 15 years after publication. ""Obsolescence,"" however, ""is a fate devoutly to be wished,"" reminds Stephen Jay Gould. So what if some of this science is old hat? The vast, and I mean that, vast, majority of Sagan's predictions are already fact, especially his thoughts on the then, and now, burgeoning field of exoplanetary science. I say that Sagan was ahead of his time not because of any particular science in question, though, but because centuries from now, when we have colonized the solar system and its myriad worlds are known to us, we will be able to look at Sagan as the one guy who was on the right track at the end of the twentieth century, whereas most people even at the start of the twenty-first were finding excuses not to spacefar and search for extraterrestrial life. ""SETI,"" remarks Sagan, ""costs less than one attack helicopter a year."" We spend so much on killing each other and so little on exploring together, on being human. Read this book like some people read the Bible and spread the word in the same way; baby steps, eh?As for the edition, it was convenient for me, listening on an iPod at work in a kitchen. But it consists of Sagan reading the abridged edition and J. Charles, an OK, but not noteworthy, narrator, rounding out the remainder, that is, 3 hours of Sagan, 7 of Charles. Go for the illustrated copy of the paperback if you have more time on your hands; I also own that one and turned to it as an augmentation of my listening here."
155,0345376595,http://goodreads.com/user/show/38148349-benjamin-atkinson,5,"To say Carl Sagan is under-rated is probably a stretch for most people; not me. He is one of the most rare of intellectuals; a genius who is grounded and can explain incredibly complicated concepts in simple language without losing information. He is a humane man that does not denigrate others beliefs while strongly espousing his own. Pale Blue Dot is once again very deep but incredibly simple. The farther we go out in space to photograph the planet we all share the signifcance the smaller it appears. The artificial lines that we shortsightedly fight over disappear from this perspective. He really emphasizes the importance of uniting through this realization and take care of our shared home. He talks about the history of physics and astronomy and how religion has distorted and perverted in some cases what are the true natural laws that truly rule our lives. Like many of his books, I strongly recommend this one. It is an academic education and a spiritual enlightenment. I have read all of his books and love them all. If I had to pick two books by Carl Sagan that I think everyone should read it would be ""In a Demon-Haunted World-Science as a Candle in the Dark"" and then this one in that order. Great."
156,0345376595,http://goodreads.com/user/show/13249932-fred,4,"This book represents my first toe-dip into Sagan's writing. He was, as we all know, brilliant. And he was quite the gifted writer. This book may not be enjoyable to the sternly devout religious readers whose belief systems rigidly tether them to unwavering dogma. In fact, I wager most of that segment of the population won't make it through the first chapter before tossing this book in the trash bin. For the rest of us, Sagan leads us through an elegant tour of scientific inquiry into the origins of the universe, of man and his place in it. This reader found it very easy to apply Sagan's thoughts to an assessment of current perceptions and misconceptions about our own importance and our own behaviors as inhabitants of Earth.If there is a downside to this book, it is that Dr. Sagan may go to greater lengths than necessary to make his points. Being a man of science, he was careful to supply lots of supporting evidence. Occasionally in this book, he comes across as pounding home the point that could have easily been laid out before moving on. It's an interesting read. "
157,0345376595,http://goodreads.com/user/show/44354532-simo-ibourki,5,"This is my second book by Carl Sagan (the first was his novel Contact)If Marx's The Capital is communism manifesto, Pale Blue Dot is space exploration manifesto. Sagan talks about nearly everything related to the universe, the place of humans in it, what we have discovered and what we are still searching for (From the formation of our solar system to the apearance of humans to the beginings of space exploration and the future possibilities)Carl Sagan knows how to explain complex scientific concepts and methods in a readable style that any normal non-scientific human like me can understand.Reading about Sagan's vision of the future of humanity was for me the best part of this book, it really makes conflicts and misjudgements futile and non-sense. Space exploration and colonisation will help humans unify their powers and technologies to serve one big goal which is the survival of humanity. "
158,0345376595,http://goodreads.com/user/show/10013767-jeff-mauch,5,"Carl Sagan has this way of describing the moons, planets and vastness of the universe in a way that makes the reader feel like anything is possible for the human race. Sagan had such a sense of wonder when it came to his prose that you couldn't help but be moved by it. In Pale Blue Dot, Sagan summarizes the discoveries and wonders of the universe up to the late 90s and then ponders and describes his view of the coming decades and millennia. Even though this book is 20 years old, its still a much read for anyone interested in space or the possible future of the human race. It's a shame Sagan is no longer with us, while I enjoy the likes of Neil Degrasse Tyson and Bill Nye, nobody expresses the true wonders of the universe in the same way that Sagan did. He was one of a kind and this is probably his greatest work. "
159,0345376595,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3002008-joshua-woodbury,3,"The first part of this book really bugged me. Sagan explains how ridiculous it is for humans to believe that we have a purpose. That is just part of egocentric human nature trying to put itself at the center of the universe. I mean, people once thought the sun rotated around the earth. That wasn't true, so it logically follows that there is no designer to the universe. I don't care that he holds his beliefs, I just do not see what spending so much time on them had to do with our future of space exploration.His look at the planets in our solar system and the future terraforming and space travel were interesting. However, I don't think the case was very strong for the main thrust of his book - that space exploration needs to be a strong priority for us."
160,0345376595,http://goodreads.com/user/show/8303742-subbu,5,"An excellent read.Hadn't read any other books by Sagan before; so wasn't sure what to expect, but impressed by how simply he puts things across. Infectious enthusiasm for curiosity, a great tour of the planets and their moons - and tempered with caution.Brilliant vision about man's possible steps in the future out there among the planets and stars : but before which, we need to set our own home - our insignificant pale blue dot, other than which we have no home as of now - in order, and need to make changes to our institutions - political, economic, religious - whether we like it or not, and stand united, and gain wisdom and not just smartness - if we are not to destroy ourselves before ever stepping out."
161,0345376595,http://goodreads.com/user/show/15862910-steve-granger,5,"Carl Sagan stirs within his readers a passion to adventure and learn, to never stop being curious, and to ultimately reach for the stars. When you listen to the ramblings of dreamers and wanderers about galavanting over the universe, you can't help but be skeptical. But having the benefit of hindsight, it is amazing to have seen so many of Sagan's ideas come to reality. It was as though I was reading a manual for explorers from 1994 to present day. This has to have been by far my favourite book by Sagan, as his passion and genius jumps out at you in every chapter, whether he is exploring distant galaxies to our very egos. A must read for the curious."

Read it, it will open your eyes to possibilities beyond our imagination. To top it all off, the language, phew! So compelling, so vivid, so masterful and so moving. I have to now find my way to other works of Carl Sagan."

It was a great loss to the world when he died, and I don’t believe that anyone has since filled his shoes, even Neil deGrasse Tyson’s attempts fall short. Pale Blue Dot starts out with the history of our initial exploration of the solar system with robotic probes visiting the 70 or so bodies that have been explored. It goes on to describe possible future exploration of the solar system by humans including the risks and rewards of venturing down that path. "

If only we could come together as a race and work towards a common goal, we could achieve so much more. An absolute jewel of a book. "
174,0345376595,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3744803-chris,3,"The title of this book gets its name from the famous photograph taken by Voyager 1 in 1990 as the spacecraft was leaving our Solar System. Due to Carl Sagan's urging, NASA agreed to point Voyager 1's camera toward Earth when it was about 3.7 billion miles from our planet and capture the image. The photo shows our planet Earth as a minuscule dot in the vast expanse of space. Sagan was trying to show how small our home is and at the same time emphasize the vastness of the universe in which we live. Pale Blue Dot is the sequel to Cosmos and devotes time to describing the Solar System and characteristics of several of the planets and moons. Sagan discusses ways in which humans could travel to, and potentially inhabit these planets and moons."

“It is sometimes said that scientists are unromantic, that their passion to figure out robs the world of beauty and mystery. But is it not stirring to understand how the world actually works — that white light is made of colors, that color is the way we perceive the wavelengths of light, that transparent air reflects light, that in so doing it discriminates among the waves, and that the sky is blue for the same reason that the sunset is red? It does no harm to the romance of the sunset to know a little bit about it.”
I’ll be honest – I wish I could quote almost the entirety of this book just to show how wonderfully  Carl Sagan marries science, philosophy, and a sense of wonderment, and molds it all into literary poetry.Most widely known for the television series Cosmos, Sagan was a beloved planetary scientist and astronomer who popularized science, raised awareness for global warming, and did a myriad of other things that inspired people from all around the world.Where his book  Cosmos read as a more scientific journey throughout the universe, explaining core concepts of planetology and astronomy,  Pale Blue Dot takes a broader approach – and dives into the history and future of humanity’s journey into space.Every one of his works has a slightly philosophical approach; Sagan never examines things out of their context, and takes into careful consideration the history, environment, mindset, intent, and even global politics of his topics. He tackles complex issues – from the origins of Venus’ atmosphere to Cold War mindsets that contributed to the smooth and successful funding of Apollo II – and in an easy, accessible way without ever using too much technical jargon.His intelligence and insight give the exploration of the wanderlust in us humans a realistic tone, and he remains optimistic throughout. Even as he examines humanity’s lesser moments, our faults and our frailty, he calls us to action and allows us to hope; if we realize what we’re doing to ourselves, the environment, and the Earth itself, we can choose to do what’s right for all of us. There is no bleakness as Sagan looks out to the stars, and you realize that we might yet scale heaven sometime in the future. And below that all is science that propels his arguments and clarifies his train of thought.It’s illuminating, it’s mind-blowing, and it’s just such a damn joy to read. I’ve never met a writer who could do this – capture the joy, the wonder, the uttermost bedazzlement at how small you are in such a big universe, and how beautiful that realization is.To me, science could never be cold and unromantic. And Sagan can tell you why."
176,0345376595,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1271545-david,4,"Carl Sagan has a wonderful ability to share his passion for science and the natural world. He's an excellent writer, and does a very good job of making astronomy accessible without dumbing it down. Reading this took me back to my childhood and the wonder I felt when I thought about the natural world (universe) and how incredible it is. It also reminded me that science can be fun, regardless of how dull most schooling makes it. A wonderful book, and I would highly recommend it to EVERYONE. My only issue with the book, and the only thing keeping me from giving it 5 stars, is that Sagan gives the human race too much credit. For most of the book, he talks about the universe, what we know, and what is actually there. For the last 50 or so pages, he speculates on where human space travel will go over the next few thousand years. Now Carl, you're obviously a brilliant man, and I have endless respect for your scientific mind and accomplishments, but doesn't that strike you as a bit naive? I mean, humans can't wait to kill each other. Most countries put more into defense (or offense, depending on how you look at it) than education, which means that if we don't manage to destroy each other with our big guns, we'll be too stupid to avoid destroying ourselves some other way. I mean, in the thousands of years we've had, we've been unable to get our shit together within individual homes, much less the planet as a whole. Even if we gained the capability to move onto other planets/asteroids, I don't think that'd solve anything. Then there would just be new, larger targets for our guns. Grr. Okay, human-hating rant aside, it's a great book. Read it. If you're less cynical than I am, you'll like it all the more. "
177,0345376595,http://goodreads.com/user/show/52241811-reed-melvin,5,"There are countless writers out there providing us with insights on nature's mysteries. None of them, however, quite reach the breadth of view or magical feeling that Carl Sagan gives. His writings explained topics ranging from quantum particles to the extent of the cosmos. Along the way, he addressed evolution, space engineering and countless other facets of science and technology. Even fiction wasn't beyond his grasp. Pale Blue Dot is a journey in time and space. Beginning with the assertion that we're natural wanderers, being the only species to settle across our world, it continues with a plea to extend further our exploration of space. The early chapters challenge restrictions on our desire to explore and learn. Sagan demonstrates how foolish minds have restrained our quest for knowledge of the cosmos. He then takes us on a tour of the solar system, exhibiting the wonders revealed by the fleet of robot probes. He reminds us of the forces the cosmos can unleash, sometimes right in our neighborhood. Sagan was awed by the collision of a comet with the Jovian gas giant. It was a hint of what might lay in store for us if we fail to understand the universe better than we do now. The space probes also returned images of worlds invalidating existing theories of planetary formation. If our own neighbors can present such bizarre structures, what kinds of worlds lay out beyond our own planetary community? Anyone even slightly interested in space sciences, or just curious about a potential future and other perspectives, should definitely read this book."
178,0345376595,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5882124-kevin-cecil,4,"Sagan spends the first part of PALE BLUE DOT reminding us of the insignificance of Earth and it's denizens within the enormity of our universe. The second part looks at what we've done to expand our existence beyond one planet, with special attention to the Voyager missions. The third part becomes more speculative, acknowledging that the Sun and Earth are not infinite. That, if we want to survive, we will eventually - in about 7 billon years - have to leave Earth if we don't want to get swallowed up by the Sun. His argument being that it is never too early to start thinking about Plan(et) B.The first chapter, where Sagan describes the Pale Blue Dot image of Earth as captured by Voyager while leaving Saturn's orbit, is simply my favorite written passage in all of human history. The prose is beautiful, the ideas astonishing in their complexity, the message profound in its simplicity. I have listened to that passage well over a hundred times. The book as a whole though, while fantastic, doesn't quite live up to it's opening. The arguments, history and sci-fi predictions are laid out in greater depth, with Sagan's typical poetic accessibility; but nothing else resonates like that astonishing passage. That is to say, if you read nothing else in your entire life, at least read the first chapter of PALE BLUE DOT. And if you have plenty of life and reading plans left, the rest is certainly worth catching up with. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XH7ZR..."

So in addition to the rigorous scientific accuracy and sense of wonder common to all Sagan's writing, there's also a palpable sense of wistfulness. ""I know I won't make it with you"", he seems to be saying, ""but you should start here...""The beauty and the wistfulness of Pale Blue Dot has had a curious side effect on our culture. The language of the book is so beautiful, so full of hope, that in recent years a small cottage industry has grown up around producing ""Carl Sagan"" videos: examples of digital animations showing the wonders of the universe, narrated by Sagan's audiobook recording of Pale Blue Dot. Those of us who write wish our books to be read while we're still alive. Sagan's are inspiring art, 20 years after he died. "

182,0345376595,http://goodreads.com/user/show/57263951-nacho-santos,4,"Pale Blue Dot by Carl SaganListening to the first two chapters of this book, I was astonished. It was thought provoking, mind boggling, brilliant. It made me think about existence and the nature of this world. It made me look up and look around myself. It made me look at things I otherwise wouldn’t have paid attention to. (If you are a fan of Sapiens by Yuval Noah Harari, you’ll love it.) Though the first two chapters were amazing, sadly I had to drag myself to finish the other twenty. It was mostly about other planets, space exploration, and delves into related questions regarding it."
183,0345376595,http://goodreads.com/user/show/41735508-noah-goats,3,"Carl Sagan was a gifted thinker and writer, and all his talents are on display in Pale Blue Dot. He writes with more warmth and humanity than most science writers I've read, and it's easy to see how he became the preeminent popularizer of space related science of his day.Of course, his day was a few decades ago now, and as you read this book it soon becomes clear that astronomy and space exploration have made significant advances in the interim period (the number of exoplanets we know of, info from Curiosity and other probes, the age of the universe, all sorts of crap about Titan... our knowledge just keeps growing but this book cannot). Pale Blue Dot is a book that is beginning to show its age, and in many details this it is seriously out of date.I also wish Sagan didn't spend so much time in the first couple chapters talking about how finding out that we are not the literal center of the universe is some kind of blow to human self esteem. People believed earth was the center for a long time, and religions adopted this idea that appeared to be so obvious. But despite what Sagan and those science writers who followed him have to say, I don't believe many people have ever thought they were special because the earth was the center of the universe. Historically, people have been down on earth. For Christians the earth isn't much more than a dirty crust that barely does an adequate job of preventing us from falling straight into hell. Heaven is where it's at. Jesus ascended to the stars when he was done here. And (for pagans) when Julius Caesar was declared a god, a comet passing after his death was said to be his soul rising to take its place among the heavens. I wish Sagan hadn't spent so much time pummeling this particular straw man. Nevertheless, this is still a pretty good book, filled with ideas and arguments about the universe and our place in it that are unfailingly engaging. Sagan's knowledge and passion for his subject are matched by his ability as a writer. He makes the case for space exploration, including manned exploration without ignoring the costs, trade-offs, and dangers. It is in the chapters where Sagan argues for man's expansion into space that the book is at it's best. "
184,0345376595,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1959519-max-maxwell,5,"For the general part of this brief review, I should say that I think that this book was way ahead of its time. Some people will object to this, call it just another pop-sci book, and move on, decrying the science in it for already being out of date, a mere 15 years after publication. ""Obsolescence,"" however, ""is a fate devoutly to be wished,"" reminds Stephen Jay Gould. So what if some of this science is old hat? The vast, and I mean that, vast, majority of Sagan's predictions are already fact, especially his thoughts on the then, and now, burgeoning field of exoplanetary science. I say that Sagan was ahead of his time not because of any particular science in question, though, but because centuries from now, when we have colonized the solar system and its myriad worlds are known to us, we will be able to look at Sagan as the one guy who was on the right track at the end of the twentieth century, whereas most people even at the start of the twenty-first were finding excuses not to spacefar and search for extraterrestrial life. ""SETI,"" remarks Sagan, ""costs less than one attack helicopter a year."" We spend so much on killing each other and so little on exploring together, on being human. Read this book like some people read the Bible and spread the word in the same way; baby steps, eh?As for the edition, it was convenient for me, listening on an iPod at work in a kitchen. But it consists of Sagan reading the abridged edition and J. Charles, an OK, but not noteworthy, narrator, rounding out the remainder, that is, 3 hours of Sagan, 7 of Charles. Go for the illustrated copy of the paperback if you have more time on your hands; I also own that one and turned to it as an augmentation of my listening here."
185,0345376595,http://goodreads.com/user/show/38148349-benjamin-atkinson,5,"To say Carl Sagan is under-rated is probably a stretch for most people; not me. He is one of the most rare of intellectuals; a genius who is grounded and can explain incredibly complicated concepts in simple language without losing information. He is a humane man that does not denigrate others beliefs while strongly espousing his own. Pale Blue Dot is once again very deep but incredibly simple. The farther we go out in space to photograph the planet we all share the signifcance the smaller it appears. The artificial lines that we shortsightedly fight over disappear from this perspective. He really emphasizes the importance of uniting through this realization and take care of our shared home. He talks about the history of physics and astronomy and how religion has distorted and perverted in some cases what are the true natural laws that truly rule our lives. Like many of his books, I strongly recommend this one. It is an academic education and a spiritual enlightenment. I have read all of his books and love them all. If I had to pick two books by Carl Sagan that I think everyone should read it would be ""In a Demon-Haunted World-Science as a Candle in the Dark"" and then this one in that order. Great."
186,0345376595,http://goodreads.com/user/show/13249932-fred,4,"This book represents my first toe-dip into Sagan's writing. He was, as we all know, brilliant. And he was quite the gifted writer. This book may not be enjoyable to the sternly devout religious readers whose belief systems rigidly tether them to unwavering dogma. In fact, I wager most of that segment of the population won't make it through the first chapter before tossing this book in the trash bin. For the rest of us, Sagan leads us through an elegant tour of scientific inquiry into the origins of the universe, of man and his place in it. This reader found it very easy to apply Sagan's thoughts to an assessment of current perceptions and misconceptions about our own importance and our own behaviors as inhabitants of Earth.If there is a downside to this book, it is that Dr. Sagan may go to greater lengths than necessary to make his points. Being a man of science, he was careful to supply lots of supporting evidence. Occasionally in this book, he comes across as pounding home the point that could have easily been laid out before moving on. It's an interesting read. "
187,0345376595,http://goodreads.com/user/show/44354532-simo-ibourki,5,"This is my second book by Carl Sagan (the first was his novel Contact)If Marx's The Capital is communism manifesto, Pale Blue Dot is space exploration manifesto. Sagan talks about nearly everything related to the universe, the place of humans in it, what we have discovered and what we are still searching for (From the formation of our solar system to the apearance of humans to the beginings of space exploration and the future possibilities)Carl Sagan knows how to explain complex scientific concepts and methods in a readable style that any normal non-scientific human like me can understand.Reading about Sagan's vision of the future of humanity was for me the best part of this book, it really makes conflicts and misjudgements futile and non-sense. Space exploration and colonisation will help humans unify their powers and technologies to serve one big goal which is the survival of humanity. "
188,0345376595,http://goodreads.com/user/show/10013767-jeff-mauch,5,"Carl Sagan has this way of describing the moons, planets and vastness of the universe in a way that makes the reader feel like anything is possible for the human race. Sagan had such a sense of wonder when it came to his prose that you couldn't help but be moved by it. In Pale Blue Dot, Sagan summarizes the discoveries and wonders of the universe up to the late 90s and then ponders and describes his view of the coming decades and millennia. Even though this book is 20 years old, its still a much read for anyone interested in space or the possible future of the human race. It's a shame Sagan is no longer with us, while I enjoy the likes of Neil Degrasse Tyson and Bill Nye, nobody expresses the true wonders of the universe in the same way that Sagan did. He was one of a kind and this is probably his greatest work. "
189,0345376595,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3002008-joshua-woodbury,3,"The first part of this book really bugged me. Sagan explains how ridiculous it is for humans to believe that we have a purpose. That is just part of egocentric human nature trying to put itself at the center of the universe. I mean, people once thought the sun rotated around the earth. That wasn't true, so it logically follows that there is no designer to the universe. I don't care that he holds his beliefs, I just do not see what spending so much time on them had to do with our future of space exploration.His look at the planets in our solar system and the future terraforming and space travel were interesting. However, I don't think the case was very strong for the main thrust of his book - that space exploration needs to be a strong priority for us."
190,0345376595,http://goodreads.com/user/show/8303742-subbu,5,"An excellent read.Hadn't read any other books by Sagan before; so wasn't sure what to expect, but impressed by how simply he puts things across. Infectious enthusiasm for curiosity, a great tour of the planets and their moons - and tempered with caution.Brilliant vision about man's possible steps in the future out there among the planets and stars : but before which, we need to set our own home - our insignificant pale blue dot, other than which we have no home as of now - in order, and need to make changes to our institutions - political, economic, religious - whether we like it or not, and stand united, and gain wisdom and not just smartness - if we are not to destroy ourselves before ever stepping out."
191,0345376595,http://goodreads.com/user/show/15862910-steve-granger,5,"Carl Sagan stirs within his readers a passion to adventure and learn, to never stop being curious, and to ultimately reach for the stars. When you listen to the ramblings of dreamers and wanderers about galavanting over the universe, you can't help but be skeptical. But having the benefit of hindsight, it is amazing to have seen so many of Sagan's ideas come to reality. It was as though I was reading a manual for explorers from 1994 to present day. This has to have been by far my favourite book by Sagan, as his passion and genius jumps out at you in every chapter, whether he is exploring distant galaxies to our very egos. A must read for the curious."

It was a great loss to the world when he died, and I don’t believe that anyone has since filled his shoes, even Neil deGrasse Tyson’s attempts fall short. Pale Blue Dot starts out with the history of our initial exploration of the solar system with robotic probes visiting the 70 or so bodies that have been explored. It goes on to describe possible future exploration of the solar system by humans including the risks and rewards of venturing down that path. "

203,0345376595,http://goodreads.com/user/show/11463357-suraj,5,"What can I say about this book, that hasn't already been said. Carl Sagan is a hero to a lot of people. Why wouldn't he be, he is a brilliant astrophysicist and an even better writer. Pale Blue Dot makes you think about the progress of life, the vastness of the universe, our place in the big picture. If only we could come together as a race and work towards a common goal, we could achieve so much more. An absolute jewel of a book. "
204,0345376595,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3744803-chris,3,"The title of this book gets its name from the famous photograph taken by Voyager 1 in 1990 as the spacecraft was leaving our Solar System. Due to Carl Sagan's urging, NASA agreed to point Voyager 1's camera toward Earth when it was about 3.7 billion miles from our planet and capture the image. The photo shows our planet Earth as a minuscule dot in the vast expanse of space. Sagan was trying to show how small our home is and at the same time emphasize the vastness of the universe in which we live. Pale Blue Dot is the sequel to Cosmos and devotes time to describing the Solar System and characteristics of several of the planets and moons. Sagan discusses ways in which humans could travel to, and potentially inhabit these planets and moons."

“It is sometimes said that scientists are unromantic, that their passion to figure out robs the world of beauty and mystery. But is it not stirring to understand how the world actually works — that white light is made of colors, that color is the way we perceive the wavelengths of light, that transparent air reflects light, that in so doing it discriminates among the waves, and that the sky is blue for the same reason that the sunset is red? It does no harm to the romance of the sunset to know a little bit about it.”
I’ll be honest – I wish I could quote almost the entirety of this book just to show how wonderfully  Carl Sagan marries science, philosophy, and a sense of wonderment, and molds it all into literary poetry.Most widely known for the television series Cosmos, Sagan was a beloved planetary scientist and astronomer who popularized science, raised awareness for global warming, and did a myriad of other things that inspired people from all around the world.Where his book  Cosmos read as a more scientific journey throughout the universe, explaining core concepts of planetology and astronomy,  Pale Blue Dot takes a broader approach – and dives into the history and future of humanity’s journey into space.Every one of his works has a slightly philosophical approach; Sagan never examines things out of their context, and takes into careful consideration the history, environment, mindset, intent, and even global politics of his topics. He tackles complex issues – from the origins of Venus’ atmosphere to Cold War mindsets that contributed to the smooth and successful funding of Apollo II – and in an easy, accessible way without ever using too much technical jargon.His intelligence and insight give the exploration of the wanderlust in us humans a realistic tone, and he remains optimistic throughout. Even as he examines humanity’s lesser moments, our faults and our frailty, he calls us to action and allows us to hope; if we realize what we’re doing to ourselves, the environment, and the Earth itself, we can choose to do what’s right for all of us. There is no bleakness as Sagan looks out to the stars, and you realize that we might yet scale heaven sometime in the future. And below that all is science that propels his arguments and clarifies his train of thought.It’s illuminating, it’s mind-blowing, and it’s just such a damn joy to read. I’ve never met a writer who could do this – capture the joy, the wonder, the uttermost bedazzlement at how small you are in such a big universe, and how beautiful that realization is.To me, science could never be cold and unromantic. And Sagan can tell you why."
206,0345376595,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1271545-david,4,"Carl Sagan has a wonderful ability to share his passion for science and the natural world. He's an excellent writer, and does a very good job of making astronomy accessible without dumbing it down. Reading this took me back to my childhood and the wonder I felt when I thought about the natural world (universe) and how incredible it is. It also reminded me that science can be fun, regardless of how dull most schooling makes it. A wonderful book, and I would highly recommend it to EVERYONE. My only issue with the book, and the only thing keeping me from giving it 5 stars, is that Sagan gives the human race too much credit. For most of the book, he talks about the universe, what we know, and what is actually there. For the last 50 or so pages, he speculates on where human space travel will go over the next few thousand years. Now Carl, you're obviously a brilliant man, and I have endless respect for your scientific mind and accomplishments, but doesn't that strike you as a bit naive? I mean, humans can't wait to kill each other. Most countries put more into defense (or offense, depending on how you look at it) than education, which means that if we don't manage to destroy each other with our big guns, we'll be too stupid to avoid destroying ourselves some other way. I mean, in the thousands of years we've had, we've been unable to get our shit together within individual homes, much less the planet as a whole. Even if we gained the capability to move onto other planets/asteroids, I don't think that'd solve anything. Then there would just be new, larger targets for our guns. Grr. Okay, human-hating rant aside, it's a great book. Read it. If you're less cynical than I am, you'll like it all the more. "
207,0345376595,http://goodreads.com/user/show/52241811-reed-melvin,5,"There are countless writers out there providing us with insights on nature's mysteries. None of them, however, quite reach the breadth of view or magical feeling that Carl Sagan gives. His writings explained topics ranging from quantum particles to the extent of the cosmos. Along the way, he addressed evolution, space engineering and countless other facets of science and technology. Even fiction wasn't beyond his grasp. Pale Blue Dot is a journey in time and space. Beginning with the assertion that we're natural wanderers, being the only species to settle across our world, it continues with a plea to extend further our exploration of space. The early chapters challenge restrictions on our desire to explore and learn. Sagan demonstrates how foolish minds have restrained our quest for knowledge of the cosmos. He then takes us on a tour of the solar system, exhibiting the wonders revealed by the fleet of robot probes. He reminds us of the forces the cosmos can unleash, sometimes right in our neighborhood. Sagan was awed by the collision of a comet with the Jovian gas giant. It was a hint of what might lay in store for us if we fail to understand the universe better than we do now. The space probes also returned images of worlds invalidating existing theories of planetary formation. If our own neighbors can present such bizarre structures, what kinds of worlds lay out beyond our own planetary community? Anyone even slightly interested in space sciences, or just curious about a potential future and other perspectives, should definitely read this book."
208,0345376595,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5882124-kevin-cecil,4,"Sagan spends the first part of PALE BLUE DOT reminding us of the insignificance of Earth and it's denizens within the enormity of our universe. The second part looks at what we've done to expand our existence beyond one planet, with special attention to the Voyager missions. The third part becomes more speculative, acknowledging that the Sun and Earth are not infinite. That, if we want to survive, we will eventually - in about 7 billon years - have to leave Earth if we don't want to get swallowed up by the Sun. His argument being that it is never too early to start thinking about Plan(et) B.The first chapter, where Sagan describes the Pale Blue Dot image of Earth as captured by Voyager while leaving Saturn's orbit, is simply my favorite written passage in all of human history. The prose is beautiful, the ideas astonishing in their complexity, the message profound in its simplicity. I have listened to that passage well over a hundred times. The book as a whole though, while fantastic, doesn't quite live up to it's opening. The arguments, history and sci-fi predictions are laid out in greater depth, with Sagan's typical poetic accessibility; but nothing else resonates like that astonishing passage. That is to say, if you read nothing else in your entire life, at least read the first chapter of PALE BLUE DOT. And if you have plenty of life and reading plans left, the rest is certainly worth catching up with. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XH7ZR..."
209,0345376595,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5275261-patrick-dijusto,5,"Can you believe I've never read this before?The book is subtitled A Vision of the Human Future in Space, and if my dates are correct, this was written when Carl Sagan knew he had no future himself, being deep into the myelodysplasia that would eventually kill him. So in addition to the rigorous scientific accuracy and sense of wonder common to all Sagan's writing, there's also a palpable sense of wistfulness. ""I know I won't make it with you"", he seems to be saying, ""but you should start here...""The beauty and the wistfulness of Pale Blue Dot has had a curious side effect on our culture. The language of the book is so beautiful, so full of hope, that in recent years a small cottage industry has grown up around producing ""Carl Sagan"" videos: examples of digital animations showing the wonders of the universe, narrated by Sagan's audiobook recording of Pale Blue Dot. Those of us who write wish our books to be read while we're still alive. Sagan's are inspiring art, 20 years after he died. "
210,0345376595,http://goodreads.com/user/show/20202380-molly,4,"Marvelous look at what humanity can achieve if we put our minds to it. This book should be read by every lawmaker and statesperson in the world, and by every high school student looking to their future career."

212,0345376595,http://goodreads.com/user/show/57263951-nacho-santos,4,"Pale Blue Dot by Carl SaganListening to the first two chapters of this book, I was astonished. It was thought provoking, mind boggling, brilliant. It made me think about existence and the nature of this world. It made me look up and look around myself. It made me look at things I otherwise wouldn’t have paid attention to. (If you are a fan of Sapiens by Yuval Noah Harari, you’ll love it.) Though the first two chapters were amazing, sadly I had to drag myself to finish the other twenty. It was mostly about other planets, space exploration, and delves into related questions regarding it."
213,0345376595,http://goodreads.com/user/show/41735508-noah-goats,3,"Carl Sagan was a gifted thinker and writer, and all his talents are on display in Pale Blue Dot. He writes with more warmth and humanity than most science writers I've read, and it's easy to see how he became the preeminent popularizer of space related science of his day.Of course, his day was a few decades ago now, and as you read this book it soon becomes clear that astronomy and space exploration have made significant advances in the interim period (the number of exoplanets we know of, info from Curiosity and other probes, the age of the universe, all sorts of crap about Titan... our knowledge just keeps growing but this book cannot). Pale Blue Dot is a book that is beginning to show its age, and in many details this it is seriously out of date.I also wish Sagan didn't spend so much time in the first couple chapters talking about how finding out that we are not the literal center of the universe is some kind of blow to human self esteem. People believed earth was the center for a long time, and religions adopted this idea that appeared to be so obvious. But despite what Sagan and those science writers who followed him have to say, I don't believe many people have ever thought they were special because the earth was the center of the universe. Historically, people have been down on earth. For Christians the earth isn't much more than a dirty crust that barely does an adequate job of preventing us from falling straight into hell. Heaven is where it's at. Jesus ascended to the stars when he was done here. And (for pagans) when Julius Caesar was declared a god, a comet passing after his death was said to be his soul rising to take its place among the heavens. I wish Sagan hadn't spent so much time pummeling this particular straw man. Nevertheless, this is still a pretty good book, filled with ideas and arguments about the universe and our place in it that are unfailingly engaging. Sagan's knowledge and passion for his subject are matched by his ability as a writer. He makes the case for space exploration, including manned exploration without ignoring the costs, trade-offs, and dangers. It is in the chapters where Sagan argues for man's expansion into space that the book is at it's best. "
214,0345376595,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1959519-max-maxwell,5,"For the general part of this brief review, I should say that I think that this book was way ahead of its time. Some people will object to this, call it just another pop-sci book, and move on, decrying the science in it for already being out of date, a mere 15 years after publication. ""Obsolescence,"" however, ""is a fate devoutly to be wished,"" reminds Stephen Jay Gould. So what if some of this science is old hat? The vast, and I mean that, vast, majority of Sagan's predictions are already fact, especially his thoughts on the then, and now, burgeoning field of exoplanetary science. I say that Sagan was ahead of his time not because of any particular science in question, though, but because centuries from now, when we have colonized the solar system and its myriad worlds are known to us, we will be able to look at Sagan as the one guy who was on the right track at the end of the twentieth century, whereas most people even at the start of the twenty-first were finding excuses not to spacefar and search for extraterrestrial life. ""SETI,"" remarks Sagan, ""costs less than one attack helicopter a year."" We spend so much on killing each other and so little on exploring together, on being human. Read this book like some people read the Bible and spread the word in the same way; baby steps, eh?As for the edition, it was convenient for me, listening on an iPod at work in a kitchen. But it consists of Sagan reading the abridged edition and J. Charles, an OK, but not noteworthy, narrator, rounding out the remainder, that is, 3 hours of Sagan, 7 of Charles. Go for the illustrated copy of the paperback if you have more time on your hands; I also own that one and turned to it as an augmentation of my listening here."
215,0345376595,http://goodreads.com/user/show/38148349-benjamin-atkinson,5,"To say Carl Sagan is under-rated is probably a stretch for most people; not me. He is one of the most rare of intellectuals; a genius who is grounded and can explain incredibly complicated concepts in simple language without losing information. He is a humane man that does not denigrate others beliefs while strongly espousing his own. Pale Blue Dot is once again very deep but incredibly simple. The farther we go out in space to photograph the planet we all share the signifcance the smaller it appears. The artificial lines that we shortsightedly fight over disappear from this perspective. He really emphasizes the importance of uniting through this realization and take care of our shared home. He talks about the history of physics and astronomy and how religion has distorted and perverted in some cases what are the true natural laws that truly rule our lives. Like many of his books, I strongly recommend this one. It is an academic education and a spiritual enlightenment. I have read all of his books and love them all. If I had to pick two books by Carl Sagan that I think everyone should read it would be ""In a Demon-Haunted World-Science as a Candle in the Dark"" and then this one in that order. Great."
216,0345376595,http://goodreads.com/user/show/13249932-fred,4,"This book represents my first toe-dip into Sagan's writing. He was, as we all know, brilliant. And he was quite the gifted writer. This book may not be enjoyable to the sternly devout religious readers whose belief systems rigidly tether them to unwavering dogma. In fact, I wager most of that segment of the population won't make it through the first chapter before tossing this book in the trash bin. For the rest of us, Sagan leads us through an elegant tour of scientific inquiry into the origins of the universe, of man and his place in it. This reader found it very easy to apply Sagan's thoughts to an assessment of current perceptions and misconceptions about our own importance and our own behaviors as inhabitants of Earth.If there is a downside to this book, it is that Dr. Sagan may go to greater lengths than necessary to make his points. Being a man of science, he was careful to supply lots of supporting evidence. Occasionally in this book, he comes across as pounding home the point that could have easily been laid out before moving on. It's an interesting read. "
217,0345376595,http://goodreads.com/user/show/44354532-simo-ibourki,5,"This is my second book by Carl Sagan (the first was his novel Contact)If Marx's The Capital is communism manifesto, Pale Blue Dot is space exploration manifesto. Sagan talks about nearly everything related to the universe, the place of humans in it, what we have discovered and what we are still searching for (From the formation of our solar system to the apearance of humans to the beginings of space exploration and the future possibilities)Carl Sagan knows how to explain complex scientific concepts and methods in a readable style that any normal non-scientific human like me can understand.Reading about Sagan's vision of the future of humanity was for me the best part of this book, it really makes conflicts and misjudgements futile and non-sense. Space exploration and colonisation will help humans unify their powers and technologies to serve one big goal which is the survival of humanity. "
218,0345376595,http://goodreads.com/user/show/10013767-jeff-mauch,5,"Carl Sagan has this way of describing the moons, planets and vastness of the universe in a way that makes the reader feel like anything is possible for the human race. Sagan had such a sense of wonder when it came to his prose that you couldn't help but be moved by it. In Pale Blue Dot, Sagan summarizes the discoveries and wonders of the universe up to the late 90s and then ponders and describes his view of the coming decades and millennia. Even though this book is 20 years old, its still a much read for anyone interested in space or the possible future of the human race. It's a shame Sagan is no longer with us, while I enjoy the likes of Neil Degrasse Tyson and Bill Nye, nobody expresses the true wonders of the universe in the same way that Sagan did. He was one of a kind and this is probably his greatest work. "
219,0345376595,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3002008-joshua-woodbury,3,"The first part of this book really bugged me. Sagan explains how ridiculous it is for humans to believe that we have a purpose. That is just part of egocentric human nature trying to put itself at the center of the universe. I mean, people once thought the sun rotated around the earth. That wasn't true, so it logically follows that there is no designer to the universe. I don't care that he holds his beliefs, I just do not see what spending so much time on them had to do with our future of space exploration.His look at the planets in our solar system and the future terraforming and space travel were interesting. However, I don't think the case was very strong for the main thrust of his book - that space exploration needs to be a strong priority for us."
220,0345376595,http://goodreads.com/user/show/8303742-subbu,5,"An excellent read.Hadn't read any other books by Sagan before; so wasn't sure what to expect, but impressed by how simply he puts things across. Infectious enthusiasm for curiosity, a great tour of the planets and their moons - and tempered with caution.Brilliant vision about man's possible steps in the future out there among the planets and stars : but before which, we need to set our own home - our insignificant pale blue dot, other than which we have no home as of now - in order, and need to make changes to our institutions - political, economic, religious - whether we like it or not, and stand united, and gain wisdom and not just smartness - if we are not to destroy ourselves before ever stepping out."
221,0345376595,http://goodreads.com/user/show/15862910-steve-granger,5,"Carl Sagan stirs within his readers a passion to adventure and learn, to never stop being curious, and to ultimately reach for the stars. When you listen to the ramblings of dreamers and wanderers about galavanting over the universe, you can't help but be skeptical. But having the benefit of hindsight, it is amazing to have seen so many of Sagan's ideas come to reality. It was as though I was reading a manual for explorers from 1994 to present day. This has to have been by far my favourite book by Sagan, as his passion and genius jumps out at you in every chapter, whether he is exploring distant galaxies to our very egos. A must read for the curious."
222,0345376595,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1444324-leela,5,"It is a visual marvel. Carl Sagan takes us out of our small planet to the edges of Solar System, Andromeda, Oort Clouds, M33, Milky Way and worlds that we either do not know exist or do not enough about those. I do not think I can do justice to this book in this review. I have never been a big reader of space books but boy, thanks to a dear friend, I took my first step with a giant in the field. Read it, it will open your eyes to possibilities beyond our imagination. To top it all off, the language, phew! So compelling, so vivid, so masterful and so moving. I have to now find my way to other works of Carl Sagan."

If hiking up a mountain makes one feel small and impressed by the sublimity of massive things, then the realization and contemplation of these massive massive balls of fire and metal, of astronomical dimensions and masses, will do no less than sending a thrill down one's spine.Read more astronomy and be less of a country bumpkin."
224,0345376595,http://goodreads.com/user/show/91317383-andrew,5,"My favorite advocate for science and knowledge is Carl Sagan. Humble, logical, and a very inviting personality. It was a great loss to the world when he died, and I don’t believe that anyone has since filled his shoes, even Neil deGrasse Tyson’s attempts fall short. Pale Blue Dot starts out with the history of our initial exploration of the solar system with robotic probes visiting the 70 or so bodies that have been explored. It goes on to describe possible future exploration of the solar system by humans including the risks and rewards of venturing down that path. "

This book is mad intelligent. When a world renowned astronomer, astrophysicist, cosmologist... (the list goes on) happens to be an amazing writer and science communicator, he brings to this world nothing but genius works and ideas that hold so much value until this day (PBD is 26 years old which is very old for a scientific informative book, yet still a highly recommended one for all space enthusiasts). The marriage of science, history and politics (just a little bit, only the important, necessary facts were included) was finely executed. This book complements Cosmos very well, they give you the answers to the many space questions you ask yourself. I also love that Ann Druyan, a woman I look up to a lot, worked on this masterpiece too.

233,0345376595,http://goodreads.com/user/show/11463357-suraj,5,"What can I say about this book, that hasn't already been said. Carl Sagan is a hero to a lot of people. Why wouldn't he be, he is a brilliant astrophysicist and an even better writer. Pale Blue Dot makes you think about the progress of life, the vastness of the universe, our place in the big picture. If only we could come together as a race and work towards a common goal, we could achieve so much more. An absolute jewel of a book. "
234,0345376595,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3744803-chris,3,"The title of this book gets its name from the famous photograph taken by Voyager 1 in 1990 as the spacecraft was leaving our Solar System. Due to Carl Sagan's urging, NASA agreed to point Voyager 1's camera toward Earth when it was about 3.7 billion miles from our planet and capture the image. The photo shows our planet Earth as a minuscule dot in the vast expanse of space. Sagan was trying to show how small our home is and at the same time emphasize the vastness of the universe in which we live. Pale Blue Dot is the sequel to Cosmos and devotes time to describing the Solar System and characteristics of several of the planets and moons. Sagan discusses ways in which humans could travel to, and potentially inhabit these planets and moons."

“It is sometimes said that scientists are unromantic, that their passion to figure out robs the world of beauty and mystery. But is it not stirring to understand how the world actually works — that white light is made of colors, that color is the way we perceive the wavelengths of light, that transparent air reflects light, that in so doing it discriminates among the waves, and that the sky is blue for the same reason that the sunset is red? It does no harm to the romance of the sunset to know a little bit about it.”
I’ll be honest – I wish I could quote almost the entirety of this book just to show how wonderfully  Carl Sagan marries science, philosophy, and a sense of wonderment, and molds it all into literary poetry.Most widely known for the television series Cosmos, Sagan was a beloved planetary scientist and astronomer who popularized science, raised awareness for global warming, and did a myriad of other things that inspired people from all around the world.Where his book  Cosmos read as a more scientific journey throughout the universe, explaining core concepts of planetology and astronomy,  Pale Blue Dot takes a broader approach – and dives into the history and future of humanity’s journey into space.Every one of his works has a slightly philosophical approach; Sagan never examines things out of their context, and takes into careful consideration the history, environment, mindset, intent, and even global politics of his topics. He tackles complex issues – from the origins of Venus’ atmosphere to Cold War mindsets that contributed to the smooth and successful funding of Apollo II – and in an easy, accessible way without ever using too much technical jargon.His intelligence and insight give the exploration of the wanderlust in us humans a realistic tone, and he remains optimistic throughout. Even as he examines humanity’s lesser moments, our faults and our frailty, he calls us to action and allows us to hope; if we realize what we’re doing to ourselves, the environment, and the Earth itself, we can choose to do what’s right for all of us. There is no bleakness as Sagan looks out to the stars, and you realize that we might yet scale heaven sometime in the future. And below that all is science that propels his arguments and clarifies his train of thought.It’s illuminating, it’s mind-blowing, and it’s just such a damn joy to read. I’ve never met a writer who could do this – capture the joy, the wonder, the uttermost bedazzlement at how small you are in such a big universe, and how beautiful that realization is.To me, science could never be cold and unromantic. And Sagan can tell you why."
236,0345376595,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1271545-david,4,"Carl Sagan has a wonderful ability to share his passion for science and the natural world. He's an excellent writer, and does a very good job of making astronomy accessible without dumbing it down. Reading this took me back to my childhood and the wonder I felt when I thought about the natural world (universe) and how incredible it is. It also reminded me that science can be fun, regardless of how dull most schooling makes it. A wonderful book, and I would highly recommend it to EVERYONE. My only issue with the book, and the only thing keeping me from giving it 5 stars, is that Sagan gives the human race too much credit. For most of the book, he talks about the universe, what we know, and what is actually there. For the last 50 or so pages, he speculates on where human space travel will go over the next few thousand years. Now Carl, you're obviously a brilliant man, and I have endless respect for your scientific mind and accomplishments, but doesn't that strike you as a bit naive? I mean, humans can't wait to kill each other. Most countries put more into defense (or offense, depending on how you look at it) than education, which means that if we don't manage to destroy each other with our big guns, we'll be too stupid to avoid destroying ourselves some other way. I mean, in the thousands of years we've had, we've been unable to get our shit together within individual homes, much less the planet as a whole. Even if we gained the capability to move onto other planets/asteroids, I don't think that'd solve anything. Then there would just be new, larger targets for our guns. Grr. Okay, human-hating rant aside, it's a great book. Read it. If you're less cynical than I am, you'll like it all the more. "
237,0345376595,http://goodreads.com/user/show/52241811-reed-melvin,5,"There are countless writers out there providing us with insights on nature's mysteries. None of them, however, quite reach the breadth of view or magical feeling that Carl Sagan gives. His writings explained topics ranging from quantum particles to the extent of the cosmos. Along the way, he addressed evolution, space engineering and countless other facets of science and technology. Even fiction wasn't beyond his grasp. Pale Blue Dot is a journey in time and space. Beginning with the assertion that we're natural wanderers, being the only species to settle across our world, it continues with a plea to extend further our exploration of space. The early chapters challenge restrictions on our desire to explore and learn. Sagan demonstrates how foolish minds have restrained our quest for knowledge of the cosmos. He then takes us on a tour of the solar system, exhibiting the wonders revealed by the fleet of robot probes. He reminds us of the forces the cosmos can unleash, sometimes right in our neighborhood. Sagan was awed by the collision of a comet with the Jovian gas giant. It was a hint of what might lay in store for us if we fail to understand the universe better than we do now. The space probes also returned images of worlds invalidating existing theories of planetary formation. If our own neighbors can present such bizarre structures, what kinds of worlds lay out beyond our own planetary community? Anyone even slightly interested in space sciences, or just curious about a potential future and other perspectives, should definitely read this book."
238,0345376595,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5882124-kevin-cecil,4,"Sagan spends the first part of PALE BLUE DOT reminding us of the insignificance of Earth and it's denizens within the enormity of our universe. The second part looks at what we've done to expand our existence beyond one planet, with special attention to the Voyager missions. The third part becomes more speculative, acknowledging that the Sun and Earth are not infinite. That, if we want to survive, we will eventually - in about 7 billon years - have to leave Earth if we don't want to get swallowed up by the Sun. His argument being that it is never too early to start thinking about Plan(et) B.The first chapter, where Sagan describes the Pale Blue Dot image of Earth as captured by Voyager while leaving Saturn's orbit, is simply my favorite written passage in all of human history. The prose is beautiful, the ideas astonishing in their complexity, the message profound in its simplicity. I have listened to that passage well over a hundred times. The book as a whole though, while fantastic, doesn't quite live up to it's opening. The arguments, history and sci-fi predictions are laid out in greater depth, with Sagan's typical poetic accessibility; but nothing else resonates like that astonishing passage. That is to say, if you read nothing else in your entire life, at least read the first chapter of PALE BLUE DOT. And if you have plenty of life and reading plans left, the rest is certainly worth catching up with. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XH7ZR..."
239,0345376595,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5275261-patrick-dijusto,5,"Can you believe I've never read this before?The book is subtitled A Vision of the Human Future in Space, and if my dates are correct, this was written when Carl Sagan knew he had no future himself, being deep into the myelodysplasia that would eventually kill him. So in addition to the rigorous scientific accuracy and sense of wonder common to all Sagan's writing, there's also a palpable sense of wistfulness. ""I know I won't make it with you"", he seems to be saying, ""but you should start here...""The beauty and the wistfulness of Pale Blue Dot has had a curious side effect on our culture. The language of the book is so beautiful, so full of hope, that in recent years a small cottage industry has grown up around producing ""Carl Sagan"" videos: examples of digital animations showing the wonders of the universe, narrated by Sagan's audiobook recording of Pale Blue Dot. Those of us who write wish our books to be read while we're still alive. Sagan's are inspiring art, 20 years after he died. "

242,0345376595,http://goodreads.com/user/show/57263951-nacho-santos,4,"Pale Blue Dot by Carl SaganListening to the first two chapters of this book, I was astonished. It was thought provoking, mind boggling, brilliant. It made me think about existence and the nature of this world. It made me look up and look around myself. It made me look at things I otherwise wouldn’t have paid attention to. (If you are a fan of Sapiens by Yuval Noah Harari, you’ll love it.) Though the first two chapters were amazing, sadly I had to drag myself to finish the other twenty. It was mostly about other planets, space exploration, and delves into related questions regarding it."
243,0345376595,http://goodreads.com/user/show/41735508-noah-goats,3,"Carl Sagan was a gifted thinker and writer, and all his talents are on display in Pale Blue Dot. He writes with more warmth and humanity than most science writers I've read, and it's easy to see how he became the preeminent popularizer of space related science of his day.Of course, his day was a few decades ago now, and as you read this book it soon becomes clear that astronomy and space exploration have made significant advances in the interim period (the number of exoplanets we know of, info from Curiosity and other probes, the age of the universe, all sorts of crap about Titan... our knowledge just keeps growing but this book cannot). Pale Blue Dot is a book that is beginning to show its age, and in many details this it is seriously out of date.I also wish Sagan didn't spend so much time in the first couple chapters talking about how finding out that we are not the literal center of the universe is some kind of blow to human self esteem. People believed earth was the center for a long time, and religions adopted this idea that appeared to be so obvious. But despite what Sagan and those science writers who followed him have to say, I don't believe many people have ever thought they were special because the earth was the center of the universe. Historically, people have been down on earth. For Christians the earth isn't much more than a dirty crust that barely does an adequate job of preventing us from falling straight into hell. Heaven is where it's at. Jesus ascended to the stars when he was done here. And (for pagans) when Julius Caesar was declared a god, a comet passing after his death was said to be his soul rising to take its place among the heavens. I wish Sagan hadn't spent so much time pummeling this particular straw man. Nevertheless, this is still a pretty good book, filled with ideas and arguments about the universe and our place in it that are unfailingly engaging. Sagan's knowledge and passion for his subject are matched by his ability as a writer. He makes the case for space exploration, including manned exploration without ignoring the costs, trade-offs, and dangers. It is in the chapters where Sagan argues for man's expansion into space that the book is at it's best. "
244,0345376595,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1959519-max-maxwell,5,"For the general part of this brief review, I should say that I think that this book was way ahead of its time. Some people will object to this, call it just another pop-sci book, and move on, decrying the science in it for already being out of date, a mere 15 years after publication. ""Obsolescence,"" however, ""is a fate devoutly to be wished,"" reminds Stephen Jay Gould. So what if some of this science is old hat? The vast, and I mean that, vast, majority of Sagan's predictions are already fact, especially his thoughts on the then, and now, burgeoning field of exoplanetary science. I say that Sagan was ahead of his time not because of any particular science in question, though, but because centuries from now, when we have colonized the solar system and its myriad worlds are known to us, we will be able to look at Sagan as the one guy who was on the right track at the end of the twentieth century, whereas most people even at the start of the twenty-first were finding excuses not to spacefar and search for extraterrestrial life. ""SETI,"" remarks Sagan, ""costs less than one attack helicopter a year."" We spend so much on killing each other and so little on exploring together, on being human. Read this book like some people read the Bible and spread the word in the same way; baby steps, eh?As for the edition, it was convenient for me, listening on an iPod at work in a kitchen. But it consists of Sagan reading the abridged edition and J. Charles, an OK, but not noteworthy, narrator, rounding out the remainder, that is, 3 hours of Sagan, 7 of Charles. Go for the illustrated copy of the paperback if you have more time on your hands; I also own that one and turned to it as an augmentation of my listening here."
245,0345376595,http://goodreads.com/user/show/38148349-benjamin-atkinson,5,"To say Carl Sagan is under-rated is probably a stretch for most people; not me. He is one of the most rare of intellectuals; a genius who is grounded and can explain incredibly complicated concepts in simple language without losing information. He is a humane man that does not denigrate others beliefs while strongly espousing his own. Pale Blue Dot is once again very deep but incredibly simple. The farther we go out in space to photograph the planet we all share the signifcance the smaller it appears. The artificial lines that we shortsightedly fight over disappear from this perspective. He really emphasizes the importance of uniting through this realization and take care of our shared home. He talks about the history of physics and astronomy and how religion has distorted and perverted in some cases what are the true natural laws that truly rule our lives. Like many of his books, I strongly recommend this one. It is an academic education and a spiritual enlightenment. I have read all of his books and love them all. If I had to pick two books by Carl Sagan that I think everyone should read it would be ""In a Demon-Haunted World-Science as a Candle in the Dark"" and then this one in that order. Great."
246,0345376595,http://goodreads.com/user/show/13249932-fred,4,"This book represents my first toe-dip into Sagan's writing. He was, as we all know, brilliant. And he was quite the gifted writer. This book may not be enjoyable to the sternly devout religious readers whose belief systems rigidly tether them to unwavering dogma. In fact, I wager most of that segment of the population won't make it through the first chapter before tossing this book in the trash bin. For the rest of us, Sagan leads us through an elegant tour of scientific inquiry into the origins of the universe, of man and his place in it. This reader found it very easy to apply Sagan's thoughts to an assessment of current perceptions and misconceptions about our own importance and our own behaviors as inhabitants of Earth.If there is a downside to this book, it is that Dr. Sagan may go to greater lengths than necessary to make his points. Being a man of science, he was careful to supply lots of supporting evidence. Occasionally in this book, he comes across as pounding home the point that could have easily been laid out before moving on. It's an interesting read. "
247,0345376595,http://goodreads.com/user/show/44354532-simo-ibourki,5,"This is my second book by Carl Sagan (the first was his novel Contact)If Marx's The Capital is communism manifesto, Pale Blue Dot is space exploration manifesto. Sagan talks about nearly everything related to the universe, the place of humans in it, what we have discovered and what we are still searching for (From the formation of our solar system to the apearance of humans to the beginings of space exploration and the future possibilities)Carl Sagan knows how to explain complex scientific concepts and methods in a readable style that any normal non-scientific human like me can understand.Reading about Sagan's vision of the future of humanity was for me the best part of this book, it really makes conflicts and misjudgements futile and non-sense. Space exploration and colonisation will help humans unify their powers and technologies to serve one big goal which is the survival of humanity. "
248,0345376595,http://goodreads.com/user/show/10013767-jeff-mauch,5,"Carl Sagan has this way of describing the moons, planets and vastness of the universe in a way that makes the reader feel like anything is possible for the human race. Sagan had such a sense of wonder when it came to his prose that you couldn't help but be moved by it. In Pale Blue Dot, Sagan summarizes the discoveries and wonders of the universe up to the late 90s and then ponders and describes his view of the coming decades and millennia. Even though this book is 20 years old, its still a much read for anyone interested in space or the possible future of the human race. It's a shame Sagan is no longer with us, while I enjoy the likes of Neil Degrasse Tyson and Bill Nye, nobody expresses the true wonders of the universe in the same way that Sagan did. He was one of a kind and this is probably his greatest work. "
249,0345376595,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3002008-joshua-woodbury,3,"The first part of this book really bugged me. Sagan explains how ridiculous it is for humans to believe that we have a purpose. That is just part of egocentric human nature trying to put itself at the center of the universe. I mean, people once thought the sun rotated around the earth. That wasn't true, so it logically follows that there is no designer to the universe. I don't care that he holds his beliefs, I just do not see what spending so much time on them had to do with our future of space exploration.His look at the planets in our solar system and the future terraforming and space travel were interesting. However, I don't think the case was very strong for the main thrust of his book - that space exploration needs to be a strong priority for us."
250,0345376595,http://goodreads.com/user/show/8303742-subbu,5,"An excellent read.Hadn't read any other books by Sagan before; so wasn't sure what to expect, but impressed by how simply he puts things across. Infectious enthusiasm for curiosity, a great tour of the planets and their moons - and tempered with caution.Brilliant vision about man's possible steps in the future out there among the planets and stars : but before which, we need to set our own home - our insignificant pale blue dot, other than which we have no home as of now - in order, and need to make changes to our institutions - political, economic, religious - whether we like it or not, and stand united, and gain wisdom and not just smartness - if we are not to destroy ourselves before ever stepping out."
251,0345376595,http://goodreads.com/user/show/15862910-steve-granger,5,"Carl Sagan stirs within his readers a passion to adventure and learn, to never stop being curious, and to ultimately reach for the stars. When you listen to the ramblings of dreamers and wanderers about galavanting over the universe, you can't help but be skeptical. But having the benefit of hindsight, it is amazing to have seen so many of Sagan's ideas come to reality. It was as though I was reading a manual for explorers from 1994 to present day. This has to have been by far my favourite book by Sagan, as his passion and genius jumps out at you in every chapter, whether he is exploring distant galaxies to our very egos. A must read for the curious."
252,0345376595,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1444324-leela,5,"It is a visual marvel. Carl Sagan takes us out of our small planet to the edges of Solar System, Andromeda, Oort Clouds, M33, Milky Way and worlds that we either do not know exist or do not enough about those. I do not think I can do justice to this book in this review. I have never been a big reader of space books but boy, thanks to a dear friend, I took my first step with a giant in the field. Read it, it will open your eyes to possibilities beyond our imagination. To top it all off, the language, phew! So compelling, so vivid, so masterful and so moving. I have to now find my way to other works of Carl Sagan."

It was a great loss to the world when he died, and I don’t believe that anyone has since filled his shoes, even Neil deGrasse Tyson’s attempts fall short. Pale Blue Dot starts out with the history of our initial exploration of the solar system with robotic probes visiting the 70 or so bodies that have been explored. It goes on to describe possible future exploration of the solar system by humans including the risks and rewards of venturing down that path. "

This book is mad intelligent. When a world renowned astronomer, astrophysicist, cosmologist... (the list goes on) happens to be an amazing writer and science communicator, he brings to this world nothing but genius works and ideas that hold so much value until this day (PBD is 26 years old which is very old for a scientific informative book, yet still a highly recommended one for all space enthusiasts). The marriage of science, history and politics (just a little bit, only the important, necessary facts were included) was finely executed. This book complements Cosmos very well, they give you the answers to the many space questions you ask yourself. I also love that Ann Druyan, a woman I look up to a lot, worked on this masterpiece too.

263,0345376595,http://goodreads.com/user/show/11463357-suraj,5,"What can I say about this book, that hasn't already been said. Carl Sagan is a hero to a lot of people. Why wouldn't he be, he is a brilliant astrophysicist and an even better writer. Pale Blue Dot makes you think about the progress of life, the vastness of the universe, our place in the big picture. If only we could come together as a race and work towards a common goal, we could achieve so much more. An absolute jewel of a book. "
264,0345376595,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3744803-chris,3,"The title of this book gets its name from the famous photograph taken by Voyager 1 in 1990 as the spacecraft was leaving our Solar System. Due to Carl Sagan's urging, NASA agreed to point Voyager 1's camera toward Earth when it was about 3.7 billion miles from our planet and capture the image. The photo shows our planet Earth as a minuscule dot in the vast expanse of space. Sagan was trying to show how small our home is and at the same time emphasize the vastness of the universe in which we live. Pale Blue Dot is the sequel to Cosmos and devotes time to describing the Solar System and characteristics of several of the planets and moons. Sagan discusses ways in which humans could travel to, and potentially inhabit these planets and moons."

“It is sometimes said that scientists are unromantic, that their passion to figure out robs the world of beauty and mystery. But is it not stirring to understand how the world actually works — that white light is made of colors, that color is the way we perceive the wavelengths of light, that transparent air reflects light, that in so doing it discriminates among the waves, and that the sky is blue for the same reason that the sunset is red? It does no harm to the romance of the sunset to know a little bit about it.”
I’ll be honest – I wish I could quote almost the entirety of this book just to show how wonderfully  Carl Sagan marries science, philosophy, and a sense of wonderment, and molds it all into literary poetry.Most widely known for the television series Cosmos, Sagan was a beloved planetary scientist and astronomer who popularized science, raised awareness for global warming, and did a myriad of other things that inspired people from all around the world.Where his book  Cosmos read as a more scientific journey throughout the universe, explaining core concepts of planetology and astronomy,  Pale Blue Dot takes a broader approach – and dives into the history and future of humanity’s journey into space.Every one of his works has a slightly philosophical approach; Sagan never examines things out of their context, and takes into careful consideration the history, environment, mindset, intent, and even global politics of his topics. He tackles complex issues – from the origins of Venus’ atmosphere to Cold War mindsets that contributed to the smooth and successful funding of Apollo II – and in an easy, accessible way without ever using too much technical jargon.His intelligence and insight give the exploration of the wanderlust in us humans a realistic tone, and he remains optimistic throughout. Even as he examines humanity’s lesser moments, our faults and our frailty, he calls us to action and allows us to hope; if we realize what we’re doing to ourselves, the environment, and the Earth itself, we can choose to do what’s right for all of us. There is no bleakness as Sagan looks out to the stars, and you realize that we might yet scale heaven sometime in the future. And below that all is science that propels his arguments and clarifies his train of thought.It’s illuminating, it’s mind-blowing, and it’s just such a damn joy to read. I’ve never met a writer who could do this – capture the joy, the wonder, the uttermost bedazzlement at how small you are in such a big universe, and how beautiful that realization is.To me, science could never be cold and unromantic. And Sagan can tell you why."
266,0345376595,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1271545-david,4,"Carl Sagan has a wonderful ability to share his passion for science and the natural world. He's an excellent writer, and does a very good job of making astronomy accessible without dumbing it down. Reading this took me back to my childhood and the wonder I felt when I thought about the natural world (universe) and how incredible it is. It also reminded me that science can be fun, regardless of how dull most schooling makes it. A wonderful book, and I would highly recommend it to EVERYONE. My only issue with the book, and the only thing keeping me from giving it 5 stars, is that Sagan gives the human race too much credit. For most of the book, he talks about the universe, what we know, and what is actually there. For the last 50 or so pages, he speculates on where human space travel will go over the next few thousand years. Now Carl, you're obviously a brilliant man, and I have endless respect for your scientific mind and accomplishments, but doesn't that strike you as a bit naive? I mean, humans can't wait to kill each other. Most countries put more into defense (or offense, depending on how you look at it) than education, which means that if we don't manage to destroy each other with our big guns, we'll be too stupid to avoid destroying ourselves some other way. I mean, in the thousands of years we've had, we've been unable to get our shit together within individual homes, much less the planet as a whole. Even if we gained the capability to move onto other planets/asteroids, I don't think that'd solve anything. Then there would just be new, larger targets for our guns. Grr. Okay, human-hating rant aside, it's a great book. Read it. If you're less cynical than I am, you'll like it all the more. "
267,0345376595,http://goodreads.com/user/show/52241811-reed-melvin,5,"There are countless writers out there providing us with insights on nature's mysteries. None of them, however, quite reach the breadth of view or magical feeling that Carl Sagan gives. His writings explained topics ranging from quantum particles to the extent of the cosmos. Along the way, he addressed evolution, space engineering and countless other facets of science and technology. Even fiction wasn't beyond his grasp. Pale Blue Dot is a journey in time and space. Beginning with the assertion that we're natural wanderers, being the only species to settle across our world, it continues with a plea to extend further our exploration of space. The early chapters challenge restrictions on our desire to explore and learn. Sagan demonstrates how foolish minds have restrained our quest for knowledge of the cosmos. He then takes us on a tour of the solar system, exhibiting the wonders revealed by the fleet of robot probes. He reminds us of the forces the cosmos can unleash, sometimes right in our neighborhood. Sagan was awed by the collision of a comet with the Jovian gas giant. It was a hint of what might lay in store for us if we fail to understand the universe better than we do now. The space probes also returned images of worlds invalidating existing theories of planetary formation. If our own neighbors can present such bizarre structures, what kinds of worlds lay out beyond our own planetary community? Anyone even slightly interested in space sciences, or just curious about a potential future and other perspectives, should definitely read this book."
268,0345376595,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5882124-kevin-cecil,4,"Sagan spends the first part of PALE BLUE DOT reminding us of the insignificance of Earth and it's denizens within the enormity of our universe. The second part looks at what we've done to expand our existence beyond one planet, with special attention to the Voyager missions. The third part becomes more speculative, acknowledging that the Sun and Earth are not infinite. That, if we want to survive, we will eventually - in about 7 billon years - have to leave Earth if we don't want to get swallowed up by the Sun. His argument being that it is never too early to start thinking about Plan(et) B.The first chapter, where Sagan describes the Pale Blue Dot image of Earth as captured by Voyager while leaving Saturn's orbit, is simply my favorite written passage in all of human history. The prose is beautiful, the ideas astonishing in their complexity, the message profound in its simplicity. I have listened to that passage well over a hundred times. The book as a whole though, while fantastic, doesn't quite live up to it's opening. The arguments, history and sci-fi predictions are laid out in greater depth, with Sagan's typical poetic accessibility; but nothing else resonates like that astonishing passage. That is to say, if you read nothing else in your entire life, at least read the first chapter of PALE BLUE DOT. And if you have plenty of life and reading plans left, the rest is certainly worth catching up with. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XH7ZR..."
269,0345376595,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5275261-patrick-dijusto,5,"Can you believe I've never read this before?The book is subtitled A Vision of the Human Future in Space, and if my dates are correct, this was written when Carl Sagan knew he had no future himself, being deep into the myelodysplasia that would eventually kill him. So in addition to the rigorous scientific accuracy and sense of wonder common to all Sagan's writing, there's also a palpable sense of wistfulness. ""I know I won't make it with you"", he seems to be saying, ""but you should start here...""The beauty and the wistfulness of Pale Blue Dot has had a curious side effect on our culture. The language of the book is so beautiful, so full of hope, that in recent years a small cottage industry has grown up around producing ""Carl Sagan"" videos: examples of digital animations showing the wonders of the universe, narrated by Sagan's audiobook recording of Pale Blue Dot. Those of us who write wish our books to be read while we're still alive. Sagan's are inspiring art, 20 years after he died. "

272,0345376595,http://goodreads.com/user/show/57263951-nacho-santos,4,"Pale Blue Dot by Carl SaganListening to the first two chapters of this book, I was astonished. It was thought provoking, mind boggling, brilliant. It made me think about existence and the nature of this world. It made me look up and look around myself. It made me look at things I otherwise wouldn’t have paid attention to. (If you are a fan of Sapiens by Yuval Noah Harari, you’ll love it.) Though the first two chapters were amazing, sadly I had to drag myself to finish the other twenty. It was mostly about other planets, space exploration, and delves into related questions regarding it."
273,0345376595,http://goodreads.com/user/show/41735508-noah-goats,3,"Carl Sagan was a gifted thinker and writer, and all his talents are on display in Pale Blue Dot. He writes with more warmth and humanity than most science writers I've read, and it's easy to see how he became the preeminent popularizer of space related science of his day.Of course, his day was a few decades ago now, and as you read this book it soon becomes clear that astronomy and space exploration have made significant advances in the interim period (the number of exoplanets we know of, info from Curiosity and other probes, the age of the universe, all sorts of crap about Titan... our knowledge just keeps growing but this book cannot). Pale Blue Dot is a book that is beginning to show its age, and in many details this it is seriously out of date.I also wish Sagan didn't spend so much time in the first couple chapters talking about how finding out that we are not the literal center of the universe is some kind of blow to human self esteem. People believed earth was the center for a long time, and religions adopted this idea that appeared to be so obvious. But despite what Sagan and those science writers who followed him have to say, I don't believe many people have ever thought they were special because the earth was the center of the universe. Historically, people have been down on earth. For Christians the earth isn't much more than a dirty crust that barely does an adequate job of preventing us from falling straight into hell. Heaven is where it's at. Jesus ascended to the stars when he was done here. And (for pagans) when Julius Caesar was declared a god, a comet passing after his death was said to be his soul rising to take its place among the heavens. I wish Sagan hadn't spent so much time pummeling this particular straw man. Nevertheless, this is still a pretty good book, filled with ideas and arguments about the universe and our place in it that are unfailingly engaging. Sagan's knowledge and passion for his subject are matched by his ability as a writer. He makes the case for space exploration, including manned exploration without ignoring the costs, trade-offs, and dangers. It is in the chapters where Sagan argues for man's expansion into space that the book is at it's best. "
274,0345376595,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1959519-max-maxwell,5,"For the general part of this brief review, I should say that I think that this book was way ahead of its time. Some people will object to this, call it just another pop-sci book, and move on, decrying the science in it for already being out of date, a mere 15 years after publication. ""Obsolescence,"" however, ""is a fate devoutly to be wished,"" reminds Stephen Jay Gould. So what if some of this science is old hat? The vast, and I mean that, vast, majority of Sagan's predictions are already fact, especially his thoughts on the then, and now, burgeoning field of exoplanetary science. I say that Sagan was ahead of his time not because of any particular science in question, though, but because centuries from now, when we have colonized the solar system and its myriad worlds are known to us, we will be able to look at Sagan as the one guy who was on the right track at the end of the twentieth century, whereas most people even at the start of the twenty-first were finding excuses not to spacefar and search for extraterrestrial life. ""SETI,"" remarks Sagan, ""costs less than one attack helicopter a year."" We spend so much on killing each other and so little on exploring together, on being human. Read this book like some people read the Bible and spread the word in the same way; baby steps, eh?As for the edition, it was convenient for me, listening on an iPod at work in a kitchen. But it consists of Sagan reading the abridged edition and J. Charles, an OK, but not noteworthy, narrator, rounding out the remainder, that is, 3 hours of Sagan, 7 of Charles. Go for the illustrated copy of the paperback if you have more time on your hands; I also own that one and turned to it as an augmentation of my listening here."
275,0345376595,http://goodreads.com/user/show/38148349-benjamin-atkinson,5,"To say Carl Sagan is under-rated is probably a stretch for most people; not me. He is one of the most rare of intellectuals; a genius who is grounded and can explain incredibly complicated concepts in simple language without losing information. He is a humane man that does not denigrate others beliefs while strongly espousing his own. Pale Blue Dot is once again very deep but incredibly simple. The farther we go out in space to photograph the planet we all share the signifcance the smaller it appears. The artificial lines that we shortsightedly fight over disappear from this perspective. He really emphasizes the importance of uniting through this realization and take care of our shared home. He talks about the history of physics and astronomy and how religion has distorted and perverted in some cases what are the true natural laws that truly rule our lives. Like many of his books, I strongly recommend this one. It is an academic education and a spiritual enlightenment. I have read all of his books and love them all. If I had to pick two books by Carl Sagan that I think everyone should read it would be ""In a Demon-Haunted World-Science as a Candle in the Dark"" and then this one in that order. Great."
276,0345376595,http://goodreads.com/user/show/13249932-fred,4,"This book represents my first toe-dip into Sagan's writing. He was, as we all know, brilliant. And he was quite the gifted writer. This book may not be enjoyable to the sternly devout religious readers whose belief systems rigidly tether them to unwavering dogma. In fact, I wager most of that segment of the population won't make it through the first chapter before tossing this book in the trash bin. For the rest of us, Sagan leads us through an elegant tour of scientific inquiry into the origins of the universe, of man and his place in it. This reader found it very easy to apply Sagan's thoughts to an assessment of current perceptions and misconceptions about our own importance and our own behaviors as inhabitants of Earth.If there is a downside to this book, it is that Dr. Sagan may go to greater lengths than necessary to make his points. Being a man of science, he was careful to supply lots of supporting evidence. Occasionally in this book, he comes across as pounding home the point that could have easily been laid out before moving on. It's an interesting read. "
277,0345376595,http://goodreads.com/user/show/44354532-simo-ibourki,5,"This is my second book by Carl Sagan (the first was his novel Contact)If Marx's The Capital is communism manifesto, Pale Blue Dot is space exploration manifesto. Sagan talks about nearly everything related to the universe, the place of humans in it, what we have discovered and what we are still searching for (From the formation of our solar system to the apearance of humans to the beginings of space exploration and the future possibilities)Carl Sagan knows how to explain complex scientific concepts and methods in a readable style that any normal non-scientific human like me can understand.Reading about Sagan's vision of the future of humanity was for me the best part of this book, it really makes conflicts and misjudgements futile and non-sense. Space exploration and colonisation will help humans unify their powers and technologies to serve one big goal which is the survival of humanity. "
278,0345376595,http://goodreads.com/user/show/10013767-jeff-mauch,5,"Carl Sagan has this way of describing the moons, planets and vastness of the universe in a way that makes the reader feel like anything is possible for the human race. Sagan had such a sense of wonder when it came to his prose that you couldn't help but be moved by it. In Pale Blue Dot, Sagan summarizes the discoveries and wonders of the universe up to the late 90s and then ponders and describes his view of the coming decades and millennia. Even though this book is 20 years old, its still a much read for anyone interested in space or the possible future of the human race. It's a shame Sagan is no longer with us, while I enjoy the likes of Neil Degrasse Tyson and Bill Nye, nobody expresses the true wonders of the universe in the same way that Sagan did. He was one of a kind and this is probably his greatest work. "
279,0345376595,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3002008-joshua-woodbury,3,"The first part of this book really bugged me. Sagan explains how ridiculous it is for humans to believe that we have a purpose. That is just part of egocentric human nature trying to put itself at the center of the universe. I mean, people once thought the sun rotated around the earth. That wasn't true, so it logically follows that there is no designer to the universe. I don't care that he holds his beliefs, I just do not see what spending so much time on them had to do with our future of space exploration.His look at the planets in our solar system and the future terraforming and space travel were interesting. However, I don't think the case was very strong for the main thrust of his book - that space exploration needs to be a strong priority for us."
280,0345376595,http://goodreads.com/user/show/8303742-subbu,5,"An excellent read.Hadn't read any other books by Sagan before; so wasn't sure what to expect, but impressed by how simply he puts things across. Infectious enthusiasm for curiosity, a great tour of the planets and their moons - and tempered with caution.Brilliant vision about man's possible steps in the future out there among the planets and stars : but before which, we need to set our own home - our insignificant pale blue dot, other than which we have no home as of now - in order, and need to make changes to our institutions - political, economic, religious - whether we like it or not, and stand united, and gain wisdom and not just smartness - if we are not to destroy ourselves before ever stepping out."
281,0345376595,http://goodreads.com/user/show/15862910-steve-granger,5,"Carl Sagan stirs within his readers a passion to adventure and learn, to never stop being curious, and to ultimately reach for the stars. When you listen to the ramblings of dreamers and wanderers about galavanting over the universe, you can't help but be skeptical. But having the benefit of hindsight, it is amazing to have seen so many of Sagan's ideas come to reality. It was as though I was reading a manual for explorers from 1994 to present day. This has to have been by far my favourite book by Sagan, as his passion and genius jumps out at you in every chapter, whether he is exploring distant galaxies to our very egos. A must read for the curious."

Carl Sagan takes us out of our small planet to the edges of Solar System, Andromeda, Oort Clouds, M33, Milky Way and worlds that we either do not know exist or do not enough about those. I do not think I can do justice to this book in this review. I have never been a big reader of space books but boy, thanks to a dear friend, I took my first step with a giant in the field. Read it, it will open your eyes to possibilities beyond our imagination. To top it all off, the language, phew! So compelling, so vivid, so masterful and so moving. I have to now find my way to other works of Carl Sagan."

It was a great loss to the world when he died, and I don’t believe that anyone has since filled his shoes, even Neil deGrasse Tyson’s attempts fall short. Pale Blue Dot starts out with the history of our initial exploration of the solar system with robotic probes visiting the 70 or so bodies that have been explored. It goes on to describe possible future exploration of the solar system by humans including the risks and rewards of venturing down that path. "

This book is mad intelligent. When a world renowned astronomer, astrophysicist, cosmologist... (the list goes on) happens to be an amazing writer and science communicator, he brings to this world nothing but genius works and ideas that hold so much value until this day (PBD is 26 years old which is very old for a scientific informative book, yet still a highly recommended one for all space enthusiasts). The marriage of science, history and politics (just a little bit, only the important, necessary facts were included) was finely executed. This book complements Cosmos very well, they give you the answers to the many space questions you ask yourself. I also love that Ann Druyan, a woman I look up to a lot, worked on this masterpiece too.

293,0345376595,http://goodreads.com/user/show/11463357-suraj,5,"What can I say about this book, that hasn't already been said. Carl Sagan is a hero to a lot of people. Why wouldn't he be, he is a brilliant astrophysicist and an even better writer. Pale Blue Dot makes you think about the progress of life, the vastness of the universe, our place in the big picture. If only we could come together as a race and work towards a common goal, we could achieve so much more. An absolute jewel of a book. "
294,0345376595,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3744803-chris,3,"The title of this book gets its name from the famous photograph taken by Voyager 1 in 1990 as the spacecraft was leaving our Solar System. Due to Carl Sagan's urging, NASA agreed to point Voyager 1's camera toward Earth when it was about 3.7 billion miles from our planet and capture the image. The photo shows our planet Earth as a minuscule dot in the vast expanse of space. Sagan was trying to show how small our home is and at the same time emphasize the vastness of the universe in which we live. Pale Blue Dot is the sequel to Cosmos and devotes time to describing the Solar System and characteristics of several of the planets and moons. Sagan discusses ways in which humans could travel to, and potentially inhabit these planets and moons."

“It is sometimes said that scientists are unromantic, that their passion to figure out robs the world of beauty and mystery. But is it not stirring to understand how the world actually works — that white light is made of colors, that color is the way we perceive the wavelengths of light, that transparent air reflects light, that in so doing it discriminates among the waves, and that the sky is blue for the same reason that the sunset is red? It does no harm to the romance of the sunset to know a little bit about it.”
I’ll be honest – I wish I could quote almost the entirety of this book just to show how wonderfully  Carl Sagan marries science, philosophy, and a sense of wonderment, and molds it all into literary poetry.Most widely known for the television series Cosmos, Sagan was a beloved planetary scientist and astronomer who popularized science, raised awareness for global warming, and did a myriad of other things that inspired people from all around the world.Where his book  Cosmos read as a more scientific journey throughout the universe, explaining core concepts of planetology and astronomy,  Pale Blue Dot takes a broader approach – and dives into the history and future of humanity’s journey into space.Every one of his works has a slightly philosophical approach; Sagan never examines things out of their context, and takes into careful consideration the history, environment, mindset, intent, and even global politics of his topics. He tackles complex issues – from the origins of Venus’ atmosphere to Cold War mindsets that contributed to the smooth and successful funding of Apollo II – and in an easy, accessible way without ever using too much technical jargon.His intelligence and insight give the exploration of the wanderlust in us humans a realistic tone, and he remains optimistic throughout. Even as he examines humanity’s lesser moments, our faults and our frailty, he calls us to action and allows us to hope; if we realize what we’re doing to ourselves, the environment, and the Earth itself, we can choose to do what’s right for all of us. There is no bleakness as Sagan looks out to the stars, and you realize that we might yet scale heaven sometime in the future. And below that all is science that propels his arguments and clarifies his train of thought.It’s illuminating, it’s mind-blowing, and it’s just such a damn joy to read. I’ve never met a writer who could do this – capture the joy, the wonder, the uttermost bedazzlement at how small you are in such a big universe, and how beautiful that realization is.To me, science could never be cold and unromantic. And Sagan can tell you why."
296,0345376595,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1271545-david,4,"Carl Sagan has a wonderful ability to share his passion for science and the natural world. He's an excellent writer, and does a very good job of making astronomy accessible without dumbing it down. Reading this took me back to my childhood and the wonder I felt when I thought about the natural world (universe) and how incredible it is. It also reminded me that science can be fun, regardless of how dull most schooling makes it. A wonderful book, and I would highly recommend it to EVERYONE. My only issue with the book, and the only thing keeping me from giving it 5 stars, is that Sagan gives the human race too much credit. For most of the book, he talks about the universe, what we know, and what is actually there. For the last 50 or so pages, he speculates on where human space travel will go over the next few thousand years. Now Carl, you're obviously a brilliant man, and I have endless respect for your scientific mind and accomplishments, but doesn't that strike you as a bit naive? I mean, humans can't wait to kill each other. Most countries put more into defense (or offense, depending on how you look at it) than education, which means that if we don't manage to destroy each other with our big guns, we'll be too stupid to avoid destroying ourselves some other way. I mean, in the thousands of years we've had, we've been unable to get our shit together within individual homes, much less the planet as a whole. Even if we gained the capability to move onto other planets/asteroids, I don't think that'd solve anything. Then there would just be new, larger targets for our guns. Grr. Okay, human-hating rant aside, it's a great book. Read it. If you're less cynical than I am, you'll like it all the more. "
297,0345376595,http://goodreads.com/user/show/52241811-reed-melvin,5,"There are countless writers out there providing us with insights on nature's mysteries. None of them, however, quite reach the breadth of view or magical feeling that Carl Sagan gives. His writings explained topics ranging from quantum particles to the extent of the cosmos. Along the way, he addressed evolution, space engineering and countless other facets of science and technology. Even fiction wasn't beyond his grasp. Pale Blue Dot is a journey in time and space. Beginning with the assertion that we're natural wanderers, being the only species to settle across our world, it continues with a plea to extend further our exploration of space. The early chapters challenge restrictions on our desire to explore and learn. Sagan demonstrates how foolish minds have restrained our quest for knowledge of the cosmos. He then takes us on a tour of the solar system, exhibiting the wonders revealed by the fleet of robot probes. He reminds us of the forces the cosmos can unleash, sometimes right in our neighborhood. Sagan was awed by the collision of a comet with the Jovian gas giant. It was a hint of what might lay in store for us if we fail to understand the universe better than we do now. The space probes also returned images of worlds invalidating existing theories of planetary formation. If our own neighbors can present such bizarre structures, what kinds of worlds lay out beyond our own planetary community? Anyone even slightly interested in space sciences, or just curious about a potential future and other perspectives, should definitely read this book."
298,0345376595,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5882124-kevin-cecil,4,"Sagan spends the first part of PALE BLUE DOT reminding us of the insignificance of Earth and it's denizens within the enormity of our universe. The second part looks at what we've done to expand our existence beyond one planet, with special attention to the Voyager missions. The third part becomes more speculative, acknowledging that the Sun and Earth are not infinite. That, if we want to survive, we will eventually - in about 7 billon years - have to leave Earth if we don't want to get swallowed up by the Sun. His argument being that it is never too early to start thinking about Plan(et) B.The first chapter, where Sagan describes the Pale Blue Dot image of Earth as captured by Voyager while leaving Saturn's orbit, is simply my favorite written passage in all of human history. The prose is beautiful, the ideas astonishing in their complexity, the message profound in its simplicity. I have listened to that passage well over a hundred times. The book as a whole though, while fantastic, doesn't quite live up to it's opening. The arguments, history and sci-fi predictions are laid out in greater depth, with Sagan's typical poetic accessibility; but nothing else resonates like that astonishing passage. That is to say, if you read nothing else in your entire life, at least read the first chapter of PALE BLUE DOT. And if you have plenty of life and reading plans left, the rest is certainly worth catching up with. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XH7ZR..."
299,0345376595,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5275261-patrick-dijusto,5,"Can you believe I've never read this before?The book is subtitled A Vision of the Human Future in Space, and if my dates are correct, this was written when Carl Sagan knew he had no future himself, being deep into the myelodysplasia that would eventually kill him. So in addition to the rigorous scientific accuracy and sense of wonder common to all Sagan's writing, there's also a palpable sense of wistfulness. ""I know I won't make it with you"", he seems to be saying, ""but you should start here...""The beauty and the wistfulness of Pale Blue Dot has had a curious side effect on our culture. The language of the book is so beautiful, so full of hope, that in recent years a small cottage industry has grown up around producing ""Carl Sagan"" videos: examples of digital animations showing the wonders of the universe, narrated by Sagan's audiobook recording of Pale Blue Dot. Those of us who write wish our books to be read while we're still alive. Sagan's are inspiring art, 20 years after he died. "
