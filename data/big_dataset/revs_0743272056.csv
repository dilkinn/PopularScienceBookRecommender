0,0743272056,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1836077-lightreads,3,"It’s impossible to talk about the history of the brain – about the history of medicine at large, actually – without also talking about religion and politics and philosophy. Mostly religion, as you might expect. This book tackles all of the above with admirable aplomb, starting off with one of my favorite childhood anecdotes about the ancient Egyptian burial custom of removing the brain through the nostrils because it was clearly a useless organ (how can you not love that; it’s totally disgusting!). We hop on through the first anatomists, sojourn a bit with alchemy, pause for natural philosophy, and then settle down in fifteenth-century England for the majority of the book. This is a bit too broad to be classified as a biography of Thomas Willis (the father of neuroscience), but it’s a close thing. It’s a thorough, ranging but focused account of the history of the brain and how we conceive of our conscious minds, our souls, ourselves as animals. And a whole lot of familiar names keep popping up, like Hobbes and Locke (a doctor, which I had forgotten) and the two Roberts (Boyle and Hooke) who are better known for their work in physics and chemistry, but who actually made enormous contributions to the understanding of human respiration and blood oxygenation.Well-researched, entirely lucid, a bit rambling but in the good way. There’s a whole hell of a lot of ground to cover when you start out before we even realized the brain was the seat of consciousness, not to mention the many theologians and anatomists alike who maintained the soul by its nature could not be physical. This book covers most of that very well, particularly in detailing the ebb and flow of experimentation through England’s revolution and restoration. I was unsatisfied by the sudden 350 year leap made in the last chapter, and the rushed treatment of modern nuropharmacology and the potential of MRI studies (what is the brain doing when confronted with some of those awful moral philosophy questions – in situation x you can save five people by killing one, what do you do?). I honestly would have been happier had the book simply maintained its historical focus and stopped in the fifteenth century. Which would have left the “and how it changed the world” part mostly to inference, but I almost would have preferred inference to the rushed and vague cap on an otherwise nuanced account. The writing here is also rather dry. It’s not bad by any stretch of the imagination – it’s more invisible than anything – and I’m spoiled by the last nonfiction I read. Still, it’s a consideration. On balance, this is definitely a book you will like if you like that sort of thing. Otherwise it will be deeply dull. Luckily, I like that sort of thing."
1,0743272056,http://goodreads.com/user/show/8464281-darnell,4,Very interesting look into the scientific period where people switched from thinking that the heart was the source of the mind to the brain being the source. Also some good writing on the changes in the scientific method during that time. My only complaint is that there was a little too much biography of historical figures for my taste.
2,0743272056,http://goodreads.com/user/show/19341029-aur-lien-thomas,3,"It's difficult to think, but for centuries the heart was considered as the ruler of the body - not the brain. When medicine was based all around a set of four humours those unbalance were supposedly the source of all diseases, the brain was seen as just a nest for 'pumps', various ventricules just there to distribute 'vital fluids'. Thomas Willis, a 17th century English doctor and scientist, will radically change all that.Willis was the first to describe some sort of 'animal spirit' travelling through the brain and being responsible for our emotions and various skills (eg. perception...), what we would describe now as the electrical signals travelling through neurons to neurons. Willis was the first to understand that different parts of the brain had different functions. Willis was the first to note that the human brain bears striking similarities with the brains of other animals - which will later make sense in the light of evolutionary biology. Willis had dissected the human body with such careful precision that, his anatomy of the brain and nerves not only led him to coin the word 'neurology' (a new whole science) but, also, discover a crucial set of arteries supplying the brain with blood (a set of arteries named after him -'the circle of Willis'). Willis completely blew away the previous paradigm whereas the heart was the ruler of the body (illnesses the product of an unbalance in four humours) to demonstrate instead that most diseases could be linked to abnormalities in the brain. The shift was massive. As Carl Zimmer asserts:'Thomas Willis ushered in the Neurocentric Age... His mixture of anatomy, experiment, and medical observation has set the agenda of neuroscience into the twenty-first century.'Delving into the life of such a bold and curious scientist, whose insights would be radical for our understanding of ourselves, is fascinating enough. Carl Zimmer, on that score, does an amazing job in retracing the biography of this original doctor. Even more remarkable, though, is the context into which Thomas Willis worked and evolved. England, back then, was indeed at the throat of a Civil War that saw Royalists fighting Parliamentarians, and Christians battling each other (the Church of England against the Puritans against the Quakers). Willis' time was the time of a king being put to death, the two Cromwell, and of the Restoration. Chaotic? Surely. And for a Royalist like him, well, not that great! And yet... Willis was working in Oxford, the University from where he had graduated, and Oxford was then a strange peaceful haven in the surrounding chaos:'A poor, orphan soldier on the losing side of a civil war, he [Thomas Willis] would struggle for a decade to survive in the turmoil between Puritans and conspiring royalists, in a country still facing years of war and the execution of a king. For Willis and many like him these years would feel like a national insanity. Yet the political chaos also turned Oxford intellectually into a fizzing vial of spirits, a place where alchemists jostled with Aristotelians, where telescopes were trained at the sky and microscopes at the legs of fleas.'And Carl Zimmer describes the place superbly: John Wilkins was there, Robert Boyle was there, William Petty was there, Christopher Wren was there, Robert Hooke was there... You get it! That bizarre melting-pot to such brilliant minds of all sorts would be the ferment of the Royal Society, created in 1662 and of which Willis was a founding member.No matter how radical their ideas, though, these brilliant minds were still pretty much clinging to ancient beliefs and paradigms, Willis included. This is where the author manages to show us a man in all its contradictions: a scientist firmly grounded in experiments, who, yet, also dabbled into mysticism, alchemy, and, as a doctor, used to prescribe weird remedies reminiscent of snake oils! The 17th century might have been exciting and ground-breaking time for science (eg. besides his work on the brain, Willis will also pick up on William Harvey's discovery to experiment with blood transfusion...). It was also the age of Alchemy and superstitions, and, the mix of both makes for a bizarre era to plunge into. A deep and engaging book, 'Soul Made Flesh' goes way beyond Willis, the Civil War and its impact, and, the burgeoning Royal Society. It depicts how a fascinating bunch of intellectuals of all sort, gathered in Oxford, would radically change the face of science besides greatly impact on modern medicine. Willis was more than a virtuosi, he was the first neuroscientist. Carl Zimmer, surely, does a great job in retelling it all; but be warned: it's so wide-encompassing and detailed, it's at times quite difficult to follow! So many names, so many intricacies, so many bubbling and contradictory ideas! Nevertheless, here's a biography to discover."
3,0743272056,http://goodreads.com/user/show/60074558-xander,2,"In Soul Made Flesh (2003), Zimmer describes the scientific revolution of the 17th century in terms of medicine and psychology. Before the 17th century most of medicine was based on Hippocrates and Galen, which in essence was an explanation for the workings of our bodies and diseases in terms of the relative abundance of four bodily fluids. This was not science as we know it, this was all based on deductive logical systems à la Aristotle, mixed with a unhealthy dose of mysticism. René Descartes was the first natural philosopher to erect a materialistic scientific model of the world: everything is based on the motions and collisions of particles (atoms). Humans differ from the rest of the immaterial matter and animals because humans have an immaterial soul. Later thinkers like Hobbes would take this scientific outlook even further and tried to build politics and ethics on the workings of material particles (i.e. humans). On the other side were empiricists like William Harvey - the discoverer of the function of the heart in terms of blood circulation - who worked in the tradition that Francis Bacon founded (i.e. using experiments to search for truth). A relatively obscure Englishman called Thomas Willis tried to manoeuvre between both camps. On one hand Willis discovered the anatomy and the workings of brains and nervous systems - and thereby explaining our bodily and mental illnesses in neurological and physical terms. On the other hand, Willis held fast to a Rational Soul that delegates the sensual tasks (receiving and processing information) to lower systems (i.e. Sensitive Souls). This Rational Soul was supposed to be immaterial and immortal and was the place where 'the will', ethics, In broad outlines, this is the major transition in medicine and psychology that happened in the 17th century. In the 21st century, we know that our functioning (as well as the functioning of any other organism) depends on some sort of information processing and that illnesses - physical as well as mental (not that this distinction makes much sense anymore) have nothing to do with spirits, souls or bodily fluids, but have physical causes. That this view of medicine and psychology took until deep into the 20th century to be recognized as the truth, was due to John Locke, who with his Essay Concerning Human Understanding shifted the attention in medicine and psychology to 'ideas' instead of 'anatomy'. One of the offshoots of this Englightenment-mistake is the idea of moral realism. It's only in recent decades that we have shifted towards moral intuitionism: ethics is nothing more (or less!) than our intuitions of what's good or bad. It seems that most of our personal decisions are guided by emotions; only the more distant decisions are guided by logic/rational thought. As Zimmer states: ""Sometimes we act like Mill (emotion), sometimes we act like Kant (rational)"" (p.294). It just depends on the subject; and neuroscience can inform us when it's important not to give (too much) in to emotion.Zimmer does a good job in explaining all the important steps in this major transition. The revolution in medicine/psychology is one that easily gets overlooked in treatments of the scientific revolution. There are a lot important insights in this book: the influence of alchemy on the discovery of drugs and on the drive to search for physical explanations of the workings of our bodies; the intricate interplay between the political turbulence (Civil War, religious outbursts, the various political factions), the role of Oxford and religious convictions about (the existence of) the immortal soul; the importance of empirical evidence to support scientific theories; the origin of the Royal Society. The most interesting part of the book was (for me) by far the background information on the various actors; it is really refreshing to read something about giants like John Locke, René Descartes, William Harvey, Robbert Boyle, etc. that has nothing to do with their philosophies or scientific discoveries. It makes them more human than in most other treatments of these subjects."
4,0743272056,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4947834-dave-ciskowski,3,"A solid introduction to the history of the realization of the role of the brain. The book centers on Thomas Willis, the alchemist, physician, and anatomist. His studies, conducted among the early fellows of the Royal Society in seventeenth-century England, cast off a great deal of ancient and Medieval teaching about the body in general and the brain in particular. The book is strongest at the somewhat grisly work of describing the experiments and dissections conducted by Willis and others who founded the Society, and at placing their education and research in context with their predecessors and peers. (This is at times a difficult book to read over a meal.) I would have liked to read more about research beyond Willis’ immediate circle, in both geographic and temporal proximity; in particular, Willis and his cohort walked us to the edge of further revelatory discoveries, and the book would have been more complete if it had followed along. Likewise, the connections to modern understanding were a bit thin, contained in a single, final chapter. (The 2003 publication date probably doesn’t help, as there’s been much brain and AI research in the last 15 years.) I think too that there are still fundamental philosophical issues that remain relevant that would have been interesting to discuss. Ultimately, it’s a good read, and while a bit slight, is a good overview of the start of a revolution in how medicine and science are conducted."
5,0743272056,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7231894-chris-branch,3,"I’ve enjoyed Zimmer’s books before, and he remains the best science writer I know of who isn’t actually a scientist himself. In this book, he attempts to describe the transition in thinking that happened in the mid to late 1600s, during which alchemy became chemistry and a mystical view of life gave way to scientific thinking about biology and anatomy. As a broad history, it often reads like a summary of notes abridged from a longer textbook. It succeeds in clearly conveying the material, but for me, the author’s usually engaging style fails to shine through as much as it should. While much of the historical information was new to me, including the significant contributions of Harvey, Willis and others, the content was a bit dry and occasionally tedious. I found that I enjoyed the final section the most, where Zimmer brings us up to the present and comments on the work being done more recently in the area of neuroscience, while referring back to the ideas and discoveries that laid the groundwork for our modern understanding."
6,0743272056,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2881115-ed,3,"This book presents a broad brush picture of seventeenth century developments in exploration of the relationship of mind and brain. From my research on the main character in Zimmer's book--Thomas Willis--I can say that Zimmer has got most of the facts of the story right. While many will find his chapters on the political history of this tumultuous era in British history engaging, I found it somewhat distracting. That is merely a matter of taste. Zimmer is a fine story teller. What one gets from this book will depend on what one wants from it. For me it was somewhat superficial."
7,0743272056,http://goodreads.com/user/show/684405-ann-michael,4,"I learned as much about Restoration England as I did about Thomas Willis and the pre-Enlightenment discoveries that led to the science of neurology and the idea of psychology.Interesting read and well-written, though I felt some of the editorial decisions concerning the structure of the book were a bit inconsistent. Interesting perspectives on John Locke and Thomas Hobbes and Christopher Wren."
8,0743272056,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5886527-megan-hex,3,"Interesting if a bit slow at times. The biographical information on various scientists, alchemists, and philosophers was really interesting, as was seeing human understanding make small leaps slowly adding up to more knowledge."
9,0743272056,http://goodreads.com/user/show/32899919-mark-evans,4,The well-told story of the beginnings of what would become modern neurology and the paradigm shift that came with it. 
10,0743272056,http://goodreads.com/user/show/11019520-keith,4,"I was expecting more balanced chronology, instead of the strong focus on the late Middle Ages and early modern period. Well written with lots of interesting anecdotes, though. "
11,0743272056,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6435110-riley,5,A wonderful read about the history and discovery of the brain.
12,0743272056,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6207412-ineffablyschmoo,3,"This book is about Thomas Willis and his compatriots, who in the seventeenth century led the way for a new medical science based in careful observation and experimentation. It's also a book which looks at history, politics and religion, and how these shape the possibility of, and reception to, new ideas. Finally, it is a book which introduces neurology as a science and discusses the spiritual and religious implications of discovering the brain in its neuro-anatomical reality. I found this book a little difficult to read, because it is dense with rich historical, political and religious detail. So it took longer than I would expect a 300-page text written in an accessible style to take. But it is accessibly written, and well worth the effort. Carl Zimmer has a clear and imaginative way of connecting ideas, thoughts and concepts to historical and political situation.I would recommend this book to anyone interested in psychology and neurology, but also to anyone interested in how ideas emerge and are shaped by their historical settings. One of the most fascinating parts of this narrative were the details situating Thomas Willis and his work in the backdrop of civil war and restoration, with the way that his social situation - and the kinds of ideas allowed - changed with these bigger, political shifts. The stories of William Harvey (with his revolutionary ideas about blood circulation) and Thomas Hobbes (with his book on government, the Leviathan) provide illustrative and useful contrasts to the reception of Thomas Willis's work, and perhaps some of the hesitancy of Willis to move too far from Galenistic ideas of how to treat disease. Thomas Willis's work in a sense is a brilliant example of the old and the new co-existing in one theoretical framework - he cannot take the steps further into the new, because his beliefs and his circumstances make this dangerous and near impossible. It's also a brilliant example of the mix of scientific method (as it starts to be established) and old philosophical argument (as it starts to be challenged by new ways of thinking) that makes the early natural philosophers such a curious mix of modern and ancient.I really enjoyed the richness of the stories and the scientific detail of the book. The last chapter, which offers a whistlestop tour of modern neurology and highlights ways in which we can see Willis's influence, is perhaps a little too kind to his legacy, and mixes in lots of ideas and directions in neuroscience in perhaps not the most clear way. As someone versed in MRI and modern neuroscience, I wondered how sensible it would seem to a more lay reader. But, as a whole, I really enjoyed the challenge the book presented, in its rich historical and scientific detail and in its introduction to different ways of thinking and understanding the world. "
13,0743272056,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4623559-toni-moore,5,"I'm a science nerd, and I really like reading about the brain. I also like reading about the history of science. So this book was a perfect fit for me.Carl Zimmer is an excellent writer. He has a knack for making science understandable for non-scientists without ""dumbing down"" the science.The story of the brain ranges from Aristotle to current-day neuroscientists trying to map the brain. Zimmer relates the development of the modern idea of the brain by telling the stories of the men who studied and dissected it through the centuries. As I found in reading another history of science book, ""Darwin's Ghosts,"" dangerous times of civil conflict and rebellion when everything is in flux -- including the accepted scientific wisdom -- are often times when new and radical scientific ideas are generated. There's a lot of intellectual ferment. The old order is crumbling, leaving an empty space, so to speak, for the new order(s) to develop.Zimmer covers the big ideas and the most influential scientists, but he also writes about minor, but critical, characters such as Lady Anne Conway. She lived in England during the mid-17th century and suffered from terrible migraines. Her illness had a profound effect on the research and ideas of Thomas Willis, an English physician who treated her.Here's a passage dealing with Willis: ""Thomas Willis was in the process of installing the soul in the brain, which he saw as part machine, part alembic. . . . Illnesses that had been put down to imbalances in the body's humors or even demonic possession Willis now conceived as the wayward actions of mechanical particles.""Willis is a crucial player in Zimmer's book and very important to the development of the current view of the brain. It seems clear that Zimmer is determined to resurrect the reputation of Willis, who has been largely forgotten. That's obviously part of Zimmer's agenda in writing this book.I found this book fascinating and well-written. At times it read like a thriller, especially during the British civil war, when Willis and his circle of scientifically minded friends met in secret to discuss and test their ideas. I thoroughly recommend it to anyone with an interest in the brain and how it works."
14,0743272056,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1467389-jonathan,3,"I confess to a Physicist's bias as a general feature of my worldview, which, so as it pertains to ""Soul Made Flesh: The Discovery of the Brain and How it Changed the World,"" means that in general, I'm a reductionist, in that I believe almost all phenomena are reducible to basic mathematical laws, and, less rationally, that only those explanations of phenomena which are so expressed are correct or interesting. What is so interesting, then, about ""Soul Made Flesh,"" which is a lay person's history of the development of the so-called ""Doctrine of Nerves,"" (that is, that mind is somehow tightly related to the nervous system, particularly the brain) is the way it describes scientists who, to an almost stunning degree, had to operate in a purely pragmatic and messy universe of anatomy and brute experiment to make their discoveries, the meaning of which they could barely conceive, much less put on a rigorous footing. Which is to say that I left the book with a much greater respect for early biological scientists who, unlike Newton or Galileo, who studied things which human technological prowess allowed one to be quantitative about, had to work with much blunter instruments, and to be satisfied with significantly weaker knowledge. And yet had they given up, in pursuit of more tractable problems, we wouldn't be where we are today. The book is reasonably good history, describing the slow progress from the almost purely irrational conceptions or early greek physicians (and the slavish, comic adherence to those notions on the part of early Medieval doctors) to the peculiar state of affairs wherein a man like Thomas Willis, who formulated a theory of the brain which is, more or less, the one we work with now, could be utterly unable to transform that model into meaningful medicine. Men who first conceived of mental illness as a physical problem with the brain still had to treat people with leeches, ""steel syrup"" and blood letting. It sort of peters out, like all history, I guess, does, as it merges with the present, with some weak musings on the question of dualism, but I still recommend it. "
15,0743272056,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1906185-kaara,5,"I picked this up off the shelves at work where we keep books sent to us for our organization's magazine to review but that we ignored. I was really impressed by it. It's a history of the discovery of our nervous system (and many other anatomical and scientic systems), but it's rendered absolutely fascinating as the author conveys the interplay of these discoveries with the heady and impassioned social, religious, and political contexts of the times.I have a hard time remembering historical events I read about in books. I am generally much more struck by history when I am traveling and can connect a people's and a place's history to what I am seeing around me. This book, however, provided a sort of unifying context, a narrative thread, on which to weave the intrigues of 17th century England--Charles I and Oliver Cromwell, the Puritans and the Church of England, Boyle, Hook, Willis, and even Wren (he was a surgeon as well as an architect). I was fascinated from beginning to end.The book also implicitly presents some very interesting medical ethics questions (the author does not ask or address them directly). These men performed experiments, some turning out to be quite cruel, on dogs and other animals. But from those experiments emerged our understanding of anatomy, physics, and medicine, as well as the entire backbone of the scientific method we use today. The suffering of those animals was worth it...right? They had no choice, no computer simulation models or anything, but what they had to do was shocking. "
16,0743272056,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5718825-kari,3,"This was surprisingly accessible, I was expecting something much more complex but it is aimed as a layman's account which was lucky for me! The story Zimmer told is a fascinating one. He discusses how ideas developed from the ideas of Galen and Plato to the vital work of people like Thomas Willis, William Harvey and Christopher Wren. The work Willis did mapping the brain was an important turning point in how people perceived the brain and the place of the soul within the body. Placing it within the context of English history, Zimmer shows the reactions and problems these men faced in trying to put their ideas across. Hostility from the church and government all played a part in the way in which information was published and what was suppressed or destroyed. The descriptions of some of the experiments carried out, especially those on dogs, are pretty grisly and not for the squeamish. The work did however move scientific thought forward, a work that is still in progress today. It asks you to consider the way we think of the soul today and the medical advances on illnesses associated with the brain. A great glimpse into the science of seventeenth-century England. "
17,0743272056,http://goodreads.com/user/show/8262037-duane-donecker,4,"I have recently become interested in reading books on medical/disease history and picked this one up based on the look of the cover (I do that a lot) and was presently surprised by this one.Carl Zimmer did some excellent research for this book, my mine interest is United States and World History, and in the process of pursuing my love of history I discovered by reading medical history books, not only do you get history of the particular condition relating to the author's subject matter; you also pick up on much of the history of the years covered in the book.That is exactly what Zimmer has done here. Soul Made Flesh is a fantastic read covering the history of how mankind viewed the brain thorough the ages, not only that he also gives you a good understanding of what was going on in the world around the physicians, alchemists and philosophers who were investigating the brain.I recommend this book to anyone interested in history, (mankind or medical). Zimmer turned out a book that is perfect for the layman as well as professionals involved in medicine and gave the world a very interesting read."
18,0743272056,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2446655-lissa-notreallywolf,5,"This is largely devoted to the study of Willis and his associates who formed one of the contingents of the early Royal Society. Willis is the father of neurology and is rarely discussed in anatomy courses or recognized in the history of science. Yet through a number of horrifying experiments on people and many, many dogs, he and Christopher Wren did for neurology what Harvey did for blood and circulation. One of the best aspects of the book is the exploration of the many talents of people like Wren, whom history only recounts as a great architect, when his field was actually astronomy. He also pioneered injections and staining the brain to trace neural pathways, was able to perform a splenectomy on a dog which survived, and many many other accomplishments. And he is not unusual in having diverse talents in the Oxford circle, a group which provided the largest infusion to the Early RS.My only criticism of the book is that I found it difficult to keep the time line straight and to align events because so much of this is a relational history, and many of the associations overlap. But really a great readable book, as long as you aren't eating while reading."

Overall, a good work on the development of anatomy and medicine in the early Enlightenment. As for telling the story of the brain, it takes several chapters of development to get to the important two on its actual discovery and analysis by Willis and friends. For those not well-versed in the era, the background information is well-presented and easy to follow. But from reading so much history from this era I kept finding myself going yadda yadda four humors...yadda yadda comparative anatomy...yadda yadda Galen and Aristotle...LET'S GO ALREADY! Unfortunately, once the meat of the book is finally reached the developments thereafter are summarized into a single chapter, which doesn't do much justice to either Freud or MRIs. Solid for an understanding of pre-Enlightenment anatomy, science, and medicine but not much new information if you've read heavily in the field."

Every new idea and path, produces information, even when proved wrong or false. Any curiosity explored, any question that begs an answer, can be steps towards a refined understanding.Besides making clear iterative science at its best when it comes to neurology, Zimmer also placed historical events (I am embarrassed to admit that these events are most clear to me through my reading of Outlander) against a backdrop of scientific discovery, which I am more familiar with than the ascension of English Royalty. I found that fascinating, as it helped my brain in the iterative process of learning.I have also decided that I must explore the life of Christopher Wren; and I wouldn't mind learning more about Hooke and Boyle either."

It follows Willis mainly and includes a number of his original drawings which were delightful. "

While well researched, I felt it dragged on somewhat, and coming away from the book, I felt more educated about past methods of scientific inquiry than the specific study of the brain."
29,0743272056,http://goodreads.com/user/show/48326269-anderson-ferreira-sepulveda,4,"It is not just about the history of anatomy or physiology of the brain in XVII century, started by Willis. It' about a group of men that initiated a ""scientific revolution"". Zimmer proposes to show how a complicated epoch in England affected and, at same time, encouraged men like Boyle, Hooke, Harvey to begin what we know as modern science."
30,0743272056,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4696922-ushan,4,"The life and times of Thomas Willis, seventeenth-century anatomist, physiologist and one of the first neurologists, an FRS and a contemporary of Boyle, Hooke and Newton, who described the anatomy of human and animal brains with yet-unheard precision."
31,0743272056,http://goodreads.com/user/show/821374-nicole,5,The first book I've found to really tie together the extraordinary people who lay the foundations for most of modern science as it transitioned from alchemical and religious beliefs to empirical study. This is all tied to the cultural background of England's civil war and social change.
32,0743272056,http://goodreads.com/user/show/11536071-georgina,2,I picked this upo having read two others but I have to say I was disappointed. I have found the rest of Carl Zimmers books accesible and readable but found this one dry and difficult to get into or have any interest in. In future I shall stick to his scientific rather than history of science works.
33,0743272056,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3532544-cindy,5,A history of the evolution of neuroscience that is not overly technical. An Oxford University circle of scientists devoted to the scientific method forms the Royal Society for the Promotion of Natural Science ... which later became the Royal Society of Science. 
34,0743272056,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5907537-lucas,5,"Soul Made Flesh provides an amazing insight into the legendary forefathers of neuroscience. Zimmer brings the history and science to life providing a gripping read that also gives the reader an appreciation for the evolution of science throughout history. A great read for anyone, scientist or not."
35,0743272056,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1787954-jack,2,"More history and less biology than I expected from Zimmer. A worthwhile book, but I didn't enjoy it as much as I expected."
36,0743272056,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2674867-lynn,4,"Excellent writing style. Interesting history of neuroscience. If you don't know who Willis is, then you must read this book."
37,0743272056,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3392587-dan-sonnenberg,0,GREAT!!!!!
38,0743272056,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5827385-jennifer,1,"I couldn't do it. I tried...I love science books, I have read tons of them, but this was so dry and boring I just couldn't get through it. Blech."
39,0743272056,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1312257-colleen,4,"enjoyed it. I've read a lot of books on modern neurology, but this one went into the whole history and the ingenious discoveries people made before we even had the technology"
40,0743272056,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2554312-bill-ward,3,"An interesting history of the brain, but not quite as interesting as I'd hoped it would be. More grounding in philosophy would have helped me to grok this better."
41,0743272056,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5609760-s-a,5,Great work. Zimmer grapples with Social metaphors/Conventional wisdoms as they co-evolve with the rational exploration of the human brain. 
42,0743272056,http://goodreads.com/user/show/9197041-homestic,4,Fascinating. History. Science. Morality. All wrapped up in a book about something so fundamental. It's dense with facts and history so wasn't a quick read (for me) - but utterly worthwhile. 
43,0743272056,http://goodreads.com/user/show/56926287-paula,5,what they motivated me to speak
44,0743272056,http://goodreads.com/user/show/22127141-rhys,3,"A history of science, and the emerging understanding of the body and brain, with a hint of a discussion on the mind.""Willis still saved a place in the brain for an immaterial, immortal rational soul, but one that depended profoundly on the sensitive soul. It could not perceive the outside world on its own, and the diseases of the sensitive soul could eclipse the rational soul as well.""I was struck while reading this book with the scientific leap happening during political chaos in England in the mid 1600s. It reminded me of Rudolf Rocker's thesis in Nationalism and Culture where progress in arts and science occurs under more anarchical (in the good way) political situations - fewer political intrusions, more opportunities to escape the ideologies of the time."
