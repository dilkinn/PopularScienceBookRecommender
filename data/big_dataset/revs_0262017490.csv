0,0262017490,http://goodreads.com/user/show/9968594-maria,5,"After receiving the Nobel prize along with James Watson and Maurice Wilkins in 1962 for the elegant description of the structure of our helical molecule, Francis Crick dedicated his life towards the studying of the mind. Although I knew this true genius dedicated his life on this, I haven't got the opportunity to read about his work on consciousness before, so I was really excited when I found this book the other day.Consciousness is a fascinating memoir, written by Christof Koch, about his research work along with Francis Crick on their quest on understanding what the mind is....on what is consciousness and makes us ""human"". Koch, also a physicist like Crick and with a minor in philosophy, will give you a fascinating approach on this topic as well as on free will. Can we truly act freely or are we just the result of the predispositions and circumstances of our environment or the culture we were raised by? What does physics have to say about this? Can the computational theory of mind help us to understand our ""qualia""? Do animals have consciousness? Does the cortico-thalamic system has the answer? You will find a little of this along your reading.Many of us, rely on science and philosophy in order to look for answers of the many questions our curiosity can give us, and this is what this memoir is about. So I really enjoy when I find a scientist that tries to give answers from many different approaches. In this case, our consciousness from a physics, philosophical and neurobiological perspective for only one true answer. I found Koch as an honest writer, who besides talking about his research talks openly about his loss in religious belief due to a maturity in seeing the world as it is along with being incompatible with scientific explanations. A naturalist scientific in whom I also noticed a touch of existentialism and a great sense of wonder. I like and agree with Koch expressing: ""There is no reason why we should not ultimately understand how the phenomenal mind fits into the physical world"".Well, even if we find a reductionist molecular answer to this great riddle of the mind, will humans ever settle with this explanations or will we always be in the need something more?I also perceived the same Crick that I've read many times and that James Watson also describes, open to new and radical explanations but always consistent with established and verifiable facts. It was funny to see that he referred to automatisms as zombie agents! It was a true delight for me to read about the research of this pair of geniuses and their friendship all the way to Crick's death.I'll close with my favorite Francis Crick quote: “There is no scientific study more vital to man than the study of his own brain. Our entire view of the universe depends on it.” A short memoir, that I really liked!"
1,0262017490,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7381993-katia-n,4,"Christof Koch is neuroscientist and biophysicist, He started his career in the US working with Francis Crick who was interested in the study of the brain at the late part of his life. Since then Koch has firmly specialised in the problems of consciousness. This book is combination of the developments in the related areas of the research with his personal memoirs focused on his professional, personal and religious metamorphoses. This combination makes the book quite special, imho. In the book, Koch summarises the experiments he and his colleagues carried out to locate the relevant neuro-correlates between the parts of the brain and the consciousness. He also talks a bit about the potential role of the unconscious. He is vivid supporter of the Integrated Information Theory (IIT). But ITT does not take much space in this book. The most controversial for a scientist, he seems to believe that the consciousness is fundamentally different and irreducible to a matter. Which is basically panpsychism in some form. It is very interesting and accessible book. The book has been written in 2014. Since them the world has moved on a bit. And Koch has got a new book on the similar subject minus personal stuff. The Feeling of Life Itself: Why Consciousness Is Widespread But Can't Be Computed. So if you are more interested in the ITT and the related subject matter, that book is probably better. This one would be interesting for those who want to trace an evolution of the views of an individual scientist. I enjoyed it."
2,0262017490,http://goodreads.com/user/show/26188-jafar,3,"Here's a neuroscientist who wrote The Quest for Consciousness: A Neurobiological Approach, trying to explain how brain can give rise to consciousness. It doesn't look like he's even managed to convince himself. While you can always find a ""neural correlate"" for any sensory or mental or emotional experience, it's still a puzzle how neural and synaptic activities result in subjective conscious experiences. It's what philosophers refer to as the Hard Problem. Invoking an ethereal soul to explain this is not only unscientific, it actually creates more problems than it solves. Koch spends the first half of the book summarizing the present state of research on consciousness. He then proceeds to propose a solution for the Hard Problem, admitting that he's throwing caution to the wind. He postulates that consciousness is a fundamental and elementary property of organized matter. It doesn't rise from anything, in the same manner that the electric charge of a particle is its intrinsic property and doesn't emerge from anything else. There's nothing special about human brain. Anyone would agree that although dogs can't compose symphonies or play chess, they're sentient beings. As you go down the complexity ladder, there's no clear point where to stop and proclaim the absence of consciousness. Nor is there anything especial with organic matter and what we call living systems. Consciousness is the property of any systems with interacting parts. The larger and more highly networked the system, the greater the degree of consciousness. Is the Internet conscious? Who knows! Is the universe, in its entirety, a self-conscious being? Who knows! Koch tries to provide some justification for this solution based on the integrated information theory and even proposes ways of how his hypothesis can be tested. Basically, instead of providing a solution for the Hard Problem, it seems to me that Koch is cleverly erasing the problem. Can't explain how matter gives rise to consciousness? Say it's its intrinsic property. He may well be right. Who knows. But we're still far away from solving this problem. "
3,0262017490,http://goodreads.com/user/show/24882791-india-m-clamp,4," One cannot mention Koch without including Francis Crick---as they go together like Matzo and ball. Though too many to name here, the accolades of this author would fill a twelve-page CV. In brief, Koch taught at California Institute of Technology and elegantly vibrates our silvery web like tangle of the mind with the question, what is consciousness? He equates the brain to a psychic experience having a plus or minus one charge.  “Midway in the journey of our life I came to myself in a dark wood, For the straight way was lost.”  ---Dante Alighieri  Consciousness: Confessions of a Romantic Reductionist is a velvety warm read. Understanding “from nothing comes nothing” is something familiar to our senses. Koch jumps with us into the “schwarz” void and we probe the riddle of our existence. For example, in a brain existing without a cerebellum, why are there so few cognitive defects like: ataxia, unsteady gait or slurred speech? Should there be more? Engaging read, imparting a latte art cappuccino-like experience feeling superb as the caffeine slowly permeated my being and injected bright color into my “bête noire” microcosm. Life in its complexity we may come to find is an unrelenting quest of survival acting as an engine propelling evolution forward. Must read for erudition hungry physics, medical and philosophy devotees. Read, ponder and deduce!"
4,0262017490,http://goodreads.com/user/show/10934946-kelly-head,4,"Christoph Koch is one of the leading scientists studying consciousness at a fundamental level. He has studied under the brilliant Francis Crick, is the lead scientist at the Allen Brain Institute in Seattle, and teaches at Cal Tech. A large portion of the book deals with the theory of a colleague of Koch's named Guilio Tononi. Tononi holds that consciousness is integrated information, a measurable property of causal systems that may exist in both biological and non-biological systems, e.g. computers. This view is interesting for a variety of reasons, but I think two of the things that stood out to me about it were its similarity to panpsychism and its invocation of Platonism. Oddly enough, Koch is very dismissive of philosophers throughout the book, despite being well-versed in the tradition and a huge fan of Descartes. He thinks Chalmer's skepticism about ever being able to resolve the Hard Problem of Consciousness is typical of philosophers overstepping their bounds and limiting science's abilities. There are many interesting autobiographical elements to this book, including some heavy-duty existential reflection. Koch's willingness to speak to issues of religion and his personal faith history were welcome alternatives to most scientists' summary dismissal of all things spiritual. My biggest beefs with this book were his failure to articulate HOW integrated information JUST IS consciousness (i.e. how does it bridge the first-person/third-person divide?) and his sometimes scattered and incoherent thoughts on religion. Overall, one of the best books about consciousness I have encountered, and sure to be a classic. "
5,0262017490,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7701175-alison,4,"It's very hard to categorise or summarise this book. It works as an introduction to the field of neuroscience - particularly to the concepts involved, as opposed to this-bit-of-brain-then-that-bit-of-brain - it also has elements of speculative science; memoir and philosophy. Perhaps most affectingly, however, it is a surprisingly emotional grappling from a man who knows than almost everyone about how the brain works, yet loses himself in grief and guilt just the same. A man who understands how far we are from understanding why we do what we do, and how this rich internal life of ours, well, *is*.Which is not to be confused with a religious or spiritual approach that says this is unknowable. If Koch's book is a hero's journey towards specific knowledge, it doesn't conclude with defeat, but with the optimistic note that gradual enquiry reveals truths and understandings, even if it falls short of ""Life, the Universe and Everything"" answers. (Koch provides a splendid side-swipe at M-Theory here, managing to make it look petty and small - the attempt to have a solution at any cost, when we just aren't there yet).It's very short this book, but in the end it packed a real punch and will be one of those which come back and cycle around in my head."
6,0262017490,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1575042-antonia,4,"I liked it very much. Some of it was very entertaining. In a few places, I just felt lost. An excellent discussion of free will, however, and that's a difficult topic. I'll probably reread that chapter. My favorite paragraph:""If we honestly seek a single, rational, and intellectually consistent view of the cosmos and everything iin it, we must abandon the classical view of the immortal soul. It is a view that is deeply embedded in our culture; it suffuses our songs, novels, movies, great buildings, public discourse, and our myths. Science has brought us to the end of our childhood. Growing up is unsettling to many people, and unbearable to a few, but we must learn to see the world as it is and not as we want it to be. Once we free ourselves of magical thinking we have a chance of comprehending how we fit into this unfolding universe."" - p. 152.And this should be a poster:""No matter, never mind."""
7,0262017490,http://goodreads.com/user/show/47154315-ian,4,"Philosophers, theologians, and scientists have debated the questions of human consciousness for a very long time. What is the difference between my brain and my mind? Are my thoughts simply epiphenomena arising glibly from the chemical soup of the grey matter behind my skull walls, or do they spring divinely from my eternal soul or from some sort of ethereal akashic records?These are daunting issues, but Christof Koch is well-qualified to tackle them as a scientist who worked alongside one of the biggest names in neurology and consciousness studies--indeed all of biology--Francis Crick of DNA double-helix fame. Koch's approach is very readable, almost conversational. Although much of the scientific nitty-gritty was above my crude, rudimentary level of biochemical and neurological understanding, his book takes an approach, as the subtitle indicates, as a confessional of a romantic reductionist. Born into a devout Catholic household, he struggled at times to put aside the romantic notions of mind and soul from the hard-data and empirical results that the reductionist scientific community was building upon after the middle of the 20th Century. The book makes for a read that is part autobiography, part history, part philosophy, and part scientific journal; an eclectic mix for sure, but one that worked well for me.Although I would have really liked to also see some discussion around puzzles such as out-of-body and near death experiences, which I believe stretch the connection between brain material and consciousness to the maximum, I feel that Koch puts together a pretty good argument that science is slowly but surely getting us closer to a more accurate understanding of what consciousness is and how it works. Let's face it, though...we have a long, long way to go, as science has only just started assembling the edge pieces of this puzzle. The parts about information theory, information integration, and optogenetics were really interesting. I've always been skeptical of engineers and scientists who simply tout the speed and large memory of a computer switchbox as something approaching artificial intelligence and ultimately the ""singularity of consciousness"". Well, size is not everything. Koch explains the work of Giulio Tononi, which centers around the idea that the degree of consciousness (of a human, or a dog, or mouse, or even a computer network) depends upon the interlinking integration of the information itself. ...the quantity of conscious experience generated by any physical system in a particular state is equal to the amount of integrated information generated by the system in that state above and beyond the information generated by its parts. The system must discriminate among a large repertoire of states (differentiation), and it must do so as part of a unified whole, one that can't be decomposed into a collection of causally independent parts (integration).I heartily recommend this for readers with a reasonable background in basic science interested in the ancient puzzle of mind over matter and who don't mind dipping into personal anecdote and thoughtful commentary. They should find this an interesting and entertaining read in a daunting subject."
8,0262017490,http://goodreads.com/user/show/9767799-anagh,5,"The reading of all good books is like a conversation with the finest minds of past centuries.-Rene DescartesThe subject of the book is an age old conundrum that has preoccupied scientists,philosophers and mystics alike for over many millenia- How does the water of biological tissue become the wine of conscious perception? How can the inanimate rumblings of neurons cause feelings as diverse as love, fear, anger or existential angst? Do lower life forms possess that same apparatus as us to perceive love, loss and suffering? If so( if we are to believe Koch), what are the implications on our conduct towards them ?Early on in the book, Koch desists from overemphasising a rigid definition of consciousness, arguing in favour of a loose interpretation derived from commonplace and clinical experience. Along the way he takes great care in pointing out the distinction between attention and consciousness- a frequent bone of contention in academic circles. The authors love for philosophy is not lost on the reader as he masterfully traces the philosophical underpinnings of consciousness from Aristotle to Nietzsche and Wittgenstein. Koch gives a blueprint for a rigorous theory based on the solid foundations of Shannon’s information theory- the so called Integrated information theory. To quote Koch 'Even if it(IIT) turns out to be wrong, it will be wrong in interesting ways that illuminate the problem.'Despite the ancient origins of the problem, most serious progress has occurred only in the recent past. Armed with gizmos like fMRIs, EEG and much recent still-optogenetics, neuroscientists are taking definitive steps in the right direction. The book is replete with topical case studies as well as classic experiments like the famous readiness potential experiments pioneered by Benjamin Libet. As such, the book is worth a dekko for the serious practitioner as well. Koch does well in firmly extricating the study of consciousness from the realm of new age charlatans(Deepak Chopra ?) and cults and places it squarely in the domain of science- so that serious researchers can take a whack at it without losing credibility. Ever since the grand success of quantum mechanics and evolutionary biology, religion has been in constant retreat. In some ways, the mystery of consciousness is the last bastion where religions of all shapes and stripes have sought refuge from the onslaught of science.Along the way the book provides the reader with interesting snippets about the life of a scientist working at the forefronts. It paints a charming picture of the relationship between a celebrated mentor and his famous acolyte. Koch poignantly captures the trials and tribulations concomitant with a crisis of faith. What stands out throughout the book is the extraordinary courage the pursual of a problem exacts from the scientist. Written in the finest traditions of modern science writing, it gets my unequivocal approval ! "
9,0262017490,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4065783-daniel,3,"I started reading this book because of my connection to the Allen Institute. This is more of an autobiography and memoir than actual details about his integrated information theory and his vision for the future. Koch admits he has a flamboyant personality and that certainly shows in his writing, which makes the book interesting to read, but sometimes hard to decode. He covers many popular neuroscience discoveries (like Jennifer Aniston neurons and the Libet experiments) that may be a boring review for people already familiar with neuroscience & philosophy. If you've already Sam Harris's brief book Free Will, or read How to Create a Mind by Ray Kurzweil, many of the ideas of determinism vs. libertarian compatibilism and panpsychism are echoed. The meat of the book is towards the last few chapters where he briefly discusses integrated information theory, free will, and religion. I would recommend this book more for a lay audience that is less familiar with neuroscience and also interested Christof's autobiography."
10,0262017490,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5477706-joseph-siegel,3,"Chapters 6,7,8 are five-star material. The book is too full of things like this: ""in 1995, Francis and I published a manuscript in the international journal Nature...(Having your article appear in Nature is like having the premier gallery in New York or Paris display your art; it's a big deal.)"" In the chapters not numbered 6,7, or 8, these punchable offenses so outweigh anything of note that I only can selectively recommend the book. I was looking for Ernst Mayr, and I got a middle-aged dude still trying to impress everyone by his career, his mountain climbing, his friends, and his ability to turn ""clever"" phrases. He does refer once each to Heraclitus and Thales, however, so I would definitely treat him to a reasonable lunch. "
11,0262017490,http://goodreads.com/user/show/21843540-safat,5,"I was interested in this book because the title seemed appealing. I basically wanted to know the author's take on the 'Hard problem' of consciousness. Here, I was satisfied. Although a through reductionist, Koch admits the 'limit of reductionism' and claims that consciousness is something fundamentally different from matter and can never be fully reduced to matter. His attempt to gap the bridge between mind and matter is 'Integrated information theory', which is sort of a metaphysical theory with sufficient mathematical formulation, but still has a long way to go. A major part of the book was a memoir. Koch worked with Francis Crick, who seemed like an amazing character to me. All in all, I enjoyed the book very much. "
12,0262017490,http://goodreads.com/user/show/23528727-ishaan,5,"This is one of the best reads in recent months. It covers thoughts about my favorite topic for lifetime: consciousness and the Brain! The author gives a detailed view of how science has approached the problem, what theories are on plate. He also covers metaphysical aspects as well as a little bit of religious viewpoints. One of the most interesting parts was how quantum mechanics can change the way we consider free will or determinism in terms of human nature.For a seeker about the human nature, this is a must read. "
13,0262017490,http://goodreads.com/user/show/20051503-kunal-sen,4,"Another intriguing approach to explain consciousness as a physical phenomenon, and dismissal of the idea of a mind-body duality, or the idea of classical free-will. The only thing I found abrupt was the unjustified connection between quantum mechanics and unpredictability of many brain and other biological phenomenon. There are far more macroscopic ways to explain unpredictability based on regular chaos theory. Most biological systems are complex enough to display chaotic non-linear behavior, and quantum behavior is an unnecessary complication, which can be true, but not particularly needed to explain the observed facts."
14,0262017490,http://goodreads.com/user/show/99017862-david-wiik,5,"Listened to this :)A great book that that does not contain that sort of self-indulgent Saganesque natural prose, despite its generic title.Neuroscience has re-paradigmed consciousness research, snatching it from rationalistic philosophers."
15,0262017490,http://goodreads.com/user/show/11936754-kevin,5,"This is a powerful book brimming with fascinating insights into the author's quest to understand consciousness. Brilliant stuff, well-written and captivating. Loved it."
16,0262017490,http://goodreads.com/user/show/37139214-tapio,4,"A pleasant read. Koch makes clear that what he is writing is also something like a memoir, and indeed he is not always very informative. Flows easily and is somewhat rewarding, which makes for 4/5."
17,0262017490,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4000724-jennifer,0,"Wow. What a rich, heady read! I appreciated how humble and down-to-earth Koch was throughout, emphasizing that we don't have all the answers (yet!). The most meaningful revelation was in the final chapter, which reminded me that having the capacity to contemplate humanity does not spare me from being one."
18,0262017490,http://goodreads.com/user/show/10323799-nia-nymue,4,"The writer is a passionate empiricist who strongly believes that the Hard Problem of Consciousness can be resolved through scientific means. He doesn't actually say how in this book, but he emphasises this belief several times.The text is very easy to read and is peppered with the right amount of geeky humour that most people would appreciate. It's also well-structured and can be read even by those without any background knowledge in philosophy. One possible drawback to the book is the inclusion of some sentimental parts. The last chapter is entirely unnecessary for anyone reading this book purely for academic purposes.A new thing I did learn from this book was Giulio Tononi's Integrated Information Theory and how it can be used to detect consciousness. The writer then justified panpsychism on empirical grounds."
19,0262017490,http://goodreads.com/user/show/16080726-sabin,4,"The book is oozing personality.This is the most daring science book I've read since Max Tegmark's Our Mathematical Universe. Yet Koch seems a man with a lot on his heart and little time. It is a short tour de force through the scientific understanding of consciousness, a succinct presentation of his preferred hypothesis and how he plans to test it, and a brief confession about his motivations and beliefs for the future of consciousness, all in the form of confessional writing. Yup, it's a pretty short book, which covers a lot of ground and has little patience for introductions.His presentation of the current state of the science cites a lot of scientific work and gives solid examples, but does not go into detail about them, expecting the reader to look for the sources on his/her own. I, for one, am glad to have read other books which go into more detail about the cited experiments and conclusions, but for the purpose of this book the information provided is enough to convey the point. Of course there's no need to trust the author's conclusions to these experiments, but for my part I found them entirely accurate. The best part about this approach is that it doesn't allow the reader with a short attention span to get bored.The theory he explains is a very interesting one, and without him going into the mathematics behind the theory (must consult the sources, again) it seems very plausible. As he explains it, the amount by which the number of possible different states of a system is greater than the sum of the different states of the systems of which it is made up is the quantifiable consciousness of the system. Leaving combinatorial mathematics aside, this allows him to postulate consciousness' existence apart from physical causes. Consciousness is born out of the relationships between elements of a system, out of mathematics, so basically out of nothing. And I'm ok with that. If the theory is right, consciousness becomes just another property of the universe which can be accounted for.I felt the last chapter to be too personal and with very little to add to the book, but it does not diminish the rest of the book in the least. I'd wholeheartedly recommend this book to anyone who raises an eyebrow when confronted with the big How and Why questions: how and why do we transform sensations into phenomenal experiences."
20,0262017490,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1950709-derek-davis,5,"Though Koch presents a lot of solid scientific material here, the real heart of the book is the man himself and his outlooks on a series of questions that have haunted much of the history of philosophy and, more recently, science: What is consciousness, how does it work, does it require a spiritual explanation and presence or is it a mechanical construct of the human brain? Koch, as a scientist of the modern age, not surprisingly leans heavily toward the idea that consciousness can emerge from the peculiar type of complexity in the brain – indeed, that it would necessarily arise with any such construct, organic or otherwise. He also believes that all living things have some degree of ""consciousness"" in a more nebulous sense than we normally think of it Yet, as the ""romantic"" limitation indicates, he's not fully sure that there isn't ""something else"" involved. As he straightforwardly admits, only time will tell, and he exuberantly hopes that time will come in his lifetime.Like others of the Germanic mob involved in brain and consciousness study, earlier and later (Freud, Jung, Eric Kandel and others), he does get a bit obsessed with ""will,"" ""free"" and otherwise. Of course, Goethe, Schopenhauer and Nietzsche have to make an appearance, but they don't get in the way, really. Koch is a likable, fair-minded man who only occasionally – and with good reason – goes on mild tears against rank stupidity. And his reverence for Francis Crick, with whom he spent many a speculative and productive hour, is both touching and enlightening.It's a fun read and a delightful look into a particular – and particularly – conscious brain."
21,0262017490,http://goodreads.com/user/show/20988020-josh-oberman,4,"To me, this is a very important book, less because of its content and more for its form. The book certainly serves as a useful and up-to-date introduction to consciousness studies from a leading scientist in the field, but its real force comes from the personal nature of the writing. Science, for good reason, is meant to be third-person, objective, and impersonal. But many scientists are themselves deeply driven to the work they do. Koch lays bear these deeper sides of scientific work and through doing so provides a compelling account of a scientist who truly has devoted his life towards discovering what he and many others perceive to be one of the deepest mysteries of the universe--the emergence of consciousness from matter. While the ""solution"" Koch seeks may be forever beyond our grasp, and it is not guaranteed that he has been searching in all the right places (the panpsychist hypotheses he generates based on integrated information theory are speculative at best), more scientists, at least the ones who are serious devotees to their pursuits and are not just obsessed with ""being the best"", should write books like this at some point during their lives."
22,0262017490,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3274832-david-soltysik,3,"When I attended the Human Brain Mapping conference this year, I saw a man wearing red pants and a purple vest. I thought, what a character. He was later introduced as Christof Koch, a German-accented man with a flair to be different and the author of the book on consciousness I had recently began. Koch does a good job of introducing many concepts related to the study of consciousness, but this book is more autobiographical than didactic. I found his prose surprisingly but refreshingly honest. Science is not discovered as neatly as it is written in textbooks, and Christof's account of his career in plumbing the depths of consciousness does not make that mistake. That said, many of the concepts he introduces will be familiar to the avid science reader, so this book may be better aimed at the novice science reader. Still, I found it an enjoyable read."
23,0262017490,http://goodreads.com/user/show/65316-vanessa,4,"Beautifully tragic in his personal life in belief and personal failings. Christof's perserverance in his philosophical and scentific quest for knowledge is worth admiring and given credit to. He has illuminated life's biggest questions on consciousness and with it, the inevitable slayer of that spark. A good insightful read."
24,0262017490,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1972427-leanne,5,"The question of what is ""consciousness"" has troubled philosophers for centuries. When I was an undergraduate in the philosophy department at UC Berkeley in the early 90s, John Searle was famously working on the issue --and guess what? He is still plugging away at it! And, it's not just philosophers either. Scientists also tackle the problem of reconciling a conscious, aware mind with a physical brain. According to them, consciousness emerges from chemistry and electricity in our brains. But how it arises --the mechanism-- remains an unsolved problem. This as-yet unsolved mystery has led to two schools of thought. On the one hand we have the reductionists, who believe consciousness can be boiled down to molecules obeying scientific laws. And in the other camp we have the dualists, believing that consciousness cannot be explained solely by classical physics. Consciousness: Conversations of a Romantic Reductionist, is wonderfully quirky, blending hard science and memoir. Calling himself a reductionist (and a ""romantic"" one at that), Koch tackles the question in terms of physics by trying to isolate the part of the brain responsible for consciousness in human beings. He is looking for the physicality of consciousness. And this can be done, for example, by performing EEG diagnostics on victims of brain injury to try and understand what kinds of brain trauma cause a loss in consciousness. Likewise, it can be done on people in deep sleep.Some questions immediately emerge:How does anesthesia work? There are various anesthetic agents--but no common mechanism. What is going on in the brain?Can free will be described as a kind of quantum superposition?How about LSD? What does it tell us about consciousness?Koch's theory of consciousness builds on that of University of Wisconsin–Madison neuroscientist Giulio Tononi's integrated information theory (IIT), which posits that the degree of consciousness an organism experiences is a function of brain integration. Going back to the question concerning anesthesia, what appears to be disrupted by the various drugs is the large-scale functional integration in the corticothalamic complex (relating to the cerebral cortex and the thalamus). And this is also what happens to patients in a vegetative state. A person can experience brain trauma in various local areas of the brain and not lose consciousness (only capabilities). Complexity is necessary, but what really matters in terms of consciousness, Koch argues, is how interconnected and organized – how “integrated” – these neural circuits are. Computers are capable of storing much more memory than we are, but the information is not cross-referenced. As Koch explains it, his Mac, as yet, cannot recognize that various photos of his daughter at different stages of her life, from infancy to adulthood, are the same person; and not just the same person, but his beloved daughter. And this is because the data (or information) has not been integrated within the ""brain"" of the computer. I loved this book. I loved the hard science—and appreciated how clear Koch writes about what is a very slippery topic. More than anything, I admired the richness of his mind and character. Well-read, well-traveled and extremely soulful, I agree, if dogs can’t go to heaven then there is a very big problem with the paradigm! IIT is probably the most promising approach to the problem. Am now reading a very different one on consciousness by Douglas Hofstadter, called I am a Strange Loop—which also is a mixing of memoir and science. Also with a romantic touch. Highly recommend Sean Carroll’s podcast with David Chalmers as well to get a better idea of a non-reductionist approach. Looking at Penrose on consciousness as well is interesting as points on the graph to be better able to position Koch. His work at the Allen Institute is fascinating. "
25,0262017490,http://goodreads.com/user/show/55930903-scotoma,4,"More than anything it was the title that prompted me to read this, which neatly encapsulates the major two ways I feel about consciousness and related topics. On the one hand, a materialist to the core (though whether I feel reductionist or non-reductionist changes from time to time), on the other hand someone who hears the call of notions defying his own materialistic positions, but despite finding them intriguing and fascinating, always falls back on those.I also made me realize that it has been almost ten years since I last read a book on consciousness, which I seek to remedy this year.Anyway, while maybe not intended as such, it was a bit of a primer on some of the newer things that happened in consciousness research recently, with Koch’s own focus on finding the neural correlates of consciousness, which appeal to my materialist side. He sheds some light on those developments and it felt much less nebulous than the last time I read about the topic, with clearer insight into which parts of the brain are more deeply involved in creating consciousness than others.As an aside, not the main topic, but one I found interesting none-the-less, was Koch assertation that attention and consciousness aren’t the same. It’s not something I’ve thought about before, but I found it intriguing enough to look out for his publication on the topic he published together with Naotsugu Tsuchiya in 2008, which goes much more in-depth.All that shedding light on how the brain creates consciousness doesn’t solve the hard problem, how do we get from neurons to an inner subjectivity (like many topics, I’m of two minds when it comes to this as well, sometimes thinking that there’s no problem at all, and then changing position to the other side that says there is one), and here is where I think some form of spooky extra ingredient creeps back into the discussion, though I might also misunderstand the argument of Koch.Basically, consciousness is a physical property of all matter, but one that only becomes relevant when large repositories of information with a high level of interconnectedness between those are achieved (introducing the integrated information theory of his colleague Giulio Tononi in the process and connecting it which his concept of consciousness as physical property). Which basically means brains (or similarly interconnected structures), but not only human ones, but animals as well and other.For me, this goes beyond base materialism, because he can’t prove this property of matter, but it’s not exactly the classical ghostly btw. the magic power of past concepts, but instead a place-holder for further scientific inquiry. I’m not sure I really buy it, but I like the idea of it, that at a highly integrated level information systems give rise to consciousness due to some property of matter.Besides the discussion of the nature of consciousness, the book (as the title says it’s also a confession) goes in some depth into the life of Koch, his biography and what all this meant and still means to him on a personal level. Coming from a religious background and how this influenced his thinking and the struggle between those impulses and his scientific-minded search for understanding, his journey shows that once you start looking into consciousness, it can change how you think about things in considerable ways.It’s not a long book, but definitely packed to the brim with ideas and concepts all bound up in Koch’s personal story, which I thought made for a highly compelling read. Also, one that inspired me to read more about consciousness again, something I planned to do years ago but never did."
26,0262017490,http://goodreads.com/user/show/91261074-chris-esposo,3,"	At first after reading this book I didn’t quite like it, but after some introspection, I looked at it less as a functional book on the study of human consciousness from an esteemed neurobiologist, and more as it’s obvious intent, a technical memoir of the author’s career while working with Francis Crick on the subject matter. From this standpoint, the discursive nature of the text is easily forgivable. 	On the matter of the content, the author’s commentary is all leading to the introduction, late in the book (second-to-last, or third-to-last chapter), of the “integrated information theory”, which I don’t really fully understand just from the material introduced here, but has to do with explaining consciousness exclusively via first principles, which are predicates from the physical science. The way the author explains his argument, the organization of information can be seen as somehow advantageous (from an evolutionary perspective), and thus, systems that minimize the Shannon entropy of the system would be selected against systems that exhibited higher Shannon entropy, and thus exhibited more randomness. 	I don’t know if I quite buy this argument, and as explained, the “geometry” of the information almost sounded like a description of a decision tree, but not having any tables/formulas available I might be totally off on that account. In any event, this segment of the book only occupies the penultimate section of the text, so if you are not a very technical reader, fear not, muhc of the rest of the text is much more conceptual. 	Much of the first third of the book is really a recount of the authors early life, his conceptual development, his struggles with the philosophic approaches to the mind-body problem, his influences from Crick, as well as a touch on how religious arguments may have impacted his drive (and fears of mortality) towards this subject matter. There’s some mentions of this possibly applied to AI, but not enough for my taste. I suspect however, any application as such would come from the simulations-brain approach, which would be interesting to read about, as much of the current path is far more computational/mathematical. 	Overall, it’s not a bad book, it’s a bit vague, much vaguer than I would have thought from a physical scientist, or perhaps the explanations are not well suited in words (as opposed to set-notation or formulae). Either way, it’s worth it to hear a perspective from a noted researcher in the field, as a book of instruction, muhc less good. Conditional recommendation for those in neurobiology, computational intelligence, AI, any allied field (or students of these areas)."
27,0262017490,http://goodreads.com/user/show/37230781-jason-pryde,4,"Koch makes his science personal. He focuses on his own separation from his religious upbringing in favor of a strict scientific discipline as much as he does on neurology. He is trying to resolve the issues of free will vs pre-determination, nature vs nurture, soul vs biology using every empirical method he has access to, which, as chief scientific officer for the Paul Allen Institute for Brain Science as well as a professor at CalTech, is significant. He's also using this approach to help him get over his loss of his colleague Francis Crick, a daughter at a very early age, and even favorite pets. Koch is a consummate scientist and while trying to keep his explorations accessible to the lay reader, he is not afraid of using 3 and 4 syllable words to make his points. I found myself going off to wikipedia and online dictionaries frequently. (I read this in the hardbound version.)He also is incredibly well informed on many topics including the liberal arts, history, computer science, etc. so he leaves few stones unturned in his search for possible explanations for consciousness. I found it the book interesting but I suspect that he has some self-imposed biases that draw him towards enigmas which may never get resolved. There is a saying that any sufficiently advanced technology is indistinguishable from magic. It is possible that any sufficiently explored science will eventually reach a level beyond human comprehensibility, and thus will give over to religion that which it cannot explain. Enter the AI.Update: I'm concurrently reading ""Skin in the Game - Hidden Asymmetries in Daily Life"" by Nasim Nicholas Taleb. Interestingly, he claims that""Understanding how the subparts of the brain (say, neurons) work will never allow us to understand how the brain works. ... So far we have no f***ing idea how the brain of the worm C. elegans works, which has around three hundred neurons. ... Now consider that the human brain has about one hundred billion neurons, and that going from 300 to 301 neurons, because of the curse of dimensionality, may double the complexity. So the use of *never* here is appropriate.""While I'm not overly impressed with the assumptions and projections that Taleb makes in his book, I think this reflects my skepticism about Koch's personal mission. "
28,0262017490,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4016501-denisa,5,"Woaaa...another unputdownable book about brain, mind and consciousness, written by the neuroscientist who worked closely with Francis Crick (Nobel Prize Winner; British molecular biologist, biophysicist, and neuroscientist).My favourite paragraphs:The greatest of all existentialist puzzles is why there is anything rather than nothing. Surely, the most natural state of being—in the sense of assuming as little as possible—is emptiness. I don’t mean the empty space that has proved so fecund in the hands of physicists. I am referring to the absence of anything: space, time, matter, and energy. Nothing, rien, nada, nichts. But we are here and that is the mystery.**************I am saddened by the loss of my religious belief, like leaving forever the comfort of my childhood home, suffused with a warm glow and fond memories. I still have feelings of awe when entering a high-vaulted cathedral or listening to Bach’s St. Matthew Passion. Nor can I escape the emotional thrall, the splendor and pageantry, of high Mass. But my loss of faith is an inescapable part of growing up, of maturing and seeing the world as it is.I’m cast out into the universe, a glorious, strange, scary, and often lonely place. I strive to discern through its noisy manifestations—its people, dogs, trees, mountains, and stars—the eternal Music of the Spheres.When all is said and done, I am left with a deep and abiding sense of wonder. Echoing across more than two thousand years, the unknown scribe of the Dead Sea Scrolls, living in a tiny community in the Judean desert, expressed it well. Let his psalm close my book:So walk I on uplands unboundedand know that there is hopefor that which thou didst mold out of dustto have consort with things eternal. "
29,0262017490,http://goodreads.com/user/show/63656163-joseph-knecht,4,"The main conviction of the author is that evolution breeds complexity, and complexity breeds consciousness. There isn't a specific neural region of the brain that creates the effects of consciousness, but rather it arises as a byproduct of neuronal connectivity. Just as a single molecule of H2O doesn't have wetness property, in similar fashion a single neuron doesn't have any consciousness. Consciousness arises from the interconnectivity of neural connections. The big surprise for me was the fact that the author believes in free will. Mark my words—if physical determinism holds, there is no Cartesian freedom. Everything that will ever happen within the universe, including all of your actions, was already inherent at its birth. All events are preordained. You are condemned to watch a movie that is screened exclusively for your benefit and that lasts a lifetime. The director, the laws of physics, is deaf to your pleas to change a single scene.He attributes the freedom of choice to quantum physics where events are probabilistically determined but not certain. I was driven to write this book for a trifecta of reasons—to describe my quest for the material roots of consciousness, to come to terms with my personal failings, and to bring my search for a unifying view of the universe and my role in it that does justice to both chance and necessity to a satisfactory conclusion.It's a good read for lovers of science and interested in the inner workings of the brain.

Christof puts the discoveries and realizations that the field has made through a personal lens and it becomes philosophical at times, but not enough to be any bother. I went into the book with the assumption that it wouldn't be as personal as it ended up being, which bothered me a bit, but that's my fault for not reading the synopsis carefully enough. All-in-all it's an intriguing read for anyone curious to get a primer on concepts revolving consciousness with a touch of personal beliefs and events thrown in. "
65,0262017490,http://goodreads.com/user/show/50421505-abdullah-shams,3,"While one can understand, the undying itch to know it all before the time comes. I am still struggling which the understanding, why we have to let know others of what we know?! Deep within me that feeling is steering, the feeling to find something profound about life, bring it to surface, record it in full. While I can relate that drive within the writer. I still don't understand the purpose of the purposeless. The struggle of the non existent and the complete knowledge of the future being without the being of me. "
66,0262017490,http://goodreads.com/user/show/60627833-dominika-raciborska,4,"At first it seems as if Koch is showing too much of hubris- the constant name dropping and details of his personal life overshadow intelligent remarks and excellent quotations as well as thought-provoking questions revolving around the consciousness. The hubris disappears in final chapter and the reader looks at the author from a different perspective, gaining respect for him and his quest. The final pages act as a delicious entree and leave us enticed and hungry for more answers."
67,0262017490,http://goodreads.com/user/show/36297846-wing,5,"Koch somehow manages to write an account on the quest for the neural correlates of consciousness, the gestation of the integrated information theory, and the existentialist implication of panpsychism, that is both captivating and crystal clear. He also briefly and skillfully demystifies the unconscious and free will along the way. His autobiographical vignettes are at times poignant and moving. Five stars. "
68,0262017490,http://goodreads.com/user/show/73693007-russell-hill,3,Fizzled Out Halfway InI thought the book was quite interesting over the first several chapters. It seemed to be building toward something significant only to fizzle out in an unconvincing information science rant. Maybe that is his “Confession”— the mystery consciousness will be figured out by future information scientists when the processing power and neuroscience techniques get there. 
69,0262017490,http://goodreads.com/user/show/67063925-mary-t,4,"I'm still not quite sure what consciousness is. The ""confessions"" part of the book was touching, although our author may be a somewhat unreliable narrator. Much of the science content, once reduced to layperson' terms, just seemed to consist of interesting factoids about the brains of humans and other animals. The snippets of philosophy were never explored in depth. But whatever the book's deficiencies, it's got a great cover!"
70,0262017490,http://goodreads.com/user/show/8846885-dan-gabree,4,"Great book with insight into the neuro/biological approach to consciousness. Looks at new and current mathematical theories as well. I really enjkoyed this book but was left wondering if he had completely missed some key points due to his personal conclusion (which he stated in the beginning of the book). Worth reading, but there may be more to consider. There is still no clear decision as to why we are who we are."
71,0262017490,http://goodreads.com/user/show/26036079-mark-isaak,4,"The book gives a good overview of the facts and factors that need to be considered for explaining consciousness. However, I did not find Koch's information theory hypothesis (mercifully confined to a single chapter) at all convincing, although it does provoke thought in new areas. Much of the book, too, was personal, especially concerning Koch's relationship with Francis Crick. Never, though, did those parts diverge from the subject of the book, and they helped make it more accessible."
72,0262017490,http://goodreads.com/user/show/19155181-aditya-asopa,4,"It was a very nice experience reading it. I felt that Christof was making a sincere effort in talking about himself, explaining his ideas, and offering his thesis. Although, I feel some more expansion on the ideas, especially the chapters on free will and Phi, would have made it easier. But, despite that, the information content is good and there is a lot of food for thought.The last chapter was very moving, reading about the personal side of the author and beliefs."
73,0262017490,http://goodreads.com/user/show/38514366-alireza,5,"What I enjoyed the most about this book, is that how the author has a balanced position on what we can reject with certainty and what we should be cautious about in reasoning. He doesn't conceal what he believes in; he states it right away, a romantic reductionist. The belief doesn't cloud his judgement; he remains objective and honest with the readers all along."

It's a real tight rope walk!! but that seems fair!!
79,0262017490,http://goodreads.com/user/show/22151269-jeffrey,4,"I really like Christof's model of our existence, though in this book he barely touches on it.

89,0262017490,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2140293-dionisia,3,Hard science with just a hint of a memoir. I have this sneaking suspicion that I would have enjoyed this more if I was in a different mood. I think this book caught me at the wrong time. Interesting topic. 
90,0262017490,http://goodreads.com/user/show/67779556-dary,5,"The subject has often haunted me in the middle of countless contemplations about the big questions. Luckily a romantic reductionist could give me some insights and wisdom on it. As a neurologist who dedicated his career to focus on this very subject he explained some recent scientific findings arround the matter. But what I value the most is how Koch combines objective scientific views with his own subjective honest reflections. I find it beautiful how he, as a scientist, shares his personal views of the natural world as he quests after consciousness, his experience with science and religion, and his speculation of the future of consciousness. It may create bias thoughts on particular subjects, but I still could think about them objectively. Overall, I really appreciate his honesty in writing.From this book, I learned that we have 2 conscious minds in one skull, that attention an consciousness are not the same, about zombie agents and being unconscious, about Giolio's integrated information theory and 'phi', and that (from the latest findings) how consciousness arises."
91,0262017490,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5993314-igor-clark,4,"I think the only reason I felt I had to give it four stars rather than five is that it doesn't actually contain a fully comprehensive neuroscientific theory of consciousness. Which is kind of unreasonable of me. It's just that it's written in such a way that it almost leads you to expect one, even though you know in advance that won't be happening. Anyway there's a ton of interesting info, it's a good layman' state-of-the-nation on the topic, it's written well, and the last chapter is an unexpectedly warming personal response from Koch to lots of the standard mind-body/religious stuff. Well worth a read."

Luckily a romantic reductionist could give me some insights and wisdom on it. As a neurologist who dedicated his career to focus on this very subject he explained some recent scientific findings arround the matter. But what I value the most is how Koch combines objective scientific views with his own subjective honest reflections. I find it beautiful how he, as a scientist, shares his personal views of the natural world as he quests after consciousness, his experience with science and religion, and his speculation of the future of consciousness. It may create bias thoughts on particular subjects, but I still could think about them objectively. Overall, I really appreciate his honesty in writing.From this book, I learned that we have 2 conscious minds in one skull, that attention an consciousness are not the same, about zombie agents and being unconscious, about Giolio's integrated information theory and 'phi', and that (from the latest findings) how consciousness arises."

In which I introduce the ancient mind–body problem, explain why I am on a quest to use reason and empirical inquiry to solve it, acquaint you with Francis Crick, explain how he relates to this quest, make a confession, and end on a sad note• What is the difference that makes a difference?02. In which I write about the wellsprings of my inner conflict between religion and reason, why I grew up wanting to be a scientist, why I wear a lapel pin of Professor Calculus, and how I acquired a second mentor late in life• A Carefree Childhood as a Budding Scientist• Studying the Biophysics of Nerve Cells• Caltech, Teaching, Research, and the Brain Viewed by a Physicist• Once More unto the Breach of Consciousness03. In which I explain why consciousness challenges the scientific view of the world, how consciousness can be investigated empirically with both feet firmly planted on the ground, why animals share consciousness with humans, and why self-consciousness is not as important as many people think it is• Qualia and the Natural World• What Is the Function of Consciousness?• The Difficulty of Defining Consciousness• On the Consciousness of Animals• On the Consciousness of Self04. In which you hear tales of scientist-magicians that make you look but not see, how they track the footprints of consciousness by peering into your skull, why you don't see with your eyes, and why attention and consciousness are not the same• Finding Consciousness in the Brain• Hiding Objects in Plain Sight• Not all Neurons Participate in Consciousness• Neurons in Higher Regions of Neocortex Are Closely Allied to Consciousness• Attending to Something, yet not Seeing It05. In which you learn from neurologists and neurosurgeons that some neurons care a great deal about celebrities, that cutting the cerebral cortex in two does not reduce consciousness by half, that color is leached from the world by the loss of a small cortical region, and that the destruction of a sugar cube–sized chunk of brain stem or thalamic tissue leaves you undead• Small Chunks of Gray Matter Mediate Specific Content of Consciousness• Concept Neurons Encode Homer Simpson and Jennifer Aniston• Consciousness Can Be Generated by Either Cortical Hemisphere• Consciousness Can Flee Permanently, Leaving a Zombie Behind06. In which I defend two propositions that my younger self found nonsense—you are unaware of most of the things that go on in your head, and zombie agents control much of your life, even though you confidently believe that you are in charge• Zombies in the Brain• The Social Unconscious• What Does the Pervasive Influence of the Unconscious Imply for My Quest?07. In which I throw caution to the wind, bring up free will, Der Ring des Nibelungen, and what physics says about determinism, explain the impoverished ability of your mind to choose, show that your will lags behind your brain's decision, and that freedom is just another word for feeling• Strong versus Pragmatic Shades of Freedom• Classical Physics and Determinism: The Clockwork Universe• The Demise of the Clockwork Universe• The Impoverished Freedom of the Mind to Realize One Quantum Event over Another• Will as an Afterthought to Action• Agency, or the Conscious Experience of Will• Taking Stock of the Situation08.

180,0262017490,http://goodreads.com/user/show/67779556-dary,5,"The subject has often haunted me in the middle of countless contemplations about the big questions. Luckily a romantic reductionist could give me some insights and wisdom on it. As a neurologist who dedicated his career to focus on this very subject he explained some recent scientific findings arround the matter. But what I value the most is how Koch combines objective scientific views with his own subjective honest reflections. I find it beautiful how he, as a scientist, shares his personal views of the natural world as he quests after consciousness, his experience with science and religion, and his speculation of the future of consciousness. It may create bias thoughts on particular subjects, but I still could think about them objectively. Overall, I really appreciate his honesty in writing.From this book, I learned that we have 2 conscious minds in one skull, that attention an consciousness are not the same, about zombie agents and being unconscious, about Giolio's integrated information theory and 'phi', and that (from the latest findings) how consciousness arises."

The ""confessions"" part of the book was touching, although our author may be a somewhat unreliable narrator. Much of the science content, once reduced to layperson' terms, just seemed to consist of interesting factoids about the brains of humans and other animals. The snippets of philosophy were never explored in depth. But whatever the book's deficiencies, it's got a great cover!"

Looks at new and current mathematical theories as well. I really enjkoyed this book but was left wondering if he had completely missed some key points due to his personal conclusion (which he stated in the beginning of the book). Worth reading, but there may be more to consider. There is still no clear decision as to why we are who we are."
191,0262017490,http://goodreads.com/user/show/26036079-mark-isaak,4,"The book gives a good overview of the facts and factors that need to be considered for explaining consciousness. However, I did not find Koch's information theory hypothesis (mercifully confined to a single chapter) at all convincing, although it does provoke thought in new areas. Much of the book, too, was personal, especially concerning Koch's relationship with Francis Crick. Never, though, did those parts diverge from the subject of the book, and they helped make it more accessible."

I felt that Christof was making a sincere effort in talking about himself, explaining his ideas, and offering his thesis. Although, I feel some more expansion on the ideas, especially the chapters on free will and Phi, would have made it easier. But, despite that, the information content is good and there is a lot of food for thought.The last chapter was very moving, reading about the personal side of the author and beliefs."
193,0262017490,http://goodreads.com/user/show/38514366-alireza,5,"What I enjoyed the most about this book, is that how the author has a balanced position on what we can reject with certainty and what we should be cautious about in reasoning. He doesn't conceal what he believes in; he states it right away, a romantic reductionist. The belief doesn't cloud his judgement; he remains objective and honest with the readers all along."

Follows the efforts of Christof Koch and Sir Francis Crick to determine the brain's physical connection to our consciousness. Koch suggests a variety of strategies to find the still unknown body/mind relationship. The info on current research in to brain structure and function is very enlightening."
197,0262017490,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6554422-amal-katrib,5,"Koch's attempt to identify neural correlates of consciousness. He highlights consciousness as a fundamental irreducible feature of the universe rather than an emergent property of simpler elements. It mimics a system that is extraordinarily informative, differentiated, and integrated and posits the use of integrated information theory to measure it."
198,0262017490,http://goodreads.com/user/show/61640743-evan,4,some parts of this book are so fascinating that you can read through them over and over and still get something new out of them every time while other parts are painful reminders that I'm not smart enough to even understand a relatively dumbed down popularized version of the most basic science surrounding this subject. It's a real tight rope walk!! but that seems fair!!
199,0262017490,http://goodreads.com/user/show/22151269-jeffrey,4,"I really like Christof's model of our existence, though in this book he barely touches on it. This is a solid, scientific perspective of how consciousness comes into being. And a friendly introduction into his life/life's work (and a sad tidbit on his poorer later life choices in relationships)."

Luckily a romantic reductionist could give me some insights and wisdom on it. As a neurologist who dedicated his career to focus on this very subject he explained some recent scientific findings arround the matter. But what I value the most is how Koch combines objective scientific views with his own subjective honest reflections. I find it beautiful how he, as a scientist, shares his personal views of the natural world as he quests after consciousness, his experience with science and religion, and his speculation of the future of consciousness. It may create bias thoughts on particular subjects, but I still could think about them objectively. Overall, I really appreciate his honesty in writing.From this book, I learned that we have 2 conscious minds in one skull, that attention an consciousness are not the same, about zombie agents and being unconscious, about Giolio's integrated information theory and 'phi', and that (from the latest findings) how consciousness arises."

Christof puts the discoveries and realizations that the field has made through a personal lens and it becomes philosophical at times, but not enough to be any bother. I went into the book with the assumption that it wouldn't be as personal as it ended up being, which bothered me a bit, but that's my fault for not reading the synopsis carefully enough. All-in-all it's an intriguing read for anyone curious to get a primer on concepts revolving consciousness with a touch of personal beliefs and events thrown in. "

I am still struggling which the understanding, why we have to let know others of what we know?! Deep within me that feeling is steering, the feeling to find something profound about life, bring it to surface, record it in full. While I can relate that drive within the writer. I still don't understand the purpose of the purposeless. The struggle of the non existent and the complete knowledge of the future being without the being of me. "
246,0262017490,http://goodreads.com/user/show/60627833-dominika-raciborska,4,"At first it seems as if Koch is showing too much of hubris- the constant name dropping and details of his personal life overshadow intelligent remarks and excellent quotations as well as thought-provoking questions revolving around the consciousness. The hubris disappears in final chapter and the reader looks at the author from a different perspective, gaining respect for him and his quest. The final pages act as a delicious entree and leave us enticed and hungry for more answers."
247,0262017490,http://goodreads.com/user/show/36297846-wing,5,"Koch somehow manages to write an account on the quest for the neural correlates of consciousness, the gestation of the integrated information theory, and the existentialist implication of panpsychism, that is both captivating and crystal clear. He also briefly and skillfully demystifies the unconscious and free will along the way. His autobiographical vignettes are at times poignant and moving. Five stars. "

It seemed to be building toward something significant only to fizzle out in an unconvincing information science rant. Maybe that is his “Confession”— the mystery consciousness will be figured out by future information scientists when the processing power and neuroscience techniques get there. 
249,0262017490,http://goodreads.com/user/show/67063925-mary-t,4,"I'm still not quite sure what consciousness is. The ""confessions"" part of the book was touching, although our author may be a somewhat unreliable narrator. Much of the science content, once reduced to layperson' terms, just seemed to consist of interesting factoids about the brains of humans and other animals. The snippets of philosophy were never explored in depth. But whatever the book's deficiencies, it's got a great cover!"

Looks at new and current mathematical theories as well. I really enjkoyed this book but was left wondering if he had completely missed some key points due to his personal conclusion (which he stated in the beginning of the book). Worth reading, but there may be more to consider. There is still no clear decision as to why we are who we are."
251,0262017490,http://goodreads.com/user/show/26036079-mark-isaak,4,"The book gives a good overview of the facts and factors that need to be considered for explaining consciousness.

I went into the book with the assumption that it wouldn't be as personal as it ended up being, which bothered me a bit, but that's my fault for not reading the synopsis carefully enough. All-in-all it's an intriguing read for anyone curious to get a primer on concepts revolving consciousness with a touch of personal beliefs and events thrown in. "
275,0262017490,http://goodreads.com/user/show/50421505-abdullah-shams,3,"While one can understand, the undying itch to know it all before the time comes. I am still struggling which the understanding, why we have to let know others of what we know?! Deep within me that feeling is steering, the feeling to find something profound about life, bring it to surface, record it in full. While I can relate that drive within the writer. I still don't understand the purpose of the purposeless. The struggle of the non existent and the complete knowledge of the future being without the being of me. "
276,0262017490,http://goodreads.com/user/show/60627833-dominika-raciborska,4,"At first it seems as if Koch is showing too much of hubris- the constant name dropping and details of his personal life overshadow intelligent remarks and excellent quotations as well as thought-provoking questions revolving around the consciousness. The hubris disappears in final chapter and the reader looks at the author from a different perspective, gaining respect for him and his quest. The final pages act as a delicious entree and leave us enticed and hungry for more answers."
277,0262017490,http://goodreads.com/user/show/36297846-wing,5,"Koch somehow manages to write an account on the quest for the neural correlates of consciousness, the gestation of the integrated information theory, and the existentialist implication of panpsychism, that is both captivating and crystal clear. He also briefly and skillfully demystifies the unconscious and free will along the way. His autobiographical vignettes are at times poignant and moving. Five stars. "
278,0262017490,http://goodreads.com/user/show/73693007-russell-hill,3,Fizzled Out Halfway InI thought the book was quite interesting over the first several chapters. It seemed to be building toward something significant only to fizzle out in an unconvincing information science rant. Maybe that is his “Confession”— the mystery consciousness will be figured out by future information scientists when the processing power and neuroscience techniques get there. 
279,0262017490,http://goodreads.com/user/show/67063925-mary-t,4,"I'm still not quite sure what consciousness is. The ""confessions"" part of the book was touching, although our author may be a somewhat unreliable narrator. Much of the science content, once reduced to layperson' terms, just seemed to consist of interesting factoids about the brains of humans and other animals. The snippets of philosophy were never explored in depth. But whatever the book's deficiencies, it's got a great cover!"
280,0262017490,http://goodreads.com/user/show/8846885-dan-gabree,4,"Great book with insight into the neuro/biological approach to consciousness. Looks at new and current mathematical theories as well. I really enjkoyed this book but was left wondering if he had completely missed some key points due to his personal conclusion (which he stated in the beginning of the book). Worth reading, but there may be more to consider. There is still no clear decision as to why we are who we are."
281,0262017490,http://goodreads.com/user/show/26036079-mark-isaak,4,"The book gives a good overview of the facts and factors that need to be considered for explaining consciousness. However, I did not find Koch's information theory hypothesis (mercifully confined to a single chapter) at all convincing, although it does provoke thought in new areas. Much of the book, too, was personal, especially concerning Koch's relationship with Francis Crick. Never, though, did those parts diverge from the subject of the book, and they helped make it more accessible."
282,0262017490,http://goodreads.com/user/show/19155181-aditya-asopa,4,"It was a very nice experience reading it. I felt that Christof was making a sincere effort in talking about himself, explaining his ideas, and offering his thesis. Although, I feel some more expansion on the ideas, especially the chapters on free will and Phi, would have made it easier. But, despite that, the information content is good and there is a lot of food for thought.The last chapter was very moving, reading about the personal side of the author and beliefs."
283,0262017490,http://goodreads.com/user/show/38514366-alireza,5,"What I enjoyed the most about this book, is that how the author has a balanced position on what we can reject with certainty and what we should be cautious about in reasoning. He doesn't conceal what he believes in; he states it right away, a romantic reductionist. The belief doesn't cloud his judgement; he remains objective and honest with the readers all along."

An honest, heartfelt combination of memoir and scientific discussion of consciousness. Lots of, at least to me, new approaches to “the hard problem”."

Follows the efforts of Christof Koch and Sir Francis Crick to determine the brain's physical connection to our consciousness. Koch suggests a variety of strategies to find the still unknown body/mind relationship. The info on current research in to brain structure and function is very enlightening."
287,0262017490,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6554422-amal-katrib,5,"Koch's attempt to identify neural correlates of consciousness. He highlights consciousness as a fundamental irreducible feature of the universe rather than an emergent property of simpler elements. It mimics a system that is extraordinarily informative, differentiated, and integrated and posits the use of integrated information theory to measure it."
288,0262017490,http://goodreads.com/user/show/61640743-evan,4,some parts of this book are so fascinating that you can read through them over and over and still get something new out of them every time while other parts are painful reminders that I'm not smart enough to even understand a relatively dumbed down popularized version of the most basic science surrounding this subject. It's a real tight rope walk!! but that seems fair!!
289,0262017490,http://goodreads.com/user/show/22151269-jeffrey,4,"I really like Christof's model of our existence, though in this book he barely touches on it. This is a solid, scientific perspective of how consciousness comes into being. And a friendly introduction into his life/life's work (and a sad tidbit on his poorer later life choices in relationships)."
