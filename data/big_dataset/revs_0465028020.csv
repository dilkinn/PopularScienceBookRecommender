0,0465028020,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1275546-chris,5,"When pitching Jonathan Haidt's ""Happiness Hypothesis: Finding Modern Truth in Ancient Wisdom"" to friends, I often find myself explaining away the title -- no, it's not another self-help book and yes, it's about more than just plastering a silly smile on your face. With that said, the title is appropriate; Haidt is chiefly concerned with what's responsible for making humans happy.The title fails, however, to convey the breadth and depth of Haidt's search, which touches on philosophy, psychology, economics, evolution, and cognitive science, and skips effortlessly across the centuries, from the Stoics' philosophical minimalism to Ben Franklin's pragmatism to Robert Cialdini's work on Influence.Haidt documents the evolution of the human mind, producing an overarching narrative that explains everything from the use of gossip and prozac to mental tendencies that steer men away from their stated values and towards self-destruction.Along with Kluge, this book has profoundly shaped the way I view my brain. Before Haidt, I was aware that our brains appeared to systematically work against our best interest, and that these tendencies manifested in more general cognitive biases. Haidt, however, takes you behind the curtain, and provides a look at what exactly is going on in your brain and the evolutionary logic behind it. This book provided a more systematic take on cognition than the discrete observational work I had previously encountered.My interest in correcting my cognitive failings largely emanates from my concern with my ability to grasp the truth. Haidt rightly adds that it's profoundly important to happiness in general. Cognitive therapy has allowed many to escape depression by directly attacking distortions in thought. These depressive distortions are direct relatives to those that scare up trouble in all of our lives, and Haidt provides an excellent primer on how to exorcise your cognitive demons through a few different means, thereby improving the way you think and possibly making you happier."
1,0465028020,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1662632-richard,4,"As I was reading the first few chapters, I put this book on my “to buy” list, but my enthusiasm ebbed as I finished the book, and my natural inclination not to buy books I never expect to re-read has taken over.But it’s still a book I think I can recommend: it has plenty of interesting and thoughtful points to make, a few that are confusing and disconcerting, as well as some advice towards the front of the book.The early chapters have a bit of a “self-help” feel that dissipates further into the book. (BTW, 
A
 or 
B
?) But since Haidt substantiates his advice with a great deal of neurological evidence and complements it with some “ancient wisdom”, it isn’t too sappy.For example, he points out that a majority of us “lost the cortical lottery” and see the world through dun-colored glasses for a good reason: pessimism was a survival trait to our paleolithic ancestors. If you hear a rustling in the brush and worry that it’s not a tasty rabbit but a nasty panther, your caution may save your life. Folks too naturally optimistic tended not to survive many of those circumstances, I guess.He tells us why that cortical disability can be ruinous, and then explains why each of the three current prescriptions works: meditation, cognitive therapy, and SSRIs. As a glass-half-empty person myself, I’m cognitively meditating on the appeal of SSRIs after that.Most of the rest of the book isn’t self-help at all, but an extended exploration of the many factors that contribute to what makes us happy. Some of these discussions go far afield, such as into altruism and theories of reciprocity, or into the need for a coherent connection to “something greater”. Near the end of the book, Haidt delves into one of his research topics: the cognitive axis of disgust-to-sacredness. His discussions of how this is related to politic ideology is interesting, but when he seems to be arguing that humans will inevitably suffer if they leave the need for the sacred unattended to, he gets a little confusing.At the end of the book he returns to one of my pet favorite themes, and explores how moral authority and religiosity arose through evolutionary processes.Perhaps the most memorable take-away is the powerful metaphor of “the rider and the elephant”. The rider is our conscious self, our narrator; the elephant is the subconscious, which too often follows a path that ignores the rider’s directions. Well, actually while I’m pretty sure the metaphor is about conscious-vs-subconscious, other readers I’ve discussed this with have argued for other dichotomies: will-vs-instinct, or intellect-vs-emotion. I’m not sure Haidt uses the metaphor precisely the same way all the time — one of the problems with using a metaphor, after all — but I think the first is still the strongest reading.All in all, an excellent addition to the Cognition bookshelf.­"
2,0465028020,http://goodreads.com/user/show/25582110-kate-savage,1,"I could probably give this book two stars if I hadn't just got my fill of evo-psy smarm from Steven Pinker. Haidt's got the same penchant to 1) explain away the cultural status quo as a natural consequence of biological human nature; 2) present all of his ideas as scientific consensus, when there are very few non-controversial conclusions in positive psychology (it's fine for him to stick with his theory, but his disinterest in bringing up these disagreements leaves me very distrustful of him); 3) make readers shudder a little bit when they recognize the writer is coming from a space of extreme privilege and remains ignorant of the lives that most people live. He tells us his story of being a kid in Scranton, existentially depressed even though he got to drive daddy's Thunderbird, but don't worry he's found meaning now. And you can too, if you find ""love, work, and connection to something larger."" That's all it takes, everyone -- what excuse could you have for being sad?The fundamental flaw in the book is the ambiguity between being a science book and a self-help book. It's valuable to point out the science supporting the idea that most happiness depends on the genetic crapshoot, and explain why this is so. But once he begins to tell the losers of this gamble what they can do to be happy anyway, I found myself becoming a crank. It bleeds quickly into the idea that people who are unhappy are 1) a problem to be fixed, and 2) in some way guilty for being that problem. He suggests that Buddhism is right, except for that whole non-attachment thing, because actually people are happier if they have stable relationships. When the entire Buddhist insight, it seems, is that there is no such thing as a 'stable' relationship, and you have to learn how to find internal peace even when death or the other ways of leaving leave you lonely. And if you don't come to peace with that, well -- really, who can? Anyone think it might be fine to be sad about that?Haidt follows Durkheim's idea that ""freedom is hazardous to your health,"" showing how the more social, familial, religious constraints a person has on them the less likely they'll commit suicide. But if happiness is bought only with conformity, at what point does it become irrelevant to living a life? And what if suicide is driven also by persecution directed at nonconformists? A friend sent this timely article to me which further explains why a person would be distrustful of the pursuit of happiness: http://m.chronicle.com/article/Happin... I especially got irritated when Haidt ventured into his exploration of ""divinity,"" as an essential piece for happiness, which he commonly equates with the purity ethic, with a Pinker-esque overemphasis on 'decency' and good manners. Though Haidt repeatedly shows that an ethic of purity is tied to racism and misogyny, he thinks it espouses a crucial 'moral dimension,' and without it it's like we're living in Flatland. He has nostalgia for the time when we had universal moral standards and people were afraid of what their neighbors would say if they stepped out of line. Haidt's happy world is achingly bland. Though he at least proposes we find some balance between keeping ourselves pure and not screwing over the oppressed, I find myself far more interested in all the activities he aligns with the Disgusting. Sex and death and bodies feel plenty sacred enough for me.Large passages of the book are focused on the psychological differences between liberals and conservatives. While I understand the importance of figuring this out, it seemed like a distraction from his topic. It felt like he couldn't create an entire book with his one overwrought metaphor (elephant/rider), and so he took sections from his previous book The Righteous Mind to fill out the pages. Follow that with some repetition of his original ideas, and call it a book."
3,0465028020,http://goodreads.com/user/show/175635-trevor,4,"First of all there is a tone to this book that I thought from the beginning was really going to be a problem for me. I guess that is the tone of self-help books. All the same, this book was much more interesting and much more challenging (at least, to me) than most other self-help books I’ve read. I actually found parts of this book quite confronting.The parts of this book that I liked the most were those where he was discussing his elephant and rider metaphor. Essentially, he believes that we are part instinctual creatures and part rational agent – however, we like to believe that the rational agent (the rider) is in control, whereas the rider is sitting on top of an elephant that rarely sleeps and that has desires and needs that the rider does not always recognise or acknowledge. In the long run the elephant will get its way unless the rider recognises the elephants desires and seeks to redirect them. The rider can only do this, according to this book, by meditation, therapy or drugs.The other bit I found interesting was the stuff on Csikszentmihalyi’s book Flow – which I’ve recently bought, but haven’t gotten around to reading. The idea that if you do what you love (Aristotle’s arête) that you don’t notice time and that this is the source of happiness (Aristotle’s eudemonia). I also really liked that this book presses home the idea that we are a social animal and that as a social animal we really do need to make contact with other animals of our species to be happy. As someone who spends a lot of time alone this was one of the areas of the book that I did find personally challenging. The other challenging bits, as I’ve mentioned, where were he talked about doing work that was not directed towards your main strengths and interests.There were parts of this book that didn’t quite work for me. The stuff on religion in particular. It is an interesting point, of course, that religious people tend to be happier than those without religion, but I didn’t feel I came away from reading this section with anything like a good understanding of why that should necessarily be the case or if seeking to be more like religious people would make people without religion more happy or even if that would be a good thing. As someone without religion I can see how having a belief that there is someone (an infinite father figure, generally) watching over you and who is concerned for your well-being, would be a comfort and would probably promote happiness. But even then perhaps not if life started going badly. Some of the things that happen in life are awful and perhaps I’m better off being able to put those things down to pure chance than if I was religious (and assuming I would also remain logically consistent) also having to blame those things on a God who had it in for me for some reason.Where this book is particularly good is in challenging the movement we have towards working longer hours that seems to have taken over our lives. He points out that people are at their happiest when they are with family and friends, and yet our endless pursuit of wealth and career success takes us away from those we love the most and also where we are most happy. As he points out, this doesn’t make much sense. So, what is the secret to happiness? Well, surround yourself with people you love, find out what engages your interest and do that, have control over what you do, don’t live in the suburbs where you have to commute to work for hours every day, create ‘religious’ spaces in your life where you value things as holy and do things to connect with both your physical self and with society at large.See, it’s remarkably easy…I still think Stumbling on Happiness was a better book, but this one was worth the read."
4,0465028020,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2044236-nyamka-ganni,4,"If you are in passionate love and want to celebrate your passion, read poetry. If your ardor has calmed and you want to understand your evolving relationship, read psychology. But if you have just ended a relationship and would like to believe you are better off without love, read philosophy. and if you are unsure about what category falls for you, just read this book! :D "
5,0465028020,http://goodreads.com/user/show/14046996-roy-lotz,3,"If you read The Happiness Hypothesis after Haidt’s The Righteous Mind, then I think you are bound to be a little disappointed. Whereas the latter is informative, original, and at times challenging, this book waters down Haidt’s genuine insight with a good deal of pop psychology and self-help.According to Haidt, science has finally revealed how to be happy. All of the following factors are likely to boost happiness: enough money, ample free time, short commutes, a loving family, and meaningful work. Being virtuous and even spiritual can also help; and perhaps a touch of adversity, too. But the biggest advantage of all is being constitutionally—i.e. genetically—optimistic (which is not very useful to people who are not). If you find yourself in the unfortunate position of satisfying all of the conditions and yet unhappy, then the best advice is to meditate, go to therapy, or take antidepressants.It is hard for me to imagine much of this being especially revelatory. Are there people who think that long commutes, long hours, frigid relationships, and meaningless work are the keys to happiness? Furthermore, the potentially more controversial chapters—on virtue, spirituality, and adversity—I thought were fairly weak. Haidt’s insistence that virtue can lead to happiness is undermined by his own conclusions in The Righteous Mind, in which he details how moral hypocrisy is usually the best evolutionary strategy. And while Haidt’s analyses of spirituality and adversity are interesting, they have few practical takeaways. One can hardly choose to have a religious awakening or endure a crisis.Where this book shines is where Haidt focuses on his own specialty: evolutionary psychology. Though much of this material is recapped in The Righteous Mind, some of it was new to me, and quite interesting. Haidt’s insistence on mixing this modern research with “ancient wisdom,” however, had the effect of diluting both. Science is exciting when it gives us counterintuitive answers; if it merely serves to confirm what the Buddha said, then I might as well read the Buddha. And if, as Haidt eventually concludes, the Buddha was only partially correct, and that we need a mixture of attachment and detachment, then I am not sure what wisdom is being confirmed—or what that even means in practice.More generally, this book suffers from a serious case of bothsidesism, which you can see in Haidt’s concluding embrace of the yin yang symbol. He would like to conclude that Jesus, the Buddha, the Stoics, the Romantic poets, modern liberals, and contemporary conservatives are all partially right, and that wisdom lies somewhere “in between” these positions. You might even call Haidt a modern-day Hegelian, for trying to reconcile these through his dialectic.However, this position rings a false note, since many of these values are not truly reconcilable. For example, Haidt is sympathetic to the conservative argument that we should be teaching values in school; and he sees advantages to societies that embrace hierarchy, tradition, and moral order above tolerance and diversity. A world of strong character and tightknit community may sound nice, but this sidesteps the question of how a highly diverse society could agree on a set of values to be taught. Psychologists may, as Haidt says, have discovered a list of “universal” virtues. But “courage” in the abstract, say, does not mean very much, and normally relies on cultural context to give it meaning (is it “courageous” to stand up to your parents and teachers?).Perhaps I am disappointed because I am comparing this book to the short section on happiness in Daniel Kahneman’s Thinking, Fast and Slow. There, without any pretense of rediscovering ancient wisdom, Kahneman presents some surprising conclusions about what it means to be happy, based on psychological studies. Haidt’s conclusions, by contrast, were either too generic or too vague to be very interesting. And if his conclusions do sound surprising—if, say, the claim that commuting in heavy traffic in a shiny red Ferrari to work 10 hours, and then coming home to an empty mansion, will not make you happy—then I think this is a measure of something strangely wrong with the our world."
6,0465028020,http://goodreads.com/user/show/735855-karson,3," The short conclusion at the end of this book was really good. I wish the rest of the book stuck to the author's concise summary a little bit better. In some of Haidt's best advice within the whole book he says, ""Just as plants need sun, water, and good soil to thrive, people need love, work, and a connection to something larger."" He adds, ""You have to get the conditions right, and then wait."" There are a lot of other good insights in the book, but I find them to be burried in piles of other not-so-compelling somewhat dry information. I would prefer something a little more contemplative. Something that quotes the ancient wisdom, but doesn't add as much commentary.  Haidt has another insight that jives closely with an insight in another book I reviewed called, ""Finding Clarity"" by Jeru Kabbal. Basically the observation is that humans are like icebergs. There is a little portion that sticks above the water that we are aware of and in control of, and then there is a huge mammoth of a hunk of ice under the water that we are not aware of or in control of. We would like to think that our awareness steers our ship, but, in truth, it is the huge portion hidden under the water that directs our actions and hardens them into habits that become the building blocks of our personality. The most we can do is become aware of our subconscious selves, accept it for what it is, respect it, and work with it. Twas a good book, if you are willing to wade through some dryness to get to the good stuff."
7,0465028020,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5864678-jan-rice,4,"If I hadn't read Daniel Kahneman's Thinking, Fast and Slow, first, I may not have been able to get into The Happiness Hypothesis. Although they mine some of the same territory, The Happiness Hypothesis is an ordinary book. Kahneman's book, on the other hand, is a land mine. I think he wrote it using the knowledge that was his subject matter, giving it its penetrating power. Haidt, on the other hand, comes across as attempting to ""convert"" the reader, which can set up some resistance. Also, while Kahneman speaks of System 1 and System 2 to represent intuitive vs. effortful thinking, he explains that these are not actual physical systems in the brain but, rather, ways of picturing and understanding the way the mind works. Haidt, in speaking of ""the rider"" (rationality) and ""the elephant,"" is a lot less careful. I think that's one example of why I felt a little as though he was trying to suck me into his way of thinking, while I perceived Kahneman as enlightening me. Also, ""The Happiness Hypothesis"" strikes me as a title that would tend to attract women readers disproportionately, while ""Thinking, Fast and Slow,"" being more scientific sounding, would not turn off (some) men.Well, fortunately, I had read Kahneman first, so I could take the wealth of information Haidt has to give and plug it in as I liked. Really, all of us could benefit from reading some of these books on cognitive science that are being written these days. Then our inclination to enshrine our intellects and idolize our own rationality might be tempered. We would be more humble and be able to become more wise.Some examples of Haidt's thinking which I love: We need each other because each of us has a blind spot regarding ourselves. As human beings we are expert at seeing the mistakes of others but not our own. We are all hypocrites in that respect. That is how we are made. Listen to others who don't think like we do or like us as well as we like ourselves--that's the ticket.I liked his depiction of our three dimensions of experience--the dimension of closeness/distance, hierarchy (superior/inferior), and, last, the one he says we in the West have forgotten about since, roughly, WWII, the spiritual dimension, the dimension that stretches from degradation to elevation. He says we try to incorporate all our strivings into the rubric of autonomy, which, while maximizing our freedoms, also flattens our experience of the world.He also wrote about the seeming paradox that religions, which teach loving kindness, are also responsible for the greatest outpourings of hate and violence. That is because they do teach loving kindness--to insiders. Outsiders beware!Then there is this: There are four main causes of violence and cruelty. The first, greed and ambition, is obvious, but explains only a small part of the violence that occurs, and the second, sadism, causes little to none of it. A third source of violence is--surprise--self-esteem (especially the kind that is shaky and undeserved). Being easily threatened by reality, such people, whose ranks are often made up of young men, are prone to retaliate against the perceived cause of their angst. Fourth, according to Haidt, to really get a mass atrocity going, you need idealism. Just what we wouldn't expect to hear! You need those who believe they are creating a perfect society or those who believe they are fighting the source of evil. You need the true believer for that, because the true believer believes the end justifies the means, and that his or her group has a ""moral mandate"" to disregard ""ordinary"" rules and ""do what hast to be done.""Good stuff, huh?Oh, and ""the myth of pure evil,"" and the relevance of Manichaean thinking to today's terribly polarized political reality....And in Haidt, unlike Kahneman, the reader meets illustrious people from history and their ideas--prophets and poets and philosophers. The reader gets to meet Boethius again, he of ""The Consolation of Philosophy"" whom I'd come across recently in the Odyssey of the West series on medieval times. Not to mention Buddha and Jesus (with obvious relevance to the ""blind spot"" discussed above--the log in one's own eye) and Thomas Jefferson and Shakespeare and Benjamin Franklin and Plato...."
8,0465028020,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5900498-michael-johnston,4,"Finished reading this last night. Two things first - 1) the book is not really about ancient wisdom. It's primarily about current research/thinking in the field of Psychology on emotional happiness. 2) The first third of the book is among the most depressing things I have ever read. The book starts by focusing on the view that humans have virtually no control over our own ability to be happy (or miserable). It's genetic - we are born with an innate predisposition towards personal happiness or misery. In addition, the author focuses on a psychological view that people don't take moral or ethical actions out of an essential human goodness. Rather, we are programmed through evolution only to take actions that benefit us personally and even when we act ethically our moral compass may be off (that is, we may convince ourselves that we are being kind and morally upstanding when our objectively tested actions show that we are not). Haidt cites research that even those accused and convicted of history's most heinous crimes acted only out of the pursuit of some type of twisted greater moral good.At this point, I nearly put the book down. How can one embrace an outlook on life that implies both that we have no choice in how we act and that our actions are entirely self-serving in any case. That is a sad world.Yet, I'm glad that I didn't put the book down. After this worldview was described, the book began to change and some wonderful and powerful images began to surface. For example, Haidt talks about posttraumatic stress growth - a circumstance in which people respond to tragedy and trauma by finding a path to personal growth and in the process change their lives in fundamental ways that allow them to lead happier, more meaningful lives. Even better, he cites research that people who maintain strong social connections, belong to groups, have religious faith, have strong marriages, and help others are more optimistic and happier. Here then, he suggests, are lessons in how we can overcome our genetic limitations. He also touches on virtue and character and poses an interesting idea. The liberals have it right when it comes to diversity. Demographic diversity, as he calls it (diversity of race, sex, sexual orientation, ethnicity, and religious faith), creates a more just society. On the other hand, conservatives have it right on the need for agreement on a set of core societal values because in our effort to embrace diversity, moral diversity has disconnected us from our cultural moorings. He suggests we need a core of moral values and virtues to teach our children if we expect them to live lives of character and value.If you can get through the first third of the book without falling into a deep depression, you will find a truly interesting and valuable read. Both an intellectually interesting view on the personal and societal infrastructure that can make us happier and a world view that refuses to give in to factionalism (he is an atheist, but sees important value in religious beliefs and a liberal who embraces some of the ideas from conservatives).Whether you agree with any of his ideas or not, read it because it will stimulate your thinking and encourage personal introspection."
9,0465028020,http://goodreads.com/user/show/14238929-nithya-nagarathinam,2,"This book starts off as great. It neatly draws from the ancient philosophy and extrapolates the relevance of ancient wisdom to modern life. For example, the elephant-rider analogy, for which it gets one star. But somewhere in the middle, it loses itself in theological arguments. The scope of the book is so broad that the title becomes misleading. The book gets another star for the valuable insights into human psychology, morality and life in general that lie interspersed in between elaborate digressions into religion and drugs. But it gets no more because far from finding modern truth in ancient wisdom, it equates the latter to religion and gets ahead of itself as it delves into the religion vs science argument seeking ,rather circuitously, to derive a common ground between the two without finally offering anything valuable to the reader as a result of this rumination.A book has to be like a discovery, either revealing something new to the reader or making her see what is obvious and plain in a way that it is “elevating” as the author might have put it. The Happiness Hypothesis does that in the beginning but fades halfway through only to end in a whimpering attempt at revival of its initial zest. "
10,0465028020,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2605305-orton-family-foundation,5,"I’ve often marveled at how seemingly rational people can forgo reason when engaged in public debate over a land use issue. A few years back I was involved in a community meeting about a new village scale project being proposed for the center of a small Vermont town. Even faced with a plethora of facts, figures and testimonials to the contrary, many people held fast to their belief that the project—designed to mimic the design and spacing of the clustered houses already in the village center—would result in traffic congestion, loss of views and lost sleep due to noisy neighbors. People too easily ignored the positive aspects of the project—avoidance of sprawl, better traffic flow from a new street network—and dwelled only on potential, if unlikely, negative effects. It proved difficult for people to think openly and rationally about this project. Thanks to a new book about happiness, of all things, I am beginning to understand why.In his book, The Happiness Hypothesis, Jonathan Haidt (a professor of psychology at the University of Virginia) offers insight into where this type of irrational response comes from and why it is so hard for us to change our opinions and our behavior. Combining the wisdom of the past (from Freud to Buddha, Shakespeare to the Bible) with the latest cognitive research, Haidt engages the reader in an insightful exploration of what makes us happy and how we find meaning in our lives, and offers clues to understanding erratic personal and social behavior along the way. Many of the clues come from an understanding of the workings of the human mind—much of the book is devoted to this, starting with a very readable discussion of brain physiology and its impact on human responses. Throughout the book, Haidt provides a menu of things that we need to consider, work on, and ultimately achieve in order to find happiness. This could have resulted in a “self help” book but, thankfully, The Happiness Hypothesis avoids that fate. Of particular usefulness to the planning field, or at least for understanding the dynamic of the meeting I attended, is the description of how the human mind is divided and often in conflict, resulting in a situation where feelings take preference over reasoning. Haidt uses the analogy of a rider (our rational and conscious self or ego) trying to control an elephant that often has its own desires and agenda (our unconscious, emotional self) to explain why we often have difficulty behaving in a rational way. It turns out it is sometimes very hard to control what our elephant does. Haidt takes this concept further by looking at the evolution of the brain. In order to survive, humans have learned to take quick action when faced with a threat (“that is something that can eat me”) and respond slower when faced with opportunity (“should I catch and eat that frog now or later?”). As our species evolved, the fearful and cautious response was reinforced because it helped us survive and has now been hardwired into our brains. Consequently, our brain’s automatic system, our survival mechanism, is much stronger and more developed than our controlled system which reasons and plans, weighing pros and cons before taking action. The result is that we respond first, and rational thought comes later. We don’t necessarily need such a strong automatic response today, but remnants of it give us what Haidt refers to as a “negative bias” and explain why we react strongly to threats, like a new kind development next door, that we fear may impact our quality of life, even if our reaction is irrational or pre-rational. This makes it difficult for us to engage in new or forward thinking. It also reduces the likelihood that we will be influenced by facts or arguments that speak to the rational rider, but not to the emotional elephant. To make matters worse, our brain is hard-wired to invent a rational argument or justification for our irrational behavior (i.e., the rider will invent an explanation for why the elephant does something that makes no sense).The take-home message—as it relates to planning and bringing about changes in attitude and behavior—is to not focus so much on conscious thought (the rider), and the typical rational analysis of a situation in order to influence a decision, but rather to find ways to train the elephant to think and behave differently. Haidt suggests personal work to understand and improve ourselves as individuals, offering up meditation, cognitive therapy and Prozac as the three main pathways to this retraining. Although a part of me is really tempted to find out what would happen if all planning meeting participants were given a mood altering drug prior to public debate, I think there are less controversial approaches worth exploring first. Perhaps we need to de-emphasize the facts and set the ground work for a better public process by finding ways to help people in our communities understand their social lives, and habitual responses and behaviors, in a way that makes it possible for them to be less influenced by the behavior of their elephant. Then maybe they can engage with others more effectively. Complete Buddhist enlightenment may be too much to hope for, but if everyone worked a little harder to acknowledge and rein in their elephants we’d all be better off.Read more reviews by the Orton Family Foundation in our Scenarios e-journal at http://www.orton.org/resources/public...-Karen Yacos"
11,0465028020,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1045774-mehrsa,4,"You've heard of every single study in this book--marshmallows, monkeys and moms, etc. But Haidt's book is one of the best in this genre--he mixes modern psychological research (which I think by itself does not lend to a coherent worldview though many have tried to weave one) with some ancient ideas as well as some evolutionary truths. The point of this book, as he says, is not to tell you the meaning of life (why are we here, where do we go, etc), but how to have a meaningful (or happy) life. He's very realistic. We all have a happiness setpoint and the only way to move it is through meditation, cognitive therapy or Prozac--though he seems most sold on the latter. That's my one quip on the book--for some reason, it just can't be that Prozac is the secret to happiness. Though I have never taken it myself so I may be missing out. "

All of this is in search of one question asked two ways, “what is the meaning of life.” For some people that is better asked, “what is the purpose of life,” for others, “how do we get meaning out of the our lives?” 	Haidt’s a good writer and he has a sense of humor. His description of the human psyche, personality or brain as an Elephant and a rider is based on modern research (1970s and later) but does not ignore our past. It is also a wonderful metaphor that helps understand why people do things as they do them. He works on a macro level to categorize things like virtues that seem to be universal but are not always, and also takes very specific journeys. 	Perhaps best is that Haidt, an atheist, is incredibly respectful of religion and people of faith. He explores different cultures both in religion and in other developmental aspects and comes up with his own Happiness Hypothesis. If I were to take issue with what Haidt has strung together it is that, though I feel he understands this, what he wrote about genetic behavior does not translate in a way that reflects the science on it. This may because we haven’t learned how to discuss genetic behavior in a way that does not sound “black and white.” Genetic behavior is not characterized by, if you have the gene, you have the behavior. It is more that you have the potential for this genetic behavior to develop. There are also other potentials and the environment in which you live plays a role in activating these potentials. In the grand scheme of things, that should not take away from Haidt’s message. 	Another issue would be, “how does this help us be happy.” Haidt’s book, if it were intended to be a tool to help people find happiness rather than inform, works by the theory that “awareness is the key to change.” That only works for some people. Though there is plenty of information for those who have to “do to achieve change,” the perspective is more suited to people who are by nature introspective and, willing to challenge themselves and explore new beliefs. Even Haidt discusses in his book how that description does not apply to everybody. 	Those two things aside, there is much worth reading here about how our cultures and societies formed and what holds relationships together or what is “innate” in the natural make up of Mankind. It’s a good read and I recommend it. It reflects modern thinking, modern science and a modern look at how people, groups and personalities are put together. What comes naturally to us, and what that is based on and what comes through hard lessons? I give it 5 stars as the best short book about social psychology and the meaning of life in a while. Open-mindedness helps."
13,0465028020,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4252261-tom-la,3,"I loved Haidt's most recent book, ""The righteous mind"". This one (written years earlier) contains a lot of fascinating insights, but it seemed to me a little weaker. While ""Righteous mind"" examines the origins of morality, ""Happiness"" goes through some studies of happiness that I have already found or heard elsewhere, and it draws pertinent links with some ancient wisdom. According to Haidt, the ones among us who have lost at the ""cortex lottery"" and are therefore less naturally prone to be happy, can greatly enhance their happiness through 1) meditation 2) cognitive therapy and 3) prozac. I do not agree with this view. Like many psychological theories, I find it cynical and de-humanizing, especially the statement that if nature didn't give you a happy-go-lucky personality, you start off your life as a loser. Also, like many atheists, Haidt (in this book) is in love with his own idea of oriental meditation, and never once he mentions that the same neurological benefits can be obtained through prayer. Finally, the thing I liked the least: the value that Haidt gives to behavioral psychology experiments. I cringe at any type of psychological ""experiment"" or ""test"", and the book is full of them. You know, when they call you in, put you in a certain situation and measure your reactions, your feelings or your behavior. A long trend of studies, made very popular by Dr. Milgram, the one who asked candidates to administer electrical shocks to a man in the other room. Something pretty much as scientific as Ron Hubbard when he was sticking electrodes into tomatoes and peppers. I just don't buy any of that stuff. The tests always seem to end up 1) proving the ridiculously obvious, or 2) proving whatever the researcher intended to prove from the start. It seems to me that only a culture that is very poor in emotional intelligence would consider these as important or serious studies. For example, somehow I do not picture behavioral psychology tests being taken with the same seriousness in southern Italy, Spain or Greece, where any conclusion that you can draw from the ""psychological experiment"" is already crystal clear and freely available to anyone, irrespective of education, age or status. "
14,0465028020,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1654645-deb-readerbuzz-nance,4,"And thus we move, logically, to The Happiness Hypothesis. Ben Tanaka, main character of Shortcomings, could use The Happiness Hypothesis. Ginger Pye and the rest of the Pye family apparently intuitively knew The Happiness Hypothesis. Haidt looks at ancient wisdom and compares it to the result of the new science of positive psychology. Some of the things I learned from this book:*Reciprocity is the best guide to life. This is the classic “Do unto others” thought. *There are three effective ways to happiness: meditation, cognitive therapy, and Prozac. *People have good insight about other people, but are terrible in judging themselves. They cannot see their own flaws.*Instead of trying to improve weaknesses, we should work on our strengths. Often we can use a strength to get around a weakness.*The personality is now thought to have three components: (1) our basic and classic traits of neuroticism and extroversion, (2) the ways we characteristically adapt including openness to new experiences, agreeableness, and conscientiousness, and (3) our life story, the way we have made sense of our lives.*It takes adversity to reach our highest levels. Posttraumatic growth is rising to the challenges of problems, which reveals hidden abilities and changes our self-concept. "
15,0465028020,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2329228-amy,5,"Using psychology, philosophy, theology*, and some biology, Jonathan Haidt digs into what brings true happiness and how we define it. I like how intellectually engaging this book was. Most of the studies, philosophies, and ideas he presents should be familiar to anyone who keeps up with the topics. However, I've never seen them combined like this. It really is about ""modern truth"" born from ""ancient wisdom."" Now, while I found this book engaging, I did not agree with all of it. This is pretty understandable, considering Jonathan Haidt and I approach the world from two very different worldviews. (He could really do with some C.S. Lewis.) But I respect and I appreciate his willingness to engage with ideas and worldviews he disagrees with and doesn't understand. I find it interesting he looks to The Purpose Driven Life as a sort of ""Christian"" voice and if I have one critique there, it would be that he seems to consider the ""religious right"" in a very narrow, 1990s era way. Being seeped in the ""religious right"", however, I know a shift has taken place generationally in how we talk about faith, politics, and a meaningful life. However, that is not a nuance I would expect from someone looking in.Accordingly, I acknowledge he does the best he can to understand it considering how far he disagrees with it. I do not understanding why he felt the need to repeatedly reference fundamentalist homeschooling their children, but that can be debated another day. I like Haidt's take on wonder. I think he demonstrates a healthy understanding of awe and the role in plays in our world. I particularly appreciate the way he traces science ""shift"" from awe and move to categorize. It was very intriguing. Overall, I recommend this one. The phrase ""intellectually engaging"" keeps coming to mind. But perhaps, emotionally engaging too. I didn't discover any new truths within its pages, but I learned to think about things differently and see commonality where previously I might be inclined to make a quick assumption.*I use the word loosely. I don't know that the author would consider it theology, especially as he doesn't seem to understand it (like his description of good v. bad.)"
16,0465028020,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1833260-julie,4,"I've been slogging away at this book for nearly a month, which is unusual for me. Usually, if I stall on a book (as I did with three other books I started reading over the month of February), I simply put it down with a note that it's been partially read. But The Happiness Hypothesis was so compelling that I kept coming back after putting it down and letting my mind digest the material. It's a book that's designed to be read slowly.I discovered this book through Switch, by Chip and Dan Heath, who borrow Haidt's metaphor of the mind as a rider on an elephant. Haidt asks us to imagine our mind as a rider (your conscious self) trying to direct an elephant (your subconscious self). To some extent, the rider can manhandle the elephant into doing what it wants, but things work out much better if he can train the elephant into going along the proper path. This metaphor helps explain much of the rest of the book.Later chapters use psychology, neurology, biology, and anthropology to explain the sometimes-confusing world of our minds and our societies. Why do we feel the need to get revenge on someone, even if it doesn't bring us any personal gain? Why are we so likely to see faults in other but not ourselves? How can we find love and happiness? How can we overcome adversity? And, in the pursuit of the ultimate question, what is the meaning of life?This is an absolutely fascinating book, and I highly recommend it. You'll start to see some of the underlying reasons behind things that might previous have been a mystery. I expect I'll come back to this book and reread it every few years, because it's just so rich with information."
17,0465028020,http://goodreads.com/user/show/18944510-mario-tomic,5,"5 star, pure wisdom! This book gave me great insights on how our mind works. It's a great combination of scientific research, philosophy and psychology of today diving deep to figure out what really makes us happy. I highly recommended reading this book, if someone would say that I had only 3 books to pick for them this would be one of them. If you're wondering about the reasons for our seemingly never-ending pursuit of happiness and meaning ""The Happiness Hypothesis"" will give you very solid answers."
18,0465028020,http://goodreads.com/user/show/34749978-phil,4,"Jonathan Haidt’s The Happiness Hypothesis bears the subtitle Finding Modern Truth in Ancient Wisdom. Executives at Basic Books no doubt felt that this was a little too lofty and academic sounding for the average Indigo-browsing reader of pop-psychology, because the book also bears the second, much sexier subtitle Why the Meaningful Life is Closer Than You Think. Each of these three titles seems to point in a somewhat different direction. But whether wittingly or unwittingly, this veritable schizophrenia of titles actually does a decent job of capturing the eclecticism of Haidt’s method in the book. In fact, he may as well have called it Some Findings of Contemporary Framed by the Thought of Ancient Authors and Packaged for Your Self-Help Convenience. The stated aim of the book is to examine ten Great Ideas articulated in various traditions around the world—Buddhism, Christianity, Confucianism, Hinduism, Islam, Judaism, and Western philosophy—in order to “question it in light of what we now know from scientific research, and to extract from it lessons that still apply to our modern lives” (p. ix). Interestingly, this amalgam of serious psychological research and pop-psychological self-help may actually place him a lot closer to some of the Hellenistic philosophers whom he cites than most of contemporary philosophy. The first two Ideas Haidt addresses touch on the nature of the human mind: first, that the mind is divided into parts that sometimes conflict; and second, that it shapes our perception of the world. Haidt begins by describing the various dualisms that fragment human identity: mind vs. body, left brain vs. right brain, old brain (the limbic system) vs. new brain (the neocortex), controlled vs. automatic processes. Against the information-processing models of the mind popularized in the 20th Century, he argues that the majority of our mental processes are automatic, requiring no conscious attention. This gives him the occasion to introduce his now-famous (if overused) metaphor of the human mind as composed of a rider and an elephant: automatic processes (the elephant) are in charge, and controlled processes (the rider) function primarily as interpretive modules with little real power over human action. He then goes on to use this model to explain the manner in which automatic processes colour our perception of the world. Among our automatic processes is what is sometimes called a “like-o-meter”: we have immediate and instinctive like/dislike reactions to phenomena, which unconsciously guide our decisions to approach or to withdraw from them. The way this like-o-meter is calibrated determined our affective stance—that is, how positively or negatively we tend to see the world. Although Haidt argues that our affective stance is to a large extent genetically predetermined, he also outlines methods that have proven successful in modifying it, namely meditation, cognitive therapy, and antidepressants. The second set of Ideas Haidt addresses pertain to our social life. The first of these is the claim, echoed across religions and traditions, that reciprocity is the heart of morality; the second, that human beings are hypocritical by nature. Haidt argues that human beings have an instinctive understanding of reciprocity: the strategy of tit-for-tat—along with the related emotions of vengefulness and gratitude—are “built into” human psychology and form the lens through which we view social interactions. From an evolutionary standpoint, he suggests that reciprocity is the key to our ultrasociality: it allowed us to transcend kin altruism in order to form cooperative relationships with strangers and reap their benefits. However, Haidt points out that there is also a dark side to human ultrasociality. Our need to see ourselves—both as individuals and as a group—as worthy cooperators give rise to marked asymmetries in the standards by which we evaluate our own actions and those of others. Here, our general tendencies toward motivated reasoning and confirmation bias manifest themselves in our aptitude at finding excuses for our bad behaviour while failing to extend the same courtesy to others. It is also reflected in our tendency to look the world through the “Myth of Pure Evil”—that is, our tendency to condemn the faults of others as the product of their inherent wickedness while excusing our own as the results of external contingencies. Here again, Haidt points to meditation and self-scrutiny as ways to undermine these immensely harmful cognitive biases and to forge better relationships with others. The next couple of Great Ideas address the sources of human happiness. The first is the view, commonly associated with Stoicism and Buddhism, that happiness can be found only within, not without; and the second, incompatible, view that human beings find meaning and fulfillment only through their relationships with others. Haidt maintains that the Stoic-Buddhist goes too far: contemporary psychological research suggests that happiness comes, at least in part, from outside yourself. It is true that our happiness depends largely on our genetic makeup and that we tend to adapt to whatever happens to us by recalibrating our goals, hopes, and expectations. Nonetheless, certain factors appear to resist adaptation and to lead to net increases or decreases in our level of happiness. Strong social connections and access to a moderate amount of resources are key to happiness, whereas bad relationships and a felt lack of control have the opposite effect. Particularly important for a sense of meaning is what Haidt calls “flow”—that is, the state of total immersion (of “being in the zone”) that occurs when we are faced with a challenge, when we have the skills to meet it, and get immediate feedback about how we’re doing. In such cases, automatic and conscious processes—the elephant and the rider—are in perfect harmony. Equally important are long-lasting attachment to particular others and the obligations and constraints that they bring with them. These are crucial for providing structure to our lives and to retaining the sense of security and control required for fulfillment. In light of this analysis, Haidt cautions against the misguided pursuit of wealth and passion and the excessive valorization of negative liberty. Instead, he advises us to organize our days in such a way as to maximize flow and to pursue compassionate long-lasting relationships. After the nature of happiness, Haidt moves on to the conditions of human growth and development. Here he considers, first, the idea that people need adversity to reach the highest levels of personal development, and second, the view that cultivating virtue makes us happy. Regarding the former, he defends what he calls a “weak adversity hypothesis”: adversity can lead to growth, e.g. by revealing our abilities, strengthening our relationships, and reordering our priorities. He frames this in terms of a three-level model of personality as consisting of basic traits (e.g. extroversion, openness, agreeableness, conscientiousness), adaptations (personal goals, coping mechanisms, values, beliefs), and a life story that integrates our past, present, and future into a coherent “life myth.” On this model, the key to growth is sense-making at the level of life story. Although adversity is unlikely to be beneficial if it is so major as to be insurmountable or if it occurs too early or too late in life, he argues that moderate adversity, especially in the late teens and early twenties gives us a chance to reevaluate our goals and change our adaptions in order to establish coherence between the various levels of our personalities. Regarding what he calls the “virtue hypothesis,” Haidt sides with the Ancients against the Moderns in emphasizing good character over right action. In his view, modern moral philosophy errs in divorcing morality from happiness and in overestimating the power of reason to bring about desired conduct: “Trying to teach children to behave ethically by teaching them to reason is like trying to teach a dog to be happy by wagging its tail” (p. 165). As Haidt understands it, virtue consists in a “well-trained elephant,” i.e. in the taming of automatic processes via habit. It is primarily in this ancient sense of ἀρετή (arete, excellence) that virtue is its own reward. The final two chapters pertain to the nature of meaning itself. The first Big Idea Haidt considers in this connection is that there is something divine in human beings, and the second, that meaning is achieved through unity with a larger whole. He begins by advancing the view that the human mind perceives three dimensions of social space: in addition to the vertical and horizontal dimensions of hierarchy and closeness, we are intuitively aware of a third (diagonal?) dimension that he calls divinity or sacredness. The perception of sacredness is associated with a special emotion, which we might call elevation or uplift. It is characterized by the sense of oneness with and love for everything captured in the Christian concept of agape. He argues that, whether or not we believe in God (or other supernatural entities or planes), human life is impoverished when we lose sight of divinity and let the world collapse in two dimensions. Then, he moves on to what is arguable the central thesis of the book, namely, that happiness comes from between. That is, it comes from a variety of conditions, some of which are within us, and some of which are without. We are social creatures who need long-lasting attachments and strong communal ties. We are industrious creatures who need the satisfaction of self-directed labour and who thrive as part of a larger whole. We are also deeply divided creatures who need to establish coherence between the various levels of our personalities. Happiness comes when we get these conditions right. The Happiness Hypothesis is an excellent book: intellectual but accessible, eminently readable, very well researched, and immediately relevant. Admittedly, the book isn’t perfect. Haidt does have a bit of a tendency toward evolutionary “just-so” stories that push the bounds of the plausible—his discussion of the evolution of language as a vehicle for gossip here being a case in point. His treatment of morality also often runs into contradictions at the meta-normative level. Although he frequently speaks as though there were nothing to moral discourse apart from rationalizations of fundamentally irrational intuitions, he at the same time wants to speak about cognitive biases impairing our moral thinking—the first being a distinctly anti-realist view, and the second having inescapably realist implications. Relatedly, he falls prey to the insidious disease of moral psychology that consists in jumping from factual premises about the human mind to normative conclusions— as if, for instance, the fact that we tend to be more altruistic when experiencing a feeling x (e.g. elevation) makes irrelevant the question whether there are reasons to be altruistic, whether or not we are currently experiencing x. However, these flaws are relatively minor. The book as a whole is a triumphant achievement in our understanding of ourselves. Perhaps most enlightening is that it highlights just how much modern Western society fails miserably to secure those things that are most important to human well-being. There can be no denying that modern democratic societies are tremendous advances over other forms of social organization. But from the superficiality of relationships in the age of social media and online dating to the alienated wage labour of market capitalism, from the excessive individualism of consumer culture to the negative liberty of liberal self-understanding, it seems that we in the West have become uniquely blind to some of the most important sources of human happiness."
19,0465028020,http://goodreads.com/user/show/12392091-michael,5,"Don’t be put off by the title! It sounds wishy-washy, but it’s not. Haidt’s claims are specific and empirical, and are backed-up with citations to published studies. The Happiness Hypothesis serves two functions: (1) it’s a psychology professor’s introduction to his chosen subfield (“positive psychology”), which aims to help people “find happiness and meaning” (Kindle Loc. 132); and (2) it explores the continued applicability of (mostly ancient and/or religious) philosophical and moral ideas, in light of (relatively) recent empirical findings. First, the social science.Haidt employs a simple analytical framework throughout the book: [subjective self-reported] happiness = biological set point + conditions of one’s life (some of which are changeable) + voluntary activities. (Loc. 1772) His book spends its pages explaining which conditions and activities correlate with increased subjective well-being (and sometimes the experiments show explicit causation). Many of the findings Haidt reports are unsurprising but important nonetheless; I present four of my favorite takeaways. (1) Be aware of the adaptation principle: after you buy better/bigger/nicer things, you’ll quickly get used to them; instead, spend money on improving your circumstances in a way that, on average, will improve your subjective well-being: e.g. studies show that moving to a bigger house farther away from one’s place of work isn’t wise (“people quickly adapt to having more space, [but] they don’t fully adapt to the longer commute, particularly if it involves driving in heavy traffic.” (Loc 1795)). [Living near loud noises, e.g., a busy intersection, is like a long commute in that people do not fully adapt to it.] (2) Realize that your brain is populated with self serving biases, and that correcting them takes active work: research shows that it’s not enough to simply know that the biases exist (Loc. 1395), so force yourself to write down weaknesses in whatever position/case/argument you’re advocating: you’ll emerge from the exercise with a more nuanced/balanced (and accurate) assessment of the persuasiveness and/or the chance it will prevail (Loc. 1414).(3) Find something that engages you for long periods of time, ideally as part of your job. Haidt explains the findings of Csikszentmihalyi’s investigations into people’s level of enjoyment of their current activities (“experience sampling method”):  [His] big discovery is that there is a state many people value even more than chocolate after sex. It is the state of total immersion in a task that is challenging yet closely matched to one’s abilities. It is what people sometimes call “being in the zone.” Csikszentmihalyi called it “flow” because it often feels like effortless movement. . . . The keys to flow: There’s a clear challenge that fully engages your attention; you have the skills to meet the challenge; and you get immediate feedback about how you are doing at each step (the progress principle) [which states that on average people report more pleasure from making progress towards goals than from achieving them]. (loc 1856) Note that this finding suggests that people should find and follow their strengths (and work on strengthening their strengths, which they’ll find rewarding and which can help them as much as trying to allay weaknesses) (Loc. 4062).(4) Remember that you’re not an island: having strong social relationships-yes, even those with annoying ties and obligations-produces an absurd host of physical and emotional benefits. (loc 2527)The Happiness Hypothesis also incorporates ancient philosophy. In addition to Aristotle et. al., the author weaves in quotes from Judaism, Christianity, Islam, Buddhism, and Shakespeare, and then shows how certain studies support them, or require an augmenting of the chosen phrases. Haidt also clarifies the relationship between positive psychology and these Great Thinkers of the past, breaking it down into two questions: the first involves the question of why we all exist (just for philosophers/theologians/physicists), while the second is something like “How can I find a sense of meaning and purpose?” (Loc 3990). The second question is (he argues) empirical, and thus amenable to positive psychology’s inquiries. The inquiries don’t produce a single “how to live” answer, but rather offer a ying-yang-type balance: We were shaped by individual selection to be selfish creatures who struggle for resources, pleasure, and prestige, and we were shaped by group selection to be hive creatures who long to lose ourselves in something larger. We are social creatures who need love and attachments, and we are industrious creatures with needs for effectance, able to enter a state of vital engagement with our work. We are the rider [Haidt’s metaphor for conscious thought] and we are the elephant [metaphor for all unconscious processes], and our mental health depends on the two working together, each drawing on the others’ strengths. (Loc. 4357) Haidt also has some interesting tangents. My two favorites: he laments the change in the notion of morality from a ""character ethics"" inculcating moral virtues to a ""quandary ethics"" focusing on moral reasoning, and endorses David Wilson's interpretation of religion as an interlocking of genetic and cultural adaptations that enhance peace, harmony, and cooperation within the group for the express purpose of increasing the group's ability to compete with other groups. (Loc 4300)I thoroughly enjoyed this book, and Haidt convinced me of its main thesis (""Hypothesis""): contrary to Eastern thought, the secret to satisfaction does not lie entirely within oneself, and contrary to Western values, it does not solely involve external factors (attaining wealth, etc.), but rather happiness and meaning exist ""in the relationship between the two,"" i.e., in the relationship (coherent=happy; discordant=not) between one's thoughts/desires/dreams, and one's current situation and choices. (Loc. 4110)"
20,0465028020,http://goodreads.com/user/show/66346358-sven-kirsim-e,5,"I was a big fan of self-help books in my early 20ies and dropped them fast for they tend to be far from relating topics to any scientific reference of proof (that I tend to admire) and simply axiomatizing without any scientific reference. This book based on my experience, I initially looked at skeptically, is definitely a turnaround. For the first time, I feel like ”happiness has a scientific background in it”."
21,0465028020,http://goodreads.com/user/show/15521114-kirk,2,"I was recommended this book by a friend. Going in, I was skeptical - the premise sounded like some sort of self-help hand wavy junk. When I realized the ambition of the book, I got much more interested. To me, the concept seemed great: ""here's an ancient theory on life from an important philosopher, here's some modern science that provides empirical evidence for this theory so it seems they were correct and we should follow his / her advice."" However, I think this book may have reached too far and ultimately failed in its intention. First, the book slipped between using modern studies to buttress the arguments of philosophers and using modern studies to extend these arguments. For me there's a big difference between saying 'look! modern psychological experiments suggest that Aristotle was right about X!' and 'experiments say X, when combined with Aristotle's Y we can infer A.' You can't assume that Y is correct! He picks and chooses theories from his favorite philosophers and combines this with science to tell a nice story, but it too often takes these initial unsupported arguments for granted. As someone who also studied some philosophy in college, I can say that ancient philosophers were wrong about quite a lot, and calling it 'Wisdom of the Ancients' doesn't make me any more inclined to accept these arguments at face value. So when Haidt would give a suggestion, I would feel like the premise was still unsupported. So in the end, it felt kind of self-helpy and hand-wavy after all. Second, I just don't like the way the book was written. Haidt tries to take a Gladwellian approach to his book: here's an idea, here's some cherry-picked research, here's an insightful quote, and here's a relevant anecdote to hammer the point home. Without turning this into a rant about the intellectual bankruptcy of Malcolm Gladwell's arguments, Haidt tries to do something similar and ultimately is just not as good at it. Gladwell is a great storyteller. For all the selective inclusion and overlooked counterarguments in his books, he finds some very colorful and engaging stories to include. Haidt attempts to enhance his arguments using personal anecdotes about his own life journey that just aren't as interesting. I think Haidt's arguments may have more intellectual honesty behind them than Gladwell but I'm still not convinced - and at least with Gladwell I got a good story out of it. It's a shame this book was written before ""Thinking Fast and Slow"" by Kahneman, because there are a lot of overlaps between the two, especially in the first couple chapters. ""Thinking Fast and Slow"" does a better job of both explaining contemporary research and drawing conclusions from it. Supplementing what is shown in that book with parallels in ancient philosophy could have made this book more of a success. Additionally, Kahneman's heuristic of ""System I"" and ""System II"" work so much better for me than Haidt's more forced metaphor of an ""Elephant and it's Rider"". If you're looking for books to understand the human mind and how we work, I would recommend ""Thinking Fast and Slow"" (Kahneman), ""Predictably Irrational"" (Ariely), and ""Drive"" (Pink) ahead of this book. While none directly address 'life fulfillment', you can use what you learn there to better understand how your mind works, how to interact with other people (hint: give people the benefit of the doubt more), and feel more motivated in your life. These books are backed up by experimental evidence instead of just conjecture and in the end you can leave the philosophy behind. "
22,0465028020,http://goodreads.com/user/show/12638278-payam,5,"I love this book. I truly do! It is a combination of the three subjects I think about most: psychology, philosophy, and religion. In the Happiness Hypothesis the (humble) author brings together theories of the past, the theories of religion, and updates them with understandings from psychology. In many ways, he either adjusts traditional thinking with science or he validates traditional thinking with science. It is an excellent approach that must have taken the author a long time to put together. There is particularly one potent concept that the author teaches: the rider and the elephant. After having gone back into traditional thoughts, religion, and modern psychology, the bound nature of the mind and body becomes clear. In this case, the mind is the rider; the body is the elephant. The rider does its best to train the elephant; but the elephant can still disobey and his its own mind. The mind will never have full control, the elephant will never disappear. These two are always together and they must work together. The sooner the reader begins to understand this, the sooner the reader can listen to their own bodies and the feedback it gives them. The elephant is not bad. It is important to you. It may simply be too large to control or not trained well by the rider. The next time you cave into chocolate cake, it is not your mind that makes you do it, it may be your elephant. You may need to train the elephant more.I recommend this book for everyone."
23,0465028020,http://goodreads.com/user/show/8224038-zedsdead,4,"Non-fiction is not my usual milieu, but this was a gift from a family member so here I am.The author explores the nature of happiness, its properties and sources, with the end-goal of teaching the reader HOW to be happy. He searches for commonalities across ancient writings (Buddha, Confucius, the Bible, Torah, Aristotle, etc) to support his ideas, though in truth these felt superfluous to me. Haidt mostly relies on psychology and philosophy to back his assertions.The Happiness Hypothesis's big recurring metaphor is that the mind is a rider on an elephant. The rider represents reason and makes conscious decisions. The elephant is instinct, approach-retreat reflexes, and automatic responses to stimuli. The rider has limited control over what the elephant does, which explains why it's so hard to do things we know we should do (eg exercise portion control). Pitting the rider against the elephant in a contest of wills is doomed to eventual failure. To develop good happy-making habits, one must train the elephant over time.Some interesting concepts:Negativity bias--We're wired to assign greater value to loss than equivalent gain. The cortical lottery--We're born with a baseline level of happiness.The adaptation principle--Events may temporarily raise or lower one's baseline happiness (winning the lottery, losing a limb) but people eventually return to their baseline level.Reciprocity--We're built to reward those who are good to us and punish those that harm us, which incentivizes cooperative, mutually beneficial behavior. Sales techniques are designed to exploit this instinct.Motivated reasoning--If we can find evidence that supports the conclusion we want, we tend at that point to stop thinking critically.External factors--A few external factors that are shown to systematically affect happiness are noise (especially variable or intermittent), commute (shorter commutes increase happiness even when this means having a smaller home), lack of control (even the illusion of control increases happiness), shame (eg, body image), and especially relationships (strength and number).Conspicuous consumption--Evolutionarily advantageous (attracts more/better mates) but it demonstrably reduces happiness.The two types of love--As defined by the author. Passionate and companionate. The latter correlates to greater long-term happiness.At this point the book kind of lost me, as it veered into an examination of divinity, transcendence, religion and purity and virtues that vary from culture to culture. Squishy, ill-defined, and often undesirable stuff. I found the earlier psychology studies and experiments to be more interesting and relevant.The Happiness Hypothesis, boiled down: strong, numerous relationships create happiness; acknowledging one's own flaws and hypocrisies leads to growth and improved relationships; meditation can help; and dispense with conspicuous consumption.Update: Bumping this up a star because I find myself referencing it repeatedly in a positive way."
24,0465028020,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3650135-jenny,0,"I originally read this book for my Encounters in Humanities course. I remember settling down on the couch for a long, boring read (as I judged by the barefaced cover and a skim over the title). Although not every part is enthralling, this book has taught me, personally, so much. It also served its purpose incredibly well in the class; I was filled with questions, and insights into human nature I would have never explored on my own.  The part of the book that hit me hardest was the section on love, and also the discussions and thoughts that came from natural levels of happiness. My professor asked the class as we read this section, and as the book asked us the same thing in a different way, ""do you condemn someone with bad eyesight for wearing glasses? Are they somehow weaker in their will to see? Maybe they should just try focusing harder, instead of leaning on glasses as a crutch for their vision."" Everyone seemed surprised, but he continued. ""This book suggests the same is true, mentally, for some people; that there is an inherent level of happiness, an inherent ability to feel these emotions that we often strive for, that can make it more difficult or easier for certain people to feel. There are people who may have to constantly struggle, or may constantly be overwhelmed by sadness, who seek medication that doesn't elevate their mood, but equalize it with those of others; a neutral level that can still dip low, but can now have the ability to rise above. Why do we take issueswith mental and emotional ability so differently than those issues of physical ability? If someone inherently, internally, in their brain, is less able than another individual, should they not be helped?"". In my opinion, a book like this is made to be read, absorbed, reread, and discussed. I hold this book in high-esteem, as my friends who read this in the class with me are still bringing it up and discussing it to this day. I enjoyed it, and it influences me to this day. "

A tiny sampling of material:""But recent research in psychology suggests that Buddha and Epictetus may have taken things too far.""""In fact, happiness is one of the most highly heritable aspects of personality. Twin studies generally show that from 50 percent to 80 percent of all the variance among people in their average levels of happiness can be explained by differences in their genes rather than in their life experiences.""""You can change your affective style too—but again, you can’t do it by sheer force of will. You have to do something that will change your repertoire of available thoughts. Here are three of the best methods for doing so: meditation, cognitive therapy, and Prozac.""""After a careful review of the evidence, however, Frank concludes that those who think money can’t buy happiness just don’t know where to shop.""""If the metaphor for passionate love is fire, the metaphor for companionate love is vines growing, intertwining, and gradually binding two people together.""""A society without liberals would be harsh and oppressive to many individuals. A society without conservatives would lose many of the social structures and constraints that Durkheim showed are so valuable. Anomie would increase along with freedom. A good place to look for wisdom, therefore, is where you least expect to find it: in the minds of your opponents. You already know the ideas common on your own side. If you can take off the blinders of the myth of pure evil, you might see some good ideas for the first time."""
26,0465028020,http://goodreads.com/user/show/222151-ed,5,"Claire thinks this is the best book I have put her way in recent years and now has about six of her friends reading it. I seem to get good feedback from others I have suggested it to. Basically Jon Haidt (who I have had email correspondance with about the link between his work and mine) looks at what thinkers over the last 3000 years have said about what makes us happy and then applied modern neuro-science and the emerging study of positive psychology to see what light it throws on ancient wisdom. If only the remedial professions like social work took this approach on board instead of victimizing and medicalizing suffering. The way out of suffering is obviously partly its relief, but helping people find their own happiness is more likely to succeed long term. I think this book is the best of the recent spate of books on happiness and Jon Haidt has done some really cool work of his own on disgust, religion, morality that feeds into this book. Take a look at his web site and the photo of his research team: looks like a good place to be!Would be great to create a happiness workshop in a prison or other place of suffering."
27,0465028020,http://goodreads.com/user/show/12046702-nikola,5,"When you read a book for a second time, you realize how some other things you learned meanwhile has affected how you consume it and even your perception of the messages usually change, at least slightly. This is the first book ever that made me think that it has some even greater stuff inside while reading it (usually we all have that feeling that we have the right understanding of what we are reading and that we got it all right). This is the reason why I am going to reread it, probably next year. Anyway, I like how the book easily goes through the complicated questions of philosophy and happiness, connecting the modern scientific conclusions with older wisdom which was spread through the religions. There are no dogmas or similar, so people annoyed by the religious views should not skip this book. Also, the book got me when the Author referenced Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi who wrote Flow which is one of my favorites. "
28,0465028020,http://goodreads.com/user/show/24914252-yuriy-stasyuk,5,"I intend to read this book again in a year or two. This is the first book in my life I've said that about. It is a masterpiece that integrates the best research from psychology, neuroscience with evolutionary biology and ties that into ancient philosophy and modern social theory.The most powerful metaphor of the book is the separation of the brain into two parts, the elephant and rider. The elephant represents the subconscious or impulsive patterns of thought, which ""have a mind of their own."" The rider represents the rational and deliberate part of our mind which cannot perfectly control the elephant (our impulses or tendencies), but may only observe and gently nudge it in some direction. These two competing systems largely explain the idiosyncrasies of human nature and the reason why nearly every religion, ancient and modern, has grappled with our dual nature: our conflicting impulsivity and rationality. Here were some other takeaways:	• You can determine happiness by a formula: You have a predefined biological range of moods, and your conditions or voluntary activities can nudge you along your natural scale. Happiness = Baseline + Conditions + Activities. 	• Genetics of mood. Your tendency towards happiness or depression is hardwired and genetic. Some peoples hippocampus may be defective, and a 5 week experiment with Prozac is highly recommended. The other very effective are cognitive behavioral therapy and mindfulness practice.  	• You can subtly motivate others to behave in some way towards you by our hardwired tendency to reciprocate. Gossip is a tool for tracking reciprocity (to determine which people in the tribe are cheaters, and motivate them to correct). 	• While we certainly have plenty of cognitive biases, we are actually pretty okay at judging others, but we are really bad at assessing ourselves. Hundreds of studies have proven this again and again. 	• Money spent to impress others has really bad ROI for happiness. Money to enjoy time with others has a much better happiness ROI. 	• Baby attachment methods persist in adult relationships. If you were an avoidant infant due to your caregiver providing inconsistent emotional responses, you will be an avoidant adult that is afraid to open up to others.  	• Creating a self-story after tragic or traumatic events is correlated with happiness. (For instance, a drug addict after a car accident may come to find religion and use this traumatic experience to create a new positive story leading to a sense of happiness). Being unable to reinvent the narrative in a positive light is linked to depression.  	• Volunteer work is proven in studies to make people happier. 	• Anomie is a sense of normlessness that leads some young people to be alienated and not have structure for virtues or ethics. 	• Maslow's research indicates that existential ""Peak Experiences"" produced by our brains (where a person feels transcendence or ""at one with the universe"" are the root of all religion. 	• There are different systems of ethics in conflict in todays world. The ethics of autonomy which place a preference on individual freedom, creativity, and self-expression vs the ethic of community, which include reverence for shared group identity, community stability, , and shared group identity.  We all have an ""effectance motive,” the need or drive to develop competence through interacting with and controlling one’s environment. This is why self-improvement leads to happiness while sitting on the couch leads to depression. This is why producing real change in the world, though a vocation that you love, is a significant source of happiness."
29,0465028020,http://goodreads.com/user/show/133-arielle,4,"An interesting book from one of my professors at UVA.Quotes I'd like to remember from the book:""Our minds are loose confederations of parts, but we identify with and pay too much attention to one part: conscious verbal thinking. We are like the proverbial drunken man looking for his car keys under the street light. (“Did you drop them here?” asks the cop. “No” says the man, “Idropped them back there in the alley, but the light is better over here.”) Because we can see only one little corner of the mind’s vast operation, we are surprised when urges, wishes, and temptations emerge, seemingly from nowhere. We make pronouncements, vows, and resolutions, and then are surprised by our own powerlessness to carry them out. We sometimes fall into the view that we are fighting with our unconscious, our id, or our animal self. But really we are the whole thing. We are the rider, and we are the elephant. Both have their strengths and special skills.""“Happiness is not something that you can find, acquire, or achieve directly. You have to get the conditions right and then wait. Some of those conditions are within you, such as coherence among the parts and levels of your personality. Other conditions require relationships to things beyond you: Just as plants need sun, water, and good soil to thrive, people need love, work, and a connection to something larger. It is worth striving to get the right relationships between yourself and others, between yourself and your work, and between yourself and something larger than yourself. If you get these relationships right, a sense of purpose and meaning will emerge.” “Work on your strengths, not your weaknesses. How many of your New Year’s resolutions have been about fixing a flaw? And how many of those resolutions have you made several years in a row? It’s difficult to change any aspect of your personality by sheer force of will, and if it is a weakness you choose to work on, you probably won’t enjoy the process. If you don’t find pleasure or reinforcement along the way, then—unless you have the willpower of Ben Franklin—you’ll soon give up. But you don’t really have to be good at everything. Life offers so many chances to use one tool instead of another, and often you can use a strength to get around a weakness.” “With such a vast and wonderful library spread out before us, we often skim books or read just the reviews. We might already have encountered the Greatest Idea, the insight that would have transformed us had we savored it, taken it to heart, and worked it into our lives.” Leo Tolstoy was quoted in the book: “One can live magnificently in this world, if one knows how to work and how to love, to work for the person one loves and to love one’s work.”"

I liked the parts dealing with the issues of ethics and morality best, the ones regarding religion not so much. 3.5 starsFav. Quotes:Threatened self-esteem accounts for a large portion of violence at the individual level, but to really get a mass atrocity going you need idealism— the belief that your violence is a means to a moral end. The major atrocities of the twentieth century were carried out largely either by men who thought they were creating a utopia or else by men who believed they were defending their homeland or tribe from attack. Idealism easily becomes dangerous because it brings with it, almost inevitably, the belief that the ends justify the means. If you are fighting for good or for God, what matters is the outcome, not the path. People have little respect for rules; we respect the moral principles that underlie most rules.If you are in passionate love and want to celebrate your passion, read poetry. If your ardor has calmed and you want to understand your evolving relationship, read psychology. But if you have just ended a relationship and would like to believe you are better off without love, read philosophy."
31,0465028020,http://goodreads.com/user/show/49850369-son-tung,5,"This book expresses an holistic view of happiness, not like many others busy with the job of details (although some are great)This read is a lifetime condensed wisdom of a man on life, backed by well-researched, philosophically-wise interpretation of science, religion, politics... and yeah, profane,mundane part of life. The title of this book and his other famous The Righteous Mind: Why Good People are Divided by Politics and Religion dont do the justice. Obviously for me, what's inside is a surprise gift for thought. Ideas around happiness (including proposed hypothesis):Some contradict my preconceptions, some reinforce, some help to connect, condense scattered thoughts in a systematic, methodical manner. I would spend much of my time from now on to test, contemplate and make adjustment if neccessary to fit my own life:*  Happiness formula  H = S (biological setpoint) + C (condition, inner/outer) + V (voluntary action). - One should not seek happiness within or without, but between. Each person has his/her own unique biological disposition which predetermines happiness scale. Righties (people born with active right prefrontal cortex) often hold back, avoid novelty, less adventurous in nature as opposed to lefties - see experiment with babys. The metaphor ""hedonic treadmill"" does an excellent work describing the fact that brain can calibrate, regulate itself to predetermined setpoint. That's why there are short-lived happy events or post-traumatic growth. - Conditions include internal and external factor. - Voluntary action: Freewill is (not) an illusion after all, huh? There are 3 ways to get out of depression or to loosen up for righties (also applicable for controlling intuition using conscious mind) : meditation, cognitive therapy, Prozac (medicine). I value meditation more, understand better the other two after author's explanation.*  Seeking coherence in life Jonathan Haidt lucidly shows his thoughts on relationship ancient religions, morality within communities and science. Each of them alone hardly fulfill the truth of life, it must be the combination of all elements. - Religion thrives on receptive state of mind associated with the feeling Awe. It provides framework in which Reciprocal or Tit for Tat behavior firmly set - this fact deals with altruism in group when sacrifice is crucial for group's survival (see Group Selection vs Individual Selection in evolution).- Morality is not only about how we treat others, but also about evolutionary emotion of Disgust. That feeling is biological defense mechanism against impurities both in biological and spiritual sense. For biology part, the feeling of disgust help us to avoid disease from animal world, to motivate purifying behavior such as cleansing one's hands and feets, or sometimes vomitting. We dont feel disgust seeing someone with heart disease or kidney failure, but someone with tumor in the face, skin lesion.In the 2nd sense, morality extends itself to gray areas such as: how one should conduct sexual act-orientation, marriage... Liberals often push for ethics of autonomy, while conservatives (religious in general) push for ethics of divinity and community. >The whole religion thing makes sense within religous mind and outsiders should understand the whole system of it. But, morality offered by religion is not neccessarily true in secular world. Thats why there are many philosophical critique of religions' doctrine and thier metaphysical claims. The author did not mention anything about this fact. - Science gave the world limitless wonder. In modern time, flourishing cross-disciplinary work forges bigger and more comprehensive ideas about life. I encounter Maslow many times during classes, but come truly appreciate his work after this book. Maslow envisioned to combine ancient wisdom with scientific approach through his distinguished paramid of human needs. It makes more sense to use this model and interpret how different religions operate across the world. The 3-level model give me a great aid when i try to make sense of the whole world: Physical (with work from biologists, physicists, astronomers...), Psychology (modern psychologist and moral teachers), Socio-Cultural Psychology. Small sections i enjoyed and minus * Guide to find one's meaning, aka what makes you not to suicide, within life. Love and work right is the medicine. Choose companionate love over passionate love. Choose to align oneself with work which give the feeling of flow or serving a greater cause. * Author's attempt to clarify difference between Meaning Of Life and Within Life. I am right now suffer the same existential vacuum like the author did in his senior high school. I hope the author would write another short book or something to elaborate more on his escape out of his philosophical depression.""I finally escaped when, after a week of thinking about suicide (in the abstract, not as a plan), I turned the problem inside out. There is no God and no externally given meaning to life, I thought, so from one perspective it really wouldn’t matter if I killed myself tomorrow. Very well, then everything beyond tomorrow is a gift with no strings and no expectations. There is no test to hand in at the end of life, so there is no way to fail. If this really is all there is, why not embrace it, rather than throw it away? "" >>> How, logic pleassseee ?"

The book had some interesting and useful ideas on positive psychology and the idea of happiness, however eventually concluded that to achieve the happiness hypothesis ‘you have to get the conditions right and then wait’ and that the conditions are internal and external. This is too vague and doesn’t really mean or explain anything about happiness. Although the book had some good parts, the bad parts (such as name dropping or stating random facts with no evidence) far outweigh the better parts of the book."
33,0465028020,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7494007-aaron,4,"I gave up on happiness a long time ago.When I was a young Evangelical Christian, I wrestled with the battle between Mind and Body very often. The Body may have been a temple, but it was a jealous, lazy, and damningly horny temple. The conflict sparked a lot of self-hatred, and I can remember sitting under a breezeway near the high school auditorium remarking that it would be better to be neutered then to have to endure the inner conflict. From Roman 7’s:“For in my inner being I delight in God’s law; but I see another law at work in me, waging war against the law of my mind and making me a prisoner of the law of sin at work within me. What a wretched man I am! Who will rescue me from this body that is subject to death?”Of course, after a few years of psychology classes and Theory of Knowledge, the pain of Christian Dichotomism came crashing down to be replaced by the most beautiful fact: I am a unified whole, the product of nearly four billion years of evolution, and my Body is Mind and my Mind is Body. There is no conflict between the two, for they were designed together towards the same purpose.“The mind commands the body and is instantly obeyed. The mind commands itself and meets resistance.” - St. Augustine; ConfessionsIt turns out that atheistic monism, while it may be technically true, is completely useless in practice. For a super majority of the months of 2019, my Body wanted to sleep and drink. That’s *really* useless, even if it is a bit understandable:In Jacksonville, I was walking a dog almost a year ago from the Jaguars stadium to the Landing. This dog is a super high energy dog, and so, while the entire point of doing this walk was to get him to act low energy for like, an hour, I was still surprised when half way back home he decided to sit and strain against the leash to stay put. He was having none of it. His energy was gone. “Fuck you” Fuck me. I picked him up and carried him home. He liked that. (He did not act low energy for any time period whatsoever, but whatevs).The Body strains against the Mind in the exact same way as that dog strained against me, and Haidt begins the Happiness Hypothesis with a deep dive into figuring out what this approximate dichotomism mean. I can think of a few modern secular descriptions. Tim Ferris has popularized and Westernized “The Monkey Mind” and he calms it by writing in his journal. Jordan Peterson means to treat The Body like an entirely different person that you have to help. Haidt shows us a few historical analogies: Freud and his followers have the vast iceberg* of the id, ego, and superego. The Buddah has the “Horse and The Rider”. What Haidt does is say, “Yeah, a horse is great and all, but a man riding a horse portrays the man waaaaaay too nicely. The man is riding an elephant, because the elephant is the biggest chunk of The Situation and decides what to do most of the time. The Rider and that which is Ridden are not equals; the Rider almost never gets to even steer.”This is a freeing metaphor and it’s a useful metaphor, it immediately gives a high-level prescription on what to do to make our lives better: get the Elephant to behave in ways that are good for it; train it into happiness. The rest of the book is more or less organized on that principle (though this isn’t really mentioned in the book, which thinks of itself as “10 principles” but I’ll get to that):Happiness can be thought of the alignment of an ever greater expanding circle, starting from the individual Rider and their Elephant to the edges of the Universe. Think of it as an additional dimension to Maslow’s Hierarchy of Needs, but instead many circles.Haidt walks us through them: Once the Rider/Elephant pair align, the Elephant needs to be deconditioned from its default Risk Aversion and the depression, rage and fear that come along with it. As the two parts of the self are less at cross-purposes, Relationships make up the next circle. Three relationships literally matter the most in a person’s life: the two with their parents and the one one has with their significant other. Pick spouses wisely.Haidt points to Harlow’s poor baby monkey study to back up his assertions about our attachment systems, and rightly points out that ancient philosophies mostly get “Love” wrong. He calls upon modern neuroscience to give some more timely advice: When finding a partner, Romance, Lust, and Companionship need to be given their time and place and balanced. Haidt points out a danger period in relationships between 1-3 years in when “Romance” collapses before “Companionship” builds up enough to take its place. Navigating this correctly or incorrectly has implications for both lost happiness and lasting pain.Tending to the next circle of relationships requires us to understand how the Elephant is a half-evolved bee: we are a social animal, and have huge mental machinery dedicated to navigating complex social arrangements (For example, one family of four has 6 relationships to keep track of, two families of four meeting for Christmas dinner have 28 relationships to keep track of, four families of four have 120 relationships, etc). The Social Elephant works off two principles- Reciprocity and Reputation Guarding. The first is fairly obvious- social animals work better when they’re cooperating, and to cooperate they need to perform reciprocal behavior (grooming each other, sharing meat, sex [if you’re a bonobo], etc). To keep from being cheated, we build out a map of trust with everybody we interact with, and then we also download the map everybody else has of everybody else. This makes up a person’s Reputation. The problem arises when we actually do fail others and lose their trust: we build stories and tell moral fables to say, “Well, aksually, I’m in the right.” This is post-hoc rationalization, or as they say, “Hamstering”. This is an attempt to guard our Reputation, but what we’re ultimately doing is having the Elephant go into Panic Mode. The Elephant in Panic Mode means an Elephant telling the Rider what to do instead of the other way around. This is bad.Reputation Guarding comes from a good place- we want to preserve the trust we have- but left unchecked it ultimately leads to losing the ability to trust ourselves.Continue scaling up the number of relationships, and Reciprocity and Reputation Guarding morph into something else: Identity and Morality. The number of relationships, and therefore the number of reciprocal interactions scales as a square (If you used one neuron for every relationship, then keeping track of every relationship at a school the size of UF would require using 1% of your brain just to identify those relationships).Identifying as a part of a group lets you borrow the Reputation of that group, and therefore cooperate with people as a part of the umbrella of that identity. That means groups put constraints on those members to protect their collective Reputation. This constraint ultimately becomes Morality. We’re hardwired to build Identity like this, just as we’re hardwired to find a mate and protect our reputation, so leaning into it is good. Becoming an exemplary member of our groups is an innate drive.Ultimately, Morality, Identity, and Hierarchy blend together at the highest scale to form the dimension of Divinity. Just as we a stricken by adulation of those amongst us who achieve great moral behavior or who are super high status, that same machinery is activated by mountains, oceans, and stars. We naturally imbue the universe with moral purpose**. The Religious Right have a script for this- they have God. The Secular among us have to build out the story for ourselves*, but it is possible to build. When aligned at this outer level, “happiness” might not arise, but you get the next best thing: a shot at meaning.To recap:Are you aligned within yourself? Have you trained your Elephant to want to do what you want to do? Is the Elephant content or trusting that you will satisfy its needs? Is the Elephant (possibly chemically) depressed?Are you aligned with your spouse? Does your Elephant and her Elephant get along? (Imagine introducing two dogs if you need to, what do they do?) Do you guys agree on high level plans regarding kids, finances, and identity?Are you aligned with your closest social groups? Do you *have* close social groups? Do you have an identity you can draw upon to represent yourself? To make yourself not bored and not be boring?Are you aligned with a broader community? Do you have a place to volunteer? To donate? To perform acts of kindness? Are you aligned with Universe? Do you know your place in it or a plan to find your place in it? Do you have a Mission?Uh, answering these questions probably won’t make you happy but it’ll get you closer to whatever it even means to be happy. As I commented above, the structure I’ve just described it not entirely adapted by Haidt’s book. He presents it as actually *testing* different Happiness Hypotheses, like the “Virtue Hypothesis” or the “Stoicism/Buddhism Hypothesis” or the “Consumerist Hypothesis.” This is great and fine (they’re all wrong) except for the fact that he isn’t just describing the relevant psychology and giving thumbs up/down on the hypotheses, but actively trying to create a prescriptive hypothesis. It isn’t a self-help book, but, come on man! it’s got “Happiness” in the title and it tells the reader to take Prozac!This is a quibble about the structure and presentation, but the content of the book is solid except for the problem of “Are all psychology studies before 2016 fucked?” The book is a teenager as of this year, and draws on many studies from before 2006, which means that some of which may have been destroyed by the replication crisis. There is a certain haze that surrounds some of the more surreal findings and that means a lot of references have to pass the “Aaron’s Mom’s BS detector test”***When the content is good though, the content is good!Haidt’s book is overall great, and his prescriptivist hypothesis that a balance between Materialist Striving and Stoic Buddhism will bring about the most happiness is well-argued. He doesn’t fully synthesize a hybrid theory, but he definitely points an arrow in that direction. *It occurs to me that the iceberg metaphor is no longer appropriate from a “politically considerate stand point” given the Warming of Our Times**I’ve discussed the unnerving meta-apathy of black holes once or twice. If I lived in a state or society or generation that didn’t present as an apathetic machine, would it be harder to project apathy onto a celestial devourer. ?***If I told my mom about this study, would she say “hmm, okay, whatever” or “why did they need a study on this? duh” (The first is the failed state)"

Or, since Happiness Hypothesis predates 12 Rules by a decade or so, more correctly like Happiness Hypothesis is a musty old dad, who keeps quoting classic psychology experiments again and again, and 12 Rules is a rebellious teenager son of who takes a turn to alt-right in order to shock his liberal parents.Happiness Hypothesis embarks on a mission to find some Great Truths that keep coming up in different religions and philosophies around the globe (well, mostly Asia and Europe: there's not many references to Native American or African religions or traditions) and combine those with what we've learned from social psychology. So far, so good.And there's lots of good stuff. Unfortunately this also feels like a practice work for The Righteous Mind: Why Good People Are Divided by Politics and Religion. Haidt uses lots of same materials for both books (""the rider and the elephant"" metaphor, the ""90% chimp, 10% bee"" metaphor, even the notion that marching together can create a sense of becoming one with something greater than yourself!), so if you've read The Righteous Mind, this book will not give you any great insights. (And if you haven't read TRM, do yourself a favour and read it as soon as you can! It's great!)And the psychology... well, for the most part Haidt references the good old classics of the field, like ""the wire mother and the cloth mother"" monkey study. Good stuff, but if you're even half-familiar with social psychology, you've heard about all these studies dozens of times. And when he references newer works, it's a bit painful. This book was written before the replication crisis really became apparent, so Haidt is enthusiastic about e.g. priming studies, but we now know those studies didn't replicate and are pretty much worthless. So, I'm not completely sure how to rate this book. If I hadn't read so much psychology and soc psych already, and if I hadn't read The Righteous Mind already, I would probably be raving how much I love this book and how it blew my mind and completely changed the way I see the world. But... I have read those books. My mind is pre-blown. Now it was mainly repeating the same old, with some new nuggets of good stuff. Repetition is the mother of all learning, so I'm not sorry I read this, but at this point of my reading life this was not as great as it could've been.Recommended as a graduating present for your smart niece/nephew - although they'd be even better off with a copy of The Righteous Mind."

Not definitional, not symbolism, but basically ""what do I need to know to understand the meaning of life""(like using the journey metaphor, one in which we don't know the beginning and the end. It's true what). So what kind of answer do I really expect? Apparently something enlightening. What is something enlightening about life? THE TELO.But the purpose of life (as an object) doesn't really matter for us as an observer, because we think of life subjectively - it's our life. So whether it's randomness (which I'm inclined to after knowing about quantum physics, plus the fact that I'm atheist) or by a Creator doesn't matter. What's the purpose WITHIN life? What kind of creature I am, and what do I do? Where I am heading?I may not need to be able to verbalize the purpose of my life, but once cross coherence has been achieved from within (personality) and without (condition like love, work and connection to something greater). 	- Love what you do like you are doing something for the one you love. Labor of Love. We need to create something. 	- Why Progress Principle: because effectance need is not a deficit need like hunger or love so it's always present - and we have to satisfy it always. Academics is definitely one promising career option because I can easily structure more challenges.  	- How to motivate people? Small changes to make them more positive first, and then we can talk about the grandeur scheme of thing. Think about the janitor: he feels that his work is contributing to something beyond himself. His job has become more of a calling (job -> career -> calling but job -> calling here) because he has some occupational self-direction so that he can structure challenges to satisfy his effectance need --> make sense for the 3 values of Truth (something beyond self - the greater ideal), Service (beyond self, love and connection) and Challenge (effectance need) by Scott Young.	- Then my vision of society should still be ""more confident, compassionate and critical. DON’T YOU SEE THE LINK? Serenity prayer. Change the thing I can, accept the thing I can't, and see the difference. STARTING TO SEE MY LIFE FITTING IN A GREATER NARRATIVE. Enlightenment isn't too far away huh.  My own cross level coherence: Physical comfort of being care for. A caring community. So I definitely focus on caring and helping others. There's indeed something bigger than the self - the group. Interlocking genetic and cultural evolution. Reproduction of culture is when new ideas are adopted, which is obviously accelerated when borders among us are greatly diminished. "

Personally, it made me feel humbled and dignified at the same time... Constricted and freed. We humans are such complex creatures, brilliant but so imperfect, each of us less a singular focused consciousness and more a ""committee"" of drives which sometimes work incredibly well together but often clash epically. We are jumbles of evolutionary developments, some old and refined and some new and generations away from maturity... Our conscious minds are among the newer, more fragile developments while our subconscious / automatic minds are ancient elephants profoundly more powerful. We can find harmony with our elephants, but it takes serious work.The result of our complexity is often dissonance. But like, awesome, Sondheim-style dissonance. It is our nature to face constant internal conflict, but we get to face it at the intellectual and emotional peaks of evolution (that we know of) up to this point in the world's history. And from this great struggle, we produce inspiring inventions, art, connections, lives... So, ch. 1 has me feeling more appreciation for my messy existence and more appreciation for all that I do in spite of and because of it.The rest of the book is full of helpful, sometimes essential, info and conclusions on the human experience that I'm very glad to have read. Ultimately, it gets a 3.5 from me because it sometimes felt tangential and several of the conclusions felt subjective when they seemed to be presented as objective. "

I couldn't stop annoying people and saying, ""Oh, in my happiness book, I learned that..."" blah blah blah. But, man, so much awesome stuff, like why jealousy evolved (to keep the men around to help feed the mama and that baby with the big head). And one's default disposition is largely inherited from one's folks (the cortical lottery, yo!), and there's not a whole lot you can do about it. And this one... if there are two dudes with roughly the same default disposition, and one of them wins the lottery and the other becomes paralyzed, well, a year after the event, they will be pretty much as happy as they were before the lottery and paralysis. We just regress to our default disposition; those big-time ups and downs don't last. We just get used to things.

I learned a lot about myself, but more about society in general. I think that all leaders, managers, marketing professionals and, most important of all, people interested in understanding themselves and society should read this book.I love the elephant - rider metaphor and I am constantly reminding myself to ""be the rider"" and to be aware of ""the elephant"" when I am making decisions.

The books are distinctly different from one another, but there is still a decent amount of overlap in information. I view this book as a science based self help book. It is very informative and much of what I read, I didn't previously know. The book is filled with science-based advice on how to be happier, but in a practical way that acknowledges the limits of human willpower. The writing itself wasn't as concise as ""The Righteous Mind"" which I thought had better flow. I would recommend this book to anyone who likes self help books, psychology, or philosophy. I give it four stars because it's really good, but it did drag at parts."

41,0465028020,http://goodreads.com/user/show/929592-jon,5,"I can't recommend this book and it's successor The Righteous Mind: Why Good People are Divided by Politics and Religion highly enough. I read them in reverse order, and I imagine you will think whichever you read first is the better one. The second depends on much of the same research that informs the first, developing thoroughly ideas only hinted at in the earlier book. There is a fair amount of repetition; but for me that was a good thing. When you're not familiar with a discipline, repetition doesn't hurt. Haidt is astonishingly good at writing clearly about complex ideas, with memorable examples and frequent self-deprecating humor: ""When I first began to study morality as a philosophy major in college, my father said, 'Why aren't you studying religion too? How could people have morality without God?' As a young atheist with a strong sense of morality (well over the border into self-righteousness), I was insulted by my father's suggestion."" He begins Chapter 3 of the second book with ""On February 3, 2007, shortly before lunch, I discovered that I was a chronic liar...I lied so quickly and convincingly that my wife and I both believed me."" He is amazingly good and vivid in his discussion of ritual. I will be forever grateful to this book for crystallizing for me why I am so annoyed by recent changes in ritual at the church I've been going to for thirty years. "
42,0465028020,http://goodreads.com/user/show/51467437-donna-craig,4,"I need to state that the only reason I read this book is that I got a recommendation to read the author’s next book, The Righteous Mind. So I listened to this one first to help me understand the next. I learned some valuable stuff here: the happiness formula, what it Involves, and the idea that it is best found in a balance between conservative and liberal ideals. I think at some time we’ve all known that, but in the USA we are so angry and so polarized that we’ve decided to ignore reality. And reason. This book wasn’t political or pushing any viewpoint. It was just trying to tell people how they can increase their happiness. I enjoyed this book and definitely recommend it. "
43,0465028020,http://goodreads.com/user/show/100704296-matt-mclain,2,"Loved his chapters on disgust and on work. Those will definitely shape my perspective moving forward. It’s possible that disgust is just a physical reaction- does not necessarily make that thing moral or immoral, however. Also, do a job you believe in. I never quite matched up with the author on the thinking that we are all just kind of making up our own meaning and building communities to create meaning. I also disagreed with his chapters on altruism and morality but I did like how he showed the similarities between different religions on common topics."

50,0465028020,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5978539-lena-tumasyan,4,"I picked up this book for a book club. I read it in hardcover, from the library. I liked this book, but it did take a while to read. It was more scientific then I thought it would be. It was actually very interesting bc of the research and studies that were used, and that is one of the things I appreciated the most. That the information wasn't just opinion, it was BACKED-UP by science. I also liked that the author himself performed some of the studies in the book. It shows that he really cares about the subject.There is a lot of REALLY GOOD USEFUL information in this book. I really recommend it to EVERYONE. I think you can learn a lot about love, work, pleasure, children, communities, and many other parts of life. I think the book also reaffirms many of the things we already ""know"" but don't ""practice."" For example, working LESS is better for you then making MORE money. Did you know that introverted people actually have better HEALTH by being around EXTROVERTED people? They have less illness, colds, etc, than if they keep to themselves. Did you know that patients in hospitals get better twice as fast if they feel they have some CONTROL over their physical environment? Did you know that if you live in an apartment next to a busy intersection YOUR HEALTH could suffer, and you'll be living with higher levels of cortisol and other hormones, that will affect you even if you think ""you've gotten used to it.""Lots and lots of GREAT information.There were a few reasons I didn't give it a full 5 stars.One is because the book is a bit of a misnomer. It doesn't TEST happiness as a hypothesis, or how to find it or where it comes from. I thought this book would be more of an exploration of why SOME people are happier then others and why happiness is so vital. It's also not about modern truths VS ancient wisdom like the subtitle suggestions. Yes, some quotes are mentioned here from writers and philosophers, but that's NOT the main point. Instead it's more of ""how to live a BETTER life."" It really should have been called ""The Good Life - and how to get there."" A good Life is often a HAPPY life, but not always.It's also a bit slow going due to a lot of the research. Worthwhile, but still takes some energy and concentration to push through.I really wouldn't make any changes to this book expect maybe the title. I would ADD one more chapter about how to connect all these concepts and ideas presented in the previous chapters. Also, the chapter on work felt a bit rushed. All in all very interested and highly recommend to anyone out there."
51,0465028020,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3809399-stormin,4,"I liked this book a lot, but it was not as mindblowing as Jonathan Haidt's better known The Righteous Mind. I read Righteous Mind first, but in a couple of places he referred back to Happiness Hypothesis, so I wanted to read it too. The book did not disappoint. The one important concept that Haidt spends more time on in HH than in RM is the idea that we (human beings) have divided minds. His central metaphor (which he references in RM but explains in more detail in HH) is that we are like riders (that's our conscious, rational mind) sitting atop elephants (that's our unconscious, intuitive mind). We think of ourselves as the rider, but it's actually the elephant who makes most of the decisions. Most of the other really interesting concepts (for me, at least) like the idea that religion is a mechanism for allowing group-level selection in human beings are mentioned in HH, but only really explored in RM. There are some things in HH that are worth reading, however, and it's a quicker and easier read. The actual main topic are a variety of Big Ideas from ancient philosophers revisited with findings from modern psychology. Haidt spends time, for example, analyzing the Eastern notion that we can find joy / happiness / enlightenment by abandoning our attachment to the outside world. His finding is that there's some truth to this, but that it goes too far. A lot of the things that we set our mind and heart upon don't really matter. Our elephant is evolved to pursue social status, not happiness, and this leads to a lot of people spending a lot of energy competing in zero-sum social status games that breed discontent and exhaustion. In these cases: attachment is a millstone around our necks. But there are some things in life external to ourselves that do matter. Foremost among those are love (our relationships with other people) and work (our engagement in effortful activity that we can do well and that matters to us). Trying to sever attachments from these things will not make us happy.That's an example of the kind of insight in this book, and I definitely found the ideas interesting, compelling, and quite possibly useful in my own life. But not as exciting as RM."
52,0465028020,http://goodreads.com/user/show/20794945-yin-pang,4,"Before I start reviewing this book I want to mention that I started reading it back in August or something. My concentration was super challenged from the beginning because of outside sources, so there's a lot from this book I can't specifically recall. It's not because it's a boring book at all! It's actually a super interesting and mind opening one and the writing isn't too heavy for a non-fiction book. I really love Haidt's outlook on how to achieve happiness and deal with the stress of an existential crisis. Of why humans see life so differently and why some people feel more happy and complete than others. Maybe I'm just not a super opinionated person by nature but there really wasn't much that I disagreed with or felt was lacking in The Happiness Hypothesis. I pretty much felt like everything made sense in this book. I could follow his way of thinking and I could recognize a lot of things mentioned. It also felt like Haidt really thought a lot of things through when he put this together which I love.Like Haidt mentions at the end of the book, it will only be important if the reader is as interested in the content and debate as the author is. And I was really, really interested so I really enjoyed despite my super slow reading process. Every time I returned to it I questioned why it's been taking be so long to finish it because I really did enjoy it. I honestly do feel like the whole idea of life and happiness became ten times less complicated after reading this. But it's also definitely a re-read in maybe a year or two so I can absorb and remember more. Possibly give it a full five star rating. Much recommended."
53,0465028020,http://goodreads.com/user/show/32753876-ben-lavender,4,"It's definitely a self-help book, but the suggestions are all largely backed by science instead of feel-good bullshit. Nice.A good example is the usual trope about ""money doesn't buy happiness"", tried and true territory for self-help books/articles/blog posts. Rather than just say it, he points to studies, then, crucially, *points to exceptions*: you'll be happier with enough money to reduce your commute or live somewhere with less noise. He also discusses how meditation for 30 minutes a day for 6 weeks has identifiable medical benefits compared to ""happy"" people, and talks about the specific reasons why.He has a good metaphor throughout the book about an elephant and a rider, and how the rider exists largely to rationalize the actions of the elephant as good or excusable. It's hard to talk about bias in a way that you can identify in your own life, but this was a helpful metaphor for me. I can see the elephant now, sometimes.The book hasn't helped me reach any goals, but then, I haven't meditated yet, either, which is allegedly one of the most powerful things we can do towards controlling the elephant. Overall, pretty good stuff. But the last chapter is basically a feel-good story about how much he liked his sweet trip to india. It's not very actionable, provides no real insight, doesn't cite any sources, is prescriptive about spirituality, and is much more like a traditional self-help book. Skip it."

Haidt manages to merge philosophy, psychology, sociology, and religious studies to present an irresistibly fascinating work of - for lack of a better term - philosophy, as it was understood in the ancient times. It's an incredible guide on how to live a happy life, and to do that, he marshalls everything from Socrates, the Bible, the Romans, the Chinese to Shakespeare, Nietzsche, Durkheim, and contemporary positive psychology to name but a few. The breadth and depth of his knowledge can be tritely billed ""encyclopedic,"" or in Michel Foucault's words, ""relentless erudition."" The array of references is simply impressive. The book reminded me of Pierre Hadot's excellent book, Philosophy as a Way of Life: Spiritual Exercises from Scorates to Foucault, whose thesis is that philosophy was understood by the ancients to provide guidance in one's life, and not jargon-filled texts on the minutest aspects of language or logic to quibble over.In that sense, this book is a real work of philosophy. Moreover, the book is effortlessly readable and engaging. If you'd like to learn the best of what modern psychology has to offer, read this and let it remove scales from your eyes.An awesome book."

And the answers reflect a well crafted mix of science (mainly psychology with some social theory thrown in), illustrative narrative, and historical context. In the opening, Haidt sets forth a puzzle -- what creates happiness? -- and then explores it layer by layer, illuminating human needs and tendencies that psychologists have deciphered through experiments. Haidt tells interesting stories surrounding the experiments, and relates the findings to familiar aspects of daily life, relationships, life traumas, and religious experiences.Along with scientific expertise and expressive clarity, Haidt models admirable respect for perspectives that don't square with his leanings -- which are atheistic and mildly liberal. He's never preachy or abstruse, but always down-to-earth and engaging. In juxtaposing ancient wisdom (including religious principles) with contemporary scientific knowledge, he betrays imperfect understandings of the former -- but his insights are thought-provoking in any case, and worth chewing on."
56,0465028020,http://goodreads.com/user/show/541654-jared,4,"Fabulous insights into the causes and parts of happiness. I read it because I'm trying to figure out why I'm so happy. The author's contention, based on a whole lot of reach into positive psychology, sums up to three parts: happiness is composed of 1. a biological happiness ""set point,"" 2. environmental factors, and 3. practices that lead to happiness.The biological set point isn't something you can do much about. It's kind of the fundamental level of happiness that you return to after brief stints of higher or lower happiness. This makes up about 50% of your happiness. You can't always do much about environmental factors, either, and he doesn't spend a lot of time talking about them, but they also have surprisingly little to do with how happy you are. The good news is that some 40-ish percent of happiness is based on things you can control.Over the last 50 years or so, a lot of research has gone into what makes people happy. The author does a good job of summarizing the research, and provides lots of specific references to notable studies. He doesn't provide a lot of anecdotes, though, to illustrate the principles he outlines, which would have made his points more memorable. A better example of how to make the topic both accessible and memorable is the documentary, ""Happy."""
57,0465028020,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4746801-nancy,5,"The Happiness Hypothesis is a synthesis of information from positive psychology, social psychology, philosophy, biology and religion to explore what is most likely to make individuals lead satisfying, happy lives. Although the author makes it clear that he is an atheist, he should be given credit for his recognition of the strengths offered to individuals and communities by religion and his respectful treatment of the subject of religion. This could have been a very dry book. The author consistently and effectively uses the analogy that humans are like an undisciplined and strong-willed elephant with a rational rider to explain theories and observations about human behavior. This non-technical analogy lends to easy comprehension of his points and lightens what might otherwise be an overly intellectual flavor of the book. Despite the title, this is not really a self-help manual for those seeking happiness. If you are seeking a deeper understanding of humans and happiness and willing to deal with a lot of different information, however, this book will offer you great satisfaction. And it might allow you some insight into attitudes and behaviors you could modify to move yourself several notches closer to ""happiness."""
58,0465028020,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5237420-ana,4,"Haidt seems to be a voice always worth listening to. His other book I've read, ""The Righteous Mind"" has introduced me to his flowing writing style and his ability to condense complicated ideas into simple sentence packages. This one right here will help you if you're struggling with trying to define what ""happiness"" is, whether true personal satisfaction is ever in reach and whether our own brains allow happiness to be a possibility. Coming from a background of social psychology, Haidt uses both hard science and historical knowledge to weave together a book that seems to be very important to our modern society. I recommend it. "

What makes a person happy?This is a medium-weight book that remains balanced by combining religious and philosophical ideas with the neuroscience and biology of the captain of all our lives - the brain. (See Swab's We our are Brain.The chapters tackle different viewpoints and provides viewpoints on what makes an individual and collection of individuals happy - or happier.The author likens the brain as consisting of two parts, a driver and an elephant, which is depicted on the book's cover. The elephant can be said to be more id and requires control, hence the driver (see also Kahneman's Thinking Fast and Slow). A better driver, or controller, of the elephant, the better a person is positioned to steer away from the negative affects of the elephant always pursuing what it wants without consequence, such as instant gratification.It's a good an interesting read and, I felt, fair in the concepts it presents.How do you want to be? Perhaps reading this will help with answering that question."
60,0465028020,http://goodreads.com/user/show/37839735-mason-frierson,5,"“Where does happiness come from? There are several different “happiness hypotheses.” One is that happiness comes from getting what you want, but we all know (and research confirms) that such happiness is short-lived. A more promising hypothesis is that happiness comes from within and cannot be obtained by making the world conform to your desires. This idea was widespread in the ancient world: Buddha in India and the Stoic philosophers in ancient Greece and Rome all counseled people to break their emotional attachments to people and events, which are always unpredictable and uncontrollable, and to cultivate instead an attitude of acceptance. This ancient idea deserves respect, and it is certainly true that changing your mind is usually a more effective response to frustration than is changing the world. However, I will present evidence that this second version of the happiness hypothesis is wrong. Recent research shows that there are some things worth striving for; there are some external conditions of life that can make you lastingly happier. One of these conditions is relatedness—the bonds we form, and need to form, with others. I’ll present research showing where love comes from, why passionate love always cools, and what kind of love is “true” love. I’ll suggest that the happiness hypothesis offered by Buddha and the Stoics should be amended: Happiness comes from within, and happiness comes from without. We need the guidance of both ancient wisdom and modern science to get the balance right.”~ Jonathan Haidt from The Happiness HypothesisI came to this book from Haidt’s wonderful study, THE RIGHTEOUS MIND, which I highly recommend. Given the subject, this book is a bit more diffuse and a little less certain in its conclusions but it is still a wonderful read and an insightful study. It is also a ‘big’ book, i.e. a book that tackles an extremely important subject.I would note, first and foremost, that this is a scholarly book accessible to a wide audience. The writing is lucid and straightforward, jargon-free and not disrupted by endless annotation, charts, graphs and statistics. Most important, perhaps, is its attempt to bring together both psychological science and the humanities. On one page you might receive a report of a study in neuroscience utilizing fMRI technology, on the next the thoughts of Epictetus or Epicurus. While it has often been said that Freud learned as much from literature as from science, that pattern of investigation is now very rare. The ‘psychological sciences’ are now very distinct from the humanities and their work is heavily-funded, empirical science. They associate themselves with the biomedical sciences far more than with the departments of Philosophy or, e.g., Religious Studies. Nevertheless, the literature of reason, wisdom and faith has much to say of, e.g., human happiness and it is to JH’s considerable credit that he measures that literature against the (always tentative) conclusions of modern psychological science. Is Plato’s sense of the divided self a good metaphor for human nature and behavior? Is it true that what doesn’t kill us makes us stronger, as Nietzsche argued? How should we look at Emerson’s transcendentalism in light of the common human desire for such experience?Given the fact that the subject is so vast—the nature of man, the nature of man’s quest for happiness, the very nature of ‘happiness’ and the strategies for achieving it—the conclusions are complex. Nevertheless, they can be summarized briefly.As in THE RIGHTEOUS MIND, JH adopts a Humean model in which the Reason is, ultimately, the slave of the passions. Our lives consist of a multiplicity of experiences that rumble about in our consciousness and direct our ‘automatic’ responses to concrete situations. Joshua Reynolds talked about this phenomenon under the rubric of ‘intuition’. Intuition is not a simple, largely-unwarranted gut reaction; it is the sum total of millions of experiences summoned instantly to respond to a current situation. I am standing beside a highway or a city street. Cars are passing by at various rates of speed. I want to get to the other side of the street, quickly, efficiently and safely. I make instant mental calculations and act . . . . Reason, on the other hand, is something that we utilize when we are pressed to find an argument for an intellectual position. It is, in part, a rhetorical device: how can I outwit and defeat my opponent in the most clever and efficacious fashion? JH takes these phenomena and constructs the ongoing metaphor of a man riding an elephant. The elephant is the sum total of the work of the ‘passions’. He is experience, intuitions, inclinations, and so on. The rider is the Reason. He attempts to control the elephant but that process is complex and sometimes arduous. As we are, in a sense, ‘divided’, so is our world and our experience. So are our bodies. The trick is to put all of this together (with a little luck; being in the right place at the right time helps immeasurably). Here is JH’s conclusion:“We were shaped by individual selection to be selfish creatures who struggle for resources, pleasure, and prestige, and we were shaped by group selection to be hive creatures who need love and attachments, and we are industrious creatures with needs for effectance, able to enter a state of vital engagement with our work. We are the rider and we are the elephant, and our mental health depends on the two working together, each drawing on the others’ strengths. . . . . Happiness is not something that you can find, acquire, or achieve directly. You have to get the conditions right and then wait. . . . Just as plants need sun, water, and good soil to thrive, people need love, work, and a connection to something larger. It is worth striving to get the right relationships between yourself and others, between yourself and your work, and between yourself and something larger than yourself” (pp. 238-39).Bottom line: a lovely book that all should read, absorb and enjoy."

A little too wordy, especially at first, Haidt cites studies and the research of others to back up his ideas. Most of Haidt's hypothesis rang true to me as I listened to his explanations, although some ideas seem counter intuitive at first. Overall interesting and worth reading! If you are in the depths of depression, this book may not be your lifesaver. However if you ponder the concepts listed, you may be able to make adjustments in your behavior that will make life better for you and those around you. I would strongly recommend reading this book with the thought of how you can change your behavior in such a way that will make life better for others--not just yourself."

The book uses various aphorisms and insights from a variety of ancient traditions such as Buddhism, Stoicism, and Christianity as a framing device to discuss various insights in modern research psychology. As a more skeptical soul I was put off by the feel-good, soft-New Agey title, but I'm glad I overcame my bias and gave the book a spin. Highly recommended. "

But of the ""joy"" that comes from religious faith, moral goodness, and even ""testimony of the truth of the gospel, as manifested by the Holy Ghost,"" he has no knowledge, and even puts down people of faith.

72,0465028020,http://goodreads.com/user/show/33599214-suha,5,"This books is a beautiful smooth read that teaches you about 10 great ideas of how ancient teachings would be used to our favor in modern psychology. A bit simplistic, however it is still rich and full of helpful information. The author’s humble tone drives you to listen and trust his words; I loved it, especially the part about divinity and our need for spirituality. Here is the summary if you’d like to know more:About the author:Jonathan Haidt is a social psychologist, he is 52 years old and he is a specialist in emotions and morality. He wrote 2 books: This one ""The Happiness Hypothesis"" and the ""The Righteous Mind: Why Good People are divided by Politics"".Haidt was named one of the top world thinkers by foreign policy and prospect magazine.He wrote this book in 2006, and he describes it as it is about 10 great ideas discovered through civilizations which we can apply in our modern life.Outline:The 10 ideas were:1- The divided Self2- Changing your mind3- Reciprocity with Vengeance4- The Faults of others5- The Pursuit of Happiness6- Love & Attachment7- The Uses of Adversity8- The Felicity of Virtue9- Divinity with or without God10- Happiness comes fromChapter 1: The Divided SelfIn this chapter Haidt speaks about mind versus emotion saying that human thinking depends on metaphor~ speaking that Buddha, Freud and Plato each compared human thinking to an animal ~ elephant and horses. In our days, cars replaced elephants and horses so technology gave people more control over their physical worlds. As a result, when people looked for metaphors, they saw the mind as the driver of the car or a program running on a computer. But if that really was how human dealt with things, why do we keep on doing stupid stuff, why we sometimes do the same damn mistake if we know that we have willpower? Why do people keep on procrastinating while they know what exactly the plan to do things?So here Haidt criticized modern theories of rational choice and he believes that older metaphors work way more beautifully. He utilizes in his entire book a metaphor that I found amazing comparing the human as a rider of an elephant ~ the mind is the rider and the elephant is the emotion. If the elephant is happy and satisfied he will gladly obey your rules and be guided, however, if the elephant wants something there is no power that the rider has can stop him. And this is what Haidt meant by the divided self. The elephant represents temptations, weaknesses and internal conflicts.So why do we have this divided self:a- Mind vs Body: we have an automatic nervous system, like an administrative system that does not need thinking to act.b- Left Vs Right: our brains are split into 2 hemispheres joined by the corpus collusum that are specialized in different tasks - left is for language processing & analytics and right is for patterns in space - with experimenting the 2 hemispheres by Gazzinga a famous psychologist of split brain, he discovered that people fabricate reasons to explain their own behavior- a famous process that he called ""confabulation"" which in one experiment he showed the patient the word ""walk"" so the patient got up and walked and when the psychologist asked him why, he said to get a coke.c- New vs Old: originally the brain had 3 clumps of neurons connected to the spine. Overtime as we evolved the brain expanded more and we developed the neocortex which is the gray matter of the human brain. So we originally were animals governed by primitive emotions and drives until we developed the divine gift of reason of the neocortex. And experiments finding is that human rationality works so well only because our emotional brain works so well.d- Controlled Vs Automatic: so we have 2 systems the controlled vs automatic. Mental processes are mostly automatic without attention consciously ~ walking driving eating ~ The controlled process is limited we can only think consciously about one thing at a time but automatic processes happen in parallel.The automatic system has the dopamine in its hands while the controlled system is more like an advisor. The rider is the control and the elephant is the automatic.When we see a painting and we immediately like it and when someone asks us why we tend not to know how to answer the question with reason. The controlled system can never beat the automatic system by willpower alone. Chapter 2: Changing your mindHaidt proceeds in these 2 chapters showing us how weird our minds are.He says that we have a ""Like-o-Meter"" in which everything we see had to be ranked like or dislike and it is always running even if we are not aware. Experiments reveal, that whenever you see someone with the same name, you suddenly create a bias without you knowing it. And People are more likely to marry people whose names sound like their own. Moreover, humans have negativity bias, which is in our understanding, bad is stronger than good, Responses to threats and unpleasantness are far stronger than responses to opportunities and pleasures. The human mind reacts to bad things more quickly and persistently. The elephant reacts before the rider out of survival, when the elephant sees a snake he runs away whether you like it or not. Haidt speaks about the terminology of ""Cortical Lottery"" :this is the basic nature we are born with. Our frontal cortex has left and right side ~ research says if you have more active left side you are lucky and happy by nature:- Always willing to try something new- If you see a chance you go ahead and take it- When good things happen to you it affects you greatlyHowever if your right side is more active: - You worry about making mistakes  - Criticism hurts you- You feel worried when you do poorly at something- You have many fearsThe author believes that there are 3 ways to change this reality of lottery: 1- Meditation 2- Cognitive Therapy and 3 - ProzacHaidt speaks highly of meditation and he describes it as a pill with no side effects and it tames your elephant. On the other hand, cognitive therapy which is founded in the 60s, is the way to correct erroneous thoughts about yourself called cognitive. Finally, Prozac ~ I loved the humbleness of the author as he describes his own experience with a similar drug. He described it as wonderful, it was like magic he said and his life was amazing however he found it difficult to remember names and facts and that was bad for him in his career. Prozac raises the level of serotonin and makes the neurons adapt to new transmission amd raises the level of the neural growth hormone. The sad news that it is a short cut and it changes personality ~ psychologists call it ""cosmetic psychopharmacology"". Haidt thinks it is overprescribed. He summed up the chapter by mentioning that all these ways should be publicized and can be used by the ones with unlucky frontal cortex. Chapter 3: Reciprocity by VengeanceHaidt here also explores human behavior as we by evolution needed to win by surviving our genes, and gossiping and reciprocating were both results of evolution. Gossiping was an essential facet of human evolution and called ""emotional toolkit"" as without it we’d live in chaos and it is by gossip we make sure that what goes around comes around. Gossip is paired with reciprocity which is the karma working here on earth. Reciprocity is so amazing that sales people who are trying to sell you something give you first a gift. When you receive something for free, part of you might be pleased but another part want to give something in return. This is not limited to material things, but also to stories, if someone tells you a romantic story about his past life, you would feel pressured to do the same. Haidt calls reciprocity a relationship tonic. If used properly it strengthens social ties. For ex when we are interacting with someone we like we have tendency to copy their movesChapter 4: The faults of othersHaidt starts his chapter by saying that we are all hypocrites but we only believe that we are not. We are naive and we have myths of pure evil. There was this experiment that resulted in: people who think are moral are in fact more likely to do the right thing but when the result is against them, they find a way to ignore it and follow their self-interest. This is called ""Moral Hypocrisy"". Curing hypocrisy is very hard because we don’t see there is a problem. Haidt reveals that studies have found that we have an inner lawyer, just like you hire a lawyer that is supposed to defend you no matter what, we have an inner lawyer that defends our actions no matter what. When we are asked difficult questions, we usually choose one stand and then think about the defending answers. So we do have a cognitive mission to support our actions or beliefs. However we are extremely accurate and logical in our perceptions of others however it is our self-perceptions that are extremely disturbed ~ we have insider information. Evidence shows that we judge others by their own behavior but we think we have special data about ourselves. Also the ones with positive delusions about themselves are usually happier healthier and better liked. We also are not only hypocrites and delusional but we also have naive realism: we believe that facts as we see them are there for all to see therefore everyone should agree with us. What can we do about hypocrisy, naive realism, and inner lawyer ~ we should see all this arguing and judging as a game and not take our minds too seriously. Our elephant is always evaluating good or bad. Through meditation we can reach non-judgementalism and through it we might be able to look at our opponents point of view and that he is not entirely crazy. Chapter 5: The pursuit of HappinessHaidt criticizes Buddhism and Stoicism as happiness is not only from within ~ because:1- The progress principle: the happiness of pregoal attainment as you make progress towards your goal you are happier.2- The adaptation principle: we tend to reset our comfort zone to new changes. Our satisfaction resets to 0 - we compare ourselves to others. We recalibrate. we people tend to think that people who are more attractive are happier but in fact they are not - the ones who live in cities they are not - the ones with more money they are not - men are happier because of freedom and power they are not - younger they are not. What Haidt is saying here is that it is not entirely from the outside factors but also from the inside factors and here a formula was developed by psychologists:H=S+C+V, S is the biological set point the frontal cortex, C is the conditions of your life, And V is the voluntary activities that you doSo Biology says S and Buddha says VSo what is related to C:A- noise: if you live in traffic, noise, crowd, you are stressed and unhappy.B- Commuting: people think they buy happiness with space if they move farther from the city however commuting for long hours to and from work with traffic makes you unhappyc- Lack of control: if we can’t control some areas in our lives such as the noise, the electricity the paycheck we are less happyd- Relationships: good relationships make people happier - we cannot adapt to conflicts. Here are all the external matters things we should be striving to make. Psychologist say that there is a state people value more than chocolate after sex. They called it ""Flow"" which is a merger between pleasure and gratification. As for pleasures in life they must be spaced and diversified. Variety is the spice of life because it is the natural enemy of adaptation. Pleasure feels good in the moment but gratification is more lasting, it grants us more flow and it extends our limits. The key to find your own gratification is to know your strengths - Haidt suggests a link of a test to your strengths. So ""V"" can increase your happiness if you use your strengths. He also stresses on acts of kindness especially if you use your strengths in that direction. Note: there are misguided pursuits, a misguided pursuit is to keep up with life and he advises, work less, earn less, accumulate less, and consume more family time, vacations and enjoyable activities. Our elephant cares more about prestige. As a result, internal happiness and peace is necessary in ancient teachings but we also need external things as well to reach out for our goals and ambitions. A combination of old and modern psychology.Chapter 6: Love and attachmentThe author explains the difference between 2 kinds of love the passionate love versus the companionate love and how passion results in instant pleasures whereas the companionate love is more gratifying. When you're in passionate love, you can't think straight it is purely the elephant riding, you are not reasonable and you are at the service of the elephant. It alters parts of the brain just like cocaine and lots of dopamine, it keeps you high. But like any drug, it wears off and it is when you suddenly say oh where did the magic go. Over 6 months the pleasure of passionate versus companionate is way way higher but over 60 years it is the opposite and more stable and grows stronger. The conclusion of this chapter is that we are all ultra social species, we need others by evolution lovers, friends, sharing and attachment. Attachment and relationships can bring us pain ""Hell is other people but so is heaven.""Chapter 7:It speaks about the effect of failures, setback and trauma and the notion that it makes us stronger and more fulfilled. Haidt does not entirely agree with that but he said it is positive because:- It might reveal a challenge of hidden abilities- Filter: it makes know the depth and strength of people who truly care- Trauma changes priorities and philosophies towards the present moment and makes you live them.But: research proves that personality traits are stable pre and post trauma- our traits remain the same.So life goals fall into 4 categories:1- Work & Achievement2- Relationships3- Religion & Spirituality4- Contributing to SocietyWe are shaped by evolution to pursue success and not happiness, we fall into the trap of consuming to reach goals instead of happiness. When trauma happens it makes us fall off the treadmill and forces us to forget about these goals and enjoy what is present. It shatters belief systems and robs people out of the sense of meaning and people try to find back the pieces by seeking god or higher purpose to find grounds. It might be beneficial and it might as well be destructive. The blessed are the ones that can make sense - appreciate life's changes and accept what is. When bad things happen to good people, we have a problem. We know unconsciously that life is not fair but we want to see the world through the lens of reciprocity, the downfall of an evil man is justified but when the victim is virtuous we struggle to make sense of his tragedy. Psychologists have found that optimists benefit from trauma more than pessimists, the ones who won the cortical lottery - high set point habitually look at the bright side. Life has a way to make the rich richer and the happy happier. So, when crisis happens we either:1- Active coping 2- Re appraisal 3- Avoidance coping usually shutting off emotions by drugs drinking or other distractions. Chapter 8: The Felicity of VirtueHe starts this chapter by a nice Buddha quote: ""Set your heart on doing good. Do it over and over again and you will be filled with joy. A fool is happy until his mischief turns against him and a good man may suffer until his goodness flowers"". Here he speaks about the wisdom of the ancients as they emphasize practice and habit rather than knowledge. Modern ethics focused on actions and whether a particular action is right or wrong.Thus turn wit time from character focus to action focus moved populations form virtues towards moral reasoning and that is sad because:* It limits the scope of morality*Relies on bad psychology of training the rider rather than the elephant, the person goes to class, learns how to solve problems and then goes back to his elephant in the evening. We are being taught as riders and not elephants. So Haidt things that we need to work on developing our characters and cultivating our strengths - he lists 24 virtues divided into: wisdom, courage, humanity, justice, temperance, and transcendence. Haidt suggests to work on our strengths and not our weaknesses and we can use them to get around the weaknesses, working on your strengths is already enjoyable. Chapter 9: Divinity with or without GodI love this chapter, It is about the ancient truth that religious people grasp and secular don’t. Haidt speaks about how we evolved to have a religion and it was basically on the logic of disgust. Despite the religious fundamentalism and what it can do to us, we should give respect to religious moral motives. In science, we evolved to be religious out of fear and our longing to have something superior to long for. And as science people were trying to describe the emotion of the feeling of being “religiously high” that he called elevation: physical change in the body – dilation of the chest, motivation and a desire of doing charitable and grateful acts and a characteristic feeling beyond body sensations. Haidt studied this specific emotion and it isn’t just a form of happiness. It is also seen as a response to moral beauty involving pleasant feelings in the chest and to become a better person.An interesting experiment done was to test lactating women in 2 groups – 1 group watched a comedy show, the other watched an elevating clip on Oprah Winfry, the 2nd group showed more milk on the nursing pads of the women, and not only that, the 2nd group women went to nurse their babies and showed more warmth in the way they cuddled them.This elevation is found in anything that makes us feel small or insignificant and is not restricted to the religious people who have an idea of the supernatural. Atheists can have many of the same experiences. On the other hand, there are people stuck in the paradox of the self which keep people locked in the material world unable to see divinity.Life in a society that entirely ignored the ethic of divinity would be ugly and unsatisfying.He ends this chapter by saying if religious people are right in believing that religion is the source of their greatest happiness then maybe the rest of us who are looking for happiness and meaning can learn something from them whether or not we believe in god.Chapter 10: Happiness comes from betweengoing back to his formula H= S+C+V, he speaks about C, and he says that the biggest part of C is Love. C also depends on having and pursuing goals, we have a basic drive to make things happen – satisfaction has to be seen as lying in a considerable series of transactions in a trend of behavior rather than the goal. The optimistic conclusion coming out of research in positive psychology is that most people can get more satisfaction from their work. Step 1: know your strengths, if you can engage your strengths you ll find more gratification in work and if you find gratification in work you will have a more positive approach and in this mindset it will be easier for you to see the bigger picture the contribution you are making to a larger experience. Love & work are crucial to happiness and of course something called harmony and purpose related to the elevation and the belonging to a community. The rituals involving repetitive movement and chanting at the same time help to set up resonance patterns in the brains inducing chemicals. So, it is worth striving to get the right relationships between yourself and others, yourself and your work, yourself and something larger than yourself."
73,0465028020,http://goodreads.com/user/show/103251400-joe-novicki,5,"Happiness is something we all need, yet not all of us can achieve. In the book The Happiness Hypothesis by Johnathan Haidt he uncovers ten things that have made their way through time that all coincide to help our happiness. Drawing on the words of Buddha, Stoic Philosophy, the Bible, and much more we see that there are certain ideas that can make us happy, and certain ideas that can make us unhappy. There are many factors that go into happiness, such as love and relationships, adversity, and divinity with or without god.Through the course of the book, Johnathan Haidt uses a rider and an elephant as a metaphor. This metaphor guides the book in a way that is unparalleled. Personally, I really appreciated the metaphor because it almost summarized the point Johnathan was trying to convey. In the introduction Johnathan first introduces us to this metaphor by explaining it as, “The mind is divided into parts that sometimes conflict. Like a rider on the back of an elephant, the conscious, reasoning part of the brain has only limited control of what the elephant does.” If one can get their conscious rider to work in conjunction with the automatic elephant we can attain a better a better mental health.One of the first things great ideas that Johnathan Haidt discusses is the importance of reciprocity. At the beginning of the book I really couldn’t understand why reciprocity was such an important idea. In reality, reciprocity is one of the biggest things than contribute to ourselves feeling we belong to a society. In this book reciprocity is defined as a social currency that includes the exchange of things with others for mutual benefit. Reciprocity allows me to show that I care about others, want relationships, and can rejuvenate social ties between different people and/or groups of people. This ties beautifully with the metaphor of the elephant and the rider. The elephant is a natural mimic, we mimic others in a sense of reciprocity. He says, “Mimicry is a social glue, a way of saying “We are one"". I found Johnathan’s insight on many ideas to be very interesting and allowed me to view happiness in a different light. Before reading this book I thought happiness to be something you had or you didn’t. After reading this book I see happiness as something we can achieve, all in our own unique way. We can understand happiness through the conditions we find ourselves in, also known as the happiness formula.I personally found the happiness formula to be very interesting. In chapter five, the happiness formula is considered. The happiness formula introduced here is, H = S + C + V. This means that the amount of happiness we experience is determined by our setpoint (S), the current conditions of your life ( C), and the voluntary activities you choose to do. This was especially interesting because many often see your happiness is only linked to your biological setpoint, what you were born into. Voluntary activities and current conditions play a major role in your happiness and mental health. Out of all the great ideas there was one in particular that I found interesting. This was that our “Happiness comes from between”. We have to strive to be happy, we have to work at it, and it doesn't come overnight. Johnathan states, “You have to get the conditions right and then wait.” We have to draw on relationships, we have to draw on our work, we have to draw on something that is greater than ourselves. I really enjoyed this book and the wisdom that accompanied it. There is so much to learn, and everyone can learn something through this book. It will help you understand the concept of ourselves, the concept of our own elephant and rider. Happiness comes from between, it comes from others, and it comes from the unity between the elephant and the rider. "
74,0465028020,http://goodreads.com/user/show/87218797-ajay-solanky,5,"There's something simultaneously seductive and repulsive, sensible and absurd, and enlightened and profane about taking a surgical approach to finding happiness. But hey, it's worth a shot.I believe that everyone spends 99.9% of their time figuring out how to make themselves happy. At the same time, most of us have no idea how to get there. Instead of thrashing around in the dark, why not take a well-reasoned and scientific-ish approach to the problem?Some of the concepts that I found particularly interesting were:- Even from a biological standpoint, we have divided minds. Your rational mind may point one direction, and your subconscious, another. Your rational mind is underpowered relative to the subconscious - it evolved that way.- A lot of what makes us happy (or unhappy) is predetermined by genetics, circumstance, etc. Free will is often illusive.- Meditation, SSRIs, and cognitive therapy are effective tools for happiness. The latter two are heavily stigmatized, but it's worth opening up your mind to the possibility.- There's a difference between activities that give us ""pleasure"" (hedonism) and ""gratification"" (tasks that absorb your attention, erase self-consciousness and engage your strengths). The former is subject to the ""treadmill"" effect (although still important for day-to-day happiness), whereas the latter is key to long-term fulfillment.- ""No man is an island."" We need to find community, and specifically, romantic love in order to be happy. Romantic love can broken down into 2 different types: ""passionate"" and ""companionate"". The former, in a successful relationship, gives way to the latter, and over time the latter is the real bond that provides lasting happiness and stability.- Adversity can be harmful or helpful when it comes to long term happiness. It shapes, strengthens, and hardens us, and under the right conditions, it can lead to ""post-traumatic growth."" The conditions that lead to growth instead of PTSD are subtle, but it seems like those who experience growth are typically optimists (""positive affective style"") who make sense of their adversity and work it in to their life narratives. Adversity can help us align the different layers of our personalities and move forward with a stronger level of ""cross-coherence""- There are biological (and selfish) reasons for altriuism. For adults, especially older adults, altruism can increase long-term self-esteem and happiness because of the role it plays in strengthening their self-narratives.- Spirituality may be an innate biological ""sense"". Profanity and sacredness are the axes along which this dimension travels, and trying to create a connection with divinity (not necessarily in a religious sense - an atheist can try to connect with the universe as a whole) could be an important element for happiness. Perhaps it should be lamented that spirituality and religious tradition has drained slowly from Western culture- Religion is a part of culture. Culture evolved just like genetics, and a Darwinian framework can be applied here to understand the pervasiveness of religion and how it yields great benefits to communities. It makes us more altruistic and group-minded (at least within the group) and helps to create routine and stability and provide positive narratives that are conducive to happiness."
75,0465028020,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5874435-manu,0,"I don't remember how I discovered this book, but when it arrived, I really liked the title. Mostly because of the word ""hypothesis"", because it signals a scientific approach to a challenge. And that's exactly what the book sets out to do - take ten of the best ideas/concepts from history, religious texts and philosophers, and scrutinise it through a science filter. Positive psychology is the genre. The author begins with the idea of the divided self, and then goes deeper. Into the inbuilt ""affective style"" that plays a huge part in one's personality and how that can be changed, the role of reciprocity, and our tendency towards hypocrisy - seeing the small faults in others while ignoring our own bigger ones. At a third of the book, we even come across a formula for happiness, which makes a lot of sense when viewed rationally. My only concern with the book started around this point. The author seemed to have reframed the original thought (happiness) and moved it to meaning, and he didn't let me in on the reasoning. He tries to bridge this in the last chapter, but to me it seemed forced. If that is set aside, the rest of the book does an excellent job of parsing the ""meaning of life"" into two parts and answering the more important one. The author actually spells out the parsing only towards the end - ""why are we here"" and ""how can I find meaning""? But the chapters before that do give a bunch of perspectives on the second - love and attachments, virtue, adversity, and divinity (agnostic of God). There are several ideas that I could take away from the book. Though the metaphor of the elephant and the driver is not original, the idea of approaching them in tandem and making them work towards a harmony has been elaborated well. It also serves as a good reminder that evolution is only interested in our ""success"" (survival) and happiness is only a nice-to-have. The framing of questions as metaphors is also something I found useful. e.g. What is life? Life is like a journey. Another very interesting concept was the the three layers of personality - basic traits, ""characteristic adaptations"" and ""life story"". To me, it provides a clear actionable on how to approach meaning and happiness. The related concept of ""arête"", as well as the nuanced difference between character and personality were also good finds. It takes a lot of intellect, experience and effort to get the Bhagavad Gita, St.Paul, Confucius, Marcus Aurelius, Buddha, Nietzsche, Benjamin Franklin, Epicurus etc to align in a book that's only 240 pages. The good news is that the book does this quite well. "
76,0465028020,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1500718-ryan,4,"I really enjoyed this book, though much of its content is also in Righteous Mind. If you're on the fence, read the latter. But this book is also good.Some new-to-me (or new to my poor memory me) ideas.First, if we view a religion as a method for forming groups, then it's not so surprising to encounter members of a religion that preaches compassion expressing xenophobia.Second, when we enjoy our work, we may have ""vital engagement"" with it, which here seems to mean that we can see a connection between what we're doing and what we aspire to do. When people find that their job loses meaning, perhaps going on to describe their organization as some form of ""evil empire,"" they are losing that cohesion. I've often wondered, however, if it's not the case that all organizations are at least somewhat corrupt compared to their ideal mission, and so I often default to the idea that it's best not to learn ""how the sausage is made."" This is maybe also why administrators make more money--their jobs may, in this sense, probably suck as they are forced to look behind the curtain to do their job.Third, Haidt discusses activities that offer meaning. Conspicuous activities are prone to adaptability, so if we buy a new watch, we'll adapt to its pleasures and soon find it unfulfilling--until we buy a still fancier watch to flaunt. For a long time, activities like volunteering or going for a run were not very conspicuous and seemed to offer a sort of enduring joy. It occurs to me that we now photograph these activities for public consumption on social media. I will ""like"" a picture of someone running once or twice, but eventually I just ignore them. I wonder if we may witness an eroding of such joyful experiences as even voluntourism becomes just another way of ""keeping up with the Joneses.""I liked this book a lot, though I wonder if a student of psychology might not find it poppy. There's a sort of armchair philosophy in this book, too. I was also struck by how often the most acclaimed psychologists seem to become philosophers."
77,0465028020,http://goodreads.com/user/show/38396339-bastard-travel,4,"Half autobiography, half psych 101 class. Haidt revisits all the psychology experiments you've already heard about and ties them together with snippets of philosophers, most of whom you've also already heard of, then talks about either being in college, teaching at college, or going to India (for research. for college.) He's a respectable social psychologist which is almost like being a scientist, and the book is written clearly and accessibly. There are conflicting schools of thought as to where happiness comes from. Obviously, money can't buy it, or why would they keep saying ""money can't buy happiness"" all the time? They must have gotten it from somewhere. Everybody wants it, nobody knows how to get it.Haidt suggests it's a sort of combination of coming from within and coming from without. You've got to cultivate your internal rock garden, if you're Buddhist, or your inner citadel, if you're more an Aurelius kind of guy. You've got to manage expectations and be grateful for what you've got. You've definitely got to drop that goddamn attitude, I'll tell you that right now. Also, you've got to adopt a moral code and stick to it. You'll feel better if you do. You'll be living in accordance with your virtues, and in Current Year we don't have codified morals or virtues, so nobody knows how to act and it makes them miserable and neurotic.You've also got to stop working all the time and spend more of your time with family and friends. Family especially. You've got to make time for hobbies and live within your means, even if that requires you to adjust your stupid daydreams about Lamborghinis and cocaine to something a little cheaper, that could actually contribute to a sense of fulfillment. Waste your money on experiences, not things.In theory, you follow these rules, as confirmed by both modern psychologists and long-dead Romans, and you should be able to land proper happiness for yourself. But remember. This is just a hypothesis.See? Practically a scientist."
78,0465028020,http://goodreads.com/user/show/71924987-payel-kundu,4,"Having read The Righteous Mind, I went into this book already a big fan of Jonathan Haidt. Fans of Haidt will recognize many common themes between this book and TRM. I thought this book was a wonderful and pretty unusual balance of evidence-based theory and practical self-help. It is at once accessible but also jam packed with rigorous scientific commentary. Also, Haidt is a wonderfully clear and organized writer (quick note, the audiobook version of this is terrible, the narrator has an almost impossibly robotic delivery for a human). I learned a lot from reading this book. I’ll list some of the things I found most interesting or surprising below:-baseline happiness has a large genetic component, it’s thought to be 50-80% heritable (though Haidt is quick to show us that this is not a death sentence for those who have not won the cortical lottery. Rather, the focus of the book is in optimally re-training your elephant to make the most of your genetic lot)-people are quite inaccurate at retrospectively introspecting about what makes them happy-If someone experiences either a very bad life event (e.g paralysis from an accident) or a very good life event (e.g winning the lottery), they will likely return to their baseline level of happiness within a few months. External events tend to affect long term happiness very little, counter to what most people intuitThis book covers a lot of the most important work in happiness research over the last several decades and is written from the perspective of a thorough, balanced, and compassionate scientist. Great read. "
79,0465028020,http://goodreads.com/user/show/82034260-nikhil,4,"Finding meaning in what you do combined with the ability to get into a flow state while doing it is the key to happiness. That is an oversimplified summary of this book that uses both religion and research to propose ways to achieve happiness. It shares some of the content on the author's book on morality and I found it a gratifying experience for the most part. He assures us that as in most aspects of psychology, the answer comes from both within and without. It helps a reader to understand different perspectives of both the religious and atheists, as well as liberals and conservatives by drawing on ethics, concepts of divinity, ultrasociality, and adversity. I'd say the most annoying part of this book is the author's insistence on using the elephant rider hypothesis 99 times across 300 pages. That's way too many times to familiarise readers with the instinct and rationale metaphor. The second was his statement that forcing introverts to be outgoing led to a boost in their mood. I looked up the corresponding research and found that the sample consisted entirely of American college students, which sadly makes me question the veracity of his writing. Nonetheless, I found the book to be compelling and informative, so that's still a huge win, slight irritation or no. I'd definitely recommend it to anyone who wants a keener understanding of psychology, philosophy, and all too elusive answers. "
80,0465028020,http://goodreads.com/user/show/64942666-chris-haley,4,"4.5 stars. This book needs to be read in a book club with deep rumination and discussion after each chapter. It may be brilliant, or it may be simply insightful; I haven't decided which. Every chapter was interesting, some were deeply thought-provoking, perhaps a few were even transformative. There was no common thread weaving through the chapters (or at least none that I found), which may be the reason I am struggling to define its impact. But there are many nuggets of wisdom to be found.A sampling of the ideas in this book:- The concept of the rider and the elephant; ancient wisdom validated by modern psychology, a concept discussed at length by other authors such as Daniel Kahneman in Thinking, Fast and Slow- Adversity does not always make us stronger; it depends on our temperament, the timing, and how we respond to it- Religion and science both play important roles in understanding the human condition and finding happiness; the author argues we need more respect given across the aisle- Our society's movement away from teaching virtue is problematic; when every human being has to decide what's right in any given circumstance without a common set of virtues to strive for (e.g., quandary ethics), we are all worse off- H = S + E + V (Happiness = our genetic setpoint + our environment + our voluntary actions)- There are six virtues that are common across almost all religions and organizations: Wisdom, Justice, Courage, Humanity, Temperance, Transcendence- Evolutionary outcomes are dependent on both culture and genetics"
81,0465028020,http://goodreads.com/user/show/21091961-jacques-bezuidenhout,3,"A book taking some ancient Wisdoms and applying some modern Science / Psychology to determine what it is that makes us happy.This is not a self-help type book, but rather an easy to understand study.I've previously listened to Thinking, Fast and Slow, which focuses on very much the same content. But Daniel Kahneman's book just totally went over my head.This book is way easier to follow and understand.I enjoyed the first half of the book, but it became a bit monotonous towards the end.Especially when he started lingering on the religious aspects, with him being an atheist and all. So it became very much a religion vs science debate with himself.The book had a nice structure, in how the chapters builds up to the conclusion.Did the book change/affect my life in any way? Not really.Worth listening too? I always think that the more you know, the better. And getting some insights into historic thinking compared to modern sciences will always give you something to think about."
82,0465028020,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1717479-terry,5,"Haidt writes a superb book inspecting the nature of happiness, the knobs that affect it. The overall ideas are two fold, that there is consilience between many ancient philosophers and modern neuroscience as to what drives the portion of happiness we can control, and that pharmacology may help us nudge the portion that we can't. The first point is driven by looking at actual studies. Anecdotes are rare and only presented to elucidate a study or research rather than to be taken by itself. The second point is a passionate defense for any number of agents that can change our biochemistry. He refers to choosing to take lithium as ""cosmetic psychopharmacology"" and entirely supportable. Some people have the genetic neurotic switch flipped and we shouldn't socially punish that person for using chemistry to help flip that switch back.I can't recommend this book enough. Most people will get something out of it and Haidt's work avoids the pitfalls common in writing that talks about both neurology and philosophy. Go read it."
83,0465028020,http://goodreads.com/user/show/63426302-alin-pinta,5,"Haidt takes a jetpack, zooms into outer space and allows you to see 'the vast tapestry human culture and see why things are woven in the way that they are'. Exploring the physical, psychological and sociocultural, he seeks hard answers to hard questions.While researching positive psychology for a meta-analysis on the contruction of happiness I came across this book, instantly thinking a title so arrogant to presume to have the answers to such a complex subject must be overselling it. One hour later I was wrapped in awe and wonder, bending page corners and taking quote photos every two minutes.Philosophy drawn from the West and the East is ellegantly blended and applied to modern psychology. Religion, ultrasociability, flow, virtue, adversity, neuroscience, love. I once owned a t-shirt that said 'The search is deeper than you think', but, hell, read this book, dive deep enough and you might even find the meaning of life."
84,0465028020,http://goodreads.com/user/show/10547530-mark,5,"JUST FANTASTIC. I had already read The Righteous Mind and appreciated that, yet it seems to me that the sifting, weighing and balancing among many perspectives is even better in this one. It's research based, which is always important to me, and he pulls from other researchers too. I appreciated the examining of perspectives from across world views and many opposing views, and almost always melding the conclusions in research (and openly stating when it's an opinion). I fully support the idea that ""A good place to look for wisdom, therefore, is where you might least expect to find it; in the minds of your opponents."" This makes fantastic sense as one considers that your knowledge overlaps greatly with your aligned group, and you are likely MISSING things that your opponents see. I HIGHLY recommend this book, and I plan to re-read it soon. (I had borrowed from the Library, but now I'm buying it.)"

However, I now find that the path looks different and I needed something to help me adjust to this alternative route. I started this book lost and looking for purpose and, whilst it didn’t give me all the answers (I wasn’t expecting it to), I think it helped. I liked the mix of old and new philosophy; Haidt has definitely done his homework and there’s something for everyone in this book. Perhaps a bit too much waffle at times, it can be hard to see where each chapter is going and sometimes it doesn’t go anywhere in particular. Nevertheless, it’s a book I could come back to. In the end, ‘our life is the creation of our mind’ and my life continues to evolve in the balance of opposites. "
86,0465028020,http://goodreads.com/user/show/23183558-dina,4,"It's a good book, though in my opinion the author's over-education sometimes gets in between - since he tries to put in too many topics, so overall the message gets confused. To sum it up, the big part of being happy are your morals. If you lead a life full of purpose where you take calculated risk that give you just enough level of adversity to make you stronger but not break you, where you engage in healthy relationships with people based on understanding and trust, where you believe in God and have supporting, strong community around with good parenting, and loving family.It's doesn't actually answer the question of what makes one happy it simply brings different ideas, hypotheses and information all together."

His final conclusion is that happiness comes from between “Happiness is not something that you can find, acquire or achieve directly. You have to get the conditions right and wait. Some of those conditions are within you, such as coherence among the parts and levels of your personality. Other conditions require relationships to things beyond you: just as plants need sun, water, and good soil to thrive, people need love, work, and connection to something larger”Very intellectual and yet really easy to read. I highly recommend it."

On the other hand it was almost depressing? Even though it was a book about achieving happiness? It was overwhelming and left me thinking that I would never reached true happiness without changing everything in my life. I believe that there were a lot of great talking points and that this would be a great book to read with a group of people and discuss how you feel and if you were to adapt any of this into your life. Without a group of people to discuss this I feel its just a bit overwhelming. This is a conversation piece, it really gets the mind thinking. "
89,0465028020,http://goodreads.com/user/show/105239768-yibei,3,"I was oscillating between giving it 3 stars or 4 stars when I was in the middle of the book. After I finished it, I chose 3. The last 2/3 part of the book is not organized at all. He talks about emotion, then jumps to morality, then emotion again. It feels like he was doing his morality research when he wrote this book so his mind just can't help moving towards morality, which is understandable. But, please focus on the topic. His other book The Righteous Mind: Why Good People Are Divided by Politics and Religion has done much better, worth reading.Also, I don't like his definition/judgment of happiness. Happiness is not morality. People have their own definition of happiness and they do have the right to define it. The universal happiness formula is a false proposition."
90,0465028020,http://goodreads.com/user/show/37839735-mason-frierson,5,"“Where does happiness come from? There are several different “happiness hypotheses.” One is that happiness comes from getting what you want, but we all know (and research confirms) that such happiness is short-lived. A more promising hypothesis is that happiness comes from within and cannot be obtained by making the world conform to your desires. This idea was widespread in the ancient world: Buddha in India and the Stoic philosophers in ancient Greece and Rome all counseled people to break their emotional attachments to people and events, which are always unpredictable and uncontrollable, and to cultivate instead an attitude of acceptance. This ancient idea deserves respect, and it is certainly true that changing your mind is usually a more effective response to frustration than is changing the world. However, I will present evidence that this second version of the happiness hypothesis is wrong. Recent research shows that there are some things worth striving for; there are some external conditions of life that can make you lastingly happier. One of these conditions is relatedness—the bonds we form, and need to form, with others. I’ll present research showing where love comes from, why passionate love always cools, and what kind of love is “true” love. I’ll suggest that the happiness hypothesis offered by Buddha and the Stoics should be amended: Happiness comes from within, and happiness comes from without. We need the guidance of both ancient wisdom and modern science to get the balance right.”~ Jonathan Haidt from The Happiness HypothesisI came to this book from Haidt’s wonderful study, THE RIGHTEOUS MIND, which I highly recommend. Given the subject, this book is a bit more diffuse and a little less certain in its conclusions but it is still a wonderful read and an insightful study. It is also a ‘big’ book, i.e. a book that tackles an extremely important subject.I would note, first and foremost, that this is a scholarly book accessible to a wide audience. The writing is lucid and straightforward, jargon-free and not disrupted by endless annotation, charts, graphs and statistics. Most important, perhaps, is its attempt to bring together both psychological science and the humanities. On one page you might receive a report of a study in neuroscience utilizing fMRI technology, on the next the thoughts of Epictetus or Epicurus. While it has often been said that Freud learned as much from literature as from science, that pattern of investigation is now very rare. The ‘psychological sciences’ are now very distinct from the humanities and their work is heavily-funded, empirical science. They associate themselves with the biomedical sciences far more than with the departments of Philosophy or, e.g., Religious Studies. Nevertheless, the literature of reason, wisdom and faith has much to say of, e.g., human happiness and it is to JH’s considerable credit that he measures that literature against the (always tentative) conclusions of modern psychological science. Is Plato’s sense of the divided self a good metaphor for human nature and behavior? Is it true that what doesn’t kill us makes us stronger, as Nietzsche argued? How should we look at Emerson’s transcendentalism in light of the common human desire for such experience?Given the fact that the subject is so vast—the nature of man, the nature of man’s quest for happiness, the very nature of ‘happiness’ and the strategies for achieving it—the conclusions are complex. Nevertheless, they can be summarized briefly.As in THE RIGHTEOUS MIND, JH adopts a Humean model in which the Reason is, ultimately, the slave of the passions. Our lives consist of a multiplicity of experiences that rumble about in our consciousness and direct our ‘automatic’ responses to concrete situations. Joshua Reynolds talked about this phenomenon under the rubric of ‘intuition’. Intuition is not a simple, largely-unwarranted gut reaction; it is the sum total of millions of experiences summoned instantly to respond to a current situation. I am standing beside a highway or a city street. Cars are passing by at various rates of speed. I want to get to the other side of the street, quickly, efficiently and safely. I make instant mental calculations and act . . . . Reason, on the other hand, is something that we utilize when we are pressed to find an argument for an intellectual position. It is, in part, a rhetorical device: how can I outwit and defeat my opponent in the most clever and efficacious fashion? JH takes these phenomena and constructs the ongoing metaphor of a man riding an elephant. The elephant is the sum total of the work of the ‘passions’. He is experience, intuitions, inclinations, and so on. The rider is the Reason. He attempts to control the elephant but that process is complex and sometimes arduous. As we are, in a sense, ‘divided’, so is our world and our experience. So are our bodies. The trick is to put all of this together (with a little luck; being in the right place at the right time helps immeasurably). Here is JH’s conclusion:“We were shaped by individual selection to be selfish creatures who struggle for resources, pleasure, and prestige, and we were shaped by group selection to be hive creatures who need love and attachments, and we are industrious creatures with needs for effectance, able to enter a state of vital engagement with our work. We are the rider and we are the elephant, and our mental health depends on the two working together, each drawing on the others’ strengths. . . . . Happiness is not something that you can find, acquire, or achieve directly. You have to get the conditions right and then wait. . . . Just as plants need sun, water, and good soil to thrive, people need love, work, and a connection to something larger. It is worth striving to get the right relationships between yourself and others, between yourself and your work, and between yourself and something larger than yourself” (pp. 238-39).Bottom line: a lovely book that all should read, absorb and enjoy."
91,0465028020,http://goodreads.com/user/show/793094-lisa,4,"Haidt, a UVa professor, systematically explores what conditions make for a happy life. A little too wordy, especially at first, Haidt cites studies and the research of others to back up his ideas. Most of Haidt's hypothesis rang true to me as I listened to his explanations, although some ideas seem counter intuitive at first. Overall interesting and worth reading! If you are in the depths of depression, this book may not be your lifesaver. However if you ponder the concepts listed, you may be able to make adjustments in your behavior that will make life better for you and those around you. I would strongly recommend reading this book with the thought of how you can change your behavior in such a way that will make life better for others--not just yourself."

102,0465028020,http://goodreads.com/user/show/33599214-suha,5,"This books is a beautiful smooth read that teaches you about 10 great ideas of how ancient teachings would be used to our favor in modern psychology. A bit simplistic, however it is still rich and full of helpful information. The author’s humble tone drives you to listen and trust his words; I loved it, especially the part about divinity and our need for spirituality. Here is the summary if you’d like to know more:About the author:Jonathan Haidt is a social psychologist, he is 52 years old and he is a specialist in emotions and morality. He wrote 2 books: This one ""The Happiness Hypothesis"" and the ""The Righteous Mind: Why Good People are divided by Politics"".Haidt was named one of the top world thinkers by foreign policy and prospect magazine.He wrote this book in 2006, and he describes it as it is about 10 great ideas discovered through civilizations which we can apply in our modern life.Outline:The 10 ideas were:1- The divided Self2- Changing your mind3- Reciprocity with Vengeance4- The Faults of others5- The Pursuit of Happiness6- Love & Attachment7- The Uses of Adversity8- The Felicity of Virtue9- Divinity with or without God10- Happiness comes fromChapter 1: The Divided SelfIn this chapter Haidt speaks about mind versus emotion saying that human thinking depends on metaphor~ speaking that Buddha, Freud and Plato each compared human thinking to an animal ~ elephant and horses. In our days, cars replaced elephants and horses so technology gave people more control over their physical worlds. As a result, when people looked for metaphors, they saw the mind as the driver of the car or a program running on a computer. But if that really was how human dealt with things, why do we keep on doing stupid stuff, why we sometimes do the same damn mistake if we know that we have willpower? Why do people keep on procrastinating while they know what exactly the plan to do things?So here Haidt criticized modern theories of rational choice and he believes that older metaphors work way more beautifully. He utilizes in his entire book a metaphor that I found amazing comparing the human as a rider of an elephant ~ the mind is the rider and the elephant is the emotion. If the elephant is happy and satisfied he will gladly obey your rules and be guided, however, if the elephant wants something there is no power that the rider has can stop him. And this is what Haidt meant by the divided self. The elephant represents temptations, weaknesses and internal conflicts.So why do we have this divided self:a- Mind vs Body: we have an automatic nervous system, like an administrative system that does not need thinking to act.b- Left Vs Right: our brains are split into 2 hemispheres joined by the corpus collusum that are specialized in different tasks - left is for language processing & analytics and right is for patterns in space - with experimenting the 2 hemispheres by Gazzinga a famous psychologist of split brain, he discovered that people fabricate reasons to explain their own behavior- a famous process that he called ""confabulation"" which in one experiment he showed the patient the word ""walk"" so the patient got up and walked and when the psychologist asked him why, he said to get a coke.c- New vs Old: originally the brain had 3 clumps of neurons connected to the spine. Overtime as we evolved the brain expanded more and we developed the neocortex which is the gray matter of the human brain. So we originally were animals governed by primitive emotions and drives until we developed the divine gift of reason of the neocortex. And experiments finding is that human rationality works so well only because our emotional brain works so well.d- Controlled Vs Automatic: so we have 2 systems the controlled vs automatic. Mental processes are mostly automatic without attention consciously ~ walking driving eating ~ The controlled process is limited we can only think consciously about one thing at a time but automatic processes happen in parallel.The automatic system has the dopamine in its hands while the controlled system is more like an advisor. The rider is the control and the elephant is the automatic.When we see a painting and we immediately like it and when someone asks us why we tend not to know how to answer the question with reason. The controlled system can never beat the automatic system by willpower alone. Chapter 2: Changing your mindHaidt proceeds in these 2 chapters showing us how weird our minds are.He says that we have a ""Like-o-Meter"" in which everything we see had to be ranked like or dislike and it is always running even if we are not aware. Experiments reveal, that whenever you see someone with the same name, you suddenly create a bias without you knowing it. And People are more likely to marry people whose names sound like their own. Moreover, humans have negativity bias, which is in our understanding, bad is stronger than good, Responses to threats and unpleasantness are far stronger than responses to opportunities and pleasures. The human mind reacts to bad things more quickly and persistently. The elephant reacts before the rider out of survival, when the elephant sees a snake he runs away whether you like it or not. Haidt speaks about the terminology of ""Cortical Lottery"" :this is the basic nature we are born with. Our frontal cortex has left and right side ~ research says if you have more active left side you are lucky and happy by nature:- Always willing to try something new- If you see a chance you go ahead and take it- When good things happen to you it affects you greatlyHowever if your right side is more active: - You worry about making mistakes  - Criticism hurts you- You feel worried when you do poorly at something- You have many fearsThe author believes that there are 3 ways to change this reality of lottery: 1- Meditation 2- Cognitive Therapy and 3 - ProzacHaidt speaks highly of meditation and he describes it as a pill with no side effects and it tames your elephant. On the other hand, cognitive therapy which is founded in the 60s, is the way to correct erroneous thoughts about yourself called cognitive. Finally, Prozac ~ I loved the humbleness of the author as he describes his own experience with a similar drug. He described it as wonderful, it was like magic he said and his life was amazing however he found it difficult to remember names and facts and that was bad for him in his career. Prozac raises the level of serotonin and makes the neurons adapt to new transmission amd raises the level of the neural growth hormone. The sad news that it is a short cut and it changes personality ~ psychologists call it ""cosmetic psychopharmacology"". Haidt thinks it is overprescribed. He summed up the chapter by mentioning that all these ways should be publicized and can be used by the ones with unlucky frontal cortex. Chapter 3: Reciprocity by VengeanceHaidt here also explores human behavior as we by evolution needed to win by surviving our genes, and gossiping and reciprocating were both results of evolution. Gossiping was an essential facet of human evolution and called ""emotional toolkit"" as without it we’d live in chaos and it is by gossip we make sure that what goes around comes around. Gossip is paired with reciprocity which is the karma working here on earth. Reciprocity is so amazing that sales people who are trying to sell you something give you first a gift. When you receive something for free, part of you might be pleased but another part want to give something in return. This is not limited to material things, but also to stories, if someone tells you a romantic story about his past life, you would feel pressured to do the same. Haidt calls reciprocity a relationship tonic. If used properly it strengthens social ties. For ex when we are interacting with someone we like we have tendency to copy their movesChapter 4: The faults of othersHaidt starts his chapter by saying that we are all hypocrites but we only believe that we are not. We are naive and we have myths of pure evil. There was this experiment that resulted in: people who think are moral are in fact more likely to do the right thing but when the result is against them, they find a way to ignore it and follow their self-interest. This is called ""Moral Hypocrisy"". Curing hypocrisy is very hard because we don’t see there is a problem. Haidt reveals that studies have found that we have an inner lawyer, just like you hire a lawyer that is supposed to defend you no matter what, we have an inner lawyer that defends our actions no matter what. When we are asked difficult questions, we usually choose one stand and then think about the defending answers. So we do have a cognitive mission to support our actions or beliefs. However we are extremely accurate and logical in our perceptions of others however it is our self-perceptions that are extremely disturbed ~ we have insider information. Evidence shows that we judge others by their own behavior but we think we have special data about ourselves. Also the ones with positive delusions about themselves are usually happier healthier and better liked. We also are not only hypocrites and delusional but we also have naive realism: we believe that facts as we see them are there for all to see therefore everyone should agree with us. What can we do about hypocrisy, naive realism, and inner lawyer ~ we should see all this arguing and judging as a game and not take our minds too seriously. Our elephant is always evaluating good or bad. Through meditation we can reach non-judgementalism and through it we might be able to look at our opponents point of view and that he is not entirely crazy. Chapter 5: The pursuit of HappinessHaidt criticizes Buddhism and Stoicism as happiness is not only from within ~ because:1- The progress principle: the happiness of pregoal attainment as you make progress towards your goal you are happier.2- The adaptation principle: we tend to reset our comfort zone to new changes. Our satisfaction resets to 0 - we compare ourselves to others. We recalibrate. we people tend to think that people who are more attractive are happier but in fact they are not - the ones who live in cities they are not - the ones with more money they are not - men are happier because of freedom and power they are not - younger they are not. What Haidt is saying here is that it is not entirely from the outside factors but also from the inside factors and here a formula was developed by psychologists:H=S+C+V, S is the biological set point the frontal cortex, C is the conditions of your life, And V is the voluntary activities that you doSo Biology says S and Buddha says VSo what is related to C:A- noise: if you live in traffic, noise, crowd, you are stressed and unhappy.B- Commuting: people think they buy happiness with space if they move farther from the city however commuting for long hours to and from work with traffic makes you unhappyc- Lack of control: if we can’t control some areas in our lives such as the noise, the electricity the paycheck we are less happyd- Relationships: good relationships make people happier - we cannot adapt to conflicts. Here are all the external matters things we should be striving to make. Psychologist say that there is a state people value more than chocolate after sex. They called it ""Flow"" which is a merger between pleasure and gratification. As for pleasures in life they must be spaced and diversified. Variety is the spice of life because it is the natural enemy of adaptation. Pleasure feels good in the moment but gratification is more lasting, it grants us more flow and it extends our limits. The key to find your own gratification is to know your strengths - Haidt suggests a link of a test to your strengths. So ""V"" can increase your happiness if you use your strengths. He also stresses on acts of kindness especially if you use your strengths in that direction. Note: there are misguided pursuits, a misguided pursuit is to keep up with life and he advises, work less, earn less, accumulate less, and consume more family time, vacations and enjoyable activities. Our elephant cares more about prestige. As a result, internal happiness and peace is necessary in ancient teachings but we also need external things as well to reach out for our goals and ambitions. A combination of old and modern psychology.Chapter 6: Love and attachmentThe author explains the difference between 2 kinds of love the passionate love versus the companionate love and how passion results in instant pleasures whereas the companionate love is more gratifying. When you're in passionate love, you can't think straight it is purely the elephant riding, you are not reasonable and you are at the service of the elephant. It alters parts of the brain just like cocaine and lots of dopamine, it keeps you high. But like any drug, it wears off and it is when you suddenly say oh where did the magic go. Over 6 months the pleasure of passionate versus companionate is way way higher but over 60 years it is the opposite and more stable and grows stronger. The conclusion of this chapter is that we are all ultra social species, we need others by evolution lovers, friends, sharing and attachment. Attachment and relationships can bring us pain ""Hell is other people but so is heaven.""Chapter 7:It speaks about the effect of failures, setback and trauma and the notion that it makes us stronger and more fulfilled. Haidt does not entirely agree with that but he said it is positive because:- It might reveal a challenge of hidden abilities- Filter: it makes know the depth and strength of people who truly care- Trauma changes priorities and philosophies towards the present moment and makes you live them.But: research proves that personality traits are stable pre and post trauma- our traits remain the same.So life goals fall into 4 categories:1- Work & Achievement2- Relationships3- Religion & Spirituality4- Contributing to SocietyWe are shaped by evolution to pursue success and not happiness, we fall into the trap of consuming to reach goals instead of happiness. When trauma happens it makes us fall off the treadmill and forces us to forget about these goals and enjoy what is present. It shatters belief systems and robs people out of the sense of meaning and people try to find back the pieces by seeking god or higher purpose to find grounds. It might be beneficial and it might as well be destructive. The blessed are the ones that can make sense - appreciate life's changes and accept what is. When bad things happen to good people, we have a problem. We know unconsciously that life is not fair but we want to see the world through the lens of reciprocity, the downfall of an evil man is justified but when the victim is virtuous we struggle to make sense of his tragedy. Psychologists have found that optimists benefit from trauma more than pessimists, the ones who won the cortical lottery - high set point habitually look at the bright side. Life has a way to make the rich richer and the happy happier. So, when crisis happens we either:1- Active coping 2- Re appraisal 3- Avoidance coping usually shutting off emotions by drugs drinking or other distractions. Chapter 8: The Felicity of VirtueHe starts this chapter by a nice Buddha quote: ""Set your heart on doing good. Do it over and over again and you will be filled with joy. A fool is happy until his mischief turns against him and a good man may suffer until his goodness flowers"". Here he speaks about the wisdom of the ancients as they emphasize practice and habit rather than knowledge. Modern ethics focused on actions and whether a particular action is right or wrong.Thus turn wit time from character focus to action focus moved populations form virtues towards moral reasoning and that is sad because:* It limits the scope of morality*Relies on bad psychology of training the rider rather than the elephant, the person goes to class, learns how to solve problems and then goes back to his elephant in the evening. We are being taught as riders and not elephants. So Haidt things that we need to work on developing our characters and cultivating our strengths - he lists 24 virtues divided into: wisdom, courage, humanity, justice, temperance, and transcendence. Haidt suggests to work on our strengths and not our weaknesses and we can use them to get around the weaknesses, working on your strengths is already enjoyable. Chapter 9: Divinity with or without GodI love this chapter, It is about the ancient truth that religious people grasp and secular don’t. Haidt speaks about how we evolved to have a religion and it was basically on the logic of disgust. Despite the religious fundamentalism and what it can do to us, we should give respect to religious moral motives. In science, we evolved to be religious out of fear and our longing to have something superior to long for. And as science people were trying to describe the emotion of the feeling of being “religiously high” that he called elevation: physical change in the body – dilation of the chest, motivation and a desire of doing charitable and grateful acts and a characteristic feeling beyond body sensations. Haidt studied this specific emotion and it isn’t just a form of happiness. It is also seen as a response to moral beauty involving pleasant feelings in the chest and to become a better person.An interesting experiment done was to test lactating women in 2 groups – 1 group watched a comedy show, the other watched an elevating clip on Oprah Winfry, the 2nd group showed more milk on the nursing pads of the women, and not only that, the 2nd group women went to nurse their babies and showed more warmth in the way they cuddled them.This elevation is found in anything that makes us feel small or insignificant and is not restricted to the religious people who have an idea of the supernatural. Atheists can have many of the same experiences. On the other hand, there are people stuck in the paradox of the self which keep people locked in the material world unable to see divinity.Life in a society that entirely ignored the ethic of divinity would be ugly and unsatisfying.He ends this chapter by saying if religious people are right in believing that religion is the source of their greatest happiness then maybe the rest of us who are looking for happiness and meaning can learn something from them whether or not we believe in god.Chapter 10: Happiness comes from betweengoing back to his formula H= S+C+V, he speaks about C, and he says that the biggest part of C is Love. C also depends on having and pursuing goals, we have a basic drive to make things happen – satisfaction has to be seen as lying in a considerable series of transactions in a trend of behavior rather than the goal. The optimistic conclusion coming out of research in positive psychology is that most people can get more satisfaction from their work. Step 1: know your strengths, if you can engage your strengths you ll find more gratification in work and if you find gratification in work you will have a more positive approach and in this mindset it will be easier for you to see the bigger picture the contribution you are making to a larger experience. Love & work are crucial to happiness and of course something called harmony and purpose related to the elevation and the belonging to a community. The rituals involving repetitive movement and chanting at the same time help to set up resonance patterns in the brains inducing chemicals. So, it is worth striving to get the right relationships between yourself and others, yourself and your work, yourself and something larger than yourself."
103,0465028020,http://goodreads.com/user/show/103251400-joe-novicki,5,"Happiness is something we all need, yet not all of us can achieve. In the book The Happiness Hypothesis by Johnathan Haidt he uncovers ten things that have made their way through time that all coincide to help our happiness. Drawing on the words of Buddha, Stoic Philosophy, the Bible, and much more we see that there are certain ideas that can make us happy, and certain ideas that can make us unhappy. There are many factors that go into happiness, such as love and relationships, adversity, and divinity with or without god.Through the course of the book, Johnathan Haidt uses a rider and an elephant as a metaphor. This metaphor guides the book in a way that is unparalleled. Personally, I really appreciated the metaphor because it almost summarized the point Johnathan was trying to convey. In the introduction Johnathan first introduces us to this metaphor by explaining it as, “The mind is divided into parts that sometimes conflict. Like a rider on the back of an elephant, the conscious, reasoning part of the brain has only limited control of what the elephant does.” If one can get their conscious rider to work in conjunction with the automatic elephant we can attain a better a better mental health.One of the first things great ideas that Johnathan Haidt discusses is the importance of reciprocity. At the beginning of the book I really couldn’t understand why reciprocity was such an important idea. In reality, reciprocity is one of the biggest things than contribute to ourselves feeling we belong to a society. In this book reciprocity is defined as a social currency that includes the exchange of things with others for mutual benefit. Reciprocity allows me to show that I care about others, want relationships, and can rejuvenate social ties between different people and/or groups of people. This ties beautifully with the metaphor of the elephant and the rider. The elephant is a natural mimic, we mimic others in a sense of reciprocity. He says, “Mimicry is a social glue, a way of saying “We are one"". I found Johnathan’s insight on many ideas to be very interesting and allowed me to view happiness in a different light. Before reading this book I thought happiness to be something you had or you didn’t. After reading this book I see happiness as something we can achieve, all in our own unique way. We can understand happiness through the conditions we find ourselves in, also known as the happiness formula.I personally found the happiness formula to be very interesting. In chapter five, the happiness formula is considered. The happiness formula introduced here is, H = S + C + V. This means that the amount of happiness we experience is determined by our setpoint (S), the current conditions of your life ( C), and the voluntary activities you choose to do. This was especially interesting because many often see your happiness is only linked to your biological setpoint, what you were born into. Voluntary activities and current conditions play a major role in your happiness and mental health. Out of all the great ideas there was one in particular that I found interesting. This was that our “Happiness comes from between”. We have to strive to be happy, we have to work at it, and it doesn't come overnight. Johnathan states, “You have to get the conditions right and then wait.” We have to draw on relationships, we have to draw on our work, we have to draw on something that is greater than ourselves. I really enjoyed this book and the wisdom that accompanied it. There is so much to learn, and everyone can learn something through this book. It will help you understand the concept of ourselves, the concept of our own elephant and rider. Happiness comes from between, it comes from others, and it comes from the unity between the elephant and the rider. "
104,0465028020,http://goodreads.com/user/show/87218797-ajay-solanky,5,"There's something simultaneously seductive and repulsive, sensible and absurd, and enlightened and profane about taking a surgical approach to finding happiness. But hey, it's worth a shot.I believe that everyone spends 99.9% of their time figuring out how to make themselves happy. At the same time, most of us have no idea how to get there. Instead of thrashing around in the dark, why not take a well-reasoned and scientific-ish approach to the problem?Some of the concepts that I found particularly interesting were:- Even from a biological standpoint, we have divided minds. Your rational mind may point one direction, and your subconscious, another. Your rational mind is underpowered relative to the subconscious - it evolved that way.- A lot of what makes us happy (or unhappy) is predetermined by genetics, circumstance, etc. Free will is often illusive.- Meditation, SSRIs, and cognitive therapy are effective tools for happiness. The latter two are heavily stigmatized, but it's worth opening up your mind to the possibility.- There's a difference between activities that give us ""pleasure"" (hedonism) and ""gratification"" (tasks that absorb your attention, erase self-consciousness and engage your strengths). The former is subject to the ""treadmill"" effect (although still important for day-to-day happiness), whereas the latter is key to long-term fulfillment.- ""No man is an island."" We need to find community, and specifically, romantic love in order to be happy. Romantic love can broken down into 2 different types: ""passionate"" and ""companionate"". The former, in a successful relationship, gives way to the latter, and over time the latter is the real bond that provides lasting happiness and stability.- Adversity can be harmful or helpful when it comes to long term happiness. It shapes, strengthens, and hardens us, and under the right conditions, it can lead to ""post-traumatic growth."" The conditions that lead to growth instead of PTSD are subtle, but it seems like those who experience growth are typically optimists (""positive affective style"") who make sense of their adversity and work it in to their life narratives. Adversity can help us align the different layers of our personalities and move forward with a stronger level of ""cross-coherence""- There are biological (and selfish) reasons for altriuism. For adults, especially older adults, altruism can increase long-term self-esteem and happiness because of the role it plays in strengthening their self-narratives.- Spirituality may be an innate biological ""sense"". Profanity and sacredness are the axes along which this dimension travels, and trying to create a connection with divinity (not necessarily in a religious sense - an atheist can try to connect with the universe as a whole) could be an important element for happiness. Perhaps it should be lamented that spirituality and religious tradition has drained slowly from Western culture- Religion is a part of culture. Culture evolved just like genetics, and a Darwinian framework can be applied here to understand the pervasiveness of religion and how it yields great benefits to communities. It makes us more altruistic and group-minded (at least within the group) and helps to create routine and stability and provide positive narratives that are conducive to happiness."
105,0465028020,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5874435-manu,0,"I don't remember how I discovered this book, but when it arrived, I really liked the title. Mostly because of the word ""hypothesis"", because it signals a scientific approach to a challenge. And that's exactly what the book sets out to do - take ten of the best ideas/concepts from history, religious texts and philosophers, and scrutinise it through a science filter. Positive psychology is the genre. The author begins with the idea of the divided self, and then goes deeper. Into the inbuilt ""affective style"" that plays a huge part in one's personality and how that can be changed, the role of reciprocity, and our tendency towards hypocrisy - seeing the small faults in others while ignoring our own bigger ones. At a third of the book, we even come across a formula for happiness, which makes a lot of sense when viewed rationally. My only concern with the book started around this point. The author seemed to have reframed the original thought (happiness) and moved it to meaning, and he didn't let me in on the reasoning. He tries to bridge this in the last chapter, but to me it seemed forced. If that is set aside, the rest of the book does an excellent job of parsing the ""meaning of life"" into two parts and answering the more important one. The author actually spells out the parsing only towards the end - ""why are we here"" and ""how can I find meaning""? But the chapters before that do give a bunch of perspectives on the second - love and attachments, virtue, adversity, and divinity (agnostic of God). There are several ideas that I could take away from the book. Though the metaphor of the elephant and the driver is not original, the idea of approaching them in tandem and making them work towards a harmony has been elaborated well. It also serves as a good reminder that evolution is only interested in our ""success"" (survival) and happiness is only a nice-to-have. The framing of questions as metaphors is also something I found useful. e.g. What is life? Life is like a journey. Another very interesting concept was the the three layers of personality - basic traits, ""characteristic adaptations"" and ""life story"". To me, it provides a clear actionable on how to approach meaning and happiness. The related concept of ""arête"", as well as the nuanced difference between character and personality were also good finds. It takes a lot of intellect, experience and effort to get the Bhagavad Gita, St.Paul, Confucius, Marcus Aurelius, Buddha, Nietzsche, Benjamin Franklin, Epicurus etc to align in a book that's only 240 pages. The good news is that the book does this quite well. "
106,0465028020,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1500718-ryan,4,"I really enjoyed this book, though much of its content is also in Righteous Mind. If you're on the fence, read the latter. But this book is also good.Some new-to-me (or new to my poor memory me) ideas.First, if we view a religion as a method for forming groups, then it's not so surprising to encounter members of a religion that preaches compassion expressing xenophobia.Second, when we enjoy our work, we may have ""vital engagement"" with it, which here seems to mean that we can see a connection between what we're doing and what we aspire to do. When people find that their job loses meaning, perhaps going on to describe their organization as some form of ""evil empire,"" they are losing that cohesion. I've often wondered, however, if it's not the case that all organizations are at least somewhat corrupt compared to their ideal mission, and so I often default to the idea that it's best not to learn ""how the sausage is made."" This is maybe also why administrators make more money--their jobs may, in this sense, probably suck as they are forced to look behind the curtain to do their job.Third, Haidt discusses activities that offer meaning. Conspicuous activities are prone to adaptability, so if we buy a new watch, we'll adapt to its pleasures and soon find it unfulfilling--until we buy a still fancier watch to flaunt. For a long time, activities like volunteering or going for a run were not very conspicuous and seemed to offer a sort of enduring joy. It occurs to me that we now photograph these activities for public consumption on social media. I will ""like"" a picture of someone running once or twice, but eventually I just ignore them. I wonder if we may witness an eroding of such joyful experiences as even voluntourism becomes just another way of ""keeping up with the Joneses.""I liked this book a lot, though I wonder if a student of psychology might not find it poppy. There's a sort of armchair philosophy in this book, too. I was also struck by how often the most acclaimed psychologists seem to become philosophers."
107,0465028020,http://goodreads.com/user/show/38396339-bastard-travel,4,"Half autobiography, half psych 101 class. Haidt revisits all the psychology experiments you've already heard about and ties them together with snippets of philosophers, most of whom you've also already heard of, then talks about either being in college, teaching at college, or going to India (for research. for college.) He's a respectable social psychologist which is almost like being a scientist, and the book is written clearly and accessibly. There are conflicting schools of thought as to where happiness comes from. Obviously, money can't buy it, or why would they keep saying ""money can't buy happiness"" all the time? They must have gotten it from somewhere. Everybody wants it, nobody knows how to get it.Haidt suggests it's a sort of combination of coming from within and coming from without. You've got to cultivate your internal rock garden, if you're Buddhist, or your inner citadel, if you're more an Aurelius kind of guy. You've got to manage expectations and be grateful for what you've got. You've definitely got to drop that goddamn attitude, I'll tell you that right now. Also, you've got to adopt a moral code and stick to it. You'll feel better if you do. You'll be living in accordance with your virtues, and in Current Year we don't have codified morals or virtues, so nobody knows how to act and it makes them miserable and neurotic.You've also got to stop working all the time and spend more of your time with family and friends. Family especially. You've got to make time for hobbies and live within your means, even if that requires you to adjust your stupid daydreams about Lamborghinis and cocaine to something a little cheaper, that could actually contribute to a sense of fulfillment. Waste your money on experiences, not things.In theory, you follow these rules, as confirmed by both modern psychologists and long-dead Romans, and you should be able to land proper happiness for yourself. But remember. This is just a hypothesis.See? Practically a scientist."
108,0465028020,http://goodreads.com/user/show/71924987-payel-kundu,4,"Having read The Righteous Mind, I went into this book already a big fan of Jonathan Haidt. Fans of Haidt will recognize many common themes between this book and TRM. I thought this book was a wonderful and pretty unusual balance of evidence-based theory and practical self-help. It is at once accessible but also jam packed with rigorous scientific commentary. Also, Haidt is a wonderfully clear and organized writer (quick note, the audiobook version of this is terrible, the narrator has an almost impossibly robotic delivery for a human). I learned a lot from reading this book. I’ll list some of the things I found most interesting or surprising below:-baseline happiness has a large genetic component, it’s thought to be 50-80% heritable (though Haidt is quick to show us that this is not a death sentence for those who have not won the cortical lottery. Rather, the focus of the book is in optimally re-training your elephant to make the most of your genetic lot)-people are quite inaccurate at retrospectively introspecting about what makes them happy-If someone experiences either a very bad life event (e.g paralysis from an accident) or a very good life event (e.g winning the lottery), they will likely return to their baseline level of happiness within a few months. External events tend to affect long term happiness very little, counter to what most people intuitThis book covers a lot of the most important work in happiness research over the last several decades and is written from the perspective of a thorough, balanced, and compassionate scientist. Great read. "
109,0465028020,http://goodreads.com/user/show/82034260-nikhil,4,"Finding meaning in what you do combined with the ability to get into a flow state while doing it is the key to happiness. That is an oversimplified summary of this book that uses both religion and research to propose ways to achieve happiness. It shares some of the content on the author's book on morality and I found it a gratifying experience for the most part. He assures us that as in most aspects of psychology, the answer comes from both within and without. It helps a reader to understand different perspectives of both the religious and atheists, as well as liberals and conservatives by drawing on ethics, concepts of divinity, ultrasociality, and adversity. I'd say the most annoying part of this book is the author's insistence on using the elephant rider hypothesis 99 times across 300 pages. That's way too many times to familiarise readers with the instinct and rationale metaphor. The second was his statement that forcing introverts to be outgoing led to a boost in their mood. I looked up the corresponding research and found that the sample consisted entirely of American college students, which sadly makes me question the veracity of his writing. Nonetheless, I found the book to be compelling and informative, so that's still a huge win, slight irritation or no. I'd definitely recommend it to anyone who wants a keener understanding of psychology, philosophy, and all too elusive answers. "
110,0465028020,http://goodreads.com/user/show/64942666-chris-haley,4,"4.5 stars. This book needs to be read in a book club with deep rumination and discussion after each chapter. It may be brilliant, or it may be simply insightful; I haven't decided which. Every chapter was interesting, some were deeply thought-provoking, perhaps a few were even transformative. There was no common thread weaving through the chapters (or at least none that I found), which may be the reason I am struggling to define its impact. But there are many nuggets of wisdom to be found.A sampling of the ideas in this book:- The concept of the rider and the elephant; ancient wisdom validated by modern psychology, a concept discussed at length by other authors such as Daniel Kahneman in Thinking, Fast and Slow- Adversity does not always make us stronger; it depends on our temperament, the timing, and how we respond to it- Religion and science both play important roles in understanding the human condition and finding happiness; the author argues we need more respect given across the aisle- Our society's movement away from teaching virtue is problematic; when every human being has to decide what's right in any given circumstance without a common set of virtues to strive for (e.g., quandary ethics), we are all worse off- H = S + E + V (Happiness = our genetic setpoint + our environment + our voluntary actions)- There are six virtues that are common across almost all religions and organizations: Wisdom, Justice, Courage, Humanity, Temperance, Transcendence- Evolutionary outcomes are dependent on both culture and genetics"

But Daniel Kahneman's book just totally went over my head.This book is way easier to follow and understand.I enjoyed the first half of the book, but it became a bit monotonous towards the end.Especially when he started lingering on the religious aspects, with him being an atheist and all. So it became very much a religion vs science debate with himself.The book had a nice structure, in how the chapters builds up to the conclusion.Did the book change/affect my life in any way? Not really.Worth listening too? I always think that the more you know, the better. And getting some insights into historic thinking compared to modern sciences will always give you something to think about."
112,0465028020,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1717479-terry,5,"Haidt writes a superb book inspecting the nature of happiness, the knobs that affect it. The overall ideas are two fold, that there is consilience between many ancient philosophers and modern neuroscience as to what drives the portion of happiness we can control, and that pharmacology may help us nudge the portion that we can't. The first point is driven by looking at actual studies. Anecdotes are rare and only presented to elucidate a study or research rather than to be taken by itself. The second point is a passionate defense for any number of agents that can change our biochemistry. He refers to choosing to take lithium as ""cosmetic psychopharmacology"" and entirely supportable. Some people have the genetic neurotic switch flipped and we shouldn't socially punish that person for using chemistry to help flip that switch back.I can't recommend this book enough. Most people will get something out of it and Haidt's work avoids the pitfalls common in writing that talks about both neurology and philosophy. Go read it."
113,0465028020,http://goodreads.com/user/show/63426302-alin-pinta,5,"Haidt takes a jetpack, zooms into outer space and allows you to see 'the vast tapestry human culture and see why things are woven in the way that they are'. Exploring the physical, psychological and sociocultural, he seeks hard answers to hard questions.While researching positive psychology for a meta-analysis on the contruction of happiness I came across this book, instantly thinking a title so arrogant to presume to have the answers to such a complex subject must be overselling it. One hour later I was wrapped in awe and wonder, bending page corners and taking quote photos every two minutes.Philosophy drawn from the West and the East is ellegantly blended and applied to modern psychology. Religion, ultrasociability, flow, virtue, adversity, neuroscience, love. I once owned a t-shirt that said 'The search is deeper than you think', but, hell, read this book, dive deep enough and you might even find the meaning of life."

I had already read The Righteous Mind and appreciated that, yet it seems to me that the sifting, weighing and balancing among many perspectives is even better in this one. It's research based, which is always important to me, and he pulls from other researchers too. I appreciated the examining of perspectives from across world views and many opposing views, and almost always melding the conclusions in research (and openly stating when it's an opinion). I fully support the idea that ""A good place to look for wisdom, therefore, is where you might least expect to find it; in the minds of your opponents."" This makes fantastic sense as one considers that your knowledge overlaps greatly with your aligned group, and you are likely MISSING things that your opponents see. I HIGHLY recommend this book, and I plan to re-read it soon. (I had borrowed from the Library, but now I'm buying it.)"
115,0465028020,http://goodreads.com/user/show/72120845-rachael-hedger,4,"Last year, my elephant ran off of my chosen path and, as the rider, I’ve been desperately trying to drag it back on course ever since. However, I now find that the path looks different and I needed something to help me adjust to this alternative route. I started this book lost and looking for purpose and, whilst it didn’t give me all the answers (I wasn’t expecting it to), I think it helped. I liked the mix of old and new philosophy; Haidt has definitely done his homework and there’s something for everyone in this book. Perhaps a bit too much waffle at times, it can be hard to see where each chapter is going and sometimes it doesn’t go anywhere in particular. Nevertheless, it’s a book I could come back to. In the end, ‘our life is the creation of our mind’ and my life continues to evolve in the balance of opposites. "
116,0465028020,http://goodreads.com/user/show/23183558-dina,4,"It's a good book, though in my opinion the author's over-education sometimes gets in between - since he tries to put in too many topics, so overall the message gets confused. To sum it up, the big part of being happy are your morals. If you lead a life full of purpose where you take calculated risk that give you just enough level of adversity to make you stronger but not break you, where you engage in healthy relationships with people based on understanding and trust, where you believe in God and have supporting, strong community around with good parenting, and loving family.It's doesn't actually answer the question of what makes one happy it simply brings different ideas, hypotheses and information all together."
117,0465028020,http://goodreads.com/user/show/9471880-erin-henry,5,"Fascinating and so good! The author is a moral psychologist and has done the research to back up his conclusions. His final conclusion is that happiness comes from between “Happiness is not something that you can find, acquire or achieve directly. You have to get the conditions right and wait. Some of those conditions are within you, such as coherence among the parts and levels of your personality. Other conditions require relationships to things beyond you: just as plants need sun, water, and good soil to thrive, people need love, work, and connection to something larger”Very intellectual and yet really easy to read. I highly recommend it."

On the other hand it was almost depressing? Even though it was a book about achieving happiness? It was overwhelming and left me thinking that I would never reached true happiness without changing everything in my life. I believe that there were a lot of great talking points and that this would be a great book to read with a group of people and discuss how you feel and if you were to adapt any of this into your life. Without a group of people to discuss this I feel its just a bit overwhelming. This is a conversation piece, it really gets the mind thinking. "
119,0465028020,http://goodreads.com/user/show/105239768-yibei,3,"I was oscillating between giving it 3 stars or 4 stars when I was in the middle of the book. After I finished it, I chose 3. The last 2/3 part of the book is not organized at all. He talks about emotion, then jumps to morality, then emotion again. It feels like he was doing his morality research when he wrote this book so his mind just can't help moving towards morality, which is understandable. But, please focus on the topic. His other book The Righteous Mind: Why Good People Are Divided by Politics and Religion has done much better, worth reading.Also, I don't like his definition/judgment of happiness. Happiness is not morality. People have their own definition of happiness and they do have the right to define it. The universal happiness formula is a false proposition."
120,0465028020,http://goodreads.com/user/show/37839735-mason-frierson,5,"“Where does happiness come from? There are several different “happiness hypotheses.” One is that happiness comes from getting what you want, but we all know (and research confirms) that such happiness is short-lived. A more promising hypothesis is that happiness comes from within and cannot be obtained by making the world conform to your desires. This idea was widespread in the ancient world: Buddha in India and the Stoic philosophers in ancient Greece and Rome all counseled people to break their emotional attachments to people and events, which are always unpredictable and uncontrollable, and to cultivate instead an attitude of acceptance. This ancient idea deserves respect, and it is certainly true that changing your mind is usually a more effective response to frustration than is changing the world. However, I will present evidence that this second version of the happiness hypothesis is wrong. Recent research shows that there are some things worth striving for; there are some external conditions of life that can make you lastingly happier. One of these conditions is relatedness—the bonds we form, and need to form, with others. I’ll present research showing where love comes from, why passionate love always cools, and what kind of love is “true” love. I’ll suggest that the happiness hypothesis offered by Buddha and the Stoics should be amended: Happiness comes from within, and happiness comes from without. We need the guidance of both ancient wisdom and modern science to get the balance right.”~ Jonathan Haidt from The Happiness HypothesisI came to this book from Haidt’s wonderful study, THE RIGHTEOUS MIND, which I highly recommend. Given the subject, this book is a bit more diffuse and a little less certain in its conclusions but it is still a wonderful read and an insightful study. It is also a ‘big’ book, i.e. a book that tackles an extremely important subject.I would note, first and foremost, that this is a scholarly book accessible to a wide audience. The writing is lucid and straightforward, jargon-free and not disrupted by endless annotation, charts, graphs and statistics. Most important, perhaps, is its attempt to bring together both psychological science and the humanities. On one page you might receive a report of a study in neuroscience utilizing fMRI technology, on the next the thoughts of Epictetus or Epicurus. While it has often been said that Freud learned as much from literature as from science, that pattern of investigation is now very rare. The ‘psychological sciences’ are now very distinct from the humanities and their work is heavily-funded, empirical science. They associate themselves with the biomedical sciences far more than with the departments of Philosophy or, e.g., Religious Studies. Nevertheless, the literature of reason, wisdom and faith has much to say of, e.g., human happiness and it is to JH’s considerable credit that he measures that literature against the (always tentative) conclusions of modern psychological science. Is Plato’s sense of the divided self a good metaphor for human nature and behavior? Is it true that what doesn’t kill us makes us stronger, as Nietzsche argued? How should we look at Emerson’s transcendentalism in light of the common human desire for such experience?Given the fact that the subject is so vast—the nature of man, the nature of man’s quest for happiness, the very nature of ‘happiness’ and the strategies for achieving it—the conclusions are complex. Nevertheless, they can be summarized briefly.As in THE RIGHTEOUS MIND, JH adopts a Humean model in which the Reason is, ultimately, the slave of the passions. Our lives consist of a multiplicity of experiences that rumble about in our consciousness and direct our ‘automatic’ responses to concrete situations. Joshua Reynolds talked about this phenomenon under the rubric of ‘intuition’. Intuition is not a simple, largely-unwarranted gut reaction; it is the sum total of millions of experiences summoned instantly to respond to a current situation. I am standing beside a highway or a city street. Cars are passing by at various rates of speed. I want to get to the other side of the street, quickly, efficiently and safely. I make instant mental calculations and act . . . . Reason, on the other hand, is something that we utilize when we are pressed to find an argument for an intellectual position. It is, in part, a rhetorical device: how can I outwit and defeat my opponent in the most clever and efficacious fashion? JH takes these phenomena and constructs the ongoing metaphor of a man riding an elephant. The elephant is the sum total of the work of the ‘passions’. He is experience, intuitions, inclinations, and so on. The rider is the Reason. He attempts to control the elephant but that process is complex and sometimes arduous. As we are, in a sense, ‘divided’, so is our world and our experience. So are our bodies. The trick is to put all of this together (with a little luck; being in the right place at the right time helps immeasurably). Here is JH’s conclusion:“We were shaped by individual selection to be selfish creatures who struggle for resources, pleasure, and prestige, and we were shaped by group selection to be hive creatures who need love and attachments, and we are industrious creatures with needs for effectance, able to enter a state of vital engagement with our work. We are the rider and we are the elephant, and our mental health depends on the two working together, each drawing on the others’ strengths. . . . . Happiness is not something that you can find, acquire, or achieve directly. You have to get the conditions right and then wait. . . . Just as plants need sun, water, and good soil to thrive, people need love, work, and a connection to something larger. It is worth striving to get the right relationships between yourself and others, between yourself and your work, and between yourself and something larger than yourself” (pp. 238-39).Bottom line: a lovely book that all should read, absorb and enjoy."
121,0465028020,http://goodreads.com/user/show/793094-lisa,4,"Haidt, a UVa professor, systematically explores what conditions make for a happy life. A little too wordy, especially at first, Haidt cites studies and the research of others to back up his ideas. Most of Haidt's hypothesis rang true to me as I listened to his explanations, although some ideas seem counter intuitive at first. Overall interesting and worth reading! If you are in the depths of depression, this book may not be your lifesaver. However if you ponder the concepts listed, you may be able to make adjustments in your behavior that will make life better for you and those around you. I would strongly recommend reading this book with the thought of how you can change your behavior in such a way that will make life better for others--not just yourself."

The book uses various aphorisms and insights from a variety of ancient traditions such as Buddhism, Stoicism, and Christianity as a framing device to discuss various insights in modern research psychology. As a more skeptical soul I was put off by the feel-good, soft-New Agey title, but I'm glad I overcame my bias and gave the book a spin. Highly recommended. "

But of the ""joy"" that comes from religious faith, moral goodness, and even ""testimony of the truth of the gospel, as manifested by the Holy Ghost,"" he has no knowledge, and even puts down people of faith.

132,0465028020,http://goodreads.com/user/show/33599214-suha,5,"This books is a beautiful smooth read that teaches you about 10 great ideas of how ancient teachings would be used to our favor in modern psychology. A bit simplistic, however it is still rich and full of helpful information. The author’s humble tone drives you to listen and trust his words; I loved it, especially the part about divinity and our need for spirituality. Here is the summary if you’d like to know more:About the author:Jonathan Haidt is a social psychologist, he is 52 years old and he is a specialist in emotions and morality. He wrote 2 books: This one ""The Happiness Hypothesis"" and the ""The Righteous Mind: Why Good People are divided by Politics"".Haidt was named one of the top world thinkers by foreign policy and prospect magazine.He wrote this book in 2006, and he describes it as it is about 10 great ideas discovered through civilizations which we can apply in our modern life.Outline:The 10 ideas were:1- The divided Self2- Changing your mind3- Reciprocity with Vengeance4- The Faults of others5- The Pursuit of Happiness6- Love & Attachment7- The Uses of Adversity8- The Felicity of Virtue9- Divinity with or without God10- Happiness comes fromChapter 1: The Divided SelfIn this chapter Haidt speaks about mind versus emotion saying that human thinking depends on metaphor~ speaking that Buddha, Freud and Plato each compared human thinking to an animal ~ elephant and horses. In our days, cars replaced elephants and horses so technology gave people more control over their physical worlds. As a result, when people looked for metaphors, they saw the mind as the driver of the car or a program running on a computer. But if that really was how human dealt with things, why do we keep on doing stupid stuff, why we sometimes do the same damn mistake if we know that we have willpower? Why do people keep on procrastinating while they know what exactly the plan to do things?So here Haidt criticized modern theories of rational choice and he believes that older metaphors work way more beautifully. He utilizes in his entire book a metaphor that I found amazing comparing the human as a rider of an elephant ~ the mind is the rider and the elephant is the emotion. If the elephant is happy and satisfied he will gladly obey your rules and be guided, however, if the elephant wants something there is no power that the rider has can stop him. And this is what Haidt meant by the divided self. The elephant represents temptations, weaknesses and internal conflicts.So why do we have this divided self:a- Mind vs Body: we have an automatic nervous system, like an administrative system that does not need thinking to act.b- Left Vs Right: our brains are split into 2 hemispheres joined by the corpus collusum that are specialized in different tasks - left is for language processing & analytics and right is for patterns in space - with experimenting the 2 hemispheres by Gazzinga a famous psychologist of split brain, he discovered that people fabricate reasons to explain their own behavior- a famous process that he called ""confabulation"" which in one experiment he showed the patient the word ""walk"" so the patient got up and walked and when the psychologist asked him why, he said to get a coke.c- New vs Old: originally the brain had 3 clumps of neurons connected to the spine. Overtime as we evolved the brain expanded more and we developed the neocortex which is the gray matter of the human brain. So we originally were animals governed by primitive emotions and drives until we developed the divine gift of reason of the neocortex. And experiments finding is that human rationality works so well only because our emotional brain works so well.d- Controlled Vs Automatic: so we have 2 systems the controlled vs automatic. Mental processes are mostly automatic without attention consciously ~ walking driving eating ~ The controlled process is limited we can only think consciously about one thing at a time but automatic processes happen in parallel.The automatic system has the dopamine in its hands while the controlled system is more like an advisor. The rider is the control and the elephant is the automatic.When we see a painting and we immediately like it and when someone asks us why we tend not to know how to answer the question with reason. The controlled system can never beat the automatic system by willpower alone. Chapter 2: Changing your mindHaidt proceeds in these 2 chapters showing us how weird our minds are.He says that we have a ""Like-o-Meter"" in which everything we see had to be ranked like or dislike and it is always running even if we are not aware. Experiments reveal, that whenever you see someone with the same name, you suddenly create a bias without you knowing it. And People are more likely to marry people whose names sound like their own. Moreover, humans have negativity bias, which is in our understanding, bad is stronger than good, Responses to threats and unpleasantness are far stronger than responses to opportunities and pleasures. The human mind reacts to bad things more quickly and persistently. The elephant reacts before the rider out of survival, when the elephant sees a snake he runs away whether you like it or not. Haidt speaks about the terminology of ""Cortical Lottery"" :this is the basic nature we are born with. Our frontal cortex has left and right side ~ research says if you have more active left side you are lucky and happy by nature:- Always willing to try something new- If you see a chance you go ahead and take it- When good things happen to you it affects you greatlyHowever if your right side is more active: - You worry about making mistakes  - Criticism hurts you- You feel worried when you do poorly at something- You have many fearsThe author believes that there are 3 ways to change this reality of lottery: 1- Meditation 2- Cognitive Therapy and 3 - ProzacHaidt speaks highly of meditation and he describes it as a pill with no side effects and it tames your elephant. On the other hand, cognitive therapy which is founded in the 60s, is the way to correct erroneous thoughts about yourself called cognitive. Finally, Prozac ~ I loved the humbleness of the author as he describes his own experience with a similar drug. He described it as wonderful, it was like magic he said and his life was amazing however he found it difficult to remember names and facts and that was bad for him in his career. Prozac raises the level of serotonin and makes the neurons adapt to new transmission amd raises the level of the neural growth hormone. The sad news that it is a short cut and it changes personality ~ psychologists call it ""cosmetic psychopharmacology"". Haidt thinks it is overprescribed. He summed up the chapter by mentioning that all these ways should be publicized and can be used by the ones with unlucky frontal cortex. Chapter 3: Reciprocity by VengeanceHaidt here also explores human behavior as we by evolution needed to win by surviving our genes, and gossiping and reciprocating were both results of evolution. Gossiping was an essential facet of human evolution and called ""emotional toolkit"" as without it we’d live in chaos and it is by gossip we make sure that what goes around comes around. Gossip is paired with reciprocity which is the karma working here on earth. Reciprocity is so amazing that sales people who are trying to sell you something give you first a gift. When you receive something for free, part of you might be pleased but another part want to give something in return. This is not limited to material things, but also to stories, if someone tells you a romantic story about his past life, you would feel pressured to do the same. Haidt calls reciprocity a relationship tonic. If used properly it strengthens social ties. For ex when we are interacting with someone we like we have tendency to copy their movesChapter 4: The faults of othersHaidt starts his chapter by saying that we are all hypocrites but we only believe that we are not. We are naive and we have myths of pure evil. There was this experiment that resulted in: people who think are moral are in fact more likely to do the right thing but when the result is against them, they find a way to ignore it and follow their self-interest. This is called ""Moral Hypocrisy"". Curing hypocrisy is very hard because we don’t see there is a problem. Haidt reveals that studies have found that we have an inner lawyer, just like you hire a lawyer that is supposed to defend you no matter what, we have an inner lawyer that defends our actions no matter what. When we are asked difficult questions, we usually choose one stand and then think about the defending answers. So we do have a cognitive mission to support our actions or beliefs. However we are extremely accurate and logical in our perceptions of others however it is our self-perceptions that are extremely disturbed ~ we have insider information. Evidence shows that we judge others by their own behavior but we think we have special data about ourselves. Also the ones with positive delusions about themselves are usually happier healthier and better liked. We also are not only hypocrites and delusional but we also have naive realism: we believe that facts as we see them are there for all to see therefore everyone should agree with us. What can we do about hypocrisy, naive realism, and inner lawyer ~ we should see all this arguing and judging as a game and not take our minds too seriously. Our elephant is always evaluating good or bad. Through meditation we can reach non-judgementalism and through it we might be able to look at our opponents point of view and that he is not entirely crazy. Chapter 5: The pursuit of HappinessHaidt criticizes Buddhism and Stoicism as happiness is not only from within ~ because:1- The progress principle: the happiness of pregoal attainment as you make progress towards your goal you are happier.2- The adaptation principle: we tend to reset our comfort zone to new changes. Our satisfaction resets to 0 - we compare ourselves to others. We recalibrate. we people tend to think that people who are more attractive are happier but in fact they are not - the ones who live in cities they are not - the ones with more money they are not - men are happier because of freedom and power they are not - younger they are not. What Haidt is saying here is that it is not entirely from the outside factors but also from the inside factors and here a formula was developed by psychologists:H=S+C+V, S is the biological set point the frontal cortex, C is the conditions of your life, And V is the voluntary activities that you doSo Biology says S and Buddha says VSo what is related to C:A- noise: if you live in traffic, noise, crowd, you are stressed and unhappy.B- Commuting: people think they buy happiness with space if they move farther from the city however commuting for long hours to and from work with traffic makes you unhappyc- Lack of control: if we can’t control some areas in our lives such as the noise, the electricity the paycheck we are less happyd- Relationships: good relationships make people happier - we cannot adapt to conflicts. Here are all the external matters things we should be striving to make. Psychologist say that there is a state people value more than chocolate after sex. They called it ""Flow"" which is a merger between pleasure and gratification. As for pleasures in life they must be spaced and diversified. Variety is the spice of life because it is the natural enemy of adaptation. Pleasure feels good in the moment but gratification is more lasting, it grants us more flow and it extends our limits. The key to find your own gratification is to know your strengths - Haidt suggests a link of a test to your strengths. So ""V"" can increase your happiness if you use your strengths. He also stresses on acts of kindness especially if you use your strengths in that direction. Note: there are misguided pursuits, a misguided pursuit is to keep up with life and he advises, work less, earn less, accumulate less, and consume more family time, vacations and enjoyable activities. Our elephant cares more about prestige. As a result, internal happiness and peace is necessary in ancient teachings but we also need external things as well to reach out for our goals and ambitions. A combination of old and modern psychology.Chapter 6: Love and attachmentThe author explains the difference between 2 kinds of love the passionate love versus the companionate love and how passion results in instant pleasures whereas the companionate love is more gratifying. When you're in passionate love, you can't think straight it is purely the elephant riding, you are not reasonable and you are at the service of the elephant. It alters parts of the brain just like cocaine and lots of dopamine, it keeps you high. But like any drug, it wears off and it is when you suddenly say oh where did the magic go. Over 6 months the pleasure of passionate versus companionate is way way higher but over 60 years it is the opposite and more stable and grows stronger. The conclusion of this chapter is that we are all ultra social species, we need others by evolution lovers, friends, sharing and attachment. Attachment and relationships can bring us pain ""Hell is other people but so is heaven.""Chapter 7:It speaks about the effect of failures, setback and trauma and the notion that it makes us stronger and more fulfilled. Haidt does not entirely agree with that but he said it is positive because:- It might reveal a challenge of hidden abilities- Filter: it makes know the depth and strength of people who truly care- Trauma changes priorities and philosophies towards the present moment and makes you live them.But: research proves that personality traits are stable pre and post trauma- our traits remain the same.So life goals fall into 4 categories:1- Work & Achievement2- Relationships3- Religion & Spirituality4- Contributing to SocietyWe are shaped by evolution to pursue success and not happiness, we fall into the trap of consuming to reach goals instead of happiness. When trauma happens it makes us fall off the treadmill and forces us to forget about these goals and enjoy what is present. It shatters belief systems and robs people out of the sense of meaning and people try to find back the pieces by seeking god or higher purpose to find grounds. It might be beneficial and it might as well be destructive. The blessed are the ones that can make sense - appreciate life's changes and accept what is. When bad things happen to good people, we have a problem. We know unconsciously that life is not fair but we want to see the world through the lens of reciprocity, the downfall of an evil man is justified but when the victim is virtuous we struggle to make sense of his tragedy. Psychologists have found that optimists benefit from trauma more than pessimists, the ones who won the cortical lottery - high set point habitually look at the bright side. Life has a way to make the rich richer and the happy happier. So, when crisis happens we either:1- Active coping 2- Re appraisal 3- Avoidance coping usually shutting off emotions by drugs drinking or other distractions. Chapter 8: The Felicity of VirtueHe starts this chapter by a nice Buddha quote: ""Set your heart on doing good. Do it over and over again and you will be filled with joy. A fool is happy until his mischief turns against him and a good man may suffer until his goodness flowers"". Here he speaks about the wisdom of the ancients as they emphasize practice and habit rather than knowledge. Modern ethics focused on actions and whether a particular action is right or wrong.Thus turn wit time from character focus to action focus moved populations form virtues towards moral reasoning and that is sad because:* It limits the scope of morality*Relies on bad psychology of training the rider rather than the elephant, the person goes to class, learns how to solve problems and then goes back to his elephant in the evening. We are being taught as riders and not elephants. So Haidt things that we need to work on developing our characters and cultivating our strengths - he lists 24 virtues divided into: wisdom, courage, humanity, justice, temperance, and transcendence. Haidt suggests to work on our strengths and not our weaknesses and we can use them to get around the weaknesses, working on your strengths is already enjoyable. Chapter 9: Divinity with or without GodI love this chapter, It is about the ancient truth that religious people grasp and secular don’t. Haidt speaks about how we evolved to have a religion and it was basically on the logic of disgust. Despite the religious fundamentalism and what it can do to us, we should give respect to religious moral motives. In science, we evolved to be religious out of fear and our longing to have something superior to long for. And as science people were trying to describe the emotion of the feeling of being “religiously high” that he called elevation: physical change in the body – dilation of the chest, motivation and a desire of doing charitable and grateful acts and a characteristic feeling beyond body sensations. Haidt studied this specific emotion and it isn’t just a form of happiness. It is also seen as a response to moral beauty involving pleasant feelings in the chest and to become a better person.An interesting experiment done was to test lactating women in 2 groups – 1 group watched a comedy show, the other watched an elevating clip on Oprah Winfry, the 2nd group showed more milk on the nursing pads of the women, and not only that, the 2nd group women went to nurse their babies and showed more warmth in the way they cuddled them.This elevation is found in anything that makes us feel small or insignificant and is not restricted to the religious people who have an idea of the supernatural. Atheists can have many of the same experiences. On the other hand, there are people stuck in the paradox of the self which keep people locked in the material world unable to see divinity.Life in a society that entirely ignored the ethic of divinity would be ugly and unsatisfying.He ends this chapter by saying if religious people are right in believing that religion is the source of their greatest happiness then maybe the rest of us who are looking for happiness and meaning can learn something from them whether or not we believe in god.Chapter 10: Happiness comes from betweengoing back to his formula H= S+C+V, he speaks about C, and he says that the biggest part of C is Love. C also depends on having and pursuing goals, we have a basic drive to make things happen – satisfaction has to be seen as lying in a considerable series of transactions in a trend of behavior rather than the goal. The optimistic conclusion coming out of research in positive psychology is that most people can get more satisfaction from their work. Step 1: know your strengths, if you can engage your strengths you ll find more gratification in work and if you find gratification in work you will have a more positive approach and in this mindset it will be easier for you to see the bigger picture the contribution you are making to a larger experience. Love & work are crucial to happiness and of course something called harmony and purpose related to the elevation and the belonging to a community. The rituals involving repetitive movement and chanting at the same time help to set up resonance patterns in the brains inducing chemicals. So, it is worth striving to get the right relationships between yourself and others, yourself and your work, yourself and something larger than yourself."
133,0465028020,http://goodreads.com/user/show/103251400-joe-novicki,5,"Happiness is something we all need, yet not all of us can achieve. In the book The Happiness Hypothesis by Johnathan Haidt he uncovers ten things that have made their way through time that all coincide to help our happiness. Drawing on the words of Buddha, Stoic Philosophy, the Bible, and much more we see that there are certain ideas that can make us happy, and certain ideas that can make us unhappy. There are many factors that go into happiness, such as love and relationships, adversity, and divinity with or without god.Through the course of the book, Johnathan Haidt uses a rider and an elephant as a metaphor. This metaphor guides the book in a way that is unparalleled. Personally, I really appreciated the metaphor because it almost summarized the point Johnathan was trying to convey. In the introduction Johnathan first introduces us to this metaphor by explaining it as, “The mind is divided into parts that sometimes conflict. Like a rider on the back of an elephant, the conscious, reasoning part of the brain has only limited control of what the elephant does.” If one can get their conscious rider to work in conjunction with the automatic elephant we can attain a better a better mental health.One of the first things great ideas that Johnathan Haidt discusses is the importance of reciprocity. At the beginning of the book I really couldn’t understand why reciprocity was such an important idea. In reality, reciprocity is one of the biggest things than contribute to ourselves feeling we belong to a society. In this book reciprocity is defined as a social currency that includes the exchange of things with others for mutual benefit. Reciprocity allows me to show that I care about others, want relationships, and can rejuvenate social ties between different people and/or groups of people. This ties beautifully with the metaphor of the elephant and the rider. The elephant is a natural mimic, we mimic others in a sense of reciprocity. He says, “Mimicry is a social glue, a way of saying “We are one"". I found Johnathan’s insight on many ideas to be very interesting and allowed me to view happiness in a different light. Before reading this book I thought happiness to be something you had or you didn’t. After reading this book I see happiness as something we can achieve, all in our own unique way. We can understand happiness through the conditions we find ourselves in, also known as the happiness formula.I personally found the happiness formula to be very interesting. In chapter five, the happiness formula is considered. The happiness formula introduced here is, H = S + C + V. This means that the amount of happiness we experience is determined by our setpoint (S), the current conditions of your life ( C), and the voluntary activities you choose to do. This was especially interesting because many often see your happiness is only linked to your biological setpoint, what you were born into. Voluntary activities and current conditions play a major role in your happiness and mental health. Out of all the great ideas there was one in particular that I found interesting. This was that our “Happiness comes from between”. We have to strive to be happy, we have to work at it, and it doesn't come overnight. Johnathan states, “You have to get the conditions right and then wait.” We have to draw on relationships, we have to draw on our work, we have to draw on something that is greater than ourselves. I really enjoyed this book and the wisdom that accompanied it. There is so much to learn, and everyone can learn something through this book. It will help you understand the concept of ourselves, the concept of our own elephant and rider. Happiness comes from between, it comes from others, and it comes from the unity between the elephant and the rider. "
134,0465028020,http://goodreads.com/user/show/87218797-ajay-solanky,5,"There's something simultaneously seductive and repulsive, sensible and absurd, and enlightened and profane about taking a surgical approach to finding happiness. But hey, it's worth a shot.I believe that everyone spends 99.9% of their time figuring out how to make themselves happy. At the same time, most of us have no idea how to get there. Instead of thrashing around in the dark, why not take a well-reasoned and scientific-ish approach to the problem?Some of the concepts that I found particularly interesting were:- Even from a biological standpoint, we have divided minds. Your rational mind may point one direction, and your subconscious, another. Your rational mind is underpowered relative to the subconscious - it evolved that way.- A lot of what makes us happy (or unhappy) is predetermined by genetics, circumstance, etc. Free will is often illusive.- Meditation, SSRIs, and cognitive therapy are effective tools for happiness. The latter two are heavily stigmatized, but it's worth opening up your mind to the possibility.- There's a difference between activities that give us ""pleasure"" (hedonism) and ""gratification"" (tasks that absorb your attention, erase self-consciousness and engage your strengths). The former is subject to the ""treadmill"" effect (although still important for day-to-day happiness), whereas the latter is key to long-term fulfillment.- ""No man is an island."" We need to find community, and specifically, romantic love in order to be happy. Romantic love can broken down into 2 different types: ""passionate"" and ""companionate"". The former, in a successful relationship, gives way to the latter, and over time the latter is the real bond that provides lasting happiness and stability.- Adversity can be harmful or helpful when it comes to long term happiness. It shapes, strengthens, and hardens us, and under the right conditions, it can lead to ""post-traumatic growth."" The conditions that lead to growth instead of PTSD are subtle, but it seems like those who experience growth are typically optimists (""positive affective style"") who make sense of their adversity and work it in to their life narratives. Adversity can help us align the different layers of our personalities and move forward with a stronger level of ""cross-coherence""- There are biological (and selfish) reasons for altriuism. For adults, especially older adults, altruism can increase long-term self-esteem and happiness because of the role it plays in strengthening their self-narratives.- Spirituality may be an innate biological ""sense"". Profanity and sacredness are the axes along which this dimension travels, and trying to create a connection with divinity (not necessarily in a religious sense - an atheist can try to connect with the universe as a whole) could be an important element for happiness. Perhaps it should be lamented that spirituality and religious tradition has drained slowly from Western culture- Religion is a part of culture. Culture evolved just like genetics, and a Darwinian framework can be applied here to understand the pervasiveness of religion and how it yields great benefits to communities. It makes us more altruistic and group-minded (at least within the group) and helps to create routine and stability and provide positive narratives that are conducive to happiness."
135,0465028020,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5874435-manu,0,"I don't remember how I discovered this book, but when it arrived, I really liked the title. Mostly because of the word ""hypothesis"", because it signals a scientific approach to a challenge. And that's exactly what the book sets out to do - take ten of the best ideas/concepts from history, religious texts and philosophers, and scrutinise it through a science filter. Positive psychology is the genre. The author begins with the idea of the divided self, and then goes deeper. Into the inbuilt ""affective style"" that plays a huge part in one's personality and how that can be changed, the role of reciprocity, and our tendency towards hypocrisy - seeing the small faults in others while ignoring our own bigger ones. At a third of the book, we even come across a formula for happiness, which makes a lot of sense when viewed rationally. My only concern with the book started around this point. The author seemed to have reframed the original thought (happiness) and moved it to meaning, and he didn't let me in on the reasoning. He tries to bridge this in the last chapter, but to me it seemed forced. If that is set aside, the rest of the book does an excellent job of parsing the ""meaning of life"" into two parts and answering the more important one. The author actually spells out the parsing only towards the end - ""why are we here"" and ""how can I find meaning""? But the chapters before that do give a bunch of perspectives on the second - love and attachments, virtue, adversity, and divinity (agnostic of God). There are several ideas that I could take away from the book. Though the metaphor of the elephant and the driver is not original, the idea of approaching them in tandem and making them work towards a harmony has been elaborated well. It also serves as a good reminder that evolution is only interested in our ""success"" (survival) and happiness is only a nice-to-have. The framing of questions as metaphors is also something I found useful. e.g. What is life? Life is like a journey. Another very interesting concept was the the three layers of personality - basic traits, ""characteristic adaptations"" and ""life story"". To me, it provides a clear actionable on how to approach meaning and happiness. The related concept of ""arête"", as well as the nuanced difference between character and personality were also good finds. It takes a lot of intellect, experience and effort to get the Bhagavad Gita, St.Paul, Confucius, Marcus Aurelius, Buddha, Nietzsche, Benjamin Franklin, Epicurus etc to align in a book that's only 240 pages. The good news is that the book does this quite well. "
136,0465028020,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1500718-ryan,4,"I really enjoyed this book, though much of its content is also in Righteous Mind. If you're on the fence, read the latter. But this book is also good.Some new-to-me (or new to my poor memory me) ideas.First, if we view a religion as a method for forming groups, then it's not so surprising to encounter members of a religion that preaches compassion expressing xenophobia.Second, when we enjoy our work, we may have ""vital engagement"" with it, which here seems to mean that we can see a connection between what we're doing and what we aspire to do. When people find that their job loses meaning, perhaps going on to describe their organization as some form of ""evil empire,"" they are losing that cohesion. I've often wondered, however, if it's not the case that all organizations are at least somewhat corrupt compared to their ideal mission, and so I often default to the idea that it's best not to learn ""how the sausage is made."" This is maybe also why administrators make more money--their jobs may, in this sense, probably suck as they are forced to look behind the curtain to do their job.Third, Haidt discusses activities that offer meaning. Conspicuous activities are prone to adaptability, so if we buy a new watch, we'll adapt to its pleasures and soon find it unfulfilling--until we buy a still fancier watch to flaunt. For a long time, activities like volunteering or going for a run were not very conspicuous and seemed to offer a sort of enduring joy. It occurs to me that we now photograph these activities for public consumption on social media. I will ""like"" a picture of someone running once or twice, but eventually I just ignore them. I wonder if we may witness an eroding of such joyful experiences as even voluntourism becomes just another way of ""keeping up with the Joneses.""I liked this book a lot, though I wonder if a student of psychology might not find it poppy. There's a sort of armchair philosophy in this book, too. I was also struck by how often the most acclaimed psychologists seem to become philosophers."
137,0465028020,http://goodreads.com/user/show/38396339-bastard-travel,4,"Half autobiography, half psych 101 class. Haidt revisits all the psychology experiments you've already heard about and ties them together with snippets of philosophers, most of whom you've also already heard of, then talks about either being in college, teaching at college, or going to India (for research. for college.) He's a respectable social psychologist which is almost like being a scientist, and the book is written clearly and accessibly. There are conflicting schools of thought as to where happiness comes from. Obviously, money can't buy it, or why would they keep saying ""money can't buy happiness"" all the time? They must have gotten it from somewhere. Everybody wants it, nobody knows how to get it.Haidt suggests it's a sort of combination of coming from within and coming from without. You've got to cultivate your internal rock garden, if you're Buddhist, or your inner citadel, if you're more an Aurelius kind of guy. You've got to manage expectations and be grateful for what you've got. You've definitely got to drop that goddamn attitude, I'll tell you that right now. Also, you've got to adopt a moral code and stick to it. You'll feel better if you do. You'll be living in accordance with your virtues, and in Current Year we don't have codified morals or virtues, so nobody knows how to act and it makes them miserable and neurotic.You've also got to stop working all the time and spend more of your time with family and friends. Family especially. You've got to make time for hobbies and live within your means, even if that requires you to adjust your stupid daydreams about Lamborghinis and cocaine to something a little cheaper, that could actually contribute to a sense of fulfillment. Waste your money on experiences, not things.In theory, you follow these rules, as confirmed by both modern psychologists and long-dead Romans, and you should be able to land proper happiness for yourself. But remember. This is just a hypothesis.See? Practically a scientist."
138,0465028020,http://goodreads.com/user/show/71924987-payel-kundu,4,"Having read The Righteous Mind, I went into this book already a big fan of Jonathan Haidt. Fans of Haidt will recognize many common themes between this book and TRM. I thought this book was a wonderful and pretty unusual balance of evidence-based theory and practical self-help. It is at once accessible but also jam packed with rigorous scientific commentary. Also, Haidt is a wonderfully clear and organized writer (quick note, the audiobook version of this is terrible, the narrator has an almost impossibly robotic delivery for a human). I learned a lot from reading this book. I’ll list some of the things I found most interesting or surprising below:-baseline happiness has a large genetic component, it’s thought to be 50-80% heritable (though Haidt is quick to show us that this is not a death sentence for those who have not won the cortical lottery. Rather, the focus of the book is in optimally re-training your elephant to make the most of your genetic lot)-people are quite inaccurate at retrospectively introspecting about what makes them happy-If someone experiences either a very bad life event (e.g paralysis from an accident) or a very good life event (e.g winning the lottery), they will likely return to their baseline level of happiness within a few months. External events tend to affect long term happiness very little, counter to what most people intuitThis book covers a lot of the most important work in happiness research over the last several decades and is written from the perspective of a thorough, balanced, and compassionate scientist. Great read. "
139,0465028020,http://goodreads.com/user/show/82034260-nikhil,4,"Finding meaning in what you do combined with the ability to get into a flow state while doing it is the key to happiness. That is an oversimplified summary of this book that uses both religion and research to propose ways to achieve happiness. It shares some of the content on the author's book on morality and I found it a gratifying experience for the most part. He assures us that as in most aspects of psychology, the answer comes from both within and without. It helps a reader to understand different perspectives of both the religious and atheists, as well as liberals and conservatives by drawing on ethics, concepts of divinity, ultrasociality, and adversity. I'd say the most annoying part of this book is the author's insistence on using the elephant rider hypothesis 99 times across 300 pages. That's way too many times to familiarise readers with the instinct and rationale metaphor. The second was his statement that forcing introverts to be outgoing led to a boost in their mood. I looked up the corresponding research and found that the sample consisted entirely of American college students, which sadly makes me question the veracity of his writing. Nonetheless, I found the book to be compelling and informative, so that's still a huge win, slight irritation or no. I'd definitely recommend it to anyone who wants a keener understanding of psychology, philosophy, and all too elusive answers. "
140,0465028020,http://goodreads.com/user/show/64942666-chris-haley,4,"4.5 stars. This book needs to be read in a book club with deep rumination and discussion after each chapter. It may be brilliant, or it may be simply insightful; I haven't decided which. Every chapter was interesting, some were deeply thought-provoking, perhaps a few were even transformative. There was no common thread weaving through the chapters (or at least none that I found), which may be the reason I am struggling to define its impact. But there are many nuggets of wisdom to be found.A sampling of the ideas in this book:- The concept of the rider and the elephant; ancient wisdom validated by modern psychology, a concept discussed at length by other authors such as Daniel Kahneman in Thinking, Fast and Slow- Adversity does not always make us stronger; it depends on our temperament, the timing, and how we respond to it- Religion and science both play important roles in understanding the human condition and finding happiness; the author argues we need more respect given across the aisle- Our society's movement away from teaching virtue is problematic; when every human being has to decide what's right in any given circumstance without a common set of virtues to strive for (e.g., quandary ethics), we are all worse off- H = S + E + V (Happiness = our genetic setpoint + our environment + our voluntary actions)- There are six virtues that are common across almost all religions and organizations: Wisdom, Justice, Courage, Humanity, Temperance, Transcendence- Evolutionary outcomes are dependent on both culture and genetics"

But Daniel Kahneman's book just totally went over my head.This book is way easier to follow and understand.I enjoyed the first half of the book, but it became a bit monotonous towards the end.Especially when he started lingering on the religious aspects, with him being an atheist and all. So it became very much a religion vs science debate with himself.The book had a nice structure, in how the chapters builds up to the conclusion.Did the book change/affect my life in any way? Not really.Worth listening too? I always think that the more you know, the better. And getting some insights into historic thinking compared to modern sciences will always give you something to think about."
142,0465028020,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1717479-terry,5,"Haidt writes a superb book inspecting the nature of happiness, the knobs that affect it. The overall ideas are two fold, that there is consilience between many ancient philosophers and modern neuroscience as to what drives the portion of happiness we can control, and that pharmacology may help us nudge the portion that we can't. The first point is driven by looking at actual studies. Anecdotes are rare and only presented to elucidate a study or research rather than to be taken by itself. The second point is a passionate defense for any number of agents that can change our biochemistry. He refers to choosing to take lithium as ""cosmetic psychopharmacology"" and entirely supportable. Some people have the genetic neurotic switch flipped and we shouldn't socially punish that person for using chemistry to help flip that switch back.I can't recommend this book enough. Most people will get something out of it and Haidt's work avoids the pitfalls common in writing that talks about both neurology and philosophy. Go read it."
143,0465028020,http://goodreads.com/user/show/63426302-alin-pinta,5,"Haidt takes a jetpack, zooms into outer space and allows you to see 'the vast tapestry human culture and see why things are woven in the way that they are'. Exploring the physical, psychological and sociocultural, he seeks hard answers to hard questions.While researching positive psychology for a meta-analysis on the contruction of happiness I came across this book, instantly thinking a title so arrogant to presume to have the answers to such a complex subject must be overselling it. One hour later I was wrapped in awe and wonder, bending page corners and taking quote photos every two minutes.Philosophy drawn from the West and the East is ellegantly blended and applied to modern psychology. Religion, ultrasociability, flow, virtue, adversity, neuroscience, love. I once owned a t-shirt that said 'The search is deeper than you think', but, hell, read this book, dive deep enough and you might even find the meaning of life."
144,0465028020,http://goodreads.com/user/show/10547530-mark,5,"JUST FANTASTIC. I had already read The Righteous Mind and appreciated that, yet it seems to me that the sifting, weighing and balancing among many perspectives is even better in this one. It's research based, which is always important to me, and he pulls from other researchers too. I appreciated the examining of perspectives from across world views and many opposing views, and almost always melding the conclusions in research (and openly stating when it's an opinion). I fully support the idea that ""A good place to look for wisdom, therefore, is where you might least expect to find it; in the minds of your opponents."" This makes fantastic sense as one considers that your knowledge overlaps greatly with your aligned group, and you are likely MISSING things that your opponents see. I HIGHLY recommend this book, and I plan to re-read it soon. (I had borrowed from the Library, but now I'm buying it.)"

However, I now find that the path looks different and I needed something to help me adjust to this alternative route. I started this book lost and looking for purpose and, whilst it didn’t give me all the answers (I wasn’t expecting it to), I think it helped. I liked the mix of old and new philosophy; Haidt has definitely done his homework and there’s something for everyone in this book. Perhaps a bit too much waffle at times, it can be hard to see where each chapter is going and sometimes it doesn’t go anywhere in particular. Nevertheless, it’s a book I could come back to. In the end, ‘our life is the creation of our mind’ and my life continues to evolve in the balance of opposites. "

To sum it up, the big part of being happy are your morals. If you lead a life full of purpose where you take calculated risk that give you just enough level of adversity to make you stronger but not break you, where you engage in healthy relationships with people based on understanding and trust, where you believe in God and have supporting, strong community around with good parenting, and loving family.It's doesn't actually answer the question of what makes one happy it simply brings different ideas, hypotheses and information all together."

His final conclusion is that happiness comes from between “Happiness is not something that you can find, acquire or achieve directly. You have to get the conditions right and wait. Some of those conditions are within you, such as coherence among the parts and levels of your personality. Other conditions require relationships to things beyond you: just as plants need sun, water, and good soil to thrive, people need love, work, and connection to something larger”Very intellectual and yet really easy to read.

On the other hand it was almost depressing? Even though it was a book about achieving happiness? It was overwhelming and left me thinking that I would never reached true happiness without changing everything in my life. I believe that there were a lot of great talking points and that this would be a great book to read with a group of people and discuss how you feel and if you were to adapt any of this into your life. Without a group of people to discuss this I feel its just a bit overwhelming. This is a conversation piece, it really gets the mind thinking. "

The last 2/3 part of the book is not organized at all. He talks about emotion, then jumps to morality, then emotion again. It feels like he was doing his morality research when he wrote this book so his mind just can't help moving towards morality, which is understandable. But, please focus on the topic. His other book The Righteous Mind: Why Good People Are Divided by Politics and Religion has done much better, worth reading.Also, I don't like his definition/judgment of happiness. Happiness is not morality. People have their own definition of happiness and they do have the right to define it. The universal happiness formula is a false proposition."
150,0465028020,http://goodreads.com/user/show/37839735-mason-frierson,5,"“Where does happiness come from? There are several different “happiness hypotheses.” One is that happiness comes from getting what you want, but we all know (and research confirms) that such happiness is short-lived. A more promising hypothesis is that happiness comes from within and cannot be obtained by making the world conform to your desires. This idea was widespread in the ancient world: Buddha in India and the Stoic philosophers in ancient Greece and Rome all counseled people to break their emotional attachments to people and events, which are always unpredictable and uncontrollable, and to cultivate instead an attitude of acceptance. This ancient idea deserves respect, and it is certainly true that changing your mind is usually a more effective response to frustration than is changing the world. However, I will present evidence that this second version of the happiness hypothesis is wrong. Recent research shows that there are some things worth striving for; there are some external conditions of life that can make you lastingly happier. One of these conditions is relatedness—the bonds we form, and need to form, with others. I’ll present research showing where love comes from, why passionate love always cools, and what kind of love is “true” love. I’ll suggest that the happiness hypothesis offered by Buddha and the Stoics should be amended: Happiness comes from within, and happiness comes from without. We need the guidance of both ancient wisdom and modern science to get the balance right.”~ Jonathan Haidt from The Happiness HypothesisI came to this book from Haidt’s wonderful study, THE RIGHTEOUS MIND, which I highly recommend. Given the subject, this book is a bit more diffuse and a little less certain in its conclusions but it is still a wonderful read and an insightful study. It is also a ‘big’ book, i.e. a book that tackles an extremely important subject.I would note, first and foremost, that this is a scholarly book accessible to a wide audience. The writing is lucid and straightforward, jargon-free and not disrupted by endless annotation, charts, graphs and statistics. Most important, perhaps, is its attempt to bring together both psychological science and the humanities. On one page you might receive a report of a study in neuroscience utilizing fMRI technology, on the next the thoughts of Epictetus or Epicurus. While it has often been said that Freud learned as much from literature as from science, that pattern of investigation is now very rare. The ‘psychological sciences’ are now very distinct from the humanities and their work is heavily-funded, empirical science. They associate themselves with the biomedical sciences far more than with the departments of Philosophy or, e.g., Religious Studies. Nevertheless, the literature of reason, wisdom and faith has much to say of, e.g., human happiness and it is to JH’s considerable credit that he measures that literature against the (always tentative) conclusions of modern psychological science. Is Plato’s sense of the divided self a good metaphor for human nature and behavior? Is it true that what doesn’t kill us makes us stronger, as Nietzsche argued? How should we look at Emerson’s transcendentalism in light of the common human desire for such experience?Given the fact that the subject is so vast—the nature of man, the nature of man’s quest for happiness, the very nature of ‘happiness’ and the strategies for achieving it—the conclusions are complex. Nevertheless, they can be summarized briefly.As in THE RIGHTEOUS MIND, JH adopts a Humean model in which the Reason is, ultimately, the slave of the passions. Our lives consist of a multiplicity of experiences that rumble about in our consciousness and direct our ‘automatic’ responses to concrete situations. Joshua Reynolds talked about this phenomenon under the rubric of ‘intuition’. Intuition is not a simple, largely-unwarranted gut reaction; it is the sum total of millions of experiences summoned instantly to respond to a current situation. I am standing beside a highway or a city street. Cars are passing by at various rates of speed. I want to get to the other side of the street, quickly, efficiently and safely. I make instant mental calculations and act . . . . Reason, on the other hand, is something that we utilize when we are pressed to find an argument for an intellectual position. It is, in part, a rhetorical device: how can I outwit and defeat my opponent in the most clever and efficacious fashion? JH takes these phenomena and constructs the ongoing metaphor of a man riding an elephant. The elephant is the sum total of the work of the ‘passions’. He is experience, intuitions, inclinations, and so on. The rider is the Reason. He attempts to control the elephant but that process is complex and sometimes arduous. As we are, in a sense, ‘divided’, so is our world and our experience. So are our bodies. The trick is to put all of this together (with a little luck; being in the right place at the right time helps immeasurably). Here is JH’s conclusion:“We were shaped by individual selection to be selfish creatures who struggle for resources, pleasure, and prestige, and we were shaped by group selection to be hive creatures who need love and attachments, and we are industrious creatures with needs for effectance, able to enter a state of vital engagement with our work. We are the rider and we are the elephant, and our mental health depends on the two working together, each drawing on the others’ strengths. . . . . Happiness is not something that you can find, acquire, or achieve directly. You have to get the conditions right and then wait. . . . Just as plants need sun, water, and good soil to thrive, people need love, work, and a connection to something larger. It is worth striving to get the right relationships between yourself and others, between yourself and your work, and between yourself and something larger than yourself” (pp. 238-39).Bottom line: a lovely book that all should read, absorb and enjoy."

A little too wordy, especially at first, Haidt cites studies and the research of others to back up his ideas. Most of Haidt's hypothesis rang true to me as I listened to his explanations, although some ideas seem counter intuitive at first. Overall interesting and worth reading! If you are in the depths of depression, this book may not be your lifesaver. However if you ponder the concepts listed, you may be able to make adjustments in your behavior that will make life better for you and those around you. I would strongly recommend reading this book with the thought of how you can change your behavior in such a way that will make life better for others--not just yourself."

The book uses various aphorisms and insights from a variety of ancient traditions such as Buddhism, Stoicism, and Christianity as a framing device to discuss various insights in modern research psychology. As a more skeptical soul I was put off by the feel-good, soft-New Agey title, but I'm glad I overcame my bias and gave the book a spin. Highly recommended. "

But of the ""joy"" that comes from religious faith, moral goodness, and even ""testimony of the truth of the gospel, as manifested by the Holy Ghost,"" he has no knowledge, and even puts down people of faith. Read the Book of Mormon and test it as Moroni challenges in Moroni chapter 10, verse 4."

My copy now has many underlined passages in it, I look forward to flipping through it again in future."

The concept of the divided self (with elephant and rider analogy), Happiness hypothesis (H=S+C+V), and most unexpectedly, the chapter on divinity (flatland and spaceland) left me thinking."

162,0465028020,http://goodreads.com/user/show/33599214-suha,5,"This books is a beautiful smooth read that teaches you about 10 great ideas of how ancient teachings would be used to our favor in modern psychology. A bit simplistic, however it is still rich and full of helpful information. The author’s humble tone drives you to listen and trust his words; I loved it, especially the part about divinity and our need for spirituality. Here is the summary if you’d like to know more:About the author:Jonathan Haidt is a social psychologist, he is 52 years old and he is a specialist in emotions and morality. He wrote 2 books: This one ""The Happiness Hypothesis"" and the ""The Righteous Mind: Why Good People are divided by Politics"".Haidt was named one of the top world thinkers by foreign policy and prospect magazine.He wrote this book in 2006, and he describes it as it is about 10 great ideas discovered through civilizations which we can apply in our modern life.Outline:The 10 ideas were:1- The divided Self2- Changing your mind3- Reciprocity with Vengeance4- The Faults of others5- The Pursuit of Happiness6- Love & Attachment7- The Uses of Adversity8- The Felicity of Virtue9- Divinity with or without God10- Happiness comes fromChapter 1: The Divided SelfIn this chapter Haidt speaks about mind versus emotion saying that human thinking depends on metaphor~ speaking that Buddha, Freud and Plato each compared human thinking to an animal ~ elephant and horses. In our days, cars replaced elephants and horses so technology gave people more control over their physical worlds. As a result, when people looked for metaphors, they saw the mind as the driver of the car or a program running on a computer. But if that really was how human dealt with things, why do we keep on doing stupid stuff, why we sometimes do the same damn mistake if we know that we have willpower? Why do people keep on procrastinating while they know what exactly the plan to do things?So here Haidt criticized modern theories of rational choice and he believes that older metaphors work way more beautifully. He utilizes in his entire book a metaphor that I found amazing comparing the human as a rider of an elephant ~ the mind is the rider and the elephant is the emotion. If the elephant is happy and satisfied he will gladly obey your rules and be guided, however, if the elephant wants something there is no power that the rider has can stop him. And this is what Haidt meant by the divided self. The elephant represents temptations, weaknesses and internal conflicts.So why do we have this divided self:a- Mind vs Body: we have an automatic nervous system, like an administrative system that does not need thinking to act.b- Left Vs Right: our brains are split into 2 hemispheres joined by the corpus collusum that are specialized in different tasks - left is for language processing & analytics and right is for patterns in space - with experimenting the 2 hemispheres by Gazzinga a famous psychologist of split brain, he discovered that people fabricate reasons to explain their own behavior- a famous process that he called ""confabulation"" which in one experiment he showed the patient the word ""walk"" so the patient got up and walked and when the psychologist asked him why, he said to get a coke.c- New vs Old: originally the brain had 3 clumps of neurons connected to the spine. Overtime as we evolved the brain expanded more and we developed the neocortex which is the gray matter of the human brain. So we originally were animals governed by primitive emotions and drives until we developed the divine gift of reason of the neocortex. And experiments finding is that human rationality works so well only because our emotional brain works so well.d- Controlled Vs Automatic: so we have 2 systems the controlled vs automatic. Mental processes are mostly automatic without attention consciously ~ walking driving eating ~ The controlled process is limited we can only think consciously about one thing at a time but automatic processes happen in parallel.The automatic system has the dopamine in its hands while the controlled system is more like an advisor. The rider is the control and the elephant is the automatic.When we see a painting and we immediately like it and when someone asks us why we tend not to know how to answer the question with reason. The controlled system can never beat the automatic system by willpower alone. Chapter 2: Changing your mindHaidt proceeds in these 2 chapters showing us how weird our minds are.He says that we have a ""Like-o-Meter"" in which everything we see had to be ranked like or dislike and it is always running even if we are not aware. Experiments reveal, that whenever you see someone with the same name, you suddenly create a bias without you knowing it. And People are more likely to marry people whose names sound like their own. Moreover, humans have negativity bias, which is in our understanding, bad is stronger than good, Responses to threats and unpleasantness are far stronger than responses to opportunities and pleasures. The human mind reacts to bad things more quickly and persistently. The elephant reacts before the rider out of survival, when the elephant sees a snake he runs away whether you like it or not. Haidt speaks about the terminology of ""Cortical Lottery"" :this is the basic nature we are born with. Our frontal cortex has left and right side ~ research says if you have more active left side you are lucky and happy by nature:- Always willing to try something new- If you see a chance you go ahead and take it- When good things happen to you it affects you greatlyHowever if your right side is more active: - You worry about making mistakes  - Criticism hurts you- You feel worried when you do poorly at something- You have many fearsThe author believes that there are 3 ways to change this reality of lottery: 1- Meditation 2- Cognitive Therapy and 3 - ProzacHaidt speaks highly of meditation and he describes it as a pill with no side effects and it tames your elephant. On the other hand, cognitive therapy which is founded in the 60s, is the way to correct erroneous thoughts about yourself called cognitive. Finally, Prozac ~ I loved the humbleness of the author as he describes his own experience with a similar drug. He described it as wonderful, it was like magic he said and his life was amazing however he found it difficult to remember names and facts and that was bad for him in his career. Prozac raises the level of serotonin and makes the neurons adapt to new transmission amd raises the level of the neural growth hormone. The sad news that it is a short cut and it changes personality ~ psychologists call it ""cosmetic psychopharmacology"". Haidt thinks it is overprescribed. He summed up the chapter by mentioning that all these ways should be publicized and can be used by the ones with unlucky frontal cortex. Chapter 3: Reciprocity by VengeanceHaidt here also explores human behavior as we by evolution needed to win by surviving our genes, and gossiping and reciprocating were both results of evolution. Gossiping was an essential facet of human evolution and called ""emotional toolkit"" as without it we’d live in chaos and it is by gossip we make sure that what goes around comes around. Gossip is paired with reciprocity which is the karma working here on earth. Reciprocity is so amazing that sales people who are trying to sell you something give you first a gift. When you receive something for free, part of you might be pleased but another part want to give something in return. This is not limited to material things, but also to stories, if someone tells you a romantic story about his past life, you would feel pressured to do the same. Haidt calls reciprocity a relationship tonic. If used properly it strengthens social ties. For ex when we are interacting with someone we like we have tendency to copy their movesChapter 4: The faults of othersHaidt starts his chapter by saying that we are all hypocrites but we only believe that we are not. We are naive and we have myths of pure evil. There was this experiment that resulted in: people who think are moral are in fact more likely to do the right thing but when the result is against them, they find a way to ignore it and follow their self-interest. This is called ""Moral Hypocrisy"". Curing hypocrisy is very hard because we don’t see there is a problem. Haidt reveals that studies have found that we have an inner lawyer, just like you hire a lawyer that is supposed to defend you no matter what, we have an inner lawyer that defends our actions no matter what. When we are asked difficult questions, we usually choose one stand and then think about the defending answers. So we do have a cognitive mission to support our actions or beliefs. However we are extremely accurate and logical in our perceptions of others however it is our self-perceptions that are extremely disturbed ~ we have insider information. Evidence shows that we judge others by their own behavior but we think we have special data about ourselves. Also the ones with positive delusions about themselves are usually happier healthier and better liked. We also are not only hypocrites and delusional but we also have naive realism: we believe that facts as we see them are there for all to see therefore everyone should agree with us. What can we do about hypocrisy, naive realism, and inner lawyer ~ we should see all this arguing and judging as a game and not take our minds too seriously. Our elephant is always evaluating good or bad. Through meditation we can reach non-judgementalism and through it we might be able to look at our opponents point of view and that he is not entirely crazy. Chapter 5: The pursuit of HappinessHaidt criticizes Buddhism and Stoicism as happiness is not only from within ~ because:1- The progress principle: the happiness of pregoal attainment as you make progress towards your goal you are happier.2- The adaptation principle: we tend to reset our comfort zone to new changes. Our satisfaction resets to 0 - we compare ourselves to others. We recalibrate. we people tend to think that people who are more attractive are happier but in fact they are not - the ones who live in cities they are not - the ones with more money they are not - men are happier because of freedom and power they are not - younger they are not. What Haidt is saying here is that it is not entirely from the outside factors but also from the inside factors and here a formula was developed by psychologists:H=S+C+V, S is the biological set point the frontal cortex, C is the conditions of your life, And V is the voluntary activities that you doSo Biology says S and Buddha says VSo what is related to C:A- noise: if you live in traffic, noise, crowd, you are stressed and unhappy.B- Commuting: people think they buy happiness with space if they move farther from the city however commuting for long hours to and from work with traffic makes you unhappyc- Lack of control: if we can’t control some areas in our lives such as the noise, the electricity the paycheck we are less happyd- Relationships: good relationships make people happier - we cannot adapt to conflicts. Here are all the external matters things we should be striving to make. Psychologist say that there is a state people value more than chocolate after sex. They called it ""Flow"" which is a merger between pleasure and gratification. As for pleasures in life they must be spaced and diversified. Variety is the spice of life because it is the natural enemy of adaptation. Pleasure feels good in the moment but gratification is more lasting, it grants us more flow and it extends our limits. The key to find your own gratification is to know your strengths - Haidt suggests a link of a test to your strengths. So ""V"" can increase your happiness if you use your strengths. He also stresses on acts of kindness especially if you use your strengths in that direction. Note: there are misguided pursuits, a misguided pursuit is to keep up with life and he advises, work less, earn less, accumulate less, and consume more family time, vacations and enjoyable activities. Our elephant cares more about prestige. As a result, internal happiness and peace is necessary in ancient teachings but we also need external things as well to reach out for our goals and ambitions. A combination of old and modern psychology.Chapter 6: Love and attachmentThe author explains the difference between 2 kinds of love the passionate love versus the companionate love and how passion results in instant pleasures whereas the companionate love is more gratifying. When you're in passionate love, you can't think straight it is purely the elephant riding, you are not reasonable and you are at the service of the elephant. It alters parts of the brain just like cocaine and lots of dopamine, it keeps you high. But like any drug, it wears off and it is when you suddenly say oh where did the magic go. Over 6 months the pleasure of passionate versus companionate is way way higher but over 60 years it is the opposite and more stable and grows stronger. The conclusion of this chapter is that we are all ultra social species, we need others by evolution lovers, friends, sharing and attachment. Attachment and relationships can bring us pain ""Hell is other people but so is heaven.""Chapter 7:It speaks about the effect of failures, setback and trauma and the notion that it makes us stronger and more fulfilled. Haidt does not entirely agree with that but he said it is positive because:- It might reveal a challenge of hidden abilities- Filter: it makes know the depth and strength of people who truly care- Trauma changes priorities and philosophies towards the present moment and makes you live them.But: research proves that personality traits are stable pre and post trauma- our traits remain the same.So life goals fall into 4 categories:1- Work & Achievement2- Relationships3- Religion & Spirituality4- Contributing to SocietyWe are shaped by evolution to pursue success and not happiness, we fall into the trap of consuming to reach goals instead of happiness. When trauma happens it makes us fall off the treadmill and forces us to forget about these goals and enjoy what is present. It shatters belief systems and robs people out of the sense of meaning and people try to find back the pieces by seeking god or higher purpose to find grounds. It might be beneficial and it might as well be destructive. The blessed are the ones that can make sense - appreciate life's changes and accept what is. When bad things happen to good people, we have a problem. We know unconsciously that life is not fair but we want to see the world through the lens of reciprocity, the downfall of an evil man is justified but when the victim is virtuous we struggle to make sense of his tragedy. Psychologists have found that optimists benefit from trauma more than pessimists, the ones who won the cortical lottery - high set point habitually look at the bright side. Life has a way to make the rich richer and the happy happier. So, when crisis happens we either:1- Active coping 2- Re appraisal 3- Avoidance coping usually shutting off emotions by drugs drinking or other distractions. Chapter 8: The Felicity of VirtueHe starts this chapter by a nice Buddha quote: ""Set your heart on doing good. Do it over and over again and you will be filled with joy. A fool is happy until his mischief turns against him and a good man may suffer until his goodness flowers"". Here he speaks about the wisdom of the ancients as they emphasize practice and habit rather than knowledge. Modern ethics focused on actions and whether a particular action is right or wrong.Thus turn wit time from character focus to action focus moved populations form virtues towards moral reasoning and that is sad because:* It limits the scope of morality*Relies on bad psychology of training the rider rather than the elephant, the person goes to class, learns how to solve problems and then goes back to his elephant in the evening. We are being taught as riders and not elephants. So Haidt things that we need to work on developing our characters and cultivating our strengths - he lists 24 virtues divided into: wisdom, courage, humanity, justice, temperance, and transcendence. Haidt suggests to work on our strengths and not our weaknesses and we can use them to get around the weaknesses, working on your strengths is already enjoyable. Chapter 9: Divinity with or without GodI love this chapter, It is about the ancient truth that religious people grasp and secular don’t. Haidt speaks about how we evolved to have a religion and it was basically on the logic of disgust. Despite the religious fundamentalism and what it can do to us, we should give respect to religious moral motives. In science, we evolved to be religious out of fear and our longing to have something superior to long for. And as science people were trying to describe the emotion of the feeling of being “religiously high” that he called elevation: physical change in the body – dilation of the chest, motivation and a desire of doing charitable and grateful acts and a characteristic feeling beyond body sensations. Haidt studied this specific emotion and it isn’t just a form of happiness. It is also seen as a response to moral beauty involving pleasant feelings in the chest and to become a better person.An interesting experiment done was to test lactating women in 2 groups – 1 group watched a comedy show, the other watched an elevating clip on Oprah Winfry, the 2nd group showed more milk on the nursing pads of the women, and not only that, the 2nd group women went to nurse their babies and showed more warmth in the way they cuddled them.This elevation is found in anything that makes us feel small or insignificant and is not restricted to the religious people who have an idea of the supernatural. Atheists can have many of the same experiences. On the other hand, there are people stuck in the paradox of the self which keep people locked in the material world unable to see divinity.Life in a society that entirely ignored the ethic of divinity would be ugly and unsatisfying.He ends this chapter by saying if religious people are right in believing that religion is the source of their greatest happiness then maybe the rest of us who are looking for happiness and meaning can learn something from them whether or not we believe in god.Chapter 10: Happiness comes from betweengoing back to his formula H= S+C+V, he speaks about C, and he says that the biggest part of C is Love. C also depends on having and pursuing goals, we have a basic drive to make things happen – satisfaction has to be seen as lying in a considerable series of transactions in a trend of behavior rather than the goal. The optimistic conclusion coming out of research in positive psychology is that most people can get more satisfaction from their work. Step 1: know your strengths, if you can engage your strengths you ll find more gratification in work and if you find gratification in work you will have a more positive approach and in this mindset it will be easier for you to see the bigger picture the contribution you are making to a larger experience. Love & work are crucial to happiness and of course something called harmony and purpose related to the elevation and the belonging to a community. The rituals involving repetitive movement and chanting at the same time help to set up resonance patterns in the brains inducing chemicals. So, it is worth striving to get the right relationships between yourself and others, yourself and your work, yourself and something larger than yourself."
163,0465028020,http://goodreads.com/user/show/103251400-joe-novicki,5,"Happiness is something we all need, yet not all of us can achieve. In the book The Happiness Hypothesis by Johnathan Haidt he uncovers ten things that have made their way through time that all coincide to help our happiness. Drawing on the words of Buddha, Stoic Philosophy, the Bible, and much more we see that there are certain ideas that can make us happy, and certain ideas that can make us unhappy. There are many factors that go into happiness, such as love and relationships, adversity, and divinity with or without god.Through the course of the book, Johnathan Haidt uses a rider and an elephant as a metaphor. This metaphor guides the book in a way that is unparalleled. Personally, I really appreciated the metaphor because it almost summarized the point Johnathan was trying to convey. In the introduction Johnathan first introduces us to this metaphor by explaining it as, “The mind is divided into parts that sometimes conflict. Like a rider on the back of an elephant, the conscious, reasoning part of the brain has only limited control of what the elephant does.” If one can get their conscious rider to work in conjunction with the automatic elephant we can attain a better a better mental health.One of the first things great ideas that Johnathan Haidt discusses is the importance of reciprocity. At the beginning of the book I really couldn’t understand why reciprocity was such an important idea. In reality, reciprocity is one of the biggest things than contribute to ourselves feeling we belong to a society. In this book reciprocity is defined as a social currency that includes the exchange of things with others for mutual benefit. Reciprocity allows me to show that I care about others, want relationships, and can rejuvenate social ties between different people and/or groups of people. This ties beautifully with the metaphor of the elephant and the rider. The elephant is a natural mimic, we mimic others in a sense of reciprocity. He says, “Mimicry is a social glue, a way of saying “We are one"". I found Johnathan’s insight on many ideas to be very interesting and allowed me to view happiness in a different light. Before reading this book I thought happiness to be something you had or you didn’t. After reading this book I see happiness as something we can achieve, all in our own unique way. We can understand happiness through the conditions we find ourselves in, also known as the happiness formula.I personally found the happiness formula to be very interesting. In chapter five, the happiness formula is considered. The happiness formula introduced here is, H = S + C + V. This means that the amount of happiness we experience is determined by our setpoint (S), the current conditions of your life ( C), and the voluntary activities you choose to do. This was especially interesting because many often see your happiness is only linked to your biological setpoint, what you were born into. Voluntary activities and current conditions play a major role in your happiness and mental health. Out of all the great ideas there was one in particular that I found interesting. This was that our “Happiness comes from between”. We have to strive to be happy, we have to work at it, and it doesn't come overnight. Johnathan states, “You have to get the conditions right and then wait.” We have to draw on relationships, we have to draw on our work, we have to draw on something that is greater than ourselves. I really enjoyed this book and the wisdom that accompanied it. There is so much to learn, and everyone can learn something through this book. It will help you understand the concept of ourselves, the concept of our own elephant and rider. Happiness comes from between, it comes from others, and it comes from the unity between the elephant and the rider. "
164,0465028020,http://goodreads.com/user/show/87218797-ajay-solanky,5,"There's something simultaneously seductive and repulsive, sensible and absurd, and enlightened and profane about taking a surgical approach to finding happiness. But hey, it's worth a shot.I believe that everyone spends 99.9% of their time figuring out how to make themselves happy. At the same time, most of us have no idea how to get there. Instead of thrashing around in the dark, why not take a well-reasoned and scientific-ish approach to the problem?Some of the concepts that I found particularly interesting were:- Even from a biological standpoint, we have divided minds. Your rational mind may point one direction, and your subconscious, another. Your rational mind is underpowered relative to the subconscious - it evolved that way.- A lot of what makes us happy (or unhappy) is predetermined by genetics, circumstance, etc. Free will is often illusive.- Meditation, SSRIs, and cognitive therapy are effective tools for happiness. The latter two are heavily stigmatized, but it's worth opening up your mind to the possibility.- There's a difference between activities that give us ""pleasure"" (hedonism) and ""gratification"" (tasks that absorb your attention, erase self-consciousness and engage your strengths). The former is subject to the ""treadmill"" effect (although still important for day-to-day happiness), whereas the latter is key to long-term fulfillment.- ""No man is an island."" We need to find community, and specifically, romantic love in order to be happy. Romantic love can broken down into 2 different types: ""passionate"" and ""companionate"". The former, in a successful relationship, gives way to the latter, and over time the latter is the real bond that provides lasting happiness and stability.- Adversity can be harmful or helpful when it comes to long term happiness. It shapes, strengthens, and hardens us, and under the right conditions, it can lead to ""post-traumatic growth."" The conditions that lead to growth instead of PTSD are subtle, but it seems like those who experience growth are typically optimists (""positive affective style"") who make sense of their adversity and work it in to their life narratives. Adversity can help us align the different layers of our personalities and move forward with a stronger level of ""cross-coherence""- There are biological (and selfish) reasons for altriuism. For adults, especially older adults, altruism can increase long-term self-esteem and happiness because of the role it plays in strengthening their self-narratives.- Spirituality may be an innate biological ""sense"". Profanity and sacredness are the axes along which this dimension travels, and trying to create a connection with divinity (not necessarily in a religious sense - an atheist can try to connect with the universe as a whole) could be an important element for happiness. Perhaps it should be lamented that spirituality and religious tradition has drained slowly from Western culture- Religion is a part of culture. Culture evolved just like genetics, and a Darwinian framework can be applied here to understand the pervasiveness of religion and how it yields great benefits to communities. It makes us more altruistic and group-minded (at least within the group) and helps to create routine and stability and provide positive narratives that are conducive to happiness."
165,0465028020,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5874435-manu,0,"I don't remember how I discovered this book, but when it arrived, I really liked the title. Mostly because of the word ""hypothesis"", because it signals a scientific approach to a challenge. And that's exactly what the book sets out to do - take ten of the best ideas/concepts from history, religious texts and philosophers, and scrutinise it through a science filter. Positive psychology is the genre. The author begins with the idea of the divided self, and then goes deeper. Into the inbuilt ""affective style"" that plays a huge part in one's personality and how that can be changed, the role of reciprocity, and our tendency towards hypocrisy - seeing the small faults in others while ignoring our own bigger ones. At a third of the book, we even come across a formula for happiness, which makes a lot of sense when viewed rationally. My only concern with the book started around this point. The author seemed to have reframed the original thought (happiness) and moved it to meaning, and he didn't let me in on the reasoning. He tries to bridge this in the last chapter, but to me it seemed forced. If that is set aside, the rest of the book does an excellent job of parsing the ""meaning of life"" into two parts and answering the more important one. The author actually spells out the parsing only towards the end - ""why are we here"" and ""how can I find meaning""? But the chapters before that do give a bunch of perspectives on the second - love and attachments, virtue, adversity, and divinity (agnostic of God). There are several ideas that I could take away from the book. Though the metaphor of the elephant and the driver is not original, the idea of approaching them in tandem and making them work towards a harmony has been elaborated well. It also serves as a good reminder that evolution is only interested in our ""success"" (survival) and happiness is only a nice-to-have. The framing of questions as metaphors is also something I found useful. e.g. What is life? Life is like a journey. Another very interesting concept was the the three layers of personality - basic traits, ""characteristic adaptations"" and ""life story"". To me, it provides a clear actionable on how to approach meaning and happiness. The related concept of ""arête"", as well as the nuanced difference between character and personality were also good finds. It takes a lot of intellect, experience and effort to get the Bhagavad Gita, St.Paul, Confucius, Marcus Aurelius, Buddha, Nietzsche, Benjamin Franklin, Epicurus etc to align in a book that's only 240 pages. The good news is that the book does this quite well. "
166,0465028020,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1500718-ryan,4,"I really enjoyed this book, though much of its content is also in Righteous Mind. If you're on the fence, read the latter. But this book is also good.Some new-to-me (or new to my poor memory me) ideas.First, if we view a religion as a method for forming groups, then it's not so surprising to encounter members of a religion that preaches compassion expressing xenophobia.Second, when we enjoy our work, we may have ""vital engagement"" with it, which here seems to mean that we can see a connection between what we're doing and what we aspire to do. When people find that their job loses meaning, perhaps going on to describe their organization as some form of ""evil empire,"" they are losing that cohesion. I've often wondered, however, if it's not the case that all organizations are at least somewhat corrupt compared to their ideal mission, and so I often default to the idea that it's best not to learn ""how the sausage is made."" This is maybe also why administrators make more money--their jobs may, in this sense, probably suck as they are forced to look behind the curtain to do their job.Third, Haidt discusses activities that offer meaning. Conspicuous activities are prone to adaptability, so if we buy a new watch, we'll adapt to its pleasures and soon find it unfulfilling--until we buy a still fancier watch to flaunt. For a long time, activities like volunteering or going for a run were not very conspicuous and seemed to offer a sort of enduring joy. It occurs to me that we now photograph these activities for public consumption on social media. I will ""like"" a picture of someone running once or twice, but eventually I just ignore them. I wonder if we may witness an eroding of such joyful experiences as even voluntourism becomes just another way of ""keeping up with the Joneses.""I liked this book a lot, though I wonder if a student of psychology might not find it poppy. There's a sort of armchair philosophy in this book, too. I was also struck by how often the most acclaimed psychologists seem to become philosophers."
167,0465028020,http://goodreads.com/user/show/38396339-bastard-travel,4,"Half autobiography, half psych 101 class. Haidt revisits all the psychology experiments you've already heard about and ties them together with snippets of philosophers, most of whom you've also already heard of, then talks about either being in college, teaching at college, or going to India (for research. for college.) He's a respectable social psychologist which is almost like being a scientist, and the book is written clearly and accessibly. There are conflicting schools of thought as to where happiness comes from. Obviously, money can't buy it, or why would they keep saying ""money can't buy happiness"" all the time? They must have gotten it from somewhere. Everybody wants it, nobody knows how to get it.Haidt suggests it's a sort of combination of coming from within and coming from without. You've got to cultivate your internal rock garden, if you're Buddhist, or your inner citadel, if you're more an Aurelius kind of guy. You've got to manage expectations and be grateful for what you've got. You've definitely got to drop that goddamn attitude, I'll tell you that right now. Also, you've got to adopt a moral code and stick to it. You'll feel better if you do. You'll be living in accordance with your virtues, and in Current Year we don't have codified morals or virtues, so nobody knows how to act and it makes them miserable and neurotic.You've also got to stop working all the time and spend more of your time with family and friends. Family especially. You've got to make time for hobbies and live within your means, even if that requires you to adjust your stupid daydreams about Lamborghinis and cocaine to something a little cheaper, that could actually contribute to a sense of fulfillment. Waste your money on experiences, not things.In theory, you follow these rules, as confirmed by both modern psychologists and long-dead Romans, and you should be able to land proper happiness for yourself. But remember. This is just a hypothesis.See? Practically a scientist."
168,0465028020,http://goodreads.com/user/show/71924987-payel-kundu,4,"Having read The Righteous Mind, I went into this book already a big fan of Jonathan Haidt. Fans of Haidt will recognize many common themes between this book and TRM. I thought this book was a wonderful and pretty unusual balance of evidence-based theory and practical self-help. It is at once accessible but also jam packed with rigorous scientific commentary. Also, Haidt is a wonderfully clear and organized writer (quick note, the audiobook version of this is terrible, the narrator has an almost impossibly robotic delivery for a human). I learned a lot from reading this book. I’ll list some of the things I found most interesting or surprising below:-baseline happiness has a large genetic component, it’s thought to be 50-80% heritable (though Haidt is quick to show us that this is not a death sentence for those who have not won the cortical lottery. Rather, the focus of the book is in optimally re-training your elephant to make the most of your genetic lot)-people are quite inaccurate at retrospectively introspecting about what makes them happy-If someone experiences either a very bad life event (e.g paralysis from an accident) or a very good life event (e.g winning the lottery), they will likely return to their baseline level of happiness within a few months. External events tend to affect long term happiness very little, counter to what most people intuitThis book covers a lot of the most important work in happiness research over the last several decades and is written from the perspective of a thorough, balanced, and compassionate scientist. Great read. "
169,0465028020,http://goodreads.com/user/show/82034260-nikhil,4,"Finding meaning in what you do combined with the ability to get into a flow state while doing it is the key to happiness. That is an oversimplified summary of this book that uses both religion and research to propose ways to achieve happiness. It shares some of the content on the author's book on morality and I found it a gratifying experience for the most part. He assures us that as in most aspects of psychology, the answer comes from both within and without. It helps a reader to understand different perspectives of both the religious and atheists, as well as liberals and conservatives by drawing on ethics, concepts of divinity, ultrasociality, and adversity. I'd say the most annoying part of this book is the author's insistence on using the elephant rider hypothesis 99 times across 300 pages. That's way too many times to familiarise readers with the instinct and rationale metaphor. The second was his statement that forcing introverts to be outgoing led to a boost in their mood. I looked up the corresponding research and found that the sample consisted entirely of American college students, which sadly makes me question the veracity of his writing. Nonetheless, I found the book to be compelling and informative, so that's still a huge win, slight irritation or no. I'd definitely recommend it to anyone who wants a keener understanding of psychology, philosophy, and all too elusive answers. "
170,0465028020,http://goodreads.com/user/show/64942666-chris-haley,4,"4.5 stars. This book needs to be read in a book club with deep rumination and discussion after each chapter. It may be brilliant, or it may be simply insightful; I haven't decided which. Every chapter was interesting, some were deeply thought-provoking, perhaps a few were even transformative. There was no common thread weaving through the chapters (or at least none that I found), which may be the reason I am struggling to define its impact. But there are many nuggets of wisdom to be found.A sampling of the ideas in this book:- The concept of the rider and the elephant; ancient wisdom validated by modern psychology, a concept discussed at length by other authors such as Daniel Kahneman in Thinking, Fast and Slow- Adversity does not always make us stronger; it depends on our temperament, the timing, and how we respond to it- Religion and science both play important roles in understanding the human condition and finding happiness; the author argues we need more respect given across the aisle- Our society's movement away from teaching virtue is problematic; when every human being has to decide what's right in any given circumstance without a common set of virtues to strive for (e.g., quandary ethics), we are all worse off- H = S + E + V (Happiness = our genetic setpoint + our environment + our voluntary actions)- There are six virtues that are common across almost all religions and organizations: Wisdom, Justice, Courage, Humanity, Temperance, Transcendence- Evolutionary outcomes are dependent on both culture and genetics"
171,0465028020,http://goodreads.com/user/show/21091961-jacques-bezuidenhout,3,"A book taking some ancient Wisdoms and applying some modern Science / Psychology to determine what it is that makes us happy.This is not a self-help type book, but rather an easy to understand study.I've previously listened to Thinking, Fast and Slow, which focuses on very much the same content. But Daniel Kahneman's book just totally went over my head.This book is way easier to follow and understand.I enjoyed the first half of the book, but it became a bit monotonous towards the end.Especially when he started lingering on the religious aspects, with him being an atheist and all. So it became very much a religion vs science debate with himself.The book had a nice structure, in how the chapters builds up to the conclusion.Did the book change/affect my life in any way? Not really.Worth listening too? I always think that the more you know, the better. And getting some insights into historic thinking compared to modern sciences will always give you something to think about."
172,0465028020,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1717479-terry,5,"Haidt writes a superb book inspecting the nature of happiness, the knobs that affect it. The overall ideas are two fold, that there is consilience between many ancient philosophers and modern neuroscience as to what drives the portion of happiness we can control, and that pharmacology may help us nudge the portion that we can't. The first point is driven by looking at actual studies. Anecdotes are rare and only presented to elucidate a study or research rather than to be taken by itself. The second point is a passionate defense for any number of agents that can change our biochemistry. He refers to choosing to take lithium as ""cosmetic psychopharmacology"" and entirely supportable. Some people have the genetic neurotic switch flipped and we shouldn't socially punish that person for using chemistry to help flip that switch back.I can't recommend this book enough. Most people will get something out of it and Haidt's work avoids the pitfalls common in writing that talks about both neurology and philosophy. Go read it."
173,0465028020,http://goodreads.com/user/show/63426302-alin-pinta,5,"Haidt takes a jetpack, zooms into outer space and allows you to see 'the vast tapestry human culture and see why things are woven in the way that they are'. Exploring the physical, psychological and sociocultural, he seeks hard answers to hard questions.While researching positive psychology for a meta-analysis on the contruction of happiness I came across this book, instantly thinking a title so arrogant to presume to have the answers to such a complex subject must be overselling it. One hour later I was wrapped in awe and wonder, bending page corners and taking quote photos every two minutes.Philosophy drawn from the West and the East is ellegantly blended and applied to modern psychology. Religion, ultrasociability, flow, virtue, adversity, neuroscience, love. I once owned a t-shirt that said 'The search is deeper than you think', but, hell, read this book, dive deep enough and you might even find the meaning of life."
174,0465028020,http://goodreads.com/user/show/10547530-mark,5,"JUST FANTASTIC. I had already read The Righteous Mind and appreciated that, yet it seems to me that the sifting, weighing and balancing among many perspectives is even better in this one. It's research based, which is always important to me, and he pulls from other researchers too. I appreciated the examining of perspectives from across world views and many opposing views, and almost always melding the conclusions in research (and openly stating when it's an opinion). I fully support the idea that ""A good place to look for wisdom, therefore, is where you might least expect to find it; in the minds of your opponents."" This makes fantastic sense as one considers that your knowledge overlaps greatly with your aligned group, and you are likely MISSING things that your opponents see. I HIGHLY recommend this book, and I plan to re-read it soon. (I had borrowed from the Library, but now I'm buying it.)"

However, I now find that the path looks different and I needed something to help me adjust to this alternative route. I started this book lost and looking for purpose and, whilst it didn’t give me all the answers (I wasn’t expecting it to), I think it helped. I liked the mix of old and new philosophy; Haidt has definitely done his homework and there’s something for everyone in this book. Perhaps a bit too much waffle at times, it can be hard to see where each chapter is going and sometimes it doesn’t go anywhere in particular. Nevertheless, it’s a book I could come back to. In the end, ‘our life is the creation of our mind’ and my life continues to evolve in the balance of opposites. "
176,0465028020,http://goodreads.com/user/show/23183558-dina,4,"It's a good book, though in my opinion the author's over-education sometimes gets in between - since he tries to put in too many topics, so overall the message gets confused. To sum it up, the big part of being happy are your morals. If you lead a life full of purpose where you take calculated risk that give you just enough level of adversity to make you stronger but not break you, where you engage in healthy relationships with people based on understanding and trust, where you believe in God and have supporting, strong community around with good parenting, and loving family.It's doesn't actually answer the question of what makes one happy it simply brings different ideas, hypotheses and information all together."
177,0465028020,http://goodreads.com/user/show/9471880-erin-henry,5,"Fascinating and so good! The author is a moral psychologist and has done the research to back up his conclusions. His final conclusion is that happiness comes from between “Happiness is not something that you can find, acquire or achieve directly. You have to get the conditions right and wait. Some of those conditions are within you, such as coherence among the parts and levels of your personality. Other conditions require relationships to things beyond you: just as plants need sun, water, and good soil to thrive, people need love, work, and connection to something larger”Very intellectual and yet really easy to read. I highly recommend it."

On the other hand it was almost depressing? Even though it was a book about achieving happiness? It was overwhelming and left me thinking that I would never reached true happiness without changing everything in my life. I believe that there were a lot of great talking points and that this would be a great book to read with a group of people and discuss how you feel and if you were to adapt any of this into your life. Without a group of people to discuss this I feel its just a bit overwhelming. This is a conversation piece, it really gets the mind thinking. "
179,0465028020,http://goodreads.com/user/show/105239768-yibei,3,"I was oscillating between giving it 3 stars or 4 stars when I was in the middle of the book. After I finished it, I chose 3. The last 2/3 part of the book is not organized at all. He talks about emotion, then jumps to morality, then emotion again. It feels like he was doing his morality research when he wrote this book so his mind just can't help moving towards morality, which is understandable. But, please focus on the topic. His other book The Righteous Mind: Why Good People Are Divided by Politics and Religion has done much better, worth reading.Also, I don't like his definition/judgment of happiness. Happiness is not morality. People have their own definition of happiness and they do have the right to define it. The universal happiness formula is a false proposition."
180,0465028020,http://goodreads.com/user/show/37839735-mason-frierson,5,"“Where does happiness come from? There are several different “happiness hypotheses.” One is that happiness comes from getting what you want, but we all know (and research confirms) that such happiness is short-lived. A more promising hypothesis is that happiness comes from within and cannot be obtained by making the world conform to your desires. This idea was widespread in the ancient world: Buddha in India and the Stoic philosophers in ancient Greece and Rome all counseled people to break their emotional attachments to people and events, which are always unpredictable and uncontrollable, and to cultivate instead an attitude of acceptance. This ancient idea deserves respect, and it is certainly true that changing your mind is usually a more effective response to frustration than is changing the world. However, I will present evidence that this second version of the happiness hypothesis is wrong. Recent research shows that there are some things worth striving for; there are some external conditions of life that can make you lastingly happier. One of these conditions is relatedness—the bonds we form, and need to form, with others. I’ll present research showing where love comes from, why passionate love always cools, and what kind of love is “true” love. I’ll suggest that the happiness hypothesis offered by Buddha and the Stoics should be amended: Happiness comes from within, and happiness comes from without. We need the guidance of both ancient wisdom and modern science to get the balance right.”~ Jonathan Haidt from The Happiness HypothesisI came to this book from Haidt’s wonderful study, THE RIGHTEOUS MIND, which I highly recommend. Given the subject, this book is a bit more diffuse and a little less certain in its conclusions but it is still a wonderful read and an insightful study. It is also a ‘big’ book, i.e. a book that tackles an extremely important subject.I would note, first and foremost, that this is a scholarly book accessible to a wide audience. The writing is lucid and straightforward, jargon-free and not disrupted by endless annotation, charts, graphs and statistics. Most important, perhaps, is its attempt to bring together both psychological science and the humanities. On one page you might receive a report of a study in neuroscience utilizing fMRI technology, on the next the thoughts of Epictetus or Epicurus. While it has often been said that Freud learned as much from literature as from science, that pattern of investigation is now very rare. The ‘psychological sciences’ are now very distinct from the humanities and their work is heavily-funded, empirical science. They associate themselves with the biomedical sciences far more than with the departments of Philosophy or, e.g., Religious Studies. Nevertheless, the literature of reason, wisdom and faith has much to say of, e.g., human happiness and it is to JH’s considerable credit that he measures that literature against the (always tentative) conclusions of modern psychological science. Is Plato’s sense of the divided self a good metaphor for human nature and behavior? Is it true that what doesn’t kill us makes us stronger, as Nietzsche argued? How should we look at Emerson’s transcendentalism in light of the common human desire for such experience?Given the fact that the subject is so vast—the nature of man, the nature of man’s quest for happiness, the very nature of ‘happiness’ and the strategies for achieving it—the conclusions are complex. Nevertheless, they can be summarized briefly.As in THE RIGHTEOUS MIND, JH adopts a Humean model in which the Reason is, ultimately, the slave of the passions. Our lives consist of a multiplicity of experiences that rumble about in our consciousness and direct our ‘automatic’ responses to concrete situations. Joshua Reynolds talked about this phenomenon under the rubric of ‘intuition’. Intuition is not a simple, largely-unwarranted gut reaction; it is the sum total of millions of experiences summoned instantly to respond to a current situation. I am standing beside a highway or a city street. Cars are passing by at various rates of speed. I want to get to the other side of the street, quickly, efficiently and safely. I make instant mental calculations and act . . . . Reason, on the other hand, is something that we utilize when we are pressed to find an argument for an intellectual position. It is, in part, a rhetorical device: how can I outwit and defeat my opponent in the most clever and efficacious fashion? JH takes these phenomena and constructs the ongoing metaphor of a man riding an elephant. The elephant is the sum total of the work of the ‘passions’. He is experience, intuitions, inclinations, and so on. The rider is the Reason. He attempts to control the elephant but that process is complex and sometimes arduous. As we are, in a sense, ‘divided’, so is our world and our experience. So are our bodies. The trick is to put all of this together (with a little luck; being in the right place at the right time helps immeasurably). Here is JH’s conclusion:“We were shaped by individual selection to be selfish creatures who struggle for resources, pleasure, and prestige, and we were shaped by group selection to be hive creatures who need love and attachments, and we are industrious creatures with needs for effectance, able to enter a state of vital engagement with our work. We are the rider and we are the elephant, and our mental health depends on the two working together, each drawing on the others’ strengths. . . . . Happiness is not something that you can find, acquire, or achieve directly. You have to get the conditions right and then wait. . . . Just as plants need sun, water, and good soil to thrive, people need love, work, and a connection to something larger. It is worth striving to get the right relationships between yourself and others, between yourself and your work, and between yourself and something larger than yourself” (pp. 238-39).Bottom line: a lovely book that all should read, absorb and enjoy."
181,0465028020,http://goodreads.com/user/show/793094-lisa,4,"Haidt, a UVa professor, systematically explores what conditions make for a happy life. A little too wordy, especially at first, Haidt cites studies and the research of others to back up his ideas. Most of Haidt's hypothesis rang true to me as I listened to his explanations, although some ideas seem counter intuitive at first. Overall interesting and worth reading! If you are in the depths of depression, this book may not be your lifesaver. However if you ponder the concepts listed, you may be able to make adjustments in your behavior that will make life better for you and those around you. I would strongly recommend reading this book with the thought of how you can change your behavior in such a way that will make life better for others--not just yourself."

The book uses various aphorisms and insights from a variety of ancient traditions such as Buddhism, Stoicism, and Christianity as a framing device to discuss various insights in modern research psychology.

But of the ""joy"" that comes from religious faith, moral goodness, and even ""testimony of the truth of the gospel, as manifested by the Holy Ghost,"" he has no knowledge, and even puts down people of faith.

192,0465028020,http://goodreads.com/user/show/33599214-suha,5,"This books is a beautiful smooth read that teaches you about 10 great ideas of how ancient teachings would be used to our favor in modern psychology. A bit simplistic, however it is still rich and full of helpful information. The author’s humble tone drives you to listen and trust his words; I loved it, especially the part about divinity and our need for spirituality. Here is the summary if you’d like to know more:About the author:Jonathan Haidt is a social psychologist, he is 52 years old and he is a specialist in emotions and morality. He wrote 2 books: This one ""The Happiness Hypothesis"" and the ""The Righteous Mind: Why Good People are divided by Politics"".Haidt was named one of the top world thinkers by foreign policy and prospect magazine.He wrote this book in 2006, and he describes it as it is about 10 great ideas discovered through civilizations which we can apply in our modern life.Outline:The 10 ideas were:1- The divided Self2- Changing your mind3- Reciprocity with Vengeance4- The Faults of others5- The Pursuit of Happiness6- Love & Attachment7- The Uses of Adversity8- The Felicity of Virtue9- Divinity with or without God10- Happiness comes fromChapter 1: The Divided SelfIn this chapter Haidt speaks about mind versus emotion saying that human thinking depends on metaphor~ speaking that Buddha, Freud and Plato each compared human thinking to an animal ~ elephant and horses. In our days, cars replaced elephants and horses so technology gave people more control over their physical worlds. As a result, when people looked for metaphors, they saw the mind as the driver of the car or a program running on a computer. But if that really was how human dealt with things, why do we keep on doing stupid stuff, why we sometimes do the same damn mistake if we know that we have willpower? Why do people keep on procrastinating while they know what exactly the plan to do things?So here Haidt criticized modern theories of rational choice and he believes that older metaphors work way more beautifully. He utilizes in his entire book a metaphor that I found amazing comparing the human as a rider of an elephant ~ the mind is the rider and the elephant is the emotion. If the elephant is happy and satisfied he will gladly obey your rules and be guided, however, if the elephant wants something there is no power that the rider has can stop him. And this is what Haidt meant by the divided self. The elephant represents temptations, weaknesses and internal conflicts.So why do we have this divided self:a- Mind vs Body: we have an automatic nervous system, like an administrative system that does not need thinking to act.b- Left Vs Right: our brains are split into 2 hemispheres joined by the corpus collusum that are specialized in different tasks - left is for language processing & analytics and right is for patterns in space - with experimenting the 2 hemispheres by Gazzinga a famous psychologist of split brain, he discovered that people fabricate reasons to explain their own behavior- a famous process that he called ""confabulation"" which in one experiment he showed the patient the word ""walk"" so the patient got up and walked and when the psychologist asked him why, he said to get a coke.c- New vs Old: originally the brain had 3 clumps of neurons connected to the spine. Overtime as we evolved the brain expanded more and we developed the neocortex which is the gray matter of the human brain. So we originally were animals governed by primitive emotions and drives until we developed the divine gift of reason of the neocortex. And experiments finding is that human rationality works so well only because our emotional brain works so well.d- Controlled Vs Automatic: so we have 2 systems the controlled vs automatic. Mental processes are mostly automatic without attention consciously ~ walking driving eating ~ The controlled process is limited we can only think consciously about one thing at a time but automatic processes happen in parallel.The automatic system has the dopamine in its hands while the controlled system is more like an advisor. The rider is the control and the elephant is the automatic.When we see a painting and we immediately like it and when someone asks us why we tend not to know how to answer the question with reason. The controlled system can never beat the automatic system by willpower alone. Chapter 2: Changing your mindHaidt proceeds in these 2 chapters showing us how weird our minds are.He says that we have a ""Like-o-Meter"" in which everything we see had to be ranked like or dislike and it is always running even if we are not aware. Experiments reveal, that whenever you see someone with the same name, you suddenly create a bias without you knowing it. And People are more likely to marry people whose names sound like their own. Moreover, humans have negativity bias, which is in our understanding, bad is stronger than good, Responses to threats and unpleasantness are far stronger than responses to opportunities and pleasures. The human mind reacts to bad things more quickly and persistently. The elephant reacts before the rider out of survival, when the elephant sees a snake he runs away whether you like it or not. Haidt speaks about the terminology of ""Cortical Lottery"" :this is the basic nature we are born with. Our frontal cortex has left and right side ~ research says if you have more active left side you are lucky and happy by nature:- Always willing to try something new- If you see a chance you go ahead and take it- When good things happen to you it affects you greatlyHowever if your right side is more active: - You worry about making mistakes  - Criticism hurts you- You feel worried when you do poorly at something- You have many fearsThe author believes that there are 3 ways to change this reality of lottery: 1- Meditation 2- Cognitive Therapy and 3 - ProzacHaidt speaks highly of meditation and he describes it as a pill with no side effects and it tames your elephant. On the other hand, cognitive therapy which is founded in the 60s, is the way to correct erroneous thoughts about yourself called cognitive. Finally, Prozac ~ I loved the humbleness of the author as he describes his own experience with a similar drug. He described it as wonderful, it was like magic he said and his life was amazing however he found it difficult to remember names and facts and that was bad for him in his career. Prozac raises the level of serotonin and makes the neurons adapt to new transmission amd raises the level of the neural growth hormone. The sad news that it is a short cut and it changes personality ~ psychologists call it ""cosmetic psychopharmacology"". Haidt thinks it is overprescribed. He summed up the chapter by mentioning that all these ways should be publicized and can be used by the ones with unlucky frontal cortex. Chapter 3: Reciprocity by VengeanceHaidt here also explores human behavior as we by evolution needed to win by surviving our genes, and gossiping and reciprocating were both results of evolution. Gossiping was an essential facet of human evolution and called ""emotional toolkit"" as without it we’d live in chaos and it is by gossip we make sure that what goes around comes around. Gossip is paired with reciprocity which is the karma working here on earth. Reciprocity is so amazing that sales people who are trying to sell you something give you first a gift. When you receive something for free, part of you might be pleased but another part want to give something in return. This is not limited to material things, but also to stories, if someone tells you a romantic story about his past life, you would feel pressured to do the same. Haidt calls reciprocity a relationship tonic. If used properly it strengthens social ties. For ex when we are interacting with someone we like we have tendency to copy their movesChapter 4: The faults of othersHaidt starts his chapter by saying that we are all hypocrites but we only believe that we are not. We are naive and we have myths of pure evil. There was this experiment that resulted in: people who think are moral are in fact more likely to do the right thing but when the result is against them, they find a way to ignore it and follow their self-interest. This is called ""Moral Hypocrisy"". Curing hypocrisy is very hard because we don’t see there is a problem. Haidt reveals that studies have found that we have an inner lawyer, just like you hire a lawyer that is supposed to defend you no matter what, we have an inner lawyer that defends our actions no matter what. When we are asked difficult questions, we usually choose one stand and then think about the defending answers. So we do have a cognitive mission to support our actions or beliefs. However we are extremely accurate and logical in our perceptions of others however it is our self-perceptions that are extremely disturbed ~ we have insider information. Evidence shows that we judge others by their own behavior but we think we have special data about ourselves. Also the ones with positive delusions about themselves are usually happier healthier and better liked. We also are not only hypocrites and delusional but we also have naive realism: we believe that facts as we see them are there for all to see therefore everyone should agree with us. What can we do about hypocrisy, naive realism, and inner lawyer ~ we should see all this arguing and judging as a game and not take our minds too seriously. Our elephant is always evaluating good or bad. Through meditation we can reach non-judgementalism and through it we might be able to look at our opponents point of view and that he is not entirely crazy. Chapter 5: The pursuit of HappinessHaidt criticizes Buddhism and Stoicism as happiness is not only from within ~ because:1- The progress principle: the happiness of pregoal attainment as you make progress towards your goal you are happier.2- The adaptation principle: we tend to reset our comfort zone to new changes. Our satisfaction resets to 0 - we compare ourselves to others. We recalibrate. we people tend to think that people who are more attractive are happier but in fact they are not - the ones who live in cities they are not - the ones with more money they are not - men are happier because of freedom and power they are not - younger they are not. What Haidt is saying here is that it is not entirely from the outside factors but also from the inside factors and here a formula was developed by psychologists:H=S+C+V, S is the biological set point the frontal cortex, C is the conditions of your life, And V is the voluntary activities that you doSo Biology says S and Buddha says VSo what is related to C:A- noise: if you live in traffic, noise, crowd, you are stressed and unhappy.B- Commuting: people think they buy happiness with space if they move farther from the city however commuting for long hours to and from work with traffic makes you unhappyc- Lack of control: if we can’t control some areas in our lives such as the noise, the electricity the paycheck we are less happyd- Relationships: good relationships make people happier - we cannot adapt to conflicts. Here are all the external matters things we should be striving to make. Psychologist say that there is a state people value more than chocolate after sex. They called it ""Flow"" which is a merger between pleasure and gratification. As for pleasures in life they must be spaced and diversified. Variety is the spice of life because it is the natural enemy of adaptation. Pleasure feels good in the moment but gratification is more lasting, it grants us more flow and it extends our limits. The key to find your own gratification is to know your strengths - Haidt suggests a link of a test to your strengths. So ""V"" can increase your happiness if you use your strengths. He also stresses on acts of kindness especially if you use your strengths in that direction. Note: there are misguided pursuits, a misguided pursuit is to keep up with life and he advises, work less, earn less, accumulate less, and consume more family time, vacations and enjoyable activities. Our elephant cares more about prestige. As a result, internal happiness and peace is necessary in ancient teachings but we also need external things as well to reach out for our goals and ambitions. A combination of old and modern psychology.Chapter 6: Love and attachmentThe author explains the difference between 2 kinds of love the passionate love versus the companionate love and how passion results in instant pleasures whereas the companionate love is more gratifying. When you're in passionate love, you can't think straight it is purely the elephant riding, you are not reasonable and you are at the service of the elephant. It alters parts of the brain just like cocaine and lots of dopamine, it keeps you high. But like any drug, it wears off and it is when you suddenly say oh where did the magic go. Over 6 months the pleasure of passionate versus companionate is way way higher but over 60 years it is the opposite and more stable and grows stronger. The conclusion of this chapter is that we are all ultra social species, we need others by evolution lovers, friends, sharing and attachment. Attachment and relationships can bring us pain ""Hell is other people but so is heaven.""Chapter 7:It speaks about the effect of failures, setback and trauma and the notion that it makes us stronger and more fulfilled. Haidt does not entirely agree with that but he said it is positive because:- It might reveal a challenge of hidden abilities- Filter: it makes know the depth and strength of people who truly care- Trauma changes priorities and philosophies towards the present moment and makes you live them.But: research proves that personality traits are stable pre and post trauma- our traits remain the same.So life goals fall into 4 categories:1- Work & Achievement2- Relationships3- Religion & Spirituality4- Contributing to SocietyWe are shaped by evolution to pursue success and not happiness, we fall into the trap of consuming to reach goals instead of happiness. When trauma happens it makes us fall off the treadmill and forces us to forget about these goals and enjoy what is present. It shatters belief systems and robs people out of the sense of meaning and people try to find back the pieces by seeking god or higher purpose to find grounds. It might be beneficial and it might as well be destructive. The blessed are the ones that can make sense - appreciate life's changes and accept what is. When bad things happen to good people, we have a problem. We know unconsciously that life is not fair but we want to see the world through the lens of reciprocity, the downfall of an evil man is justified but when the victim is virtuous we struggle to make sense of his tragedy. Psychologists have found that optimists benefit from trauma more than pessimists, the ones who won the cortical lottery - high set point habitually look at the bright side. Life has a way to make the rich richer and the happy happier. So, when crisis happens we either:1- Active coping 2- Re appraisal 3- Avoidance coping usually shutting off emotions by drugs drinking or other distractions. Chapter 8: The Felicity of VirtueHe starts this chapter by a nice Buddha quote: ""Set your heart on doing good. Do it over and over again and you will be filled with joy. A fool is happy until his mischief turns against him and a good man may suffer until his goodness flowers"". Here he speaks about the wisdom of the ancients as they emphasize practice and habit rather than knowledge. Modern ethics focused on actions and whether a particular action is right or wrong.Thus turn wit time from character focus to action focus moved populations form virtues towards moral reasoning and that is sad because:* It limits the scope of morality*Relies on bad psychology of training the rider rather than the elephant, the person goes to class, learns how to solve problems and then goes back to his elephant in the evening. We are being taught as riders and not elephants. So Haidt things that we need to work on developing our characters and cultivating our strengths - he lists 24 virtues divided into: wisdom, courage, humanity, justice, temperance, and transcendence. Haidt suggests to work on our strengths and not our weaknesses and we can use them to get around the weaknesses, working on your strengths is already enjoyable. Chapter 9: Divinity with or without GodI love this chapter, It is about the ancient truth that religious people grasp and secular don’t. Haidt speaks about how we evolved to have a religion and it was basically on the logic of disgust. Despite the religious fundamentalism and what it can do to us, we should give respect to religious moral motives. In science, we evolved to be religious out of fear and our longing to have something superior to long for. And as science people were trying to describe the emotion of the feeling of being “religiously high” that he called elevation: physical change in the body – dilation of the chest, motivation and a desire of doing charitable and grateful acts and a characteristic feeling beyond body sensations. Haidt studied this specific emotion and it isn’t just a form of happiness. It is also seen as a response to moral beauty involving pleasant feelings in the chest and to become a better person.An interesting experiment done was to test lactating women in 2 groups – 1 group watched a comedy show, the other watched an elevating clip on Oprah Winfry, the 2nd group showed more milk on the nursing pads of the women, and not only that, the 2nd group women went to nurse their babies and showed more warmth in the way they cuddled them.This elevation is found in anything that makes us feel small or insignificant and is not restricted to the religious people who have an idea of the supernatural. Atheists can have many of the same experiences. On the other hand, there are people stuck in the paradox of the self which keep people locked in the material world unable to see divinity.Life in a society that entirely ignored the ethic of divinity would be ugly and unsatisfying.He ends this chapter by saying if religious people are right in believing that religion is the source of their greatest happiness then maybe the rest of us who are looking for happiness and meaning can learn something from them whether or not we believe in god.Chapter 10: Happiness comes from betweengoing back to his formula H= S+C+V, he speaks about C, and he says that the biggest part of C is Love. C also depends on having and pursuing goals, we have a basic drive to make things happen – satisfaction has to be seen as lying in a considerable series of transactions in a trend of behavior rather than the goal. The optimistic conclusion coming out of research in positive psychology is that most people can get more satisfaction from their work. Step 1: know your strengths, if you can engage your strengths you ll find more gratification in work and if you find gratification in work you will have a more positive approach and in this mindset it will be easier for you to see the bigger picture the contribution you are making to a larger experience. Love & work are crucial to happiness and of course something called harmony and purpose related to the elevation and the belonging to a community. The rituals involving repetitive movement and chanting at the same time help to set up resonance patterns in the brains inducing chemicals. So, it is worth striving to get the right relationships between yourself and others, yourself and your work, yourself and something larger than yourself."
193,0465028020,http://goodreads.com/user/show/103251400-joe-novicki,5,"Happiness is something we all need, yet not all of us can achieve. In the book The Happiness Hypothesis by Johnathan Haidt he uncovers ten things that have made their way through time that all coincide to help our happiness. Drawing on the words of Buddha, Stoic Philosophy, the Bible, and much more we see that there are certain ideas that can make us happy, and certain ideas that can make us unhappy. There are many factors that go into happiness, such as love and relationships, adversity, and divinity with or without god.Through the course of the book, Johnathan Haidt uses a rider and an elephant as a metaphor. This metaphor guides the book in a way that is unparalleled. Personally, I really appreciated the metaphor because it almost summarized the point Johnathan was trying to convey. In the introduction Johnathan first introduces us to this metaphor by explaining it as, “The mind is divided into parts that sometimes conflict. Like a rider on the back of an elephant, the conscious, reasoning part of the brain has only limited control of what the elephant does.” If one can get their conscious rider to work in conjunction with the automatic elephant we can attain a better a better mental health.One of the first things great ideas that Johnathan Haidt discusses is the importance of reciprocity. At the beginning of the book I really couldn’t understand why reciprocity was such an important idea. In reality, reciprocity is one of the biggest things than contribute to ourselves feeling we belong to a society. In this book reciprocity is defined as a social currency that includes the exchange of things with others for mutual benefit. Reciprocity allows me to show that I care about others, want relationships, and can rejuvenate social ties between different people and/or groups of people. This ties beautifully with the metaphor of the elephant and the rider. The elephant is a natural mimic, we mimic others in a sense of reciprocity. He says, “Mimicry is a social glue, a way of saying “We are one"". I found Johnathan’s insight on many ideas to be very interesting and allowed me to view happiness in a different light. Before reading this book I thought happiness to be something you had or you didn’t. After reading this book I see happiness as something we can achieve, all in our own unique way. We can understand happiness through the conditions we find ourselves in, also known as the happiness formula.I personally found the happiness formula to be very interesting. In chapter five, the happiness formula is considered. The happiness formula introduced here is, H = S + C + V. This means that the amount of happiness we experience is determined by our setpoint (S), the current conditions of your life ( C), and the voluntary activities you choose to do. This was especially interesting because many often see your happiness is only linked to your biological setpoint, what you were born into. Voluntary activities and current conditions play a major role in your happiness and mental health. Out of all the great ideas there was one in particular that I found interesting. This was that our “Happiness comes from between”. We have to strive to be happy, we have to work at it, and it doesn't come overnight. Johnathan states, “You have to get the conditions right and then wait.” We have to draw on relationships, we have to draw on our work, we have to draw on something that is greater than ourselves. I really enjoyed this book and the wisdom that accompanied it. There is so much to learn, and everyone can learn something through this book. It will help you understand the concept of ourselves, the concept of our own elephant and rider. Happiness comes from between, it comes from others, and it comes from the unity between the elephant and the rider. "
194,0465028020,http://goodreads.com/user/show/87218797-ajay-solanky,5,"There's something simultaneously seductive and repulsive, sensible and absurd, and enlightened and profane about taking a surgical approach to finding happiness. But hey, it's worth a shot.I believe that everyone spends 99.9% of their time figuring out how to make themselves happy. At the same time, most of us have no idea how to get there. Instead of thrashing around in the dark, why not take a well-reasoned and scientific-ish approach to the problem?Some of the concepts that I found particularly interesting were:- Even from a biological standpoint, we have divided minds. Your rational mind may point one direction, and your subconscious, another. Your rational mind is underpowered relative to the subconscious - it evolved that way.- A lot of what makes us happy (or unhappy) is predetermined by genetics, circumstance, etc. Free will is often illusive.- Meditation, SSRIs, and cognitive therapy are effective tools for happiness. The latter two are heavily stigmatized, but it's worth opening up your mind to the possibility.- There's a difference between activities that give us ""pleasure"" (hedonism) and ""gratification"" (tasks that absorb your attention, erase self-consciousness and engage your strengths). The former is subject to the ""treadmill"" effect (although still important for day-to-day happiness), whereas the latter is key to long-term fulfillment.- ""No man is an island."" We need to find community, and specifically, romantic love in order to be happy. Romantic love can broken down into 2 different types: ""passionate"" and ""companionate"". The former, in a successful relationship, gives way to the latter, and over time the latter is the real bond that provides lasting happiness and stability.- Adversity can be harmful or helpful when it comes to long term happiness. It shapes, strengthens, and hardens us, and under the right conditions, it can lead to ""post-traumatic growth."" The conditions that lead to growth instead of PTSD are subtle, but it seems like those who experience growth are typically optimists (""positive affective style"") who make sense of their adversity and work it in to their life narratives. Adversity can help us align the different layers of our personalities and move forward with a stronger level of ""cross-coherence""- There are biological (and selfish) reasons for altriuism. For adults, especially older adults, altruism can increase long-term self-esteem and happiness because of the role it plays in strengthening their self-narratives.- Spirituality may be an innate biological ""sense"". Profanity and sacredness are the axes along which this dimension travels, and trying to create a connection with divinity (not necessarily in a religious sense - an atheist can try to connect with the universe as a whole) could be an important element for happiness. Perhaps it should be lamented that spirituality and religious tradition has drained slowly from Western culture- Religion is a part of culture. Culture evolved just like genetics, and a Darwinian framework can be applied here to understand the pervasiveness of religion and how it yields great benefits to communities. It makes us more altruistic and group-minded (at least within the group) and helps to create routine and stability and provide positive narratives that are conducive to happiness."
195,0465028020,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5874435-manu,0,"I don't remember how I discovered this book, but when it arrived, I really liked the title. Mostly because of the word ""hypothesis"", because it signals a scientific approach to a challenge. And that's exactly what the book sets out to do - take ten of the best ideas/concepts from history, religious texts and philosophers, and scrutinise it through a science filter. Positive psychology is the genre. The author begins with the idea of the divided self, and then goes deeper. Into the inbuilt ""affective style"" that plays a huge part in one's personality and how that can be changed, the role of reciprocity, and our tendency towards hypocrisy - seeing the small faults in others while ignoring our own bigger ones. At a third of the book, we even come across a formula for happiness, which makes a lot of sense when viewed rationally. My only concern with the book started around this point. The author seemed to have reframed the original thought (happiness) and moved it to meaning, and he didn't let me in on the reasoning. He tries to bridge this in the last chapter, but to me it seemed forced. If that is set aside, the rest of the book does an excellent job of parsing the ""meaning of life"" into two parts and answering the more important one. The author actually spells out the parsing only towards the end - ""why are we here"" and ""how can I find meaning""? But the chapters before that do give a bunch of perspectives on the second - love and attachments, virtue, adversity, and divinity (agnostic of God). There are several ideas that I could take away from the book. Though the metaphor of the elephant and the driver is not original, the idea of approaching them in tandem and making them work towards a harmony has been elaborated well. It also serves as a good reminder that evolution is only interested in our ""success"" (survival) and happiness is only a nice-to-have. The framing of questions as metaphors is also something I found useful. e.g. What is life? Life is like a journey. Another very interesting concept was the the three layers of personality - basic traits, ""characteristic adaptations"" and ""life story"". To me, it provides a clear actionable on how to approach meaning and happiness. The related concept of ""arête"", as well as the nuanced difference between character and personality were also good finds. It takes a lot of intellect, experience and effort to get the Bhagavad Gita, St.Paul, Confucius, Marcus Aurelius, Buddha, Nietzsche, Benjamin Franklin, Epicurus etc to align in a book that's only 240 pages. The good news is that the book does this quite well. "
196,0465028020,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1500718-ryan,4,"I really enjoyed this book, though much of its content is also in Righteous Mind. If you're on the fence, read the latter. But this book is also good.Some new-to-me (or new to my poor memory me) ideas.First, if we view a religion as a method for forming groups, then it's not so surprising to encounter members of a religion that preaches compassion expressing xenophobia.Second, when we enjoy our work, we may have ""vital engagement"" with it, which here seems to mean that we can see a connection between what we're doing and what we aspire to do. When people find that their job loses meaning, perhaps going on to describe their organization as some form of ""evil empire,"" they are losing that cohesion. I've often wondered, however, if it's not the case that all organizations are at least somewhat corrupt compared to their ideal mission, and so I often default to the idea that it's best not to learn ""how the sausage is made."" This is maybe also why administrators make more money--their jobs may, in this sense, probably suck as they are forced to look behind the curtain to do their job.Third, Haidt discusses activities that offer meaning. Conspicuous activities are prone to adaptability, so if we buy a new watch, we'll adapt to its pleasures and soon find it unfulfilling--until we buy a still fancier watch to flaunt. For a long time, activities like volunteering or going for a run were not very conspicuous and seemed to offer a sort of enduring joy. It occurs to me that we now photograph these activities for public consumption on social media. I will ""like"" a picture of someone running once or twice, but eventually I just ignore them. I wonder if we may witness an eroding of such joyful experiences as even voluntourism becomes just another way of ""keeping up with the Joneses.""I liked this book a lot, though I wonder if a student of psychology might not find it poppy. There's a sort of armchair philosophy in this book, too. I was also struck by how often the most acclaimed psychologists seem to become philosophers."
197,0465028020,http://goodreads.com/user/show/38396339-bastard-travel,4,"Half autobiography, half psych 101 class. Haidt revisits all the psychology experiments you've already heard about and ties them together with snippets of philosophers, most of whom you've also already heard of, then talks about either being in college, teaching at college, or going to India (for research. for college.) He's a respectable social psychologist which is almost like being a scientist, and the book is written clearly and accessibly. There are conflicting schools of thought as to where happiness comes from. Obviously, money can't buy it, or why would they keep saying ""money can't buy happiness"" all the time? They must have gotten it from somewhere. Everybody wants it, nobody knows how to get it.Haidt suggests it's a sort of combination of coming from within and coming from without. You've got to cultivate your internal rock garden, if you're Buddhist, or your inner citadel, if you're more an Aurelius kind of guy. You've got to manage expectations and be grateful for what you've got. You've definitely got to drop that goddamn attitude, I'll tell you that right now. Also, you've got to adopt a moral code and stick to it. You'll feel better if you do. You'll be living in accordance with your virtues, and in Current Year we don't have codified morals or virtues, so nobody knows how to act and it makes them miserable and neurotic.You've also got to stop working all the time and spend more of your time with family and friends. Family especially. You've got to make time for hobbies and live within your means, even if that requires you to adjust your stupid daydreams about Lamborghinis and cocaine to something a little cheaper, that could actually contribute to a sense of fulfillment. Waste your money on experiences, not things.In theory, you follow these rules, as confirmed by both modern psychologists and long-dead Romans, and you should be able to land proper happiness for yourself. But remember. This is just a hypothesis.See? Practically a scientist."
198,0465028020,http://goodreads.com/user/show/71924987-payel-kundu,4,"Having read The Righteous Mind, I went into this book already a big fan of Jonathan Haidt. Fans of Haidt will recognize many common themes between this book and TRM. I thought this book was a wonderful and pretty unusual balance of evidence-based theory and practical self-help. It is at once accessible but also jam packed with rigorous scientific commentary. Also, Haidt is a wonderfully clear and organized writer (quick note, the audiobook version of this is terrible, the narrator has an almost impossibly robotic delivery for a human). I learned a lot from reading this book. I’ll list some of the things I found most interesting or surprising below:-baseline happiness has a large genetic component, it’s thought to be 50-80% heritable (though Haidt is quick to show us that this is not a death sentence for those who have not won the cortical lottery. Rather, the focus of the book is in optimally re-training your elephant to make the most of your genetic lot)-people are quite inaccurate at retrospectively introspecting about what makes them happy-If someone experiences either a very bad life event (e.g paralysis from an accident) or a very good life event (e.g winning the lottery), they will likely return to their baseline level of happiness within a few months. External events tend to affect long term happiness very little, counter to what most people intuitThis book covers a lot of the most important work in happiness research over the last several decades and is written from the perspective of a thorough, balanced, and compassionate scientist. Great read. "
199,0465028020,http://goodreads.com/user/show/82034260-nikhil,4,"Finding meaning in what you do combined with the ability to get into a flow state while doing it is the key to happiness. That is an oversimplified summary of this book that uses both religion and research to propose ways to achieve happiness. It shares some of the content on the author's book on morality and I found it a gratifying experience for the most part. He assures us that as in most aspects of psychology, the answer comes from both within and without. It helps a reader to understand different perspectives of both the religious and atheists, as well as liberals and conservatives by drawing on ethics, concepts of divinity, ultrasociality, and adversity. I'd say the most annoying part of this book is the author's insistence on using the elephant rider hypothesis 99 times across 300 pages. That's way too many times to familiarise readers with the instinct and rationale metaphor. The second was his statement that forcing introverts to be outgoing led to a boost in their mood. I looked up the corresponding research and found that the sample consisted entirely of American college students, which sadly makes me question the veracity of his writing. Nonetheless, I found the book to be compelling and informative, so that's still a huge win, slight irritation or no. I'd definitely recommend it to anyone who wants a keener understanding of psychology, philosophy, and all too elusive answers. "
200,0465028020,http://goodreads.com/user/show/64942666-chris-haley,4,"4.5 stars. This book needs to be read in a book club with deep rumination and discussion after each chapter. It may be brilliant, or it may be simply insightful; I haven't decided which. Every chapter was interesting, some were deeply thought-provoking, perhaps a few were even transformative. There was no common thread weaving through the chapters (or at least none that I found), which may be the reason I am struggling to define its impact. But there are many nuggets of wisdom to be found.A sampling of the ideas in this book:- The concept of the rider and the elephant; ancient wisdom validated by modern psychology, a concept discussed at length by other authors such as Daniel Kahneman in Thinking, Fast and Slow- Adversity does not always make us stronger; it depends on our temperament, the timing, and how we respond to it- Religion and science both play important roles in understanding the human condition and finding happiness; the author argues we need more respect given across the aisle- Our society's movement away from teaching virtue is problematic; when every human being has to decide what's right in any given circumstance without a common set of virtues to strive for (e.g., quandary ethics), we are all worse off- H = S + E + V (Happiness = our genetic setpoint + our environment + our voluntary actions)- There are six virtues that are common across almost all religions and organizations: Wisdom, Justice, Courage, Humanity, Temperance, Transcendence- Evolutionary outcomes are dependent on both culture and genetics"

But Daniel Kahneman's book just totally went over my head.This book is way easier to follow and understand.I enjoyed the first half of the book, but it became a bit monotonous towards the end.Especially when he started lingering on the religious aspects, with him being an atheist and all. So it became very much a religion vs science debate with himself.The book had a nice structure, in how the chapters builds up to the conclusion.Did the book change/affect my life in any way? Not really.Worth listening too? I always think that the more you know, the better. And getting some insights into historic thinking compared to modern sciences will always give you something to think about."
202,0465028020,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1717479-terry,5,"Haidt writes a superb book inspecting the nature of happiness, the knobs that affect it. The overall ideas are two fold, that there is consilience between many ancient philosophers and modern neuroscience as to what drives the portion of happiness we can control, and that pharmacology may help us nudge the portion that we can't. The first point is driven by looking at actual studies. Anecdotes are rare and only presented to elucidate a study or research rather than to be taken by itself. The second point is a passionate defense for any number of agents that can change our biochemistry. He refers to choosing to take lithium as ""cosmetic psychopharmacology"" and entirely supportable. Some people have the genetic neurotic switch flipped and we shouldn't socially punish that person for using chemistry to help flip that switch back.I can't recommend this book enough. Most people will get something out of it and Haidt's work avoids the pitfalls common in writing that talks about both neurology and philosophy. Go read it."
203,0465028020,http://goodreads.com/user/show/63426302-alin-pinta,5,"Haidt takes a jetpack, zooms into outer space and allows you to see 'the vast tapestry human culture and see why things are woven in the way that they are'. Exploring the physical, psychological and sociocultural, he seeks hard answers to hard questions.While researching positive psychology for a meta-analysis on the contruction of happiness I came across this book, instantly thinking a title so arrogant to presume to have the answers to such a complex subject must be overselling it. One hour later I was wrapped in awe and wonder, bending page corners and taking quote photos every two minutes.Philosophy drawn from the West and the East is ellegantly blended and applied to modern psychology. Religion, ultrasociability, flow, virtue, adversity, neuroscience, love. I once owned a t-shirt that said 'The search is deeper than you think', but, hell, read this book, dive deep enough and you might even find the meaning of life."

I had already read The Righteous Mind and appreciated that, yet it seems to me that the sifting, weighing and balancing among many perspectives is even better in this one. It's research based, which is always important to me, and he pulls from other researchers too. I appreciated the examining of perspectives from across world views and many opposing views, and almost always melding the conclusions in research (and openly stating when it's an opinion). I fully support the idea that ""A good place to look for wisdom, therefore, is where you might least expect to find it; in the minds of your opponents."" This makes fantastic sense as one considers that your knowledge overlaps greatly with your aligned group, and you are likely MISSING things that your opponents see. I HIGHLY recommend this book, and I plan to re-read it soon. (I had borrowed from the Library, but now I'm buying it.)"

However, I now find that the path looks different and I needed something to help me adjust to this alternative route. I started this book lost and looking for purpose and, whilst it didn’t give me all the answers (I wasn’t expecting it to), I think it helped. I liked the mix of old and new philosophy; Haidt has definitely done his homework and there’s something for everyone in this book. Perhaps a bit too much waffle at times, it can be hard to see where each chapter is going and sometimes it doesn’t go anywhere in particular. Nevertheless, it’s a book I could come back to. In the end, ‘our life is the creation of our mind’ and my life continues to evolve in the balance of opposites. "

To sum it up, the big part of being happy are your morals. If you lead a life full of purpose where you take calculated risk that give you just enough level of adversity to make you stronger but not break you, where you engage in healthy relationships with people based on understanding and trust, where you believe in God and have supporting, strong community around with good parenting, and loving family.It's doesn't actually answer the question of what makes one happy it simply brings different ideas, hypotheses and information all together."

His final conclusion is that happiness comes from between “Happiness is not something that you can find, acquire or achieve directly. You have to get the conditions right and wait. Some of those conditions are within you, such as coherence among the parts and levels of your personality. Other conditions require relationships to things beyond you: just as plants need sun, water, and good soil to thrive, people need love, work, and connection to something larger”Very intellectual and yet really easy to read. I highly recommend it."

On the other hand it was almost depressing? Even though it was a book about achieving happiness? It was overwhelming and left me thinking that I would never reached true happiness without changing everything in my life. I believe that there were a lot of great talking points and that this would be a great book to read with a group of people and discuss how you feel and if you were to adapt any of this into your life. Without a group of people to discuss this I feel its just a bit overwhelming. This is a conversation piece, it really gets the mind thinking. "
209,0465028020,http://goodreads.com/user/show/105239768-yibei,3,"I was oscillating between giving it 3 stars or 4 stars when I was in the middle of the book. After I finished it, I chose 3. The last 2/3 part of the book is not organized at all. He talks about emotion, then jumps to morality, then emotion again. It feels like he was doing his morality research when he wrote this book so his mind just can't help moving towards morality, which is understandable. But, please focus on the topic. His other book The Righteous Mind: Why Good People Are Divided by Politics and Religion has done much better, worth reading.Also, I don't like his definition/judgment of happiness. Happiness is not morality. People have their own definition of happiness and they do have the right to define it. The universal happiness formula is a false proposition."
210,0465028020,http://goodreads.com/user/show/37839735-mason-frierson,5,"“Where does happiness come from? There are several different “happiness hypotheses.” One is that happiness comes from getting what you want, but we all know (and research confirms) that such happiness is short-lived. A more promising hypothesis is that happiness comes from within and cannot be obtained by making the world conform to your desires. This idea was widespread in the ancient world: Buddha in India and the Stoic philosophers in ancient Greece and Rome all counseled people to break their emotional attachments to people and events, which are always unpredictable and uncontrollable, and to cultivate instead an attitude of acceptance. This ancient idea deserves respect, and it is certainly true that changing your mind is usually a more effective response to frustration than is changing the world. However, I will present evidence that this second version of the happiness hypothesis is wrong. Recent research shows that there are some things worth striving for; there are some external conditions of life that can make you lastingly happier. One of these conditions is relatedness—the bonds we form, and need to form, with others. I’ll present research showing where love comes from, why passionate love always cools, and what kind of love is “true” love. I’ll suggest that the happiness hypothesis offered by Buddha and the Stoics should be amended: Happiness comes from within, and happiness comes from without. We need the guidance of both ancient wisdom and modern science to get the balance right.”~ Jonathan Haidt from The Happiness HypothesisI came to this book from Haidt’s wonderful study, THE RIGHTEOUS MIND, which I highly recommend. Given the subject, this book is a bit more diffuse and a little less certain in its conclusions but it is still a wonderful read and an insightful study. It is also a ‘big’ book, i.e. a book that tackles an extremely important subject.I would note, first and foremost, that this is a scholarly book accessible to a wide audience. The writing is lucid and straightforward, jargon-free and not disrupted by endless annotation, charts, graphs and statistics. Most important, perhaps, is its attempt to bring together both psychological science and the humanities. On one page you might receive a report of a study in neuroscience utilizing fMRI technology, on the next the thoughts of Epictetus or Epicurus. While it has often been said that Freud learned as much from literature as from science, that pattern of investigation is now very rare. The ‘psychological sciences’ are now very distinct from the humanities and their work is heavily-funded, empirical science. They associate themselves with the biomedical sciences far more than with the departments of Philosophy or, e.g., Religious Studies. Nevertheless, the literature of reason, wisdom and faith has much to say of, e.g., human happiness and it is to JH’s considerable credit that he measures that literature against the (always tentative) conclusions of modern psychological science. Is Plato’s sense of the divided self a good metaphor for human nature and behavior? Is it true that what doesn’t kill us makes us stronger, as Nietzsche argued? How should we look at Emerson’s transcendentalism in light of the common human desire for such experience?Given the fact that the subject is so vast—the nature of man, the nature of man’s quest for happiness, the very nature of ‘happiness’ and the strategies for achieving it—the conclusions are complex. Nevertheless, they can be summarized briefly.As in THE RIGHTEOUS MIND, JH adopts a Humean model in which the Reason is, ultimately, the slave of the passions. Our lives consist of a multiplicity of experiences that rumble about in our consciousness and direct our ‘automatic’ responses to concrete situations. Joshua Reynolds talked about this phenomenon under the rubric of ‘intuition’. Intuition is not a simple, largely-unwarranted gut reaction; it is the sum total of millions of experiences summoned instantly to respond to a current situation. I am standing beside a highway or a city street. Cars are passing by at various rates of speed. I want to get to the other side of the street, quickly, efficiently and safely. I make instant mental calculations and act . . . . Reason, on the other hand, is something that we utilize when we are pressed to find an argument for an intellectual position. It is, in part, a rhetorical device: how can I outwit and defeat my opponent in the most clever and efficacious fashion? JH takes these phenomena and constructs the ongoing metaphor of a man riding an elephant. The elephant is the sum total of the work of the ‘passions’. He is experience, intuitions, inclinations, and so on. The rider is the Reason. He attempts to control the elephant but that process is complex and sometimes arduous. As we are, in a sense, ‘divided’, so is our world and our experience. So are our bodies. The trick is to put all of this together (with a little luck; being in the right place at the right time helps immeasurably). Here is JH’s conclusion:“We were shaped by individual selection to be selfish creatures who struggle for resources, pleasure, and prestige, and we were shaped by group selection to be hive creatures who need love and attachments, and we are industrious creatures with needs for effectance, able to enter a state of vital engagement with our work. We are the rider and we are the elephant, and our mental health depends on the two working together, each drawing on the others’ strengths. . . . . Happiness is not something that you can find, acquire, or achieve directly. You have to get the conditions right and then wait. . . . Just as plants need sun, water, and good soil to thrive, people need love, work, and a connection to something larger. It is worth striving to get the right relationships between yourself and others, between yourself and your work, and between yourself and something larger than yourself” (pp. 238-39).Bottom line: a lovely book that all should read, absorb and enjoy."
211,0465028020,http://goodreads.com/user/show/793094-lisa,4,"Haidt, a UVa professor, systematically explores what conditions make for a happy life. A little too wordy, especially at first, Haidt cites studies and the research of others to back up his ideas. Most of Haidt's hypothesis rang true to me as I listened to his explanations, although some ideas seem counter intuitive at first. Overall interesting and worth reading! If you are in the depths of depression, this book may not be your lifesaver. However if you ponder the concepts listed, you may be able to make adjustments in your behavior that will make life better for you and those around you. I would strongly recommend reading this book with the thought of how you can change your behavior in such a way that will make life better for others--not just yourself."

The book uses various aphorisms and insights from a variety of ancient traditions such as Buddhism, Stoicism, and Christianity as a framing device to discuss various insights in modern research psychology. As a more skeptical soul I was put off by the feel-good, soft-New Agey title, but I'm glad I overcame my bias and gave the book a spin. Highly recommended. "

But of the ""joy"" that comes from religious faith, moral goodness, and even ""testimony of the truth of the gospel, as manifested by the Holy Ghost,"" he has no knowledge, and even puts down people of faith.

222,0465028020,http://goodreads.com/user/show/33599214-suha,5,"This books is a beautiful smooth read that teaches you about 10 great ideas of how ancient teachings would be used to our favor in modern psychology. A bit simplistic, however it is still rich and full of helpful information. The author’s humble tone drives you to listen and trust his words; I loved it, especially the part about divinity and our need for spirituality. Here is the summary if you’d like to know more:About the author:Jonathan Haidt is a social psychologist, he is 52 years old and he is a specialist in emotions and morality. He wrote 2 books: This one ""The Happiness Hypothesis"" and the ""The Righteous Mind: Why Good People are divided by Politics"".Haidt was named one of the top world thinkers by foreign policy and prospect magazine.He wrote this book in 2006, and he describes it as it is about 10 great ideas discovered through civilizations which we can apply in our modern life.Outline:The 10 ideas were:1- The divided Self2- Changing your mind3- Reciprocity with Vengeance4- The Faults of others5- The Pursuit of Happiness6- Love & Attachment7- The Uses of Adversity8- The Felicity of Virtue9- Divinity with or without God10- Happiness comes fromChapter 1: The Divided SelfIn this chapter Haidt speaks about mind versus emotion saying that human thinking depends on metaphor~ speaking that Buddha, Freud and Plato each compared human thinking to an animal ~ elephant and horses. In our days, cars replaced elephants and horses so technology gave people more control over their physical worlds. As a result, when people looked for metaphors, they saw the mind as the driver of the car or a program running on a computer. But if that really was how human dealt with things, why do we keep on doing stupid stuff, why we sometimes do the same damn mistake if we know that we have willpower? Why do people keep on procrastinating while they know what exactly the plan to do things?So here Haidt criticized modern theories of rational choice and he believes that older metaphors work way more beautifully. He utilizes in his entire book a metaphor that I found amazing comparing the human as a rider of an elephant ~ the mind is the rider and the elephant is the emotion. If the elephant is happy and satisfied he will gladly obey your rules and be guided, however, if the elephant wants something there is no power that the rider has can stop him. And this is what Haidt meant by the divided self. The elephant represents temptations, weaknesses and internal conflicts.So why do we have this divided self:a- Mind vs Body: we have an automatic nervous system, like an administrative system that does not need thinking to act.b- Left Vs Right: our brains are split into 2 hemispheres joined by the corpus collusum that are specialized in different tasks - left is for language processing & analytics and right is for patterns in space - with experimenting the 2 hemispheres by Gazzinga a famous psychologist of split brain, he discovered that people fabricate reasons to explain their own behavior- a famous process that he called ""confabulation"" which in one experiment he showed the patient the word ""walk"" so the patient got up and walked and when the psychologist asked him why, he said to get a coke.c- New vs Old: originally the brain had 3 clumps of neurons connected to the spine. Overtime as we evolved the brain expanded more and we developed the neocortex which is the gray matter of the human brain. So we originally were animals governed by primitive emotions and drives until we developed the divine gift of reason of the neocortex. And experiments finding is that human rationality works so well only because our emotional brain works so well.d- Controlled Vs Automatic: so we have 2 systems the controlled vs automatic. Mental processes are mostly automatic without attention consciously ~ walking driving eating ~ The controlled process is limited we can only think consciously about one thing at a time but automatic processes happen in parallel.The automatic system has the dopamine in its hands while the controlled system is more like an advisor. The rider is the control and the elephant is the automatic.When we see a painting and we immediately like it and when someone asks us why we tend not to know how to answer the question with reason. The controlled system can never beat the automatic system by willpower alone. Chapter 2: Changing your mindHaidt proceeds in these 2 chapters showing us how weird our minds are.He says that we have a ""Like-o-Meter"" in which everything we see had to be ranked like or dislike and it is always running even if we are not aware. Experiments reveal, that whenever you see someone with the same name, you suddenly create a bias without you knowing it. And People are more likely to marry people whose names sound like their own. Moreover, humans have negativity bias, which is in our understanding, bad is stronger than good, Responses to threats and unpleasantness are far stronger than responses to opportunities and pleasures. The human mind reacts to bad things more quickly and persistently. The elephant reacts before the rider out of survival, when the elephant sees a snake he runs away whether you like it or not. Haidt speaks about the terminology of ""Cortical Lottery"" :this is the basic nature we are born with. Our frontal cortex has left and right side ~ research says if you have more active left side you are lucky and happy by nature:- Always willing to try something new- If you see a chance you go ahead and take it- When good things happen to you it affects you greatlyHowever if your right side is more active: - You worry about making mistakes  - Criticism hurts you- You feel worried when you do poorly at something- You have many fearsThe author believes that there are 3 ways to change this reality of lottery: 1- Meditation 2- Cognitive Therapy and 3 - ProzacHaidt speaks highly of meditation and he describes it as a pill with no side effects and it tames your elephant. On the other hand, cognitive therapy which is founded in the 60s, is the way to correct erroneous thoughts about yourself called cognitive. Finally, Prozac ~ I loved the humbleness of the author as he describes his own experience with a similar drug. He described it as wonderful, it was like magic he said and his life was amazing however he found it difficult to remember names and facts and that was bad for him in his career. Prozac raises the level of serotonin and makes the neurons adapt to new transmission amd raises the level of the neural growth hormone. The sad news that it is a short cut and it changes personality ~ psychologists call it ""cosmetic psychopharmacology"". Haidt thinks it is overprescribed. He summed up the chapter by mentioning that all these ways should be publicized and can be used by the ones with unlucky frontal cortex. Chapter 3: Reciprocity by VengeanceHaidt here also explores human behavior as we by evolution needed to win by surviving our genes, and gossiping and reciprocating were both results of evolution. Gossiping was an essential facet of human evolution and called ""emotional toolkit"" as without it we’d live in chaos and it is by gossip we make sure that what goes around comes around. Gossip is paired with reciprocity which is the karma working here on earth. Reciprocity is so amazing that sales people who are trying to sell you something give you first a gift. When you receive something for free, part of you might be pleased but another part want to give something in return. This is not limited to material things, but also to stories, if someone tells you a romantic story about his past life, you would feel pressured to do the same. Haidt calls reciprocity a relationship tonic. If used properly it strengthens social ties. For ex when we are interacting with someone we like we have tendency to copy their movesChapter 4: The faults of othersHaidt starts his chapter by saying that we are all hypocrites but we only believe that we are not. We are naive and we have myths of pure evil. There was this experiment that resulted in: people who think are moral are in fact more likely to do the right thing but when the result is against them, they find a way to ignore it and follow their self-interest. This is called ""Moral Hypocrisy"". Curing hypocrisy is very hard because we don’t see there is a problem. Haidt reveals that studies have found that we have an inner lawyer, just like you hire a lawyer that is supposed to defend you no matter what, we have an inner lawyer that defends our actions no matter what. When we are asked difficult questions, we usually choose one stand and then think about the defending answers. So we do have a cognitive mission to support our actions or beliefs. However we are extremely accurate and logical in our perceptions of others however it is our self-perceptions that are extremely disturbed ~ we have insider information. Evidence shows that we judge others by their own behavior but we think we have special data about ourselves. Also the ones with positive delusions about themselves are usually happier healthier and better liked. We also are not only hypocrites and delusional but we also have naive realism: we believe that facts as we see them are there for all to see therefore everyone should agree with us. What can we do about hypocrisy, naive realism, and inner lawyer ~ we should see all this arguing and judging as a game and not take our minds too seriously. Our elephant is always evaluating good or bad. Through meditation we can reach non-judgementalism and through it we might be able to look at our opponents point of view and that he is not entirely crazy. Chapter 5: The pursuit of HappinessHaidt criticizes Buddhism and Stoicism as happiness is not only from within ~ because:1- The progress principle: the happiness of pregoal attainment as you make progress towards your goal you are happier.2- The adaptation principle: we tend to reset our comfort zone to new changes. Our satisfaction resets to 0 - we compare ourselves to others. We recalibrate. we people tend to think that people who are more attractive are happier but in fact they are not - the ones who live in cities they are not - the ones with more money they are not - men are happier because of freedom and power they are not - younger they are not. What Haidt is saying here is that it is not entirely from the outside factors but also from the inside factors and here a formula was developed by psychologists:H=S+C+V, S is the biological set point the frontal cortex, C is the conditions of your life, And V is the voluntary activities that you doSo Biology says S and Buddha says VSo what is related to C:A- noise: if you live in traffic, noise, crowd, you are stressed and unhappy.B- Commuting: people think they buy happiness with space if they move farther from the city however commuting for long hours to and from work with traffic makes you unhappyc- Lack of control: if we can’t control some areas in our lives such as the noise, the electricity the paycheck we are less happyd- Relationships: good relationships make people happier - we cannot adapt to conflicts. Here are all the external matters things we should be striving to make. Psychologist say that there is a state people value more than chocolate after sex. They called it ""Flow"" which is a merger between pleasure and gratification. As for pleasures in life they must be spaced and diversified. Variety is the spice of life because it is the natural enemy of adaptation. Pleasure feels good in the moment but gratification is more lasting, it grants us more flow and it extends our limits. The key to find your own gratification is to know your strengths - Haidt suggests a link of a test to your strengths. So ""V"" can increase your happiness if you use your strengths. He also stresses on acts of kindness especially if you use your strengths in that direction. Note: there are misguided pursuits, a misguided pursuit is to keep up with life and he advises, work less, earn less, accumulate less, and consume more family time, vacations and enjoyable activities. Our elephant cares more about prestige. As a result, internal happiness and peace is necessary in ancient teachings but we also need external things as well to reach out for our goals and ambitions. A combination of old and modern psychology.Chapter 6: Love and attachmentThe author explains the difference between 2 kinds of love the passionate love versus the companionate love and how passion results in instant pleasures whereas the companionate love is more gratifying. When you're in passionate love, you can't think straight it is purely the elephant riding, you are not reasonable and you are at the service of the elephant. It alters parts of the brain just like cocaine and lots of dopamine, it keeps you high. But like any drug, it wears off and it is when you suddenly say oh where did the magic go. Over 6 months the pleasure of passionate versus companionate is way way higher but over 60 years it is the opposite and more stable and grows stronger. The conclusion of this chapter is that we are all ultra social species, we need others by evolution lovers, friends, sharing and attachment. Attachment and relationships can bring us pain ""Hell is other people but so is heaven.""Chapter 7:It speaks about the effect of failures, setback and trauma and the notion that it makes us stronger and more fulfilled. Haidt does not entirely agree with that but he said it is positive because:- It might reveal a challenge of hidden abilities- Filter: it makes know the depth and strength of people who truly care- Trauma changes priorities and philosophies towards the present moment and makes you live them.But: research proves that personality traits are stable pre and post trauma- our traits remain the same.So life goals fall into 4 categories:1- Work & Achievement2- Relationships3- Religion & Spirituality4- Contributing to SocietyWe are shaped by evolution to pursue success and not happiness, we fall into the trap of consuming to reach goals instead of happiness. When trauma happens it makes us fall off the treadmill and forces us to forget about these goals and enjoy what is present. It shatters belief systems and robs people out of the sense of meaning and people try to find back the pieces by seeking god or higher purpose to find grounds. It might be beneficial and it might as well be destructive. The blessed are the ones that can make sense - appreciate life's changes and accept what is. When bad things happen to good people, we have a problem. We know unconsciously that life is not fair but we want to see the world through the lens of reciprocity, the downfall of an evil man is justified but when the victim is virtuous we struggle to make sense of his tragedy. Psychologists have found that optimists benefit from trauma more than pessimists, the ones who won the cortical lottery - high set point habitually look at the bright side. Life has a way to make the rich richer and the happy happier. So, when crisis happens we either:1- Active coping 2- Re appraisal 3- Avoidance coping usually shutting off emotions by drugs drinking or other distractions. Chapter 8: The Felicity of VirtueHe starts this chapter by a nice Buddha quote: ""Set your heart on doing good. Do it over and over again and you will be filled with joy. A fool is happy until his mischief turns against him and a good man may suffer until his goodness flowers"". Here he speaks about the wisdom of the ancients as they emphasize practice and habit rather than knowledge. Modern ethics focused on actions and whether a particular action is right or wrong.Thus turn wit time from character focus to action focus moved populations form virtues towards moral reasoning and that is sad because:* It limits the scope of morality*Relies on bad psychology of training the rider rather than the elephant, the person goes to class, learns how to solve problems and then goes back to his elephant in the evening. We are being taught as riders and not elephants. So Haidt things that we need to work on developing our characters and cultivating our strengths - he lists 24 virtues divided into: wisdom, courage, humanity, justice, temperance, and transcendence. Haidt suggests to work on our strengths and not our weaknesses and we can use them to get around the weaknesses, working on your strengths is already enjoyable. Chapter 9: Divinity with or without GodI love this chapter, It is about the ancient truth that religious people grasp and secular don’t. Haidt speaks about how we evolved to have a religion and it was basically on the logic of disgust. Despite the religious fundamentalism and what it can do to us, we should give respect to religious moral motives. In science, we evolved to be religious out of fear and our longing to have something superior to long for. And as science people were trying to describe the emotion of the feeling of being “religiously high” that he called elevation: physical change in the body – dilation of the chest, motivation and a desire of doing charitable and grateful acts and a characteristic feeling beyond body sensations. Haidt studied this specific emotion and it isn’t just a form of happiness. It is also seen as a response to moral beauty involving pleasant feelings in the chest and to become a better person.An interesting experiment done was to test lactating women in 2 groups – 1 group watched a comedy show, the other watched an elevating clip on Oprah Winfry, the 2nd group showed more milk on the nursing pads of the women, and not only that, the 2nd group women went to nurse their babies and showed more warmth in the way they cuddled them.This elevation is found in anything that makes us feel small or insignificant and is not restricted to the religious people who have an idea of the supernatural. Atheists can have many of the same experiences. On the other hand, there are people stuck in the paradox of the self which keep people locked in the material world unable to see divinity.Life in a society that entirely ignored the ethic of divinity would be ugly and unsatisfying.He ends this chapter by saying if religious people are right in believing that religion is the source of their greatest happiness then maybe the rest of us who are looking for happiness and meaning can learn something from them whether or not we believe in god.Chapter 10: Happiness comes from betweengoing back to his formula H= S+C+V, he speaks about C, and he says that the biggest part of C is Love. C also depends on having and pursuing goals, we have a basic drive to make things happen – satisfaction has to be seen as lying in a considerable series of transactions in a trend of behavior rather than the goal. The optimistic conclusion coming out of research in positive psychology is that most people can get more satisfaction from their work. Step 1: know your strengths, if you can engage your strengths you ll find more gratification in work and if you find gratification in work you will have a more positive approach and in this mindset it will be easier for you to see the bigger picture the contribution you are making to a larger experience. Love & work are crucial to happiness and of course something called harmony and purpose related to the elevation and the belonging to a community. The rituals involving repetitive movement and chanting at the same time help to set up resonance patterns in the brains inducing chemicals. So, it is worth striving to get the right relationships between yourself and others, yourself and your work, yourself and something larger than yourself."
223,0465028020,http://goodreads.com/user/show/103251400-joe-novicki,5,"Happiness is something we all need, yet not all of us can achieve. In the book The Happiness Hypothesis by Johnathan Haidt he uncovers ten things that have made their way through time that all coincide to help our happiness. Drawing on the words of Buddha, Stoic Philosophy, the Bible, and much more we see that there are certain ideas that can make us happy, and certain ideas that can make us unhappy. There are many factors that go into happiness, such as love and relationships, adversity, and divinity with or without god.Through the course of the book, Johnathan Haidt uses a rider and an elephant as a metaphor. This metaphor guides the book in a way that is unparalleled. Personally, I really appreciated the metaphor because it almost summarized the point Johnathan was trying to convey. In the introduction Johnathan first introduces us to this metaphor by explaining it as, “The mind is divided into parts that sometimes conflict. Like a rider on the back of an elephant, the conscious, reasoning part of the brain has only limited control of what the elephant does.” If one can get their conscious rider to work in conjunction with the automatic elephant we can attain a better a better mental health.One of the first things great ideas that Johnathan Haidt discusses is the importance of reciprocity. At the beginning of the book I really couldn’t understand why reciprocity was such an important idea. In reality, reciprocity is one of the biggest things than contribute to ourselves feeling we belong to a society. In this book reciprocity is defined as a social currency that includes the exchange of things with others for mutual benefit. Reciprocity allows me to show that I care about others, want relationships, and can rejuvenate social ties between different people and/or groups of people. This ties beautifully with the metaphor of the elephant and the rider. The elephant is a natural mimic, we mimic others in a sense of reciprocity. He says, “Mimicry is a social glue, a way of saying “We are one"". I found Johnathan’s insight on many ideas to be very interesting and allowed me to view happiness in a different light. Before reading this book I thought happiness to be something you had or you didn’t. After reading this book I see happiness as something we can achieve, all in our own unique way. We can understand happiness through the conditions we find ourselves in, also known as the happiness formula.I personally found the happiness formula to be very interesting. In chapter five, the happiness formula is considered. The happiness formula introduced here is, H = S + C + V. This means that the amount of happiness we experience is determined by our setpoint (S), the current conditions of your life ( C), and the voluntary activities you choose to do. This was especially interesting because many often see your happiness is only linked to your biological setpoint, what you were born into. Voluntary activities and current conditions play a major role in your happiness and mental health. Out of all the great ideas there was one in particular that I found interesting. This was that our “Happiness comes from between”. We have to strive to be happy, we have to work at it, and it doesn't come overnight. Johnathan states, “You have to get the conditions right and then wait.” We have to draw on relationships, we have to draw on our work, we have to draw on something that is greater than ourselves. I really enjoyed this book and the wisdom that accompanied it. There is so much to learn, and everyone can learn something through this book. It will help you understand the concept of ourselves, the concept of our own elephant and rider. Happiness comes from between, it comes from others, and it comes from the unity between the elephant and the rider. "
224,0465028020,http://goodreads.com/user/show/87218797-ajay-solanky,5,"There's something simultaneously seductive and repulsive, sensible and absurd, and enlightened and profane about taking a surgical approach to finding happiness. But hey, it's worth a shot.I believe that everyone spends 99.9% of their time figuring out how to make themselves happy. At the same time, most of us have no idea how to get there. Instead of thrashing around in the dark, why not take a well-reasoned and scientific-ish approach to the problem?Some of the concepts that I found particularly interesting were:- Even from a biological standpoint, we have divided minds. Your rational mind may point one direction, and your subconscious, another. Your rational mind is underpowered relative to the subconscious - it evolved that way.- A lot of what makes us happy (or unhappy) is predetermined by genetics, circumstance, etc. Free will is often illusive.- Meditation, SSRIs, and cognitive therapy are effective tools for happiness. The latter two are heavily stigmatized, but it's worth opening up your mind to the possibility.- There's a difference between activities that give us ""pleasure"" (hedonism) and ""gratification"" (tasks that absorb your attention, erase self-consciousness and engage your strengths). The former is subject to the ""treadmill"" effect (although still important for day-to-day happiness), whereas the latter is key to long-term fulfillment.- ""No man is an island."" We need to find community, and specifically, romantic love in order to be happy. Romantic love can broken down into 2 different types: ""passionate"" and ""companionate"". The former, in a successful relationship, gives way to the latter, and over time the latter is the real bond that provides lasting happiness and stability.- Adversity can be harmful or helpful when it comes to long term happiness. It shapes, strengthens, and hardens us, and under the right conditions, it can lead to ""post-traumatic growth."" The conditions that lead to growth instead of PTSD are subtle, but it seems like those who experience growth are typically optimists (""positive affective style"") who make sense of their adversity and work it in to their life narratives. Adversity can help us align the different layers of our personalities and move forward with a stronger level of ""cross-coherence""- There are biological (and selfish) reasons for altriuism. For adults, especially older adults, altruism can increase long-term self-esteem and happiness because of the role it plays in strengthening their self-narratives.- Spirituality may be an innate biological ""sense"". Profanity and sacredness are the axes along which this dimension travels, and trying to create a connection with divinity (not necessarily in a religious sense - an atheist can try to connect with the universe as a whole) could be an important element for happiness. Perhaps it should be lamented that spirituality and religious tradition has drained slowly from Western culture- Religion is a part of culture. Culture evolved just like genetics, and a Darwinian framework can be applied here to understand the pervasiveness of religion and how it yields great benefits to communities. It makes us more altruistic and group-minded (at least within the group) and helps to create routine and stability and provide positive narratives that are conducive to happiness."
225,0465028020,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5874435-manu,0,"I don't remember how I discovered this book, but when it arrived, I really liked the title. Mostly because of the word ""hypothesis"", because it signals a scientific approach to a challenge. And that's exactly what the book sets out to do - take ten of the best ideas/concepts from history, religious texts and philosophers, and scrutinise it through a science filter. Positive psychology is the genre. The author begins with the idea of the divided self, and then goes deeper. Into the inbuilt ""affective style"" that plays a huge part in one's personality and how that can be changed, the role of reciprocity, and our tendency towards hypocrisy - seeing the small faults in others while ignoring our own bigger ones. At a third of the book, we even come across a formula for happiness, which makes a lot of sense when viewed rationally. My only concern with the book started around this point. The author seemed to have reframed the original thought (happiness) and moved it to meaning, and he didn't let me in on the reasoning. He tries to bridge this in the last chapter, but to me it seemed forced. If that is set aside, the rest of the book does an excellent job of parsing the ""meaning of life"" into two parts and answering the more important one. The author actually spells out the parsing only towards the end - ""why are we here"" and ""how can I find meaning""? But the chapters before that do give a bunch of perspectives on the second - love and attachments, virtue, adversity, and divinity (agnostic of God). There are several ideas that I could take away from the book. Though the metaphor of the elephant and the driver is not original, the idea of approaching them in tandem and making them work towards a harmony has been elaborated well. It also serves as a good reminder that evolution is only interested in our ""success"" (survival) and happiness is only a nice-to-have. The framing of questions as metaphors is also something I found useful. e.g. What is life? Life is like a journey. Another very interesting concept was the the three layers of personality - basic traits, ""characteristic adaptations"" and ""life story"". To me, it provides a clear actionable on how to approach meaning and happiness. The related concept of ""arête"", as well as the nuanced difference between character and personality were also good finds. It takes a lot of intellect, experience and effort to get the Bhagavad Gita, St.Paul, Confucius, Marcus Aurelius, Buddha, Nietzsche, Benjamin Franklin, Epicurus etc to align in a book that's only 240 pages. The good news is that the book does this quite well. "
226,0465028020,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1500718-ryan,4,"I really enjoyed this book, though much of its content is also in Righteous Mind. If you're on the fence, read the latter. But this book is also good.Some new-to-me (or new to my poor memory me) ideas.First, if we view a religion as a method for forming groups, then it's not so surprising to encounter members of a religion that preaches compassion expressing xenophobia.Second, when we enjoy our work, we may have ""vital engagement"" with it, which here seems to mean that we can see a connection between what we're doing and what we aspire to do. When people find that their job loses meaning, perhaps going on to describe their organization as some form of ""evil empire,"" they are losing that cohesion. I've often wondered, however, if it's not the case that all organizations are at least somewhat corrupt compared to their ideal mission, and so I often default to the idea that it's best not to learn ""how the sausage is made."" This is maybe also why administrators make more money--their jobs may, in this sense, probably suck as they are forced to look behind the curtain to do their job.Third, Haidt discusses activities that offer meaning. Conspicuous activities are prone to adaptability, so if we buy a new watch, we'll adapt to its pleasures and soon find it unfulfilling--until we buy a still fancier watch to flaunt. For a long time, activities like volunteering or going for a run were not very conspicuous and seemed to offer a sort of enduring joy. It occurs to me that we now photograph these activities for public consumption on social media. I will ""like"" a picture of someone running once or twice, but eventually I just ignore them. I wonder if we may witness an eroding of such joyful experiences as even voluntourism becomes just another way of ""keeping up with the Joneses.""I liked this book a lot, though I wonder if a student of psychology might not find it poppy. There's a sort of armchair philosophy in this book, too. I was also struck by how often the most acclaimed psychologists seem to become philosophers."
227,0465028020,http://goodreads.com/user/show/38396339-bastard-travel,4,"Half autobiography, half psych 101 class. Haidt revisits all the psychology experiments you've already heard about and ties them together with snippets of philosophers, most of whom you've also already heard of, then talks about either being in college, teaching at college, or going to India (for research. for college.) He's a respectable social psychologist which is almost like being a scientist, and the book is written clearly and accessibly. There are conflicting schools of thought as to where happiness comes from. Obviously, money can't buy it, or why would they keep saying ""money can't buy happiness"" all the time? They must have gotten it from somewhere. Everybody wants it, nobody knows how to get it.Haidt suggests it's a sort of combination of coming from within and coming from without. You've got to cultivate your internal rock garden, if you're Buddhist, or your inner citadel, if you're more an Aurelius kind of guy. You've got to manage expectations and be grateful for what you've got. You've definitely got to drop that goddamn attitude, I'll tell you that right now. Also, you've got to adopt a moral code and stick to it. You'll feel better if you do. You'll be living in accordance with your virtues, and in Current Year we don't have codified morals or virtues, so nobody knows how to act and it makes them miserable and neurotic.You've also got to stop working all the time and spend more of your time with family and friends. Family especially. You've got to make time for hobbies and live within your means, even if that requires you to adjust your stupid daydreams about Lamborghinis and cocaine to something a little cheaper, that could actually contribute to a sense of fulfillment. Waste your money on experiences, not things.In theory, you follow these rules, as confirmed by both modern psychologists and long-dead Romans, and you should be able to land proper happiness for yourself. But remember. This is just a hypothesis.See? Practically a scientist."
228,0465028020,http://goodreads.com/user/show/71924987-payel-kundu,4,"Having read The Righteous Mind, I went into this book already a big fan of Jonathan Haidt. Fans of Haidt will recognize many common themes between this book and TRM. I thought this book was a wonderful and pretty unusual balance of evidence-based theory and practical self-help. It is at once accessible but also jam packed with rigorous scientific commentary. Also, Haidt is a wonderfully clear and organized writer (quick note, the audiobook version of this is terrible, the narrator has an almost impossibly robotic delivery for a human). I learned a lot from reading this book. I’ll list some of the things I found most interesting or surprising below:-baseline happiness has a large genetic component, it’s thought to be 50-80% heritable (though Haidt is quick to show us that this is not a death sentence for those who have not won the cortical lottery. Rather, the focus of the book is in optimally re-training your elephant to make the most of your genetic lot)-people are quite inaccurate at retrospectively introspecting about what makes them happy-If someone experiences either a very bad life event (e.g paralysis from an accident) or a very good life event (e.g winning the lottery), they will likely return to their baseline level of happiness within a few months. External events tend to affect long term happiness very little, counter to what most people intuitThis book covers a lot of the most important work in happiness research over the last several decades and is written from the perspective of a thorough, balanced, and compassionate scientist. Great read. "
229,0465028020,http://goodreads.com/user/show/82034260-nikhil,4,"Finding meaning in what you do combined with the ability to get into a flow state while doing it is the key to happiness. That is an oversimplified summary of this book that uses both religion and research to propose ways to achieve happiness. It shares some of the content on the author's book on morality and I found it a gratifying experience for the most part. He assures us that as in most aspects of psychology, the answer comes from both within and without. It helps a reader to understand different perspectives of both the religious and atheists, as well as liberals and conservatives by drawing on ethics, concepts of divinity, ultrasociality, and adversity. I'd say the most annoying part of this book is the author's insistence on using the elephant rider hypothesis 99 times across 300 pages. That's way too many times to familiarise readers with the instinct and rationale metaphor. The second was his statement that forcing introverts to be outgoing led to a boost in their mood. I looked up the corresponding research and found that the sample consisted entirely of American college students, which sadly makes me question the veracity of his writing. Nonetheless, I found the book to be compelling and informative, so that's still a huge win, slight irritation or no. I'd definitely recommend it to anyone who wants a keener understanding of psychology, philosophy, and all too elusive answers. "
230,0465028020,http://goodreads.com/user/show/64942666-chris-haley,4,"4.5 stars. This book needs to be read in a book club with deep rumination and discussion after each chapter. It may be brilliant, or it may be simply insightful; I haven't decided which. Every chapter was interesting, some were deeply thought-provoking, perhaps a few were even transformative. There was no common thread weaving through the chapters (or at least none that I found), which may be the reason I am struggling to define its impact. But there are many nuggets of wisdom to be found.A sampling of the ideas in this book:- The concept of the rider and the elephant; ancient wisdom validated by modern psychology, a concept discussed at length by other authors such as Daniel Kahneman in Thinking, Fast and Slow- Adversity does not always make us stronger; it depends on our temperament, the timing, and how we respond to it- Religion and science both play important roles in understanding the human condition and finding happiness; the author argues we need more respect given across the aisle- Our society's movement away from teaching virtue is problematic; when every human being has to decide what's right in any given circumstance without a common set of virtues to strive for (e.g., quandary ethics), we are all worse off- H = S + E + V (Happiness = our genetic setpoint + our environment + our voluntary actions)- There are six virtues that are common across almost all religions and organizations: Wisdom, Justice, Courage, Humanity, Temperance, Transcendence- Evolutionary outcomes are dependent on both culture and genetics"
231,0465028020,http://goodreads.com/user/show/21091961-jacques-bezuidenhout,3,"A book taking some ancient Wisdoms and applying some modern Science / Psychology to determine what it is that makes us happy.This is not a self-help type book, but rather an easy to understand study.I've previously listened to Thinking, Fast and Slow, which focuses on very much the same content. But Daniel Kahneman's book just totally went over my head.This book is way easier to follow and understand.I enjoyed the first half of the book, but it became a bit monotonous towards the end.Especially when he started lingering on the religious aspects, with him being an atheist and all. So it became very much a religion vs science debate with himself.The book had a nice structure, in how the chapters builds up to the conclusion.Did the book change/affect my life in any way? Not really.Worth listening too? I always think that the more you know, the better. And getting some insights into historic thinking compared to modern sciences will always give you something to think about."
232,0465028020,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1717479-terry,5,"Haidt writes a superb book inspecting the nature of happiness, the knobs that affect it. The overall ideas are two fold, that there is consilience between many ancient philosophers and modern neuroscience as to what drives the portion of happiness we can control, and that pharmacology may help us nudge the portion that we can't. The first point is driven by looking at actual studies. Anecdotes are rare and only presented to elucidate a study or research rather than to be taken by itself. The second point is a passionate defense for any number of agents that can change our biochemistry. He refers to choosing to take lithium as ""cosmetic psychopharmacology"" and entirely supportable. Some people have the genetic neurotic switch flipped and we shouldn't socially punish that person for using chemistry to help flip that switch back.I can't recommend this book enough. Most people will get something out of it and Haidt's work avoids the pitfalls common in writing that talks about both neurology and philosophy. Go read it."
233,0465028020,http://goodreads.com/user/show/63426302-alin-pinta,5,"Haidt takes a jetpack, zooms into outer space and allows you to see 'the vast tapestry human culture and see why things are woven in the way that they are'. Exploring the physical, psychological and sociocultural, he seeks hard answers to hard questions.While researching positive psychology for a meta-analysis on the contruction of happiness I came across this book, instantly thinking a title so arrogant to presume to have the answers to such a complex subject must be overselling it. One hour later I was wrapped in awe and wonder, bending page corners and taking quote photos every two minutes.Philosophy drawn from the West and the East is ellegantly blended and applied to modern psychology. Religion, ultrasociability, flow, virtue, adversity, neuroscience, love. I once owned a t-shirt that said 'The search is deeper than you think', but, hell, read this book, dive deep enough and you might even find the meaning of life."
234,0465028020,http://goodreads.com/user/show/10547530-mark,5,"JUST FANTASTIC. I had already read The Righteous Mind and appreciated that, yet it seems to me that the sifting, weighing and balancing among many perspectives is even better in this one. It's research based, which is always important to me, and he pulls from other researchers too. I appreciated the examining of perspectives from across world views and many opposing views, and almost always melding the conclusions in research (and openly stating when it's an opinion). I fully support the idea that ""A good place to look for wisdom, therefore, is where you might least expect to find it; in the minds of your opponents."" This makes fantastic sense as one considers that your knowledge overlaps greatly with your aligned group, and you are likely MISSING things that your opponents see. I HIGHLY recommend this book, and I plan to re-read it soon. (I had borrowed from the Library, but now I'm buying it.)"

However, I now find that the path looks different and I needed something to help me adjust to this alternative route. I started this book lost and looking for purpose and, whilst it didn’t give me all the answers (I wasn’t expecting it to), I think it helped. I liked the mix of old and new philosophy; Haidt has definitely done his homework and there’s something for everyone in this book. Perhaps a bit too much waffle at times, it can be hard to see where each chapter is going and sometimes it doesn’t go anywhere in particular. Nevertheless, it’s a book I could come back to. In the end, ‘our life is the creation of our mind’ and my life continues to evolve in the balance of opposites. "
236,0465028020,http://goodreads.com/user/show/23183558-dina,4,"It's a good book, though in my opinion the author's over-education sometimes gets in between - since he tries to put in too many topics, so overall the message gets confused. To sum it up, the big part of being happy are your morals. If you lead a life full of purpose where you take calculated risk that give you just enough level of adversity to make you stronger but not break you, where you engage in healthy relationships with people based on understanding and trust, where you believe in God and have supporting, strong community around with good parenting, and loving family.It's doesn't actually answer the question of what makes one happy it simply brings different ideas, hypotheses and information all together."

His final conclusion is that happiness comes from between “Happiness is not something that you can find, acquire or achieve directly. You have to get the conditions right and wait. Some of those conditions are within you, such as coherence among the parts and levels of your personality. Other conditions require relationships to things beyond you: just as plants need sun, water, and good soil to thrive, people need love, work, and connection to something larger”Very intellectual and yet really easy to read.

On the other hand it was almost depressing? Even though it was a book about achieving happiness? It was overwhelming and left me thinking that I would never reached true happiness without changing everything in my life. I believe that there were a lot of great talking points and that this would be a great book to read with a group of people and discuss how you feel and if you were to adapt any of this into your life. Without a group of people to discuss this I feel its just a bit overwhelming. This is a conversation piece, it really gets the mind thinking. "
239,0465028020,http://goodreads.com/user/show/105239768-yibei,3,"I was oscillating between giving it 3 stars or 4 stars when I was in the middle of the book. After I finished it, I chose 3. The last 2/3 part of the book is not organized at all. He talks about emotion, then jumps to morality, then emotion again. It feels like he was doing his morality research when he wrote this book so his mind just can't help moving towards morality, which is understandable. But, please focus on the topic. His other book The Righteous Mind: Why Good People Are Divided by Politics and Religion has done much better, worth reading.Also, I don't like his definition/judgment of happiness. Happiness is not morality. People have their own definition of happiness and they do have the right to define it. The universal happiness formula is a false proposition."
240,0465028020,http://goodreads.com/user/show/37839735-mason-frierson,5,"“Where does happiness come from? There are several different “happiness hypotheses.” One is that happiness comes from getting what you want, but we all know (and research confirms) that such happiness is short-lived. A more promising hypothesis is that happiness comes from within and cannot be obtained by making the world conform to your desires. This idea was widespread in the ancient world: Buddha in India and the Stoic philosophers in ancient Greece and Rome all counseled people to break their emotional attachments to people and events, which are always unpredictable and uncontrollable, and to cultivate instead an attitude of acceptance. This ancient idea deserves respect, and it is certainly true that changing your mind is usually a more effective response to frustration than is changing the world. However, I will present evidence that this second version of the happiness hypothesis is wrong. Recent research shows that there are some things worth striving for; there are some external conditions of life that can make you lastingly happier. One of these conditions is relatedness—the bonds we form, and need to form, with others. I’ll present research showing where love comes from, why passionate love always cools, and what kind of love is “true” love. I’ll suggest that the happiness hypothesis offered by Buddha and the Stoics should be amended: Happiness comes from within, and happiness comes from without. We need the guidance of both ancient wisdom and modern science to get the balance right.”~ Jonathan Haidt from The Happiness HypothesisI came to this book from Haidt’s wonderful study, THE RIGHTEOUS MIND, which I highly recommend. Given the subject, this book is a bit more diffuse and a little less certain in its conclusions but it is still a wonderful read and an insightful study. It is also a ‘big’ book, i.e. a book that tackles an extremely important subject.I would note, first and foremost, that this is a scholarly book accessible to a wide audience. The writing is lucid and straightforward, jargon-free and not disrupted by endless annotation, charts, graphs and statistics. Most important, perhaps, is its attempt to bring together both psychological science and the humanities. On one page you might receive a report of a study in neuroscience utilizing fMRI technology, on the next the thoughts of Epictetus or Epicurus. While it has often been said that Freud learned as much from literature as from science, that pattern of investigation is now very rare. The ‘psychological sciences’ are now very distinct from the humanities and their work is heavily-funded, empirical science. They associate themselves with the biomedical sciences far more than with the departments of Philosophy or, e.g., Religious Studies. Nevertheless, the literature of reason, wisdom and faith has much to say of, e.g., human happiness and it is to JH’s considerable credit that he measures that literature against the (always tentative) conclusions of modern psychological science. Is Plato’s sense of the divided self a good metaphor for human nature and behavior? Is it true that what doesn’t kill us makes us stronger, as Nietzsche argued? How should we look at Emerson’s transcendentalism in light of the common human desire for such experience?Given the fact that the subject is so vast—the nature of man, the nature of man’s quest for happiness, the very nature of ‘happiness’ and the strategies for achieving it—the conclusions are complex. Nevertheless, they can be summarized briefly.As in THE RIGHTEOUS MIND, JH adopts a Humean model in which the Reason is, ultimately, the slave of the passions. Our lives consist of a multiplicity of experiences that rumble about in our consciousness and direct our ‘automatic’ responses to concrete situations. Joshua Reynolds talked about this phenomenon under the rubric of ‘intuition’. Intuition is not a simple, largely-unwarranted gut reaction; it is the sum total of millions of experiences summoned instantly to respond to a current situation. I am standing beside a highway or a city street. Cars are passing by at various rates of speed. I want to get to the other side of the street, quickly, efficiently and safely. I make instant mental calculations and act . . . . Reason, on the other hand, is something that we utilize when we are pressed to find an argument for an intellectual position. It is, in part, a rhetorical device: how can I outwit and defeat my opponent in the most clever and efficacious fashion? JH takes these phenomena and constructs the ongoing metaphor of a man riding an elephant. The elephant is the sum total of the work of the ‘passions’. He is experience, intuitions, inclinations, and so on. The rider is the Reason. He attempts to control the elephant but that process is complex and sometimes arduous. As we are, in a sense, ‘divided’, so is our world and our experience. So are our bodies. The trick is to put all of this together (with a little luck; being in the right place at the right time helps immeasurably). Here is JH’s conclusion:“We were shaped by individual selection to be selfish creatures who struggle for resources, pleasure, and prestige, and we were shaped by group selection to be hive creatures who need love and attachments, and we are industrious creatures with needs for effectance, able to enter a state of vital engagement with our work. We are the rider and we are the elephant, and our mental health depends on the two working together, each drawing on the others’ strengths. . . . . Happiness is not something that you can find, acquire, or achieve directly. You have to get the conditions right and then wait. . . . Just as plants need sun, water, and good soil to thrive, people need love, work, and a connection to something larger. It is worth striving to get the right relationships between yourself and others, between yourself and your work, and between yourself and something larger than yourself” (pp. 238-39).Bottom line: a lovely book that all should read, absorb and enjoy."

A little too wordy, especially at first, Haidt cites studies and the research of others to back up his ideas. Most of Haidt's hypothesis rang true to me as I listened to his explanations, although some ideas seem counter intuitive at first. Overall interesting and worth reading! If you are in the depths of depression, this book may not be your lifesaver. However if you ponder the concepts listed, you may be able to make adjustments in your behavior that will make life better for you and those around you. I would strongly recommend reading this book with the thought of how you can change your behavior in such a way that will make life better for others--not just yourself."

252,0465028020,http://goodreads.com/user/show/33599214-suha,5,"This books is a beautiful smooth read that teaches you about 10 great ideas of how ancient teachings would be used to our favor in modern psychology. A bit simplistic, however it is still rich and full of helpful information. The author’s humble tone drives you to listen and trust his words; I loved it, especially the part about divinity and our need for spirituality. Here is the summary if you’d like to know more:About the author:Jonathan Haidt is a social psychologist, he is 52 years old and he is a specialist in emotions and morality. He wrote 2 books: This one ""The Happiness Hypothesis"" and the ""The Righteous Mind: Why Good People are divided by Politics"".Haidt was named one of the top world thinkers by foreign policy and prospect magazine.He wrote this book in 2006, and he describes it as it is about 10 great ideas discovered through civilizations which we can apply in our modern life.Outline:The 10 ideas were:1- The divided Self2- Changing your mind3- Reciprocity with Vengeance4- The Faults of others5- The Pursuit of Happiness6- Love & Attachment7- The Uses of Adversity8- The Felicity of Virtue9- Divinity with or without God10- Happiness comes fromChapter 1: The Divided SelfIn this chapter Haidt speaks about mind versus emotion saying that human thinking depends on metaphor~ speaking that Buddha, Freud and Plato each compared human thinking to an animal ~ elephant and horses. In our days, cars replaced elephants and horses so technology gave people more control over their physical worlds. As a result, when people looked for metaphors, they saw the mind as the driver of the car or a program running on a computer. But if that really was how human dealt with things, why do we keep on doing stupid stuff, why we sometimes do the same damn mistake if we know that we have willpower? Why do people keep on procrastinating while they know what exactly the plan to do things?So here Haidt criticized modern theories of rational choice and he believes that older metaphors work way more beautifully. He utilizes in his entire book a metaphor that I found amazing comparing the human as a rider of an elephant ~ the mind is the rider and the elephant is the emotion. If the elephant is happy and satisfied he will gladly obey your rules and be guided, however, if the elephant wants something there is no power that the rider has can stop him. And this is what Haidt meant by the divided self. The elephant represents temptations, weaknesses and internal conflicts.So why do we have this divided self:a- Mind vs Body: we have an automatic nervous system, like an administrative system that does not need thinking to act.b- Left Vs Right: our brains are split into 2 hemispheres joined by the corpus collusum that are specialized in different tasks - left is for language processing & analytics and right is for patterns in space - with experimenting the 2 hemispheres by Gazzinga a famous psychologist of split brain, he discovered that people fabricate reasons to explain their own behavior- a famous process that he called ""confabulation"" which in one experiment he showed the patient the word ""walk"" so the patient got up and walked and when the psychologist asked him why, he said to get a coke.c- New vs Old: originally the brain had 3 clumps of neurons connected to the spine. Overtime as we evolved the brain expanded more and we developed the neocortex which is the gray matter of the human brain. So we originally were animals governed by primitive emotions and drives until we developed the divine gift of reason of the neocortex. And experiments finding is that human rationality works so well only because our emotional brain works so well.d- Controlled Vs Automatic: so we have 2 systems the controlled vs automatic. Mental processes are mostly automatic without attention consciously ~ walking driving eating ~ The controlled process is limited we can only think consciously about one thing at a time but automatic processes happen in parallel.The automatic system has the dopamine in its hands while the controlled system is more like an advisor. The rider is the control and the elephant is the automatic.When we see a painting and we immediately like it and when someone asks us why we tend not to know how to answer the question with reason. The controlled system can never beat the automatic system by willpower alone. Chapter 2: Changing your mindHaidt proceeds in these 2 chapters showing us how weird our minds are.He says that we have a ""Like-o-Meter"" in which everything we see had to be ranked like or dislike and it is always running even if we are not aware. Experiments reveal, that whenever you see someone with the same name, you suddenly create a bias without you knowing it. And People are more likely to marry people whose names sound like their own. Moreover, humans have negativity bias, which is in our understanding, bad is stronger than good, Responses to threats and unpleasantness are far stronger than responses to opportunities and pleasures. The human mind reacts to bad things more quickly and persistently. The elephant reacts before the rider out of survival, when the elephant sees a snake he runs away whether you like it or not. Haidt speaks about the terminology of ""Cortical Lottery"" :this is the basic nature we are born with. Our frontal cortex has left and right side ~ research says if you have more active left side you are lucky and happy by nature:- Always willing to try something new- If you see a chance you go ahead and take it- When good things happen to you it affects you greatlyHowever if your right side is more active: - You worry about making mistakes  - Criticism hurts you- You feel worried when you do poorly at something- You have many fearsThe author believes that there are 3 ways to change this reality of lottery: 1- Meditation 2- Cognitive Therapy and 3 - ProzacHaidt speaks highly of meditation and he describes it as a pill with no side effects and it tames your elephant. On the other hand, cognitive therapy which is founded in the 60s, is the way to correct erroneous thoughts about yourself called cognitive. Finally, Prozac ~ I loved the humbleness of the author as he describes his own experience with a similar drug. He described it as wonderful, it was like magic he said and his life was amazing however he found it difficult to remember names and facts and that was bad for him in his career. Prozac raises the level of serotonin and makes the neurons adapt to new transmission amd raises the level of the neural growth hormone. The sad news that it is a short cut and it changes personality ~ psychologists call it ""cosmetic psychopharmacology"". Haidt thinks it is overprescribed. He summed up the chapter by mentioning that all these ways should be publicized and can be used by the ones with unlucky frontal cortex. Chapter 3: Reciprocity by VengeanceHaidt here also explores human behavior as we by evolution needed to win by surviving our genes, and gossiping and reciprocating were both results of evolution. Gossiping was an essential facet of human evolution and called ""emotional toolkit"" as without it we’d live in chaos and it is by gossip we make sure that what goes around comes around. Gossip is paired with reciprocity which is the karma working here on earth. Reciprocity is so amazing that sales people who are trying to sell you something give you first a gift. When you receive something for free, part of you might be pleased but another part want to give something in return. This is not limited to material things, but also to stories, if someone tells you a romantic story about his past life, you would feel pressured to do the same. Haidt calls reciprocity a relationship tonic. If used properly it strengthens social ties. For ex when we are interacting with someone we like we have tendency to copy their movesChapter 4: The faults of othersHaidt starts his chapter by saying that we are all hypocrites but we only believe that we are not. We are naive and we have myths of pure evil. There was this experiment that resulted in: people who think are moral are in fact more likely to do the right thing but when the result is against them, they find a way to ignore it and follow their self-interest. This is called ""Moral Hypocrisy"". Curing hypocrisy is very hard because we don’t see there is a problem. Haidt reveals that studies have found that we have an inner lawyer, just like you hire a lawyer that is supposed to defend you no matter what, we have an inner lawyer that defends our actions no matter what. When we are asked difficult questions, we usually choose one stand and then think about the defending answers. So we do have a cognitive mission to support our actions or beliefs. However we are extremely accurate and logical in our perceptions of others however it is our self-perceptions that are extremely disturbed ~ we have insider information. Evidence shows that we judge others by their own behavior but we think we have special data about ourselves. Also the ones with positive delusions about themselves are usually happier healthier and better liked. We also are not only hypocrites and delusional but we also have naive realism: we believe that facts as we see them are there for all to see therefore everyone should agree with us. What can we do about hypocrisy, naive realism, and inner lawyer ~ we should see all this arguing and judging as a game and not take our minds too seriously. Our elephant is always evaluating good or bad. Through meditation we can reach non-judgementalism and through it we might be able to look at our opponents point of view and that he is not entirely crazy. Chapter 5: The pursuit of HappinessHaidt criticizes Buddhism and Stoicism as happiness is not only from within ~ because:1- The progress principle: the happiness of pregoal attainment as you make progress towards your goal you are happier.2- The adaptation principle: we tend to reset our comfort zone to new changes. Our satisfaction resets to 0 - we compare ourselves to others. We recalibrate. we people tend to think that people who are more attractive are happier but in fact they are not - the ones who live in cities they are not - the ones with more money they are not - men are happier because of freedom and power they are not - younger they are not. What Haidt is saying here is that it is not entirely from the outside factors but also from the inside factors and here a formula was developed by psychologists:H=S+C+V, S is the biological set point the frontal cortex, C is the conditions of your life, And V is the voluntary activities that you doSo Biology says S and Buddha says VSo what is related to C:A- noise: if you live in traffic, noise, crowd, you are stressed and unhappy.B- Commuting: people think they buy happiness with space if they move farther from the city however commuting for long hours to and from work with traffic makes you unhappyc- Lack of control: if we can’t control some areas in our lives such as the noise, the electricity the paycheck we are less happyd- Relationships: good relationships make people happier - we cannot adapt to conflicts. Here are all the external matters things we should be striving to make. Psychologist say that there is a state people value more than chocolate after sex. They called it ""Flow"" which is a merger between pleasure and gratification. As for pleasures in life they must be spaced and diversified. Variety is the spice of life because it is the natural enemy of adaptation. Pleasure feels good in the moment but gratification is more lasting, it grants us more flow and it extends our limits. The key to find your own gratification is to know your strengths - Haidt suggests a link of a test to your strengths. So ""V"" can increase your happiness if you use your strengths. He also stresses on acts of kindness especially if you use your strengths in that direction. Note: there are misguided pursuits, a misguided pursuit is to keep up with life and he advises, work less, earn less, accumulate less, and consume more family time, vacations and enjoyable activities. Our elephant cares more about prestige. As a result, internal happiness and peace is necessary in ancient teachings but we also need external things as well to reach out for our goals and ambitions. A combination of old and modern psychology.Chapter 6: Love and attachmentThe author explains the difference between 2 kinds of love the passionate love versus the companionate love and how passion results in instant pleasures whereas the companionate love is more gratifying. When you're in passionate love, you can't think straight it is purely the elephant riding, you are not reasonable and you are at the service of the elephant. It alters parts of the brain just like cocaine and lots of dopamine, it keeps you high. But like any drug, it wears off and it is when you suddenly say oh where did the magic go. Over 6 months the pleasure of passionate versus companionate is way way higher but over 60 years it is the opposite and more stable and grows stronger. The conclusion of this chapter is that we are all ultra social species, we need others by evolution lovers, friends, sharing and attachment. Attachment and relationships can bring us pain ""Hell is other people but so is heaven.""Chapter 7:It speaks about the effect of failures, setback and trauma and the notion that it makes us stronger and more fulfilled. Haidt does not entirely agree with that but he said it is positive because:- It might reveal a challenge of hidden abilities- Filter: it makes know the depth and strength of people who truly care- Trauma changes priorities and philosophies towards the present moment and makes you live them.But: research proves that personality traits are stable pre and post trauma- our traits remain the same.So life goals fall into 4 categories:1- Work & Achievement2- Relationships3- Religion & Spirituality4- Contributing to SocietyWe are shaped by evolution to pursue success and not happiness, we fall into the trap of consuming to reach goals instead of happiness. When trauma happens it makes us fall off the treadmill and forces us to forget about these goals and enjoy what is present. It shatters belief systems and robs people out of the sense of meaning and people try to find back the pieces by seeking god or higher purpose to find grounds. It might be beneficial and it might as well be destructive. The blessed are the ones that can make sense - appreciate life's changes and accept what is. When bad things happen to good people, we have a problem. We know unconsciously that life is not fair but we want to see the world through the lens of reciprocity, the downfall of an evil man is justified but when the victim is virtuous we struggle to make sense of his tragedy. Psychologists have found that optimists benefit from trauma more than pessimists, the ones who won the cortical lottery - high set point habitually look at the bright side. Life has a way to make the rich richer and the happy happier. So, when crisis happens we either:1- Active coping 2- Re appraisal 3- Avoidance coping usually shutting off emotions by drugs drinking or other distractions. Chapter 8: The Felicity of VirtueHe starts this chapter by a nice Buddha quote: ""Set your heart on doing good. Do it over and over again and you will be filled with joy. A fool is happy until his mischief turns against him and a good man may suffer until his goodness flowers"". Here he speaks about the wisdom of the ancients as they emphasize practice and habit rather than knowledge. Modern ethics focused on actions and whether a particular action is right or wrong.Thus turn wit time from character focus to action focus moved populations form virtues towards moral reasoning and that is sad because:* It limits the scope of morality*Relies on bad psychology of training the rider rather than the elephant, the person goes to class, learns how to solve problems and then goes back to his elephant in the evening. We are being taught as riders and not elephants. So Haidt things that we need to work on developing our characters and cultivating our strengths - he lists 24 virtues divided into: wisdom, courage, humanity, justice, temperance, and transcendence. Haidt suggests to work on our strengths and not our weaknesses and we can use them to get around the weaknesses, working on your strengths is already enjoyable. Chapter 9: Divinity with or without GodI love this chapter, It is about the ancient truth that religious people grasp and secular don’t. Haidt speaks about how we evolved to have a religion and it was basically on the logic of disgust. Despite the religious fundamentalism and what it can do to us, we should give respect to religious moral motives. In science, we evolved to be religious out of fear and our longing to have something superior to long for. And as science people were trying to describe the emotion of the feeling of being “religiously high” that he called elevation: physical change in the body – dilation of the chest, motivation and a desire of doing charitable and grateful acts and a characteristic feeling beyond body sensations. Haidt studied this specific emotion and it isn’t just a form of happiness. It is also seen as a response to moral beauty involving pleasant feelings in the chest and to become a better person.An interesting experiment done was to test lactating women in 2 groups – 1 group watched a comedy show, the other watched an elevating clip on Oprah Winfry, the 2nd group showed more milk on the nursing pads of the women, and not only that, the 2nd group women went to nurse their babies and showed more warmth in the way they cuddled them.This elevation is found in anything that makes us feel small or insignificant and is not restricted to the religious people who have an idea of the supernatural. Atheists can have many of the same experiences. On the other hand, there are people stuck in the paradox of the self which keep people locked in the material world unable to see divinity.Life in a society that entirely ignored the ethic of divinity would be ugly and unsatisfying.He ends this chapter by saying if religious people are right in believing that religion is the source of their greatest happiness then maybe the rest of us who are looking for happiness and meaning can learn something from them whether or not we believe in god.Chapter 10: Happiness comes from betweengoing back to his formula H= S+C+V, he speaks about C, and he says that the biggest part of C is Love. C also depends on having and pursuing goals, we have a basic drive to make things happen – satisfaction has to be seen as lying in a considerable series of transactions in a trend of behavior rather than the goal. The optimistic conclusion coming out of research in positive psychology is that most people can get more satisfaction from their work. Step 1: know your strengths, if you can engage your strengths you ll find more gratification in work and if you find gratification in work you will have a more positive approach and in this mindset it will be easier for you to see the bigger picture the contribution you are making to a larger experience. Love & work are crucial to happiness and of course something called harmony and purpose related to the elevation and the belonging to a community. The rituals involving repetitive movement and chanting at the same time help to set up resonance patterns in the brains inducing chemicals. So, it is worth striving to get the right relationships between yourself and others, yourself and your work, yourself and something larger than yourself."
253,0465028020,http://goodreads.com/user/show/103251400-joe-novicki,5,"Happiness is something we all need, yet not all of us can achieve. In the book The Happiness Hypothesis by Johnathan Haidt he uncovers ten things that have made their way through time that all coincide to help our happiness. Drawing on the words of Buddha, Stoic Philosophy, the Bible, and much more we see that there are certain ideas that can make us happy, and certain ideas that can make us unhappy. There are many factors that go into happiness, such as love and relationships, adversity, and divinity with or without god.Through the course of the book, Johnathan Haidt uses a rider and an elephant as a metaphor. This metaphor guides the book in a way that is unparalleled. Personally, I really appreciated the metaphor because it almost summarized the point Johnathan was trying to convey. In the introduction Johnathan first introduces us to this metaphor by explaining it as, “The mind is divided into parts that sometimes conflict. Like a rider on the back of an elephant, the conscious, reasoning part of the brain has only limited control of what the elephant does.” If one can get their conscious rider to work in conjunction with the automatic elephant we can attain a better a better mental health.One of the first things great ideas that Johnathan Haidt discusses is the importance of reciprocity. At the beginning of the book I really couldn’t understand why reciprocity was such an important idea. In reality, reciprocity is one of the biggest things than contribute to ourselves feeling we belong to a society. In this book reciprocity is defined as a social currency that includes the exchange of things with others for mutual benefit. Reciprocity allows me to show that I care about others, want relationships, and can rejuvenate social ties between different people and/or groups of people. This ties beautifully with the metaphor of the elephant and the rider. The elephant is a natural mimic, we mimic others in a sense of reciprocity. He says, “Mimicry is a social glue, a way of saying “We are one"". I found Johnathan’s insight on many ideas to be very interesting and allowed me to view happiness in a different light. Before reading this book I thought happiness to be something you had or you didn’t. After reading this book I see happiness as something we can achieve, all in our own unique way. We can understand happiness through the conditions we find ourselves in, also known as the happiness formula.I personally found the happiness formula to be very interesting. In chapter five, the happiness formula is considered. The happiness formula introduced here is, H = S + C + V. This means that the amount of happiness we experience is determined by our setpoint (S), the current conditions of your life ( C), and the voluntary activities you choose to do. This was especially interesting because many often see your happiness is only linked to your biological setpoint, what you were born into. Voluntary activities and current conditions play a major role in your happiness and mental health. Out of all the great ideas there was one in particular that I found interesting. This was that our “Happiness comes from between”. We have to strive to be happy, we have to work at it, and it doesn't come overnight. Johnathan states, “You have to get the conditions right and then wait.” We have to draw on relationships, we have to draw on our work, we have to draw on something that is greater than ourselves. I really enjoyed this book and the wisdom that accompanied it. There is so much to learn, and everyone can learn something through this book. It will help you understand the concept of ourselves, the concept of our own elephant and rider. Happiness comes from between, it comes from others, and it comes from the unity between the elephant and the rider. "
254,0465028020,http://goodreads.com/user/show/87218797-ajay-solanky,5,"There's something simultaneously seductive and repulsive, sensible and absurd, and enlightened and profane about taking a surgical approach to finding happiness. But hey, it's worth a shot.I believe that everyone spends 99.9% of their time figuring out how to make themselves happy. At the same time, most of us have no idea how to get there. Instead of thrashing around in the dark, why not take a well-reasoned and scientific-ish approach to the problem?Some of the concepts that I found particularly interesting were:- Even from a biological standpoint, we have divided minds. Your rational mind may point one direction, and your subconscious, another. Your rational mind is underpowered relative to the subconscious - it evolved that way.- A lot of what makes us happy (or unhappy) is predetermined by genetics, circumstance, etc. Free will is often illusive.- Meditation, SSRIs, and cognitive therapy are effective tools for happiness. The latter two are heavily stigmatized, but it's worth opening up your mind to the possibility.- There's a difference between activities that give us ""pleasure"" (hedonism) and ""gratification"" (tasks that absorb your attention, erase self-consciousness and engage your strengths). The former is subject to the ""treadmill"" effect (although still important for day-to-day happiness), whereas the latter is key to long-term fulfillment.- ""No man is an island."" We need to find community, and specifically, romantic love in order to be happy. Romantic love can broken down into 2 different types: ""passionate"" and ""companionate"". The former, in a successful relationship, gives way to the latter, and over time the latter is the real bond that provides lasting happiness and stability.- Adversity can be harmful or helpful when it comes to long term happiness. It shapes, strengthens, and hardens us, and under the right conditions, it can lead to ""post-traumatic growth."" The conditions that lead to growth instead of PTSD are subtle, but it seems like those who experience growth are typically optimists (""positive affective style"") who make sense of their adversity and work it in to their life narratives. Adversity can help us align the different layers of our personalities and move forward with a stronger level of ""cross-coherence""- There are biological (and selfish) reasons for altriuism. For adults, especially older adults, altruism can increase long-term self-esteem and happiness because of the role it plays in strengthening their self-narratives.- Spirituality may be an innate biological ""sense"". Profanity and sacredness are the axes along which this dimension travels, and trying to create a connection with divinity (not necessarily in a religious sense - an atheist can try to connect with the universe as a whole) could be an important element for happiness. Perhaps it should be lamented that spirituality and religious tradition has drained slowly from Western culture- Religion is a part of culture. Culture evolved just like genetics, and a Darwinian framework can be applied here to understand the pervasiveness of religion and how it yields great benefits to communities. It makes us more altruistic and group-minded (at least within the group) and helps to create routine and stability and provide positive narratives that are conducive to happiness."
255,0465028020,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5874435-manu,0,"I don't remember how I discovered this book, but when it arrived, I really liked the title. Mostly because of the word ""hypothesis"", because it signals a scientific approach to a challenge. And that's exactly what the book sets out to do - take ten of the best ideas/concepts from history, religious texts and philosophers, and scrutinise it through a science filter. Positive psychology is the genre. The author begins with the idea of the divided self, and then goes deeper. Into the inbuilt ""affective style"" that plays a huge part in one's personality and how that can be changed, the role of reciprocity, and our tendency towards hypocrisy - seeing the small faults in others while ignoring our own bigger ones. At a third of the book, we even come across a formula for happiness, which makes a lot of sense when viewed rationally. My only concern with the book started around this point. The author seemed to have reframed the original thought (happiness) and moved it to meaning, and he didn't let me in on the reasoning. He tries to bridge this in the last chapter, but to me it seemed forced. If that is set aside, the rest of the book does an excellent job of parsing the ""meaning of life"" into two parts and answering the more important one. The author actually spells out the parsing only towards the end - ""why are we here"" and ""how can I find meaning""? But the chapters before that do give a bunch of perspectives on the second - love and attachments, virtue, adversity, and divinity (agnostic of God). There are several ideas that I could take away from the book. Though the metaphor of the elephant and the driver is not original, the idea of approaching them in tandem and making them work towards a harmony has been elaborated well. It also serves as a good reminder that evolution is only interested in our ""success"" (survival) and happiness is only a nice-to-have. The framing of questions as metaphors is also something I found useful. e.g. What is life? Life is like a journey. Another very interesting concept was the the three layers of personality - basic traits, ""characteristic adaptations"" and ""life story"". To me, it provides a clear actionable on how to approach meaning and happiness. The related concept of ""arête"", as well as the nuanced difference between character and personality were also good finds. It takes a lot of intellect, experience and effort to get the Bhagavad Gita, St.Paul, Confucius, Marcus Aurelius, Buddha, Nietzsche, Benjamin Franklin, Epicurus etc to align in a book that's only 240 pages. The good news is that the book does this quite well. "
256,0465028020,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1500718-ryan,4,"I really enjoyed this book, though much of its content is also in Righteous Mind. If you're on the fence, read the latter. But this book is also good.Some new-to-me (or new to my poor memory me) ideas.First, if we view a religion as a method for forming groups, then it's not so surprising to encounter members of a religion that preaches compassion expressing xenophobia.Second, when we enjoy our work, we may have ""vital engagement"" with it, which here seems to mean that we can see a connection between what we're doing and what we aspire to do. When people find that their job loses meaning, perhaps going on to describe their organization as some form of ""evil empire,"" they are losing that cohesion. I've often wondered, however, if it's not the case that all organizations are at least somewhat corrupt compared to their ideal mission, and so I often default to the idea that it's best not to learn ""how the sausage is made."" This is maybe also why administrators make more money--their jobs may, in this sense, probably suck as they are forced to look behind the curtain to do their job.Third, Haidt discusses activities that offer meaning. Conspicuous activities are prone to adaptability, so if we buy a new watch, we'll adapt to its pleasures and soon find it unfulfilling--until we buy a still fancier watch to flaunt. For a long time, activities like volunteering or going for a run were not very conspicuous and seemed to offer a sort of enduring joy. It occurs to me that we now photograph these activities for public consumption on social media. I will ""like"" a picture of someone running once or twice, but eventually I just ignore them. I wonder if we may witness an eroding of such joyful experiences as even voluntourism becomes just another way of ""keeping up with the Joneses.""I liked this book a lot, though I wonder if a student of psychology might not find it poppy. There's a sort of armchair philosophy in this book, too. I was also struck by how often the most acclaimed psychologists seem to become philosophers."
257,0465028020,http://goodreads.com/user/show/38396339-bastard-travel,4,"Half autobiography, half psych 101 class. Haidt revisits all the psychology experiments you've already heard about and ties them together with snippets of philosophers, most of whom you've also already heard of, then talks about either being in college, teaching at college, or going to India (for research. for college.) He's a respectable social psychologist which is almost like being a scientist, and the book is written clearly and accessibly. There are conflicting schools of thought as to where happiness comes from. Obviously, money can't buy it, or why would they keep saying ""money can't buy happiness"" all the time? They must have gotten it from somewhere. Everybody wants it, nobody knows how to get it.Haidt suggests it's a sort of combination of coming from within and coming from without. You've got to cultivate your internal rock garden, if you're Buddhist, or your inner citadel, if you're more an Aurelius kind of guy. You've got to manage expectations and be grateful for what you've got. You've definitely got to drop that goddamn attitude, I'll tell you that right now. Also, you've got to adopt a moral code and stick to it. You'll feel better if you do. You'll be living in accordance with your virtues, and in Current Year we don't have codified morals or virtues, so nobody knows how to act and it makes them miserable and neurotic.You've also got to stop working all the time and spend more of your time with family and friends. Family especially. You've got to make time for hobbies and live within your means, even if that requires you to adjust your stupid daydreams about Lamborghinis and cocaine to something a little cheaper, that could actually contribute to a sense of fulfillment. Waste your money on experiences, not things.In theory, you follow these rules, as confirmed by both modern psychologists and long-dead Romans, and you should be able to land proper happiness for yourself. But remember. This is just a hypothesis.See? Practically a scientist."
258,0465028020,http://goodreads.com/user/show/71924987-payel-kundu,4,"Having read The Righteous Mind, I went into this book already a big fan of Jonathan Haidt. Fans of Haidt will recognize many common themes between this book and TRM. I thought this book was a wonderful and pretty unusual balance of evidence-based theory and practical self-help. It is at once accessible but also jam packed with rigorous scientific commentary. Also, Haidt is a wonderfully clear and organized writer (quick note, the audiobook version of this is terrible, the narrator has an almost impossibly robotic delivery for a human). I learned a lot from reading this book. I’ll list some of the things I found most interesting or surprising below:-baseline happiness has a large genetic component, it’s thought to be 50-80% heritable (though Haidt is quick to show us that this is not a death sentence for those who have not won the cortical lottery. Rather, the focus of the book is in optimally re-training your elephant to make the most of your genetic lot)-people are quite inaccurate at retrospectively introspecting about what makes them happy-If someone experiences either a very bad life event (e.g paralysis from an accident) or a very good life event (e.g winning the lottery), they will likely return to their baseline level of happiness within a few months. External events tend to affect long term happiness very little, counter to what most people intuitThis book covers a lot of the most important work in happiness research over the last several decades and is written from the perspective of a thorough, balanced, and compassionate scientist. Great read. "
259,0465028020,http://goodreads.com/user/show/82034260-nikhil,4,"Finding meaning in what you do combined with the ability to get into a flow state while doing it is the key to happiness. That is an oversimplified summary of this book that uses both religion and research to propose ways to achieve happiness. It shares some of the content on the author's book on morality and I found it a gratifying experience for the most part. He assures us that as in most aspects of psychology, the answer comes from both within and without. It helps a reader to understand different perspectives of both the religious and atheists, as well as liberals and conservatives by drawing on ethics, concepts of divinity, ultrasociality, and adversity. I'd say the most annoying part of this book is the author's insistence on using the elephant rider hypothesis 99 times across 300 pages. That's way too many times to familiarise readers with the instinct and rationale metaphor. The second was his statement that forcing introverts to be outgoing led to a boost in their mood. I looked up the corresponding research and found that the sample consisted entirely of American college students, which sadly makes me question the veracity of his writing. Nonetheless, I found the book to be compelling and informative, so that's still a huge win, slight irritation or no. I'd definitely recommend it to anyone who wants a keener understanding of psychology, philosophy, and all too elusive answers. "
260,0465028020,http://goodreads.com/user/show/64942666-chris-haley,4,"4.5 stars. This book needs to be read in a book club with deep rumination and discussion after each chapter. It may be brilliant, or it may be simply insightful; I haven't decided which. Every chapter was interesting, some were deeply thought-provoking, perhaps a few were even transformative. There was no common thread weaving through the chapters (or at least none that I found), which may be the reason I am struggling to define its impact. But there are many nuggets of wisdom to be found.A sampling of the ideas in this book:- The concept of the rider and the elephant; ancient wisdom validated by modern psychology, a concept discussed at length by other authors such as Daniel Kahneman in Thinking, Fast and Slow- Adversity does not always make us stronger; it depends on our temperament, the timing, and how we respond to it- Religion and science both play important roles in understanding the human condition and finding happiness; the author argues we need more respect given across the aisle- Our society's movement away from teaching virtue is problematic; when every human being has to decide what's right in any given circumstance without a common set of virtues to strive for (e.g., quandary ethics), we are all worse off- H = S + E + V (Happiness = our genetic setpoint + our environment + our voluntary actions)- There are six virtues that are common across almost all religions and organizations: Wisdom, Justice, Courage, Humanity, Temperance, Transcendence- Evolutionary outcomes are dependent on both culture and genetics"
261,0465028020,http://goodreads.com/user/show/21091961-jacques-bezuidenhout,3,"A book taking some ancient Wisdoms and applying some modern Science / Psychology to determine what it is that makes us happy.This is not a self-help type book, but rather an easy to understand study.I've previously listened to Thinking, Fast and Slow, which focuses on very much the same content. But Daniel Kahneman's book just totally went over my head.This book is way easier to follow and understand.I enjoyed the first half of the book, but it became a bit monotonous towards the end.Especially when he started lingering on the religious aspects, with him being an atheist and all. So it became very much a religion vs science debate with himself.The book had a nice structure, in how the chapters builds up to the conclusion.Did the book change/affect my life in any way? Not really.Worth listening too? I always think that the more you know, the better. And getting some insights into historic thinking compared to modern sciences will always give you something to think about."
262,0465028020,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1717479-terry,5,"Haidt writes a superb book inspecting the nature of happiness, the knobs that affect it. The overall ideas are two fold, that there is consilience between many ancient philosophers and modern neuroscience as to what drives the portion of happiness we can control, and that pharmacology may help us nudge the portion that we can't. The first point is driven by looking at actual studies. Anecdotes are rare and only presented to elucidate a study or research rather than to be taken by itself. The second point is a passionate defense for any number of agents that can change our biochemistry. He refers to choosing to take lithium as ""cosmetic psychopharmacology"" and entirely supportable. Some people have the genetic neurotic switch flipped and we shouldn't socially punish that person for using chemistry to help flip that switch back.I can't recommend this book enough. Most people will get something out of it and Haidt's work avoids the pitfalls common in writing that talks about both neurology and philosophy. Go read it."
263,0465028020,http://goodreads.com/user/show/63426302-alin-pinta,5,"Haidt takes a jetpack, zooms into outer space and allows you to see 'the vast tapestry human culture and see why things are woven in the way that they are'. Exploring the physical, psychological and sociocultural, he seeks hard answers to hard questions.While researching positive psychology for a meta-analysis on the contruction of happiness I came across this book, instantly thinking a title so arrogant to presume to have the answers to such a complex subject must be overselling it. One hour later I was wrapped in awe and wonder, bending page corners and taking quote photos every two minutes.Philosophy drawn from the West and the East is ellegantly blended and applied to modern psychology. Religion, ultrasociability, flow, virtue, adversity, neuroscience, love. I once owned a t-shirt that said 'The search is deeper than you think', but, hell, read this book, dive deep enough and you might even find the meaning of life."
264,0465028020,http://goodreads.com/user/show/10547530-mark,5,"JUST FANTASTIC. I had already read The Righteous Mind and appreciated that, yet it seems to me that the sifting, weighing and balancing among many perspectives is even better in this one. It's research based, which is always important to me, and he pulls from other researchers too. I appreciated the examining of perspectives from across world views and many opposing views, and almost always melding the conclusions in research (and openly stating when it's an opinion). I fully support the idea that ""A good place to look for wisdom, therefore, is where you might least expect to find it; in the minds of your opponents."" This makes fantastic sense as one considers that your knowledge overlaps greatly with your aligned group, and you are likely MISSING things that your opponents see. I HIGHLY recommend this book, and I plan to re-read it soon. (I had borrowed from the Library, but now I'm buying it.)"

However, I now find that the path looks different and I needed something to help me adjust to this alternative route. I started this book lost and looking for purpose and, whilst it didn’t give me all the answers (I wasn’t expecting it to), I think it helped. I liked the mix of old and new philosophy; Haidt has definitely done his homework and there’s something for everyone in this book. Perhaps a bit too much waffle at times, it can be hard to see where each chapter is going and sometimes it doesn’t go anywhere in particular. Nevertheless, it’s a book I could come back to. In the end, ‘our life is the creation of our mind’ and my life continues to evolve in the balance of opposites. "
266,0465028020,http://goodreads.com/user/show/23183558-dina,4,"It's a good book, though in my opinion the author's over-education sometimes gets in between - since he tries to put in too many topics, so overall the message gets confused. To sum it up, the big part of being happy are your morals. If you lead a life full of purpose where you take calculated risk that give you just enough level of adversity to make you stronger but not break you, where you engage in healthy relationships with people based on understanding and trust, where you believe in God and have supporting, strong community around with good parenting, and loving family.It's doesn't actually answer the question of what makes one happy it simply brings different ideas, hypotheses and information all together."
267,0465028020,http://goodreads.com/user/show/9471880-erin-henry,5,"Fascinating and so good! The author is a moral psychologist and has done the research to back up his conclusions. His final conclusion is that happiness comes from between “Happiness is not something that you can find, acquire or achieve directly. You have to get the conditions right and wait. Some of those conditions are within you, such as coherence among the parts and levels of your personality. Other conditions require relationships to things beyond you: just as plants need sun, water, and good soil to thrive, people need love, work, and connection to something larger”Very intellectual and yet really easy to read. I highly recommend it."

On the other hand it was almost depressing? Even though it was a book about achieving happiness? It was overwhelming and left me thinking that I would never reached true happiness without changing everything in my life. I believe that there were a lot of great talking points and that this would be a great book to read with a group of people and discuss how you feel and if you were to adapt any of this into your life. Without a group of people to discuss this I feel its just a bit overwhelming. This is a conversation piece, it really gets the mind thinking. "
269,0465028020,http://goodreads.com/user/show/105239768-yibei,3,"I was oscillating between giving it 3 stars or 4 stars when I was in the middle of the book. After I finished it, I chose 3. The last 2/3 part of the book is not organized at all. He talks about emotion, then jumps to morality, then emotion again. It feels like he was doing his morality research when he wrote this book so his mind just can't help moving towards morality, which is understandable. But, please focus on the topic. His other book The Righteous Mind: Why Good People Are Divided by Politics and Religion has done much better, worth reading.Also, I don't like his definition/judgment of happiness. Happiness is not morality. People have their own definition of happiness and they do have the right to define it. The universal happiness formula is a false proposition."
270,0465028020,http://goodreads.com/user/show/37839735-mason-frierson,5,"“Where does happiness come from? There are several different “happiness hypotheses.” One is that happiness comes from getting what you want, but we all know (and research confirms) that such happiness is short-lived. A more promising hypothesis is that happiness comes from within and cannot be obtained by making the world conform to your desires. This idea was widespread in the ancient world: Buddha in India and the Stoic philosophers in ancient Greece and Rome all counseled people to break their emotional attachments to people and events, which are always unpredictable and uncontrollable, and to cultivate instead an attitude of acceptance. This ancient idea deserves respect, and it is certainly true that changing your mind is usually a more effective response to frustration than is changing the world. However, I will present evidence that this second version of the happiness hypothesis is wrong. Recent research shows that there are some things worth striving for; there are some external conditions of life that can make you lastingly happier. One of these conditions is relatedness—the bonds we form, and need to form, with others. I’ll present research showing where love comes from, why passionate love always cools, and what kind of love is “true” love. I’ll suggest that the happiness hypothesis offered by Buddha and the Stoics should be amended: Happiness comes from within, and happiness comes from without. We need the guidance of both ancient wisdom and modern science to get the balance right.”~ Jonathan Haidt from The Happiness HypothesisI came to this book from Haidt’s wonderful study, THE RIGHTEOUS MIND, which I highly recommend. Given the subject, this book is a bit more diffuse and a little less certain in its conclusions but it is still a wonderful read and an insightful study. It is also a ‘big’ book, i.e. a book that tackles an extremely important subject.I would note, first and foremost, that this is a scholarly book accessible to a wide audience. The writing is lucid and straightforward, jargon-free and not disrupted by endless annotation, charts, graphs and statistics. Most important, perhaps, is its attempt to bring together both psychological science and the humanities. On one page you might receive a report of a study in neuroscience utilizing fMRI technology, on the next the thoughts of Epictetus or Epicurus. While it has often been said that Freud learned as much from literature as from science, that pattern of investigation is now very rare. The ‘psychological sciences’ are now very distinct from the humanities and their work is heavily-funded, empirical science. They associate themselves with the biomedical sciences far more than with the departments of Philosophy or, e.g., Religious Studies. Nevertheless, the literature of reason, wisdom and faith has much to say of, e.g., human happiness and it is to JH’s considerable credit that he measures that literature against the (always tentative) conclusions of modern psychological science. Is Plato’s sense of the divided self a good metaphor for human nature and behavior? Is it true that what doesn’t kill us makes us stronger, as Nietzsche argued? How should we look at Emerson’s transcendentalism in light of the common human desire for such experience?Given the fact that the subject is so vast—the nature of man, the nature of man’s quest for happiness, the very nature of ‘happiness’ and the strategies for achieving it—the conclusions are complex. Nevertheless, they can be summarized briefly.As in THE RIGHTEOUS MIND, JH adopts a Humean model in which the Reason is, ultimately, the slave of the passions. Our lives consist of a multiplicity of experiences that rumble about in our consciousness and direct our ‘automatic’ responses to concrete situations. Joshua Reynolds talked about this phenomenon under the rubric of ‘intuition’. Intuition is not a simple, largely-unwarranted gut reaction; it is the sum total of millions of experiences summoned instantly to respond to a current situation. I am standing beside a highway or a city street. Cars are passing by at various rates of speed. I want to get to the other side of the street, quickly, efficiently and safely. I make instant mental calculations and act . . . . Reason, on the other hand, is something that we utilize when we are pressed to find an argument for an intellectual position. It is, in part, a rhetorical device: how can I outwit and defeat my opponent in the most clever and efficacious fashion? JH takes these phenomena and constructs the ongoing metaphor of a man riding an elephant. The elephant is the sum total of the work of the ‘passions’. He is experience, intuitions, inclinations, and so on. The rider is the Reason. He attempts to control the elephant but that process is complex and sometimes arduous. As we are, in a sense, ‘divided’, so is our world and our experience. So are our bodies. The trick is to put all of this together (with a little luck; being in the right place at the right time helps immeasurably). Here is JH’s conclusion:“We were shaped by individual selection to be selfish creatures who struggle for resources, pleasure, and prestige, and we were shaped by group selection to be hive creatures who need love and attachments, and we are industrious creatures with needs for effectance, able to enter a state of vital engagement with our work. We are the rider and we are the elephant, and our mental health depends on the two working together, each drawing on the others’ strengths. . . . . Happiness is not something that you can find, acquire, or achieve directly. You have to get the conditions right and then wait. . . . Just as plants need sun, water, and good soil to thrive, people need love, work, and a connection to something larger. It is worth striving to get the right relationships between yourself and others, between yourself and your work, and between yourself and something larger than yourself” (pp. 238-39).Bottom line: a lovely book that all should read, absorb and enjoy."
271,0465028020,http://goodreads.com/user/show/793094-lisa,4,"Haidt, a UVa professor, systematically explores what conditions make for a happy life. A little too wordy, especially at first, Haidt cites studies and the research of others to back up his ideas. Most of Haidt's hypothesis rang true to me as I listened to his explanations, although some ideas seem counter intuitive at first. Overall interesting and worth reading! If you are in the depths of depression, this book may not be your lifesaver. However if you ponder the concepts listed, you may be able to make adjustments in your behavior that will make life better for you and those around you. I would strongly recommend reading this book with the thought of how you can change your behavior in such a way that will make life better for others--not just yourself."

The book uses various aphorisms and insights from a variety of ancient traditions such as Buddhism, Stoicism, and Christianity as a framing device to discuss various insights in modern research psychology.

But of the ""joy"" that comes from religious faith, moral goodness, and even ""testimony of the truth of the gospel, as manifested by the Holy Ghost,"" he has no knowledge, and even puts down people of faith.

282,0465028020,http://goodreads.com/user/show/33599214-suha,5,"This books is a beautiful smooth read that teaches you about 10 great ideas of how ancient teachings would be used to our favor in modern psychology. A bit simplistic, however it is still rich and full of helpful information. The author’s humble tone drives you to listen and trust his words; I loved it, especially the part about divinity and our need for spirituality. Here is the summary if you’d like to know more:About the author:Jonathan Haidt is a social psychologist, he is 52 years old and he is a specialist in emotions and morality. He wrote 2 books: This one ""The Happiness Hypothesis"" and the ""The Righteous Mind: Why Good People are divided by Politics"".Haidt was named one of the top world thinkers by foreign policy and prospect magazine.He wrote this book in 2006, and he describes it as it is about 10 great ideas discovered through civilizations which we can apply in our modern life.Outline:The 10 ideas were:1- The divided Self2- Changing your mind3- Reciprocity with Vengeance4- The Faults of others5- The Pursuit of Happiness6- Love & Attachment7- The Uses of Adversity8- The Felicity of Virtue9- Divinity with or without God10- Happiness comes fromChapter 1: The Divided SelfIn this chapter Haidt speaks about mind versus emotion saying that human thinking depends on metaphor~ speaking that Buddha, Freud and Plato each compared human thinking to an animal ~ elephant and horses. In our days, cars replaced elephants and horses so technology gave people more control over their physical worlds. As a result, when people looked for metaphors, they saw the mind as the driver of the car or a program running on a computer. But if that really was how human dealt with things, why do we keep on doing stupid stuff, why we sometimes do the same damn mistake if we know that we have willpower? Why do people keep on procrastinating while they know what exactly the plan to do things?So here Haidt criticized modern theories of rational choice and he believes that older metaphors work way more beautifully. He utilizes in his entire book a metaphor that I found amazing comparing the human as a rider of an elephant ~ the mind is the rider and the elephant is the emotion. If the elephant is happy and satisfied he will gladly obey your rules and be guided, however, if the elephant wants something there is no power that the rider has can stop him. And this is what Haidt meant by the divided self. The elephant represents temptations, weaknesses and internal conflicts.So why do we have this divided self:a- Mind vs Body: we have an automatic nervous system, like an administrative system that does not need thinking to act.b- Left Vs Right: our brains are split into 2 hemispheres joined by the corpus collusum that are specialized in different tasks - left is for language processing & analytics and right is for patterns in space - with experimenting the 2 hemispheres by Gazzinga a famous psychologist of split brain, he discovered that people fabricate reasons to explain their own behavior- a famous process that he called ""confabulation"" which in one experiment he showed the patient the word ""walk"" so the patient got up and walked and when the psychologist asked him why, he said to get a coke.c- New vs Old: originally the brain had 3 clumps of neurons connected to the spine. Overtime as we evolved the brain expanded more and we developed the neocortex which is the gray matter of the human brain. So we originally were animals governed by primitive emotions and drives until we developed the divine gift of reason of the neocortex. And experiments finding is that human rationality works so well only because our emotional brain works so well.d- Controlled Vs Automatic: so we have 2 systems the controlled vs automatic. Mental processes are mostly automatic without attention consciously ~ walking driving eating ~ The controlled process is limited we can only think consciously about one thing at a time but automatic processes happen in parallel.The automatic system has the dopamine in its hands while the controlled system is more like an advisor. The rider is the control and the elephant is the automatic.When we see a painting and we immediately like it and when someone asks us why we tend not to know how to answer the question with reason. The controlled system can never beat the automatic system by willpower alone. Chapter 2: Changing your mindHaidt proceeds in these 2 chapters showing us how weird our minds are.He says that we have a ""Like-o-Meter"" in which everything we see had to be ranked like or dislike and it is always running even if we are not aware. Experiments reveal, that whenever you see someone with the same name, you suddenly create a bias without you knowing it. And People are more likely to marry people whose names sound like their own. Moreover, humans have negativity bias, which is in our understanding, bad is stronger than good, Responses to threats and unpleasantness are far stronger than responses to opportunities and pleasures. The human mind reacts to bad things more quickly and persistently. The elephant reacts before the rider out of survival, when the elephant sees a snake he runs away whether you like it or not. Haidt speaks about the terminology of ""Cortical Lottery"" :this is the basic nature we are born with. Our frontal cortex has left and right side ~ research says if you have more active left side you are lucky and happy by nature:- Always willing to try something new- If you see a chance you go ahead and take it- When good things happen to you it affects you greatlyHowever if your right side is more active: - You worry about making mistakes  - Criticism hurts you- You feel worried when you do poorly at something- You have many fearsThe author believes that there are 3 ways to change this reality of lottery: 1- Meditation 2- Cognitive Therapy and 3 - ProzacHaidt speaks highly of meditation and he describes it as a pill with no side effects and it tames your elephant. On the other hand, cognitive therapy which is founded in the 60s, is the way to correct erroneous thoughts about yourself called cognitive. Finally, Prozac ~ I loved the humbleness of the author as he describes his own experience with a similar drug. He described it as wonderful, it was like magic he said and his life was amazing however he found it difficult to remember names and facts and that was bad for him in his career. Prozac raises the level of serotonin and makes the neurons adapt to new transmission amd raises the level of the neural growth hormone. The sad news that it is a short cut and it changes personality ~ psychologists call it ""cosmetic psychopharmacology"". Haidt thinks it is overprescribed. He summed up the chapter by mentioning that all these ways should be publicized and can be used by the ones with unlucky frontal cortex. Chapter 3: Reciprocity by VengeanceHaidt here also explores human behavior as we by evolution needed to win by surviving our genes, and gossiping and reciprocating were both results of evolution. Gossiping was an essential facet of human evolution and called ""emotional toolkit"" as without it we’d live in chaos and it is by gossip we make sure that what goes around comes around. Gossip is paired with reciprocity which is the karma working here on earth. Reciprocity is so amazing that sales people who are trying to sell you something give you first a gift. When you receive something for free, part of you might be pleased but another part want to give something in return. This is not limited to material things, but also to stories, if someone tells you a romantic story about his past life, you would feel pressured to do the same. Haidt calls reciprocity a relationship tonic. If used properly it strengthens social ties. For ex when we are interacting with someone we like we have tendency to copy their movesChapter 4: The faults of othersHaidt starts his chapter by saying that we are all hypocrites but we only believe that we are not. We are naive and we have myths of pure evil. There was this experiment that resulted in: people who think are moral are in fact more likely to do the right thing but when the result is against them, they find a way to ignore it and follow their self-interest. This is called ""Moral Hypocrisy"". Curing hypocrisy is very hard because we don’t see there is a problem. Haidt reveals that studies have found that we have an inner lawyer, just like you hire a lawyer that is supposed to defend you no matter what, we have an inner lawyer that defends our actions no matter what. When we are asked difficult questions, we usually choose one stand and then think about the defending answers. So we do have a cognitive mission to support our actions or beliefs. However we are extremely accurate and logical in our perceptions of others however it is our self-perceptions that are extremely disturbed ~ we have insider information. Evidence shows that we judge others by their own behavior but we think we have special data about ourselves. Also the ones with positive delusions about themselves are usually happier healthier and better liked. We also are not only hypocrites and delusional but we also have naive realism: we believe that facts as we see them are there for all to see therefore everyone should agree with us. What can we do about hypocrisy, naive realism, and inner lawyer ~ we should see all this arguing and judging as a game and not take our minds too seriously. Our elephant is always evaluating good or bad. Through meditation we can reach non-judgementalism and through it we might be able to look at our opponents point of view and that he is not entirely crazy. Chapter 5: The pursuit of HappinessHaidt criticizes Buddhism and Stoicism as happiness is not only from within ~ because:1- The progress principle: the happiness of pregoal attainment as you make progress towards your goal you are happier.2- The adaptation principle: we tend to reset our comfort zone to new changes. Our satisfaction resets to 0 - we compare ourselves to others. We recalibrate. we people tend to think that people who are more attractive are happier but in fact they are not - the ones who live in cities they are not - the ones with more money they are not - men are happier because of freedom and power they are not - younger they are not. What Haidt is saying here is that it is not entirely from the outside factors but also from the inside factors and here a formula was developed by psychologists:H=S+C+V, S is the biological set point the frontal cortex, C is the conditions of your life, And V is the voluntary activities that you doSo Biology says S and Buddha says VSo what is related to C:A- noise: if you live in traffic, noise, crowd, you are stressed and unhappy.B- Commuting: people think they buy happiness with space if they move farther from the city however commuting for long hours to and from work with traffic makes you unhappyc- Lack of control: if we can’t control some areas in our lives such as the noise, the electricity the paycheck we are less happyd- Relationships: good relationships make people happier - we cannot adapt to conflicts. Here are all the external matters things we should be striving to make. Psychologist say that there is a state people value more than chocolate after sex. They called it ""Flow"" which is a merger between pleasure and gratification. As for pleasures in life they must be spaced and diversified. Variety is the spice of life because it is the natural enemy of adaptation. Pleasure feels good in the moment but gratification is more lasting, it grants us more flow and it extends our limits. The key to find your own gratification is to know your strengths - Haidt suggests a link of a test to your strengths. So ""V"" can increase your happiness if you use your strengths. He also stresses on acts of kindness especially if you use your strengths in that direction. Note: there are misguided pursuits, a misguided pursuit is to keep up with life and he advises, work less, earn less, accumulate less, and consume more family time, vacations and enjoyable activities. Our elephant cares more about prestige. As a result, internal happiness and peace is necessary in ancient teachings but we also need external things as well to reach out for our goals and ambitions. A combination of old and modern psychology.Chapter 6: Love and attachmentThe author explains the difference between 2 kinds of love the passionate love versus the companionate love and how passion results in instant pleasures whereas the companionate love is more gratifying. When you're in passionate love, you can't think straight it is purely the elephant riding, you are not reasonable and you are at the service of the elephant. It alters parts of the brain just like cocaine and lots of dopamine, it keeps you high. But like any drug, it wears off and it is when you suddenly say oh where did the magic go. Over 6 months the pleasure of passionate versus companionate is way way higher but over 60 years it is the opposite and more stable and grows stronger. The conclusion of this chapter is that we are all ultra social species, we need others by evolution lovers, friends, sharing and attachment. Attachment and relationships can bring us pain ""Hell is other people but so is heaven.""Chapter 7:It speaks about the effect of failures, setback and trauma and the notion that it makes us stronger and more fulfilled. Haidt does not entirely agree with that but he said it is positive because:- It might reveal a challenge of hidden abilities- Filter: it makes know the depth and strength of people who truly care- Trauma changes priorities and philosophies towards the present moment and makes you live them.But: research proves that personality traits are stable pre and post trauma- our traits remain the same.So life goals fall into 4 categories:1- Work & Achievement2- Relationships3- Religion & Spirituality4- Contributing to SocietyWe are shaped by evolution to pursue success and not happiness, we fall into the trap of consuming to reach goals instead of happiness. When trauma happens it makes us fall off the treadmill and forces us to forget about these goals and enjoy what is present. It shatters belief systems and robs people out of the sense of meaning and people try to find back the pieces by seeking god or higher purpose to find grounds. It might be beneficial and it might as well be destructive. The blessed are the ones that can make sense - appreciate life's changes and accept what is. When bad things happen to good people, we have a problem. We know unconsciously that life is not fair but we want to see the world through the lens of reciprocity, the downfall of an evil man is justified but when the victim is virtuous we struggle to make sense of his tragedy. Psychologists have found that optimists benefit from trauma more than pessimists, the ones who won the cortical lottery - high set point habitually look at the bright side. Life has a way to make the rich richer and the happy happier. So, when crisis happens we either:1- Active coping 2- Re appraisal 3- Avoidance coping usually shutting off emotions by drugs drinking or other distractions. Chapter 8: The Felicity of VirtueHe starts this chapter by a nice Buddha quote: ""Set your heart on doing good. Do it over and over again and you will be filled with joy. A fool is happy until his mischief turns against him and a good man may suffer until his goodness flowers"". Here he speaks about the wisdom of the ancients as they emphasize practice and habit rather than knowledge. Modern ethics focused on actions and whether a particular action is right or wrong.Thus turn wit time from character focus to action focus moved populations form virtues towards moral reasoning and that is sad because:* It limits the scope of morality*Relies on bad psychology of training the rider rather than the elephant, the person goes to class, learns how to solve problems and then goes back to his elephant in the evening. We are being taught as riders and not elephants. So Haidt things that we need to work on developing our characters and cultivating our strengths - he lists 24 virtues divided into: wisdom, courage, humanity, justice, temperance, and transcendence. Haidt suggests to work on our strengths and not our weaknesses and we can use them to get around the weaknesses, working on your strengths is already enjoyable. Chapter 9: Divinity with or without GodI love this chapter, It is about the ancient truth that religious people grasp and secular don’t. Haidt speaks about how we evolved to have a religion and it was basically on the logic of disgust. Despite the religious fundamentalism and what it can do to us, we should give respect to religious moral motives. In science, we evolved to be religious out of fear and our longing to have something superior to long for. And as science people were trying to describe the emotion of the feeling of being “religiously high” that he called elevation: physical change in the body – dilation of the chest, motivation and a desire of doing charitable and grateful acts and a characteristic feeling beyond body sensations. Haidt studied this specific emotion and it isn’t just a form of happiness. It is also seen as a response to moral beauty involving pleasant feelings in the chest and to become a better person.An interesting experiment done was to test lactating women in 2 groups – 1 group watched a comedy show, the other watched an elevating clip on Oprah Winfry, the 2nd group showed more milk on the nursing pads of the women, and not only that, the 2nd group women went to nurse their babies and showed more warmth in the way they cuddled them.This elevation is found in anything that makes us feel small or insignificant and is not restricted to the religious people who have an idea of the supernatural. Atheists can have many of the same experiences. On the other hand, there are people stuck in the paradox of the self which keep people locked in the material world unable to see divinity.Life in a society that entirely ignored the ethic of divinity would be ugly and unsatisfying.He ends this chapter by saying if religious people are right in believing that religion is the source of their greatest happiness then maybe the rest of us who are looking for happiness and meaning can learn something from them whether or not we believe in god.Chapter 10: Happiness comes from betweengoing back to his formula H= S+C+V, he speaks about C, and he says that the biggest part of C is Love. C also depends on having and pursuing goals, we have a basic drive to make things happen – satisfaction has to be seen as lying in a considerable series of transactions in a trend of behavior rather than the goal. The optimistic conclusion coming out of research in positive psychology is that most people can get more satisfaction from their work. Step 1: know your strengths, if you can engage your strengths you ll find more gratification in work and if you find gratification in work you will have a more positive approach and in this mindset it will be easier for you to see the bigger picture the contribution you are making to a larger experience. Love & work are crucial to happiness and of course something called harmony and purpose related to the elevation and the belonging to a community. The rituals involving repetitive movement and chanting at the same time help to set up resonance patterns in the brains inducing chemicals. So, it is worth striving to get the right relationships between yourself and others, yourself and your work, yourself and something larger than yourself."

In the book The Happiness Hypothesis by Johnathan Haidt he uncovers ten things that have made their way through time that all coincide to help our happiness. Drawing on the words of Buddha, Stoic Philosophy, the Bible, and much more we see that there are certain ideas that can make us happy, and certain ideas that can make us unhappy. There are many factors that go into happiness, such as love and relationships, adversity, and divinity with or without god.Through the course of the book, Johnathan Haidt uses a rider and an elephant as a metaphor. This metaphor guides the book in a way that is unparalleled. Personally, I really appreciated the metaphor because it almost summarized the point Johnathan was trying to convey. In the introduction Johnathan first introduces us to this metaphor by explaining it as, “The mind is divided into parts that sometimes conflict. Like a rider on the back of an elephant, the conscious, reasoning part of the brain has only limited control of what the elephant does.” If one can get their conscious rider to work in conjunction with the automatic elephant we can attain a better a better mental health.One of the first things great ideas that Johnathan Haidt discusses is the importance of reciprocity. At the beginning of the book I really couldn’t understand why reciprocity was such an important idea. In reality, reciprocity is one of the biggest things than contribute to ourselves feeling we belong to a society. In this book reciprocity is defined as a social currency that includes the exchange of things with others for mutual benefit. Reciprocity allows me to show that I care about others, want relationships, and can rejuvenate social ties between different people and/or groups of people. This ties beautifully with the metaphor of the elephant and the rider. The elephant is a natural mimic, we mimic others in a sense of reciprocity. He says, “Mimicry is a social glue, a way of saying “We are one"". I found Johnathan’s insight on many ideas to be very interesting and allowed me to view happiness in a different light. Before reading this book I thought happiness to be something you had or you didn’t. After reading this book I see happiness as something we can achieve, all in our own unique way. We can understand happiness through the conditions we find ourselves in, also known as the happiness formula.I personally found the happiness formula to be very interesting. In chapter five, the happiness formula is considered. The happiness formula introduced here is, H = S + C + V. This means that the amount of happiness we experience is determined by our setpoint (S), the current conditions of your life ( C), and the voluntary activities you choose to do. This was especially interesting because many often see your happiness is only linked to your biological setpoint, what you were born into. Voluntary activities and current conditions play a major role in your happiness and mental health. Out of all the great ideas there was one in particular that I found interesting. This was that our “Happiness comes from between”. We have to strive to be happy, we have to work at it, and it doesn't come overnight. Johnathan states, “You have to get the conditions right and then wait.” We have to draw on relationships, we have to draw on our work, we have to draw on something that is greater than ourselves. I really enjoyed this book and the wisdom that accompanied it. There is so much to learn, and everyone can learn something through this book. It will help you understand the concept of ourselves, the concept of our own elephant and rider. Happiness comes from between, it comes from others, and it comes from the unity between the elephant and the rider. "
284,0465028020,http://goodreads.com/user/show/87218797-ajay-solanky,5,"There's something simultaneously seductive and repulsive, sensible and absurd, and enlightened and profane about taking a surgical approach to finding happiness. But hey, it's worth a shot.I believe that everyone spends 99.9% of their time figuring out how to make themselves happy. At the same time, most of us have no idea how to get there. Instead of thrashing around in the dark, why not take a well-reasoned and scientific-ish approach to the problem?Some of the concepts that I found particularly interesting were:- Even from a biological standpoint, we have divided minds. Your rational mind may point one direction, and your subconscious, another. Your rational mind is underpowered relative to the subconscious - it evolved that way.- A lot of what makes us happy (or unhappy) is predetermined by genetics, circumstance, etc. Free will is often illusive.- Meditation, SSRIs, and cognitive therapy are effective tools for happiness. The latter two are heavily stigmatized, but it's worth opening up your mind to the possibility.- There's a difference between activities that give us ""pleasure"" (hedonism) and ""gratification"" (tasks that absorb your attention, erase self-consciousness and engage your strengths). The former is subject to the ""treadmill"" effect (although still important for day-to-day happiness), whereas the latter is key to long-term fulfillment.- ""No man is an island."" We need to find community, and specifically, romantic love in order to be happy. Romantic love can broken down into 2 different types: ""passionate"" and ""companionate"". The former, in a successful relationship, gives way to the latter, and over time the latter is the real bond that provides lasting happiness and stability.- Adversity can be harmful or helpful when it comes to long term happiness. It shapes, strengthens, and hardens us, and under the right conditions, it can lead to ""post-traumatic growth."" The conditions that lead to growth instead of PTSD are subtle, but it seems like those who experience growth are typically optimists (""positive affective style"") who make sense of their adversity and work it in to their life narratives. Adversity can help us align the different layers of our personalities and move forward with a stronger level of ""cross-coherence""- There are biological (and selfish) reasons for altriuism. For adults, especially older adults, altruism can increase long-term self-esteem and happiness because of the role it plays in strengthening their self-narratives.- Spirituality may be an innate biological ""sense"". Profanity and sacredness are the axes along which this dimension travels, and trying to create a connection with divinity (not necessarily in a religious sense - an atheist can try to connect with the universe as a whole) could be an important element for happiness. Perhaps it should be lamented that spirituality and religious tradition has drained slowly from Western culture- Religion is a part of culture. Culture evolved just like genetics, and a Darwinian framework can be applied here to understand the pervasiveness of religion and how it yields great benefits to communities. It makes us more altruistic and group-minded (at least within the group) and helps to create routine and stability and provide positive narratives that are conducive to happiness."
285,0465028020,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5874435-manu,0,"I don't remember how I discovered this book, but when it arrived, I really liked the title. Mostly because of the word ""hypothesis"", because it signals a scientific approach to a challenge. And that's exactly what the book sets out to do - take ten of the best ideas/concepts from history, religious texts and philosophers, and scrutinise it through a science filter. Positive psychology is the genre. The author begins with the idea of the divided self, and then goes deeper. Into the inbuilt ""affective style"" that plays a huge part in one's personality and how that can be changed, the role of reciprocity, and our tendency towards hypocrisy - seeing the small faults in others while ignoring our own bigger ones. At a third of the book, we even come across a formula for happiness, which makes a lot of sense when viewed rationally. My only concern with the book started around this point. The author seemed to have reframed the original thought (happiness) and moved it to meaning, and he didn't let me in on the reasoning. He tries to bridge this in the last chapter, but to me it seemed forced. If that is set aside, the rest of the book does an excellent job of parsing the ""meaning of life"" into two parts and answering the more important one. The author actually spells out the parsing only towards the end - ""why are we here"" and ""how can I find meaning""? But the chapters before that do give a bunch of perspectives on the second - love and attachments, virtue, adversity, and divinity (agnostic of God). There are several ideas that I could take away from the book. Though the metaphor of the elephant and the driver is not original, the idea of approaching them in tandem and making them work towards a harmony has been elaborated well. It also serves as a good reminder that evolution is only interested in our ""success"" (survival) and happiness is only a nice-to-have. The framing of questions as metaphors is also something I found useful. e.g. What is life? Life is like a journey. Another very interesting concept was the the three layers of personality - basic traits, ""characteristic adaptations"" and ""life story"". To me, it provides a clear actionable on how to approach meaning and happiness. The related concept of ""arête"", as well as the nuanced difference between character and personality were also good finds. It takes a lot of intellect, experience and effort to get the Bhagavad Gita, St.Paul, Confucius, Marcus Aurelius, Buddha, Nietzsche, Benjamin Franklin, Epicurus etc to align in a book that's only 240 pages. The good news is that the book does this quite well. "
286,0465028020,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1500718-ryan,4,"I really enjoyed this book, though much of its content is also in Righteous Mind. If you're on the fence, read the latter. But this book is also good.Some new-to-me (or new to my poor memory me) ideas.First, if we view a religion as a method for forming groups, then it's not so surprising to encounter members of a religion that preaches compassion expressing xenophobia.Second, when we enjoy our work, we may have ""vital engagement"" with it, which here seems to mean that we can see a connection between what we're doing and what we aspire to do. When people find that their job loses meaning, perhaps going on to describe their organization as some form of ""evil empire,"" they are losing that cohesion. I've often wondered, however, if it's not the case that all organizations are at least somewhat corrupt compared to their ideal mission, and so I often default to the idea that it's best not to learn ""how the sausage is made."" This is maybe also why administrators make more money--their jobs may, in this sense, probably suck as they are forced to look behind the curtain to do their job.Third, Haidt discusses activities that offer meaning. Conspicuous activities are prone to adaptability, so if we buy a new watch, we'll adapt to its pleasures and soon find it unfulfilling--until we buy a still fancier watch to flaunt. For a long time, activities like volunteering or going for a run were not very conspicuous and seemed to offer a sort of enduring joy. It occurs to me that we now photograph these activities for public consumption on social media. I will ""like"" a picture of someone running once or twice, but eventually I just ignore them. I wonder if we may witness an eroding of such joyful experiences as even voluntourism becomes just another way of ""keeping up with the Joneses.""I liked this book a lot, though I wonder if a student of psychology might not find it poppy. There's a sort of armchair philosophy in this book, too. I was also struck by how often the most acclaimed psychologists seem to become philosophers."
287,0465028020,http://goodreads.com/user/show/38396339-bastard-travel,4,"Half autobiography, half psych 101 class. Haidt revisits all the psychology experiments you've already heard about and ties them together with snippets of philosophers, most of whom you've also already heard of, then talks about either being in college, teaching at college, or going to India (for research. for college.) He's a respectable social psychologist which is almost like being a scientist, and the book is written clearly and accessibly. There are conflicting schools of thought as to where happiness comes from. Obviously, money can't buy it, or why would they keep saying ""money can't buy happiness"" all the time? They must have gotten it from somewhere. Everybody wants it, nobody knows how to get it.Haidt suggests it's a sort of combination of coming from within and coming from without. You've got to cultivate your internal rock garden, if you're Buddhist, or your inner citadel, if you're more an Aurelius kind of guy. You've got to manage expectations and be grateful for what you've got. You've definitely got to drop that goddamn attitude, I'll tell you that right now. Also, you've got to adopt a moral code and stick to it. You'll feel better if you do. You'll be living in accordance with your virtues, and in Current Year we don't have codified morals or virtues, so nobody knows how to act and it makes them miserable and neurotic.You've also got to stop working all the time and spend more of your time with family and friends. Family especially. You've got to make time for hobbies and live within your means, even if that requires you to adjust your stupid daydreams about Lamborghinis and cocaine to something a little cheaper, that could actually contribute to a sense of fulfillment. Waste your money on experiences, not things.In theory, you follow these rules, as confirmed by both modern psychologists and long-dead Romans, and you should be able to land proper happiness for yourself. But remember. This is just a hypothesis.See? Practically a scientist."
288,0465028020,http://goodreads.com/user/show/71924987-payel-kundu,4,"Having read The Righteous Mind, I went into this book already a big fan of Jonathan Haidt. Fans of Haidt will recognize many common themes between this book and TRM. I thought this book was a wonderful and pretty unusual balance of evidence-based theory and practical self-help. It is at once accessible but also jam packed with rigorous scientific commentary. Also, Haidt is a wonderfully clear and organized writer (quick note, the audiobook version of this is terrible, the narrator has an almost impossibly robotic delivery for a human). I learned a lot from reading this book. I’ll list some of the things I found most interesting or surprising below:-baseline happiness has a large genetic component, it’s thought to be 50-80% heritable (though Haidt is quick to show us that this is not a death sentence for those who have not won the cortical lottery. Rather, the focus of the book is in optimally re-training your elephant to make the most of your genetic lot)-people are quite inaccurate at retrospectively introspecting about what makes them happy-If someone experiences either a very bad life event (e.g paralysis from an accident) or a very good life event (e.g winning the lottery), they will likely return to their baseline level of happiness within a few months. External events tend to affect long term happiness very little, counter to what most people intuitThis book covers a lot of the most important work in happiness research over the last several decades and is written from the perspective of a thorough, balanced, and compassionate scientist. Great read. "
289,0465028020,http://goodreads.com/user/show/82034260-nikhil,4,"Finding meaning in what you do combined with the ability to get into a flow state while doing it is the key to happiness. That is an oversimplified summary of this book that uses both religion and research to propose ways to achieve happiness. It shares some of the content on the author's book on morality and I found it a gratifying experience for the most part. He assures us that as in most aspects of psychology, the answer comes from both within and without. It helps a reader to understand different perspectives of both the religious and atheists, as well as liberals and conservatives by drawing on ethics, concepts of divinity, ultrasociality, and adversity. I'd say the most annoying part of this book is the author's insistence on using the elephant rider hypothesis 99 times across 300 pages. That's way too many times to familiarise readers with the instinct and rationale metaphor. The second was his statement that forcing introverts to be outgoing led to a boost in their mood. I looked up the corresponding research and found that the sample consisted entirely of American college students, which sadly makes me question the veracity of his writing. Nonetheless, I found the book to be compelling and informative, so that's still a huge win, slight irritation or no. I'd definitely recommend it to anyone who wants a keener understanding of psychology, philosophy, and all too elusive answers. "
290,0465028020,http://goodreads.com/user/show/64942666-chris-haley,4,"4.5 stars. This book needs to be read in a book club with deep rumination and discussion after each chapter. It may be brilliant, or it may be simply insightful; I haven't decided which. Every chapter was interesting, some were deeply thought-provoking, perhaps a few were even transformative. There was no common thread weaving through the chapters (or at least none that I found), which may be the reason I am struggling to define its impact. But there are many nuggets of wisdom to be found.A sampling of the ideas in this book:- The concept of the rider and the elephant; ancient wisdom validated by modern psychology, a concept discussed at length by other authors such as Daniel Kahneman in Thinking, Fast and Slow- Adversity does not always make us stronger; it depends on our temperament, the timing, and how we respond to it- Religion and science both play important roles in understanding the human condition and finding happiness; the author argues we need more respect given across the aisle- Our society's movement away from teaching virtue is problematic; when every human being has to decide what's right in any given circumstance without a common set of virtues to strive for (e.g., quandary ethics), we are all worse off- H = S + E + V (Happiness = our genetic setpoint + our environment + our voluntary actions)- There are six virtues that are common across almost all religions and organizations: Wisdom, Justice, Courage, Humanity, Temperance, Transcendence- Evolutionary outcomes are dependent on both culture and genetics"

But Daniel Kahneman's book just totally went over my head.This book is way easier to follow and understand.I enjoyed the first half of the book, but it became a bit monotonous towards the end.Especially when he started lingering on the religious aspects, with him being an atheist and all. So it became very much a religion vs science debate with himself.The book had a nice structure, in how the chapters builds up to the conclusion.Did the book change/affect my life in any way? Not really.Worth listening too? I always think that the more you know, the better. And getting some insights into historic thinking compared to modern sciences will always give you something to think about."
292,0465028020,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1717479-terry,5,"Haidt writes a superb book inspecting the nature of happiness, the knobs that affect it. The overall ideas are two fold, that there is consilience between many ancient philosophers and modern neuroscience as to what drives the portion of happiness we can control, and that pharmacology may help us nudge the portion that we can't. The first point is driven by looking at actual studies. Anecdotes are rare and only presented to elucidate a study or research rather than to be taken by itself. The second point is a passionate defense for any number of agents that can change our biochemistry. He refers to choosing to take lithium as ""cosmetic psychopharmacology"" and entirely supportable. Some people have the genetic neurotic switch flipped and we shouldn't socially punish that person for using chemistry to help flip that switch back.I can't recommend this book enough. Most people will get something out of it and Haidt's work avoids the pitfalls common in writing that talks about both neurology and philosophy. Go read it."
293,0465028020,http://goodreads.com/user/show/63426302-alin-pinta,5,"Haidt takes a jetpack, zooms into outer space and allows you to see 'the vast tapestry human culture and see why things are woven in the way that they are'. Exploring the physical, psychological and sociocultural, he seeks hard answers to hard questions.While researching positive psychology for a meta-analysis on the contruction of happiness I came across this book, instantly thinking a title so arrogant to presume to have the answers to such a complex subject must be overselling it. One hour later I was wrapped in awe and wonder, bending page corners and taking quote photos every two minutes.Philosophy drawn from the West and the East is ellegantly blended and applied to modern psychology. Religion, ultrasociability, flow, virtue, adversity, neuroscience, love. I once owned a t-shirt that said 'The search is deeper than you think', but, hell, read this book, dive deep enough and you might even find the meaning of life."
294,0465028020,http://goodreads.com/user/show/10547530-mark,5,"JUST FANTASTIC. I had already read The Righteous Mind and appreciated that, yet it seems to me that the sifting, weighing and balancing among many perspectives is even better in this one. It's research based, which is always important to me, and he pulls from other researchers too. I appreciated the examining of perspectives from across world views and many opposing views, and almost always melding the conclusions in research (and openly stating when it's an opinion). I fully support the idea that ""A good place to look for wisdom, therefore, is where you might least expect to find it; in the minds of your opponents."" This makes fantastic sense as one considers that your knowledge overlaps greatly with your aligned group, and you are likely MISSING things that your opponents see. I HIGHLY recommend this book, and I plan to re-read it soon. (I had borrowed from the Library, but now I'm buying it.)"

However, I now find that the path looks different and I needed something to help me adjust to this alternative route. I started this book lost and looking for purpose and, whilst it didn’t give me all the answers (I wasn’t expecting it to), I think it helped. I liked the mix of old and new philosophy; Haidt has definitely done his homework and there’s something for everyone in this book. Perhaps a bit too much waffle at times, it can be hard to see where each chapter is going and sometimes it doesn’t go anywhere in particular. Nevertheless, it’s a book I could come back to. In the end, ‘our life is the creation of our mind’ and my life continues to evolve in the balance of opposites. "

To sum it up, the big part of being happy are your morals. If you lead a life full of purpose where you take calculated risk that give you just enough level of adversity to make you stronger but not break you, where you engage in healthy relationships with people based on understanding and trust, where you believe in God and have supporting, strong community around with good parenting, and loving family.It's doesn't actually answer the question of what makes one happy it simply brings different ideas, hypotheses and information all together."

His final conclusion is that happiness comes from between “Happiness is not something that you can find, acquire or achieve directly. You have to get the conditions right and wait. Some of those conditions are within you, such as coherence among the parts and levels of your personality. Other conditions require relationships to things beyond you: just as plants need sun, water, and good soil to thrive, people need love, work, and connection to something larger”Very intellectual and yet really easy to read.

On the other hand it was almost depressing? Even though it was a book about achieving happiness? It was overwhelming and left me thinking that I would never reached true happiness without changing everything in my life. I believe that there were a lot of great talking points and that this would be a great book to read with a group of people and discuss how you feel and if you were to adapt any of this into your life. Without a group of people to discuss this I feel its just a bit overwhelming. This is a conversation piece, it really gets the mind thinking. "

The last 2/3 part of the book is not organized at all. He talks about emotion, then jumps to morality, then emotion again. It feels like he was doing his morality research when he wrote this book so his mind just can't help moving towards morality, which is understandable. But, please focus on the topic. His other book The Righteous Mind: Why Good People Are Divided by Politics and Religion has done much better, worth reading.Also, I don't like his definition/judgment of happiness. Happiness is not morality. People have their own definition of happiness and they do have the right to define it. The universal happiness formula is a false proposition."
