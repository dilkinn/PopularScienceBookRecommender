0,1771643471,http://goodreads.com/user/show/10014356-virginie-no-more-time-to-write-reviews-for-the-moment,4,So many interesting informations about this fascinating subject: the memory. Do you know that some people remember absolutely everything while others don't have any memories? I could go on and on! I kept retelling the anecdotes to my boyfriend because it was so enlightening.The two sisters (a scientific and a writer) succeeded to write a very interesting book. I really liked it!
1,1771643471,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2361952-biblibio,4,"When one sister is a neuroscientist and the other is a writer, you're pretty much guaranteed an awesome collaboration. The book is an interesting mix of anecdotes and studies about the human brain and memory, wrapped up in a well-written literary style that makes the whole reading experience surprisingly entertaining (as well as educational!). Because the science is still so sketchy, Diving for Seahorses definitely ends up feeling a little incomplete, but in the way that a door has been opened and now I can think about all sorts of new ideas. I quite enjoyed it and would love to see this get a wider audience."
2,1771643471,http://goodreads.com/user/show/16212136-peter-pete-mcloughlin,4, Straightforward book on Memory. I am fascinated by this topic. Since memory is tied so much with who we are as people. The book goes over the cognitive mechanisms behind it and where it can go wrong. False memories have caused problems in the courtroom as people misremember details and have gotten some innocent people behind bars paying the price of our imperfect memory. Also some pathologies where memory breaks down and the tragic consequences of losing this crucial part of yourself.

4,1771643471,http://goodreads.com/user/show/31412159-furious-gazelle,4,"Diving for Seahorses is a collaboration between sisters: the writer and editor Hilde Ostby and the clinical neuropsychologist Dr. Ylva Ostby; a necessary team, as this book artfully explores the history of human knowledge regarding memory. The book takes its name from the hippocampus. As explained in the first pages, an Italian doctor named it the hippocampus (Latin for horse sea monster) back in 1564. This is the seahorse we’re diving for. This metaphor is stretched throughout the book (sometimes a little too thin, but it works). This was an overall fascinating read. Anyone who has ever had an interest in learning more about the human brain, and of course specifically memory, will enjoy this book.Hilde is a beautiful writer though at times some of her words may have been lost in translation and there are instances that read too much like a textbook rather than a nonfiction work. There are wholly artistic portrayals of experiments- like when recreating a 1970s experiment to see if memory was tied to location by diving underwater and memorizing lists of words. “We will see with our own eyes how their brains have worked, linking words and seaweed and cold water together into the same network. But we’re still standing on the pier, while the February cold eats away into our woolen underwear. It’s anything but magical. (p.27)” She puts in magical descriptions while really bringing you into time and place. This serves her well whether talking about the present or taking the reader back to early renaissance discoveries about the brain. The clinical information is sometimes presented, well, clinically, and that was really my main complaint. There were points where I was really invested in the book and the anecdotes being presented– Henry Molaison’s life story was insane– and then they would dip into paragraphs that would sound more at home in a scientific journal, as though they were presenting research rather than telling a story. I understand that it is clinical information, and it would likely be less worthwhile without Ylva’s analysis, but since they were working together it could have been cleaned up. However, the overly dry sections were few and far between and Hilde has a talent for making even the decades (and in some cases, centuries) old stories seem present and tangible. They cover a lot of ground in this fairly slim novel and all of it was truly intriguing. Despite the clinical parts, they engage with many people who aren’t scientists- like, novelists, and memory masters- which really drives home that the human brain isn’t just “science” it’s you. There’s nothing more gripping than finding out what makes us tick.Review originally posted at https://thefuriousgazelle.com/2018/12..."

6,1771643471,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2650868-leah-rachel-von-essen,4,"Diving for Seahorses: Exploring the Science and Secrets of Human Memory by Hilde Østby and Ylva Østby was a fascinating book about the mysteries that scientists are still digging into around our memory and how it works. This is a well-written and deeply compelling book, easy to read, about the study of memory—both how we learned what we know now and what we are studying that we still don’t know. The most intriguing chapter for me was on false memory—on how we can ingrain false memories, on the implications for the justice system that it can be easy to implant false memories into the human brain, both to elicit confessions and to influence witnesses. The chapter was packed with things I didn’t know about how our memory worked and how it reveals flaws in how we blindly trust witness and police officer recall, or even confessions, during trials. Unfortunately, I was also disappointed that this section failed to engage with prejudice and race and their impact on memory. If we’re discussing the possibility of remembering wrong, it should have been noted that if a witness sees black men as more likely to be criminals, they’ll be more likely to remember the criminal as black if they didn’t get a good look, or to agree and restructure their memory if the police suggest that the criminal wasn’t white. To bring up the Central Park Five but never mention the factor preconceptions and prejudice play in the construction of false memories seemed like a huge oversight.Overall, this book was readable, informative, and full of interesting anecdotes that I really enjoyed. I learned a lot, but was slightly disappointed by the failure to engage with the question of preconceptions in memory, and also was occasionally annoyed by the interjections of the authors themselves attempting to run experiments on their peers for fun—some of these yielded interesting results, but others I skimmed. It’s well-written and compelling. Diving for Seahorses comes out October 9 from Greystone Books."

It opened my eyes to the world of my childhood, youth, early and middle adulthood, my aging years and now the possible acceptance of dementia. What a mind blowing adventure I have been on, it has blown away all my anxieties and fears and given me joy in my journey from now to my future! A most unexpected outcome, but it has given me the courage to face whatever my future holds. Thank you ."
8,1771643471,http://goodreads.com/user/show/91831602-billy-curry,4,An interesting look at how our brain works. The writer provided an informative narrative. There were some interesting parts to the books informal research with working professionals as well as some academic insights. I would like to have seen a little more discussion for effective application for the average person. 
9,1771643471,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5148104-celeste,4,"I quite enjoyed this novel about memory. The case studies mentioned were fascinating, the writing was easy to follow if almost tangential at times, and the choices the authors made with respect to what about memory to discuss were not as expected to my delight.I absolutely adored the chapter The Elephant’s Graveyard, both due to the cleverness of the title and the actual content about the art of forgetting and it’s importance. The conversations between both sisters that were incorporated into the novel were some of my favourite passages. And I found myself pleasantly intrigued that a lot if not most of the people interviewed for this story were (or at least appeared to be) Norwegian, providing an unique POV to assess memory from.My main gripe is that, at times, the transitions to connect ideas, whether they were trying to segue the more science heavy parts with the more literary aspects or just trying to progress the story along, were sometimes too convenient and sounded odd in their execution. I’m not sure if it’s a result of the translation or just due to my own personal preferences, but it pulled me out of the novel to a noticeable degree.But other than that, I definitely would recommend this to anyone curious about memory."
10,1771643471,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6998570-jess,5,"A wonderfully clear and compassionate overview of memory science, an area I had almost no prior knowledge about. Some of of my favourite facts: - Mammal brains contain ‘grid cells’, which create a hexagonal co-ordinate map of the world around us. - The brain uses almost the same regions when imagining the future as remembering the past- the ‘default mode network’. This ‘mental time travel’ is something that helps us solve problems by imagining future scenarios using past experiences. - Some people suffer from a lack of autobiographical memories, meaning they remember facts about themselves but can’t relive the emotions or sensations of their past experiences. I loved the style of the two sister authors, who seemed to perfectly complement each other’s areas of skill. The addition of a novelists eye for characters and story was perfect in a book about memory, which as they argue in the book is largely composed of stories we reconstruct about ourselves. "
11,1771643471,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1772968-carole-yeaman,4,"I read lots of things on neurology: on-line and in magazines and books. Surprisingly, this book held lots of new findings -- new to me, anyway. It was published this year, so should be current (it seems to be). It is written in a style that clarifies and/or extends old facts as well. Took lots of notes, but may buy it after some consideration.Nice to have your sister as your co-worker - this might account for its lightness in tone."
12,1771643471,http://goodreads.com/user/show/24844504-hodgep,5,A non-fiction book made so very absorbing by the joint authorship of the scientist and the writer.The science of memory and the history of it was presented for every reader to understand. There remains much to be learned about it.The last chapter is a comforting ending to complete the story of memory research. Bravo ladies! I’ll read this again. (Because I want to remember everything in the book!)
13,1771643471,http://goodreads.com/user/show/9574611-jenna,4,"Thank you for the Christmas present, Jennifer!This book was a very accessible read about memories. The topics include how they are formed, forgotten, false memories, and how memory is linked to viewing the future. I liked the inclusion of research, case studies, and interviews with researchers, and non-researchers. The writing had a lot more personality than I’m used to for nonfiction, but I think that helped as I’m not super knowledgable about psychology or neurology. "
14,1771643471,http://goodreads.com/user/show/73131686-anna-van-koeverden,4,"3.5 stars. Easy to read and pretty interesting, but I was left feeling like I don't really understand how memory works any better than before I read the book - however I think that is largely to do with the fact that a lot of it is still unknown. Maybe the authors should revisit this work in another 10 years."
15,1771643471,http://goodreads.com/user/show/33664220-irene-allison,4,"Brilliantly written and full of fascinating details about memory's power and fragility, memory's ability to reach into the future, and memory's temptation to recreate what was never there.I found this book captivating, full of interesting anecdotes and metaphor. It has left me with a deeper appreciation of the magnificence, magnitude, and power of human memory. "
16,1771643471,http://goodreads.com/user/show/46880153-lucas-jarche,3,"Cut out the last third of this book and I would have liked it a lot more. The last couple chapters seemed to lose the tight focus of earlier chapters, getting a bit more existential and memory-adjacent. But I enjoyed the description of seminal psychological studies on memory, the fake-memory stuff, and the focus on journaling and memory. "
17,1771643471,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6801122-trina,3,"At times interesting, at other times very frustrating for me because I have aphantasia and either SDAM or developmental amnesia. Quite a few times it drifts into talking about the importance of envisioning the future (or the past) and since this is not possible for me it was aggravating."
18,1771643471,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4645818-richard,4,A very warm and engrossing read. Occasionally falls into waffle but for the most part this was thoroughly enjoyable 
19,1771643471,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6492207-paulina,4,"3.5 stars. Engrossing most of the time, but at the same time I did not find that I've learned too much"
20,1771643471,http://goodreads.com/user/show/50691923-bonnie-long,3,"An uneven book, with tangents digressing from the focus on how our memory functions. For those with little knowledge in the area, it is an engaging read.  "
21,1771643471,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7986559-alayne,4,"An interesting look at memory and how it works, and how much we still don't know about it. Well written, and well translated from Norse. Quite enjoyable."
22,1771643471,http://goodreads.com/user/show/52807056-cheyne,4,"A good read for those wanting to learn about the psychology of memory and learning, but pretty superficial for readers in the science field. Directed towards an non-STEM major type of reader. "
23,1771643471,http://goodreads.com/user/show/24103081-darius-hinks,4,Fascinating look at how and why we remember things.
24,1771643471,http://goodreads.com/user/show/91683293-anna-maria-wi-niewska,5,These two girls described The Memory in such an easy and interesting way. It was nice to read
25,1771643471,http://goodreads.com/user/show/28640266-carol-radovan,5,"Excellent in all aspects .. informative, credible, human and engaging."
26,1771643471,http://goodreads.com/user/show/53590083-karen-martin,5,Enormously interesting study of memory from neurological and psychological perspectives. Immensely readable.
27,1771643471,http://goodreads.com/user/show/70369446-alan-lehto,5,Engaging and surprising. An excellent read. Surprising and fascinating science coupled with a literary sensibility behind the story telling. Satisfying at multiple levels. 
28,1771643471,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5015586-jessica-mccann,5,"What a fascinating read. Thick with history, research and analysis on the science and exploration of memory, presented through engaging anecdotes and vivid metaphors. "
29,1771643471,http://goodreads.com/user/show/29260550-novah,5,"Almost to the end of this thriller. It truly is a wonderful book. Pairs nicely with ""Moonwalking with Einstein"" by one of the Foer brothers. This book is really focused on the actual scientific research revolving around memory, but does hit on memory techniques. It really is helpful to understand the ins and out of what is ""memorable"" and even what isn't.I find it so strange that I forgot purchasing this book until it came in and also that I lost it in the midst of reading and found it months later. I do hope I finish."
30,1771643471,http://goodreads.com/user/show/84314049-jono-rostron,5,Enlightening and a challenging thought to take on: “Are a lot of the memories I have constructed to make them or me sounds better?”
