This, chapter 14, named ""Thirdworldization"" is a reason for shame for the rich, industrialized countries, but what is not?The general question is, as so often, not if, but more when, how, where and hopefully not me.When: There are many ticking time bombs, be it manmade problems with superbugs due to overuse of antibiotics, urbanization with more and more people living close together, the possibility of spillovers in companion with natural destruction, as unexplored areas with new species of primates are exploited, other manmade problems like side effects of genetical engineering, the option for use as biological weapons, climate change and global warming that help germs immigrate to new territories and possibly frozen ones come back to live, terrible public health and prevention politics, no further development of new and preventive vaccines and antibiotics because there is no money to make with this stuff, except if it is the flu,...How: As an element of warfare or one lumberjack, being bitten by a monkey or getting in contact with body fluids spreading it in his hometown and from there to a larger city to the capital to….. Or a multiresistant superbug out of a secret biowarfare lab or an industrial farming facility, whatever the difference is, the farming might get much more subsidies. There are so many great film plots around this.Where: The only positive thing. If one doesn´t live in a larger city, but a rural area, by simply shooting everyone nearing the village after the breakout, bad things can be prevented and outposts have a long tradition of hating anything foreign, so that should work well. Except when there is a longer state of emergency, break down of infrastructure and food supply, leather rockers cannibalizing around, virus apocalypse, yada yada yada.The author is a biologist with specializations in bacteriology and immunology who switched to journalism and the chapters read like great storylines for hard biopunk Sci-Fi stories. The underrepresented biopunk genre deserves more authors who are biologists, geneticists, bioengineers,... So please, take a creative writing course and create the next big thing, because the Sci-Fi hall of fame is filled with just mostly astrophysicists, chemists, physicists and similar, mainly not bio-focused, authors.All of the points the author mentioned a long time ago, the suggestions she made on how to be able to deal with the problems have been commendably solved by a wise and united world government and public-private partnerships with international institutions that... Just joking, we are doomed (when living in large cities)! Doooomed. (I love to say that.) Now, it´s really enough. Ok, once again: „Move along people, nothing to see here. The government is competent and capable to deal with the situation.“One more: They build bioweapons by combining elements of something extremely deadly like smallpox or ebola with the flu and anything that can spread by air and is extremely contagious. Something like a droplet infection that spread genetically enhanced HIV, multiresistant tuberculosis, hepatitis C,… this way might be no effective immediate use bioweapon, but something for the long-term destruction of a country, especially if the own population is immune and vaccinated against it.A wiki walk can be as refreshing to the mind as a walk through nature in this completely overrated real life outside books: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pandemichttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zoonosishttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Viral_h...I read it inspired, or let´s say terrified, yes, that sounds much better, by the current coronavirus outbreak.https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2019%E2...CNN live updateshttps://edition.cnn.com/asia/live-new...John Hopkins CSSE world maphttps://gisanddata.maps.arcgis.com/ap...Youtube statisticshttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qgylp..."

I was seeing a guy getting his Ph.D. at Harvard School of Public Health and leaving him even more sleep-deprived than your average Sci.D. getting a Ph.D. in public health by hitting him on the arm to wake him up multiple times a night as questions occurred to me. Maybe if I'd written them down we'd still be together. (Kidding!)(Focus, Lori.

I stopped and asked ""Are you Laurie Garrett?"" And, of course, she was. Then I said something impossibly stupid--like ""You are to disease what the Beatles are to music."" That wasn't what I actually said, but it was something equally idiotic and I'm sure I embarrassed the poor woman. I attended a reading she gave a few years later when she was releasing a book on the public health system, and afterwards I wanted to get her to sign my copy--but I was afraid she might remember me. And I was also afraid she wouldn't. So I just left when the lecture was over.None of this speaks to this book at all, but there it is."

Nature isn't benign... we're not alone at the top of the food chain... The survival of human species is not a preordained evolutionary program.

So proclaimed Joshua Lederburg, a molecular biologist and Nobel laureate. Despite the speaker's prestige, human nature would want to dismiss his statements. But as nearly the entire world is struggling, at great human cost, against viral Covid19 infection in 2020, his declarations' veracity are self evident while his warning carries ominous heft.

 Humanity's ancient enemies are, after all, microbes. They didn't go away just because science invented drugs, antibiotics, and vaccines... And they certainly won't become extinct simply because human beings choose to ignore their existence... lulled into a complacency born of proud discoveries and medical triumphs, [leaving humanity] unprepared for the coming plague. 

More than 25 years have elapsed since the publication of The Coming Plague, and Laurie Garrett's thesis remains relevant today. Because as quickly as scientists have advanced in knowledge, the microbes (microorganisms such as bacteria, parasites, and viruses) are evolving just as doggedly. What's worse, however, is that she asserted that people are actually aiding and abetting microbes through a variety of actions ranging from ill planned development schemes, misguided medicine, errant public health to short-sighted political action or inaction.Garrett illustrated her theme via historical accounts of disease outbreaks since the 1950s, when the health field was confident that humans had vanquished acute diseases. Hubris comes before the fall. Sometimes the records were of the unglamorous, globe-trotting sort with biologists trapping bats, mice, snakes, etc. to identify the disease-carrying vector. Other times, the scientists operated in imperiled circumstances due to military activity or they themselves became infected by the lethal pathogen that they were investigating.As this book numbered 750 pages, Garrett included a long litany of horrors caused by microbes. The following were described at some length, and I've sorted them by their preferred modes of transmission:Mosquitoes - malaria, yellow fever, dengueMice- Machupo (Bolivian hemorrhagic fever), Lassa fever, hanta-ARDS (acute respiratory distress syndrome)Bats (best suspect) - Ebola Monkeys - Marburg hemorrhagic feverHumans - smallpox, meningitis, STDs (sexually transmitted diseases), AIDS (acquired immunodeficiency syndrome), tuberculosisWater - Legionnaire's disease, choleraAlthough the reading experience of this pathogen parade did not feel short, Garrett had only pointed to the tip of the iceberg. For in just 20 years when the US had established biological research stations throughout the Southern hemisphere, more than 60 viruses with terrifying impacts had been identified. The hemorrhagic fevers were quite horrific as they created holes in blood vessels, so patients bled from everywhere within and without the body. As many as half of the patients with the Machupo virus died from a seizure or cardiac arrest after their bodies went into shock. Through Garrett's accounts, I learned new concepts that I really would have wished out of reality except that I'm not a 3 year-old. Starting with ""iatrogenic"" - which describes disease created as a result of medical treatment (ex. pediatric AIDS infection in hospital nurseries). This differs from ""nosocomial"" transmission, which is the two-way spread of disease between patients and medical staff. In the 1990s, virologists believed that the worst scales of disease and death occurred with ""epizootic"" events, which happen when a virus is benign with host animal species #1 but becomes lethal when the virus finds animal species #2. Underlying this, of course, was the fear of ""zoonosis"" (infectious disease caused by a pathogen that has jumped from an animal and into humans), which is what the world is dealing with now. 

Microbes are masters of genetic engineering. 

Lederburg won his Nobel prize in 1958 because he discovered that bacteria can mate and exchange genes. As the new field of molecular biology has grown, they've since learned of the many genetic strategies microbes have to mutate and develop resistance to antibiotics and other pharmaceutical treatments. For the most part, Garrett wrote about the underlying science in an accessible way for the layperson. There were only about 20 pages on transposons, plasmids, and other microbial tactics of jumping genes which led to glazed vision from detail overload. Because of the improper use of antibiotics, many diseases are now more difficult and costly to treat. And becoming infected with something like MRSA just for being hospitalized is now not a minor concern. Garrett's most extensive disease coverage was on AIDS, because that was the most recent and globally significant pandemic prior to her book's publication. She wanted to highlight the failings in response to that crisis in order for us to learn and thus prepare for the inevitable next pandemic. As I've followed the news, we apparently learned nothing. In the US, we were caught with our pants down, not only for the embarrassing handling of the Covid19 pandemic (WH ""leadership"" denial and agitation and faulty / inadequate testing) but for the massive, and still tabulating, cost in deaths (with disproportionate racial mortalities) and human suffering economically, socially, and psychologically.By the end of The Coming Plague,  one would have to engage in willful denial to ignore Garrett's warning. Humankind needs to change our mindset. We are vulnerable and microbes do not respect any physical walls; in fact, they'll live on them in hopes of finding their next host. There will be no success solely with a strategy of national isolation because as economies reopen, the resultant flows in trade and people expose everybody to danger (at least until the majority receive effective vaccination). And as we continue to change our planet in the extreme pursuit of development and wealth, we will continue to aid and abet microbes in their fight for survival to our detriment. This is probably the longest nonfiction I've read outside of an academic setting, if not ever. The writing quality became less even as the book progressed. My reader fatigue was matched by editorial weariness, as I encountered more typos. Garrett had quit her doctoral program in immunology to become a science journalist. So she definitely has the necessary scientific background, but the writing could have been improved to strengthen her thesis. I would thus rate the message and content 4.5 stars but the reading experience between 3-3.5 stars at times for a final 4 stars."
6,0140250913,http://goodreads.com/user/show/632247-chrissie,3,"3 starsThis book is in-depth. The focus is on history, detailed facts and what we can do to prevent and cope with new maladies. Even if the book is no longer new, it still teaches a lot. We can learn from past mistakes. For me, parts read as a horror story. Then I calmed down. It first came out in 1994, and hey, we are still here! Did I become immune to the horror?! Or did it finally put me to sleep? In places, it sort of felt like a text book. My education was not adequate for a complete understanding of some of the medical discussions. It is heavily footnoted and has an index too. It is no sensational, quick read. It is both scary and deadening. Yes, the pun was intended. The book is directed toward serious readers who want the complete history of the new plagues that have confronted us in the last century, think the Bolivian hemorrhagic fever, the Marbug virus, Yellow fever, the Brazilian meningitis epidemic, Lassa fever, Ebola, swine flu, Legionnaires’ disease, sexually transmitted diseases and injecting drug users, AIDS, toxic shock syndrome and what can be done to stop this trend. Elimination of a disease threat is inextricably bound to economics, development and politics. The fight against disease is inextricably a fight against world poverty. Here is the truth: to complete this book I forced myself to read one chapter a day.*************************After Chapter 5: Definitely interesting but hard to read. I am no hypochondriac; I tend to treat pains with nonchalance in fact, but when you read this book you start worrying. You certainly get scared of traveling to Africa, and you wash your hands a lot. Have decided to read a chapter a day, which is about all I can handle, due only to my own fears. So far I have learned about Yellow fever, Ebola, Lassa fever, Marburg virus....."
7,0140250913,http://goodreads.com/user/show/278515-stefanie,5,"although it's now somewhat out of date, this remains far and away the most comprehensive and interesting book about diseases i've read. what sets this apart from the rest of the disease books on my shelf is the sheer amount of ground covered and how well it's presented. it doesn't particularly seem like it would be a fast read, yet it is."
8,0140250913,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1910836-lobstergirl,4,"We're screwed. The microbes are going to win. And make no mistake, climate change is going to accelerate our death spiral. (Though writing in the early 1990s, Garrett discusses the effects of global warming on pathogen populations and spread.)One of the most fascinating things about this story is that we are drastically underestimating the number of deaths from microbes and pathogens. If we actually had public health departments that were funded and functioned properly, if we funded public health and epidemiological studies and prevention efforts at the national level to match the need, if we did proper autopsies on everyone and performed the requisite tests, we would find the mortality rates from these infectious diseases jumping enormously. The truth is that many deaths from pathogens go unnoticed and unreported because they are not tested for; they are attributed to causes like pneumonia. (An example is Legionnaires' disease, which we associate with an isolated event in Philadelphia in 1976. But the bacteria that causes Legionnaires' disease probably killed thousands more people in the years after air conditioning systems were invented, and these deaths were attributed to other causes.)Garrett's book is a masterpiece of reporting and synthesis that, with the exception of chunks here and there, reads like a novel. Just one tiny example of her thoroughness is a footnote in which she lists every major influenza pandemic since the year 1173, along with the probable origin, geographical scope, and estimated mortality of each. This footnote has its own footnotes (four different sources). And the book has more than 100 pages of footnotes. Some of them have more depth of reporting than a news article in a major newspaper.The book is all the more astonishing in that due to an occupational injury, Garrett was unable to use a keyboard and wrote the whole thing in longhand."
9,0140250913,http://goodreads.com/user/show/83445-lisa-vegan,5,"This is my kind of horror book. I think it scared me more than just about any other book I’ve ever read, but I loved it. I appreciated the author’s skillful and entertaining story telling and admired her scientific accuracy.I can’t vouch that the information is current; I read this when it was first published. At the time it was pertinent and I can’t imagine that the basic theory (regarding epidemics) isn’t still valid. I’d continue to recommend this to anyone who’s interested in medicine, disease, and human health.I enjoyed this book so much that when Laurie Garrett was speaking in my city, I went to hear her; she’s very personable and knowledgeable."

Abundant sources of genetic variation exist for viruses to learn new tricks, not necessarily confined to what happens routinely, or even frequently.”""If HIV was our model, leading scientists concluded, humanity was in very big trouble.

It is perhaps murkier in global health (abstracted from the direct political economy of poverty), where on the surface there seems to be greater conflicting pressures (from supposedly ""apolitical"", scientific technocrats). Stay vigilante. --Furthermore, many health crises are symptoms of political economic crises that cannot be resolved by public health officials (ex. here in Vancouver, the opioid crisis is the other official ""public health emergency"", but this is tied to housing, employment, community, etc.)--On the other hand, I've noticed a few anti-imperialists (well-versed in analyzing the violence of foreign policy, which is why I follow them) who would benefit from reading a broader range of topics (i.e. statistics, sciences, technology, etc.). Acknowledgement of my own limitations in various subject matters leaves me baffled by the self-confident leaps of logic that some take, where they start with discrepancies/failures in politics (where, of course, powers will be opportunistic with crises) and conclude with (very) amateur analyses of science/statistics (i.e. ""hoax"", ""just the flu""...or even worse: pseudo-scientific musings on what is ""natural"" vs. ""man-made"" about viruses/immune system responses... Facepalm fallacies covered in Bad Science: Quacks, Hacks, and Big Pharma Flacks). --If you only have hammer, every problem looks like a nail; we all benefit from a more diverse toolkit. //2018 Review of this 1995 book:--750 pages covering 50 years of global disease control adventures… stunning narration by Laurie Garrett. --Global inequity: while the scientific and technological changes to healthcare are visible in wealthy countries, we have at the same time clinics in the Global South that reuse un-sterile injection needles so often that they need to sharpen them on stones, due to the lack of supplies and education. --Even wealthy countries require public funding for population health services and long-term R&D, which human parasites like the Reagan administration are eager to dismantle and privatize (first pillaging social wealth, then slapping on extra fees to extract further profits while sacrificing the dispossessed). While I focused on the social factors, there were plenty of discussion around the biology of disease. Highlights for newly emerging diseases include:1) Environmental disruption: human’s rapid expansion into previously isolated natural habitats opens exposures to new pathogens. A deeper analysis of the political economy/ecology that drives this would really complete the picture (i.e. the global market, urbanization/slums, capitalism seeking new markets and relentlessly commodifying nature, etc.)2) Global transportation drastically accelerating the spread of epidemics.3) Lack of global surveillance infrastructure to deal with these new threats."

We discover new diseases faster than we learn to treat them, and our current methods of treatment tend only to make the diseases stronger and more virulent. The author makes a grand case for a major change of mindset in funding not only medical research and health organizations, but also supporting basic human rights to safe living environments, clean water, and sufficient nutrition.Anyone who has any degree of literacy should read it, especially those in positions of influence. I encourage everyone to buy several copies and send one to each of your representatives: local, state, and federal.This copy will go to some government official, as soon as I figure out where it might do the best good.(BTW, this edition was published in 1994.

The first time I read it, in the late 1990s, it scared me. This time it scared me more. I’m reminded of the line from Hamlet,“There are more things in heaven and earth, Horatio, Than are dreamt of in your philosophy,”which I usually use in reference to the unexplainable. In this case, it’s the unknown dangers that have lurked around humanity for centuries but choose to expose themselves only when humankind encroaches too far, too fast.As I write this, the world is on the brink of a pandemic. Right now it could go the way of the swine flu or Ebola. Or it might be the centennial return of the Spanish flu. I hope not. Reading this book, published in 1995, in 2020, one appreciates Ms. Garrett’s insight and restraint. Neither hysterical nor polemic, it is for the most part not dated. Much of what Garrett wrote has come to pass in some form or another. It’s a thick book, 600+ pages, but there is very little that is superfluous.

I preferred David Quammen's Spillover in terms of capturing my attention. But this wasn't a bad book. Just felt a little stale, which might just be a me-problem. I need a break from virus books.

I'm a microbiology student who has been fascinated with parasitology and infectious disease for a very long time, so this seemed like it was right up my alley. And then I tripped over her facts - or rather, falsehoods. She claims, in the chapter ""Microbe Magnets"" that there were 500,000 deaths from Cholera in NYC in 1832. Wow… that's a horrifying number. Except it isn't true. There were about 250,000 people living in NYC that summer, and 3215 of them succumbed to the disease. I was able to check it from multiple sources in mere moments, with the magic of the internet at my fingertips, and although I know she wouldn't have had that in 1994, it is still an egregious error.

I had had it on my shelves for a long time and finally took it down to read during the current pandemic. And it is all there in these pages: the warnings from 1994 of emerging diseases due to (then in early stages) climate change, misapplied efforts to clear up certain organisms (allowing worse ones to take over in no longer balanced ecosystems), increasing infringement on wild places bringing humans in contact with animals that carry diseases, often harmless to the animals but deadly to humans, inadequately funded health care systems, not just in the developing world but also in countries such as Russia and Romania, leading to multiple use of hospital syringes and hence direct bloodborne infection - for a lot of diseases often far more lethal than ordinary person-to-person transmission - infection of blood banks due to lack of any sterilisation procedures or screening of donors (many of whom were needle-using drug addicts who were paid to donate blood), and overuse of antibiotics in both agricultural and hospital settings allowing mass resistance to the same on the behalf of multiple disease causing organisms including some previously thought to be brought under control such as tuberculosis. All described through chapters which focus on particular diseases such as Lassa, Ebola, HIV and so on. Particularly scary was the information that bacteria and other microbes freely exchange pieces of DNA and also take onboard freefloating fragments in their environment which confer on them such handy attributes as antibiotic-resistence and increased virulence. One of these fragments bestow on the receiving microbe the ability to form a pump which pushes back out of its cell wall anything that might harm it - such as antibiotics or even, in the case of micro-organisms contaminating water supplies, chemicals such as chlorine, rendering them impervious to the effects of such chemicals. Even cancer cells use the same mechanism. And all these things are swapping around DNA to improve their ability to infect and survive any attempt by humans to control them.To summarise: this is a very informative book. The only reason I haven't given it 5 stars is not because it would need to be brought up to date to reflect how the situation has worsened since, but because the author has a tendency to try to tell the 'stories' of some of the doctors or victims of disease and jump back and forth in the timeline so that when they reappear pages later you can't always remember them. There are also a lot of people to remember anyway given the huge numbers of microbiologists, virologists and others involved in the history of these diseases. But a solid and very sobering 4-star read"
24,0140250913,http://goodreads.com/user/show/10505847-mary-soderstrom,4,"Laurie Garrett's book The Coming Plague: Newly Emerging Diseases in a World Out of Balance is nearly 20 years old but it offers very interesting background information about the first round of Ebola in Africa, plus important discussion of how diseases develop and spread. Garrett is now senior fellow for global health at the Council on Foreign Relations and a Pulitzer Prize winning science writer, as well as being an engaging writer. I had read this book several years ago when doing research on some medical matter at a time when AIDS was still little understood by the public. The chapters on Ebola and Marburg diseases were fascinating. While much has changed since, the account gives some idea of how diseases emerged out of nowhere and then receded after less than a year.What is puzzling is that the diseases seemed to burn themselves out. This does not seem to be happening here, possibly because the outbreaks began in more densely populated, better connected parts of Africa than during the 25 previous episodes of the disease. (For an interesting comment see: Ebola: The Tolling Bell.) When people incubating the virus can travel, the risk of them contaminating others is great. In earlier epidemics, Ebola appears to have been confined to relatively isolated villages and once everyone in contracted the disease and either died or survived and became immune, the outbreak was over.This time around, Garrett has some concrete ideas of how to stop the disease now that it's escaped African villages. In her trenchant piece Foreign Policy published Oct. 6, 2014, dhe writes: ""First, a rapid point-of-care diagnostic that can find Ebola virus in a single droplet of blood must be developed. A point-of-care test avoids the need to ship samples to a laboratory and then wait for days to learn the results....I suggest the use of self-administered implements commonly used by diabetics to make a finger prick and squeeze out a droplet of blood. That droplet would go into a tiny plastic well -- an object about an inch in size that is internally coated with either DNA or antibodies that recognize specific genes or proteins found exclusively in the Ebola virus. If those viral markers are present, the device would glow with bioluminescence or change color -- the result would be observable with the naked eye...""Finger-prick tests for Ebola are in development now at Senova, a company in Weimar, Germany; at a small Colorado company called Corgenix; and at California-based Theranos...One of these screening tests should soon meet the criteria of speed, accuracy, and ease of use necessary to prevent travelers' spread of Ebola; facilitate contact tracing; and, in the midst of the epidemic, tell who has the virus and who does not."""

26,0140250913,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1947301-ericka-clouther,4,"There is a lot of amazing information in this huge tome, and it took me three weeks to get through, but it was worth it. It could have used a firmer editing hand though. Both the chronology of infectious diseases and the diseases themselves were divided into chapters in ways I failed to understand. Additionally, given the large amount of extremely useful information provided by this book, it would have moved the book along to edit down every individual thought every patient and every doctor ever had, every description of every little leaf in the jungle the disease emerged. I could basically write an entire book review about any chapter, it's so overwhelming. There was a lot of information about AIDS provided in the second half of the book.Some of the themes of the book are sleuthing the origins of novel pathogen outbreaks, scientific hubris, and illness containment fails.I recently watched an interview with Dr. Ian Crozier, an ebola survivor, and I was amazed at how much I understood that I'd only just learned from the information in this book.I read this for some insight into the novel virus outbreaks like our cures coronavirus outbreak but I definitely gained a great deal more from reading this. And what a great ending!"
27,0140250913,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6359177-james,4,"I'll first say: this book is LONG. Having it on my Kindle meant that I did not really understand how long this book would be. It is definitely a commitment.Overall, it is terrifying. I would become a germophobe and start covering myself in anti-microbial hand sanitizers, but the germs will just evolve around it, become resistance, and kill me anyway. The best portions on this book are following the disease detectives from the CDC and other organizations as they investigated real-world outbreaks in the field. In this respect, the book was similar to Beating Back the Devil: On the Front Lines with the Disease Detectives of the Epidemic Intelligence Service, and to a lesser extent The Hot Zone: A Terrifying True Story, and The Demon in the Freezer. However, I would say this book was more sophisticated and written a higher level (not for mass market readership) than those three. This is not a bad thing, as it was still very readable and not overly technical.Where the book did drag was some sections on disease outbreaks, especially where it go too much in to statistics. Several pages seemed to blur together as it seemed to just be statistic after statistic on multiple drug resistant tuberculosis. Absent the drama of following disease hunters in the field as they searched for the source of Machupo, Lassa, Ebola, Hanta, and other deadly disease outbreaks, this book seemed to drag significantly, making the 700+ page length seem unbearable.This book probably could have improved in this area, and one other, which would have been an updated edition that included more contemporary outbreaks, including the 2001 anthrax attacks, SARS, bird flu, and salmonella."
28,0140250913,http://goodreads.com/user/show/845782-carrie,5,"Wow. This woman is amazing. I would never have thought that I'd spend entire days reading an 800-page book about diseases...but I did, because Laurie Garrett is one of those rare scientists who can write captivating sentences. This book chronicles both the emergence of, and response to, historically important deadly diseases and the role of the CDC, other government agencies, and nasty scientist political maneuvering in the attempts to contain said diseases. I also like this book because it's evidence in favor of my belief that humans will never really ""win"" in our struggle to triumph over nature. Basically, we're too stupid and mostly only capable of extremely short-term thought, and can't change fast enough to keep up with the environmental changes that our stupid, short-term decisions cause. Microbes, on the other hand, evolve rapidly and can (and do) change as needed to ensure their survival. Personally, I find that comforting...but if it freaks you out, this is probably not the book for you."

Everything from anti-immunization efforts, prostitution, non-sterile hospital equipment, re-use of syringes, global warming, refugees, global animal trade, increased UV radiation, pollution... all make the world more hospitable to microbes, and less hospitable to humans. In an age when the most wealthy nation in the world can't agree to give health care to it's own citizens, those living in the developing world are left on their own. And with global travel, disease can and does spread rapidly. The whole species is at risk, and precious little is being done about it.9/12/09"

Garrett has a gift for the didactic in the way she frames complex information with vivid storytelling. There are few subjects more difficult to fathom than the microscopic world of disease, and it would have been easy for this hulking book to become something dry and unreadable, but it never does. At times the book even feels like a real-life Michael Crichton novel. The book is scrupulously researched (it contains nearly 200 pages of endnotes) and a truly staggering accomplishment. Required reading for our own year of the plague, when seemingly everyone has deemed themselves an armchair epidemiologist. While it took me nearly 5 months to read, I learned more from this book than any amount of media coverage of Covid-19."
33,0140250913,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7999979-jessica,4,"interesting, engaging, all too relevant. I studied quite a bit on sociology/anthropology of disaster in college, and it's telling just how far off the topic of disease was from my radar until this pandemic, considering how it follows much of the same general principles (the social construction of ""natural"" disaster, how technology can exacerbate impact, how it compounds with existing vulnerabilities)."
34,0140250913,http://goodreads.com/user/show/12497050-mac,2,"This book had many quite interesting moments, particularly the sections on Toxic Shock Syndrome (TSS), HIV's beginnings in America, and the politics around global pandemics. The discussion of what exactly malaria was was also fascinating - it is a unique and confounding affliction. That said, the narrative was schizophrenic: is it a travel narrative of an international cohort of doctors that solve epidemics, or a piece of public policy writing? A lack of commitment to both leaves goals only superficially explored, and at 600+ pages, its length provides another compelling reason to go with one or the other. The travel narratives and personal histories are also flat and boring, when usually these kind of touches add verve to scientific journalism.Also, many topics are treated multiple times. I understand that I might need to be reminded of something that happened 500 pages ago, but many of the reminders are heavy-handed. Her point does come to a compelling conclusion at the end - we need better infrastructure to prevent disease, particularly after the gutting of the social safety net in the 80s and 90s - but it could have been said in far few pages, with half as many case studies.The argument maybe suffered in my eyes because of how little convincing I needed that we less solve problems than change old ones to new ones - antibiotics just creating new germs, antimalarials creating different types of disease, new plagues shamed the same old way - and so someone else might need this much convincing. It did reinforce my conviction that by former standards of development, America has greatly regressed, with TB infesting our major cities, measles striking our schoolchildren, AIDS endemic to the south.I learned a lot and many of the epigraphs added books to my reading list, but I would not advise suffering through it."
35,0140250913,http://goodreads.com/user/show/948248-corbin-dodge,4,"Both fascinating and frightening, The Coming Plague explores the dark side of human life and death. From the deep Congo where the Ebola virus lurks, to the streets of New York and San Francisco where the AIDS virus made its American debut, this book is sure to keep you on the edge of your seat. I highly praise Garrett for her medical storytelling abilities. She has a way of capturing her readers’ attention and keeping it--something rarely done in medically-descriptive writing. This book can be appreciated from both a physician's and a layman's perspective since she is able to breakdown research initiatives for each disease into a language that is understandable. Each chapter seems to follow the same format: 1) Introduce the first-cases of the disease, location, environment, symptoms, acute illness, and deaths of first-cases 2) Spread of disease, numbers, location, theories on the outbreak and causes3) History of related diseases and current threats4) Initial lab initiatives, successes, failures, funding & funding politics5) Resolution of funding issues, development of research initiatives, initial discoveries, questions from researchers, answers to questions one-by-one6) Developments of treatment (if any), patient testing of treatment (if any)7) Discussion of possible future outbreaks which leads to a ...? In the chapters final paragraph that leads into the next chapter/diseaseIn this way, every disease seems to be explored chronologically, but at the same time she is able to layer the book so that every chapter feeds into the next. This is a fascinating book and I recommend anyone with medical interests in epidemiological phenomena’s pick it up from their local bookstore."
36,0140250913,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2515592-jennifer-beadle,5,"I read this book when it first came out and I was working in a biological chemical factory. This really hit home to me. We were in a way already dealing with some of the issues mentioned in the book. My job title at the time (my tongue-in-cheek title) was mad cow queen. I did research to verify the animal products we used and manufactured were bse-free. You have to wonder what people who don't want universal health care are thinking. With so many people out of work and losing their health insurance, do we really want them getting sick and passing the pandemic on to the rest of us."

38,0140250913,http://goodreads.com/user/show/952703-stacy-chance,5,"The title puts me off a little, because it sounds like it will be a doomsday alarmist proclamation about how we are creating and ignoring new diseases, and that new diseases are somehow ""winning"" the evolutionary ""war"".

41,0140250913,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1234027-liz,3,"Overall, I enjoyed this book, but I think the three-star rating is justified for several reasons. First, I want to focus on what I liked about Garrett's dense and detailed work. Garrett is a dedicated and specialized journalist. Her knowledge of not only the history but also the science in this historical book is impressive. Her chapter regarding the history of AIDS impressed me. I learned more in that one chapter about AIDS than any news article I have stumbled upon. Although the book is outdated (1994), she captures the early history and the socio-political aspects behind the woeful lack of research surrounding the disease. I also enjoyed her work on the ""cowboys"" of disease research. These men and women are all but lost in today's world and Garrett truly emphasizes why their absence is a detriment to public health today. What knocked the book down a few stars was a combination of stylistic choices and tone. It read like magazine journalism, which is one of my least favorite forms. In magazine journalism and features pieces, there is a tendency to assume the voice of the subject. She provides inner-monologue for different subjects as if they are characters and not people. This practice really overshadows her otherwise detailed and meticulous work. It's all well and good if you characterize a bacteria, but you can't say someone thought or said something if you don't have empirical proof. As someone who dabbled in journalism, this severely rubbed me the wrong way.There was also the tone of desperation towards the end regarding to eminent ""plague"". Since 1994, there have been several instances of world-wide disease that the science community successfully attacked. Is it a struggle every time a disease emerges? Yes. Is AIDS still a horrible problem? Yes. Are there practices that need to end? Of course. But is it inevitable that we will all die in some horrible plague? I don't know. I realize it is the title of her book, but I don't think she needed to end on such a paranoid note. If she wants to motivate the public health field, that's great. But I think this book was not meant for those people. It was, like a magazine, targeted towards ""everyone else."" Again, this book came out in 1994. Maybe the tone had a place then, but I don't think it resonates now. What is truly the use in horrifying everyone? We deal with public health challenges every day. And yes, we need to do more but we find ways to overcome. A lot has changed since 1994. I only hope readers in 2012 can recognize that as well.I still recommend this book if you want an interesting, although lengthy, read. I learned a great deal and plan to read more of Garrett's work. But take the tone of desperation with the smallest grain of salt. "
42,0140250913,http://goodreads.com/user/show/17443744-noah,5,"This was an excellent book. It was extremely interesting, had great writing, and did a great job of mixing history, statistics, science, and even dramatic narrative to keep me constantly interested. Because of this, it often did not even feel like I was reading a book about the science and history of disease outbreaks and instead was reading a thriller novel, which shifted between different times, places, and people, but still kept a common thread of the same organizations, the same or similar diseases, and even some people who kept showing up over and over throughout the story. To give a general outline of the book, I would say it almost feels like a really, really long essay. By this, I mean that it is organized into an introduction of the topic and message, the supporting information in between, and then a conclusion where the author tells you what it all means and how things can be fixed. And as far as supporting information goes, she supplies a lot. AIDS, Ebola, Legionnaire’s Disease- she goes through the science, history, and politics involved behind their discovery and the struggle to fight back against them. I feel like this book fell a little short of its intended goal however; while she does a great job with scaring people, showing them what is wrong, and stirring them up to want to change things, she does not explain enough about what can be done. While she devotes hundreds of pages to the disease outbreaks themselves, the conclusion is quite brief and to the point- which, although I usually like books that are very direct like this, I think it could do better with more explanation and examples in this case. Besides this flaw, which I think may just be more of a personal issue anyway, the book was great. Easily one of my favorites. It should be read by everyone, as it offers a glimpse into the current state of global public health that most people are not exposed to. "
43,0140250913,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2915426-tippy-jackson,4,"As you can see from the number of shelves this book is on, this book has everything. Although it's a little outdated, a lot of it is history and her points there are still relevant. In particular, the AIDS stuff is outdated, but her comments on the spread of HIV and the reaction, timing, history and politics of the disease is still relevant and is important for evaluating where we could have improved and will hopefully be applied in the future, should another disease like this emerge. Among my favorite thoughts, I found the use of DDT killing cats (and probably birds of prey) in Bolivia causing an influx of rats and a hemorrhagic fever outbreak to be very interesting, especially since I had recently read Silent Spring, where Rachael Carson gives examples of great studies that have shown pesticides effecting the environment in many similar ways. She also writes about DR bacteria having been selected for in areas where people were getting drugs on the black market and weren't taking them correctly and of course from the feeding of antibiotics to animals we consume. She also shows a direct correlation with the increase of poverty and the emergence of new diseases or outbreaks, with many examples. These are touchy social subjects and yet she strives to remain as scientific as possible.She loses points for the swine flu and legionnaires disease chapter, as it was boring and at times confusing and hard to know which disease she is talking about at a given point. Overall, I really liked this book and I would give it an extra half star if I could.Update: I just upped my review of this book because almost a decade after reading this book, I still find that its lessons are still with me. I reference this book all the time. It's wonderful."

At somewhere around 700 pages (of which each page feels like you're reading 3 typical pages), there are times where you just are almost confounded by the amount of information you're receiving. No doubt, the end result is a masterpiece that should be far more lauded than it currently is.With ""The Coming Plague,"" Laurie Garrett has given us something truly special. She is a master researcher, no doubt, but she enables the reader to make it through this semi-academic read by being a master storyteller as well. I can see why this is pretty commonly linked to Richard Preston's ""The Hot Zone,"" but while Preston uses a touch more flair and writer-devices to drive his story forward, Garrett finds a way to make each story/disease so important that you won't want to put the book down. Her recounting of each epidemic is beyond anything I've ever read before. You have to read it to believe it, but no matter what your take is, you will never look at the microbial world the same again.If you are in any way fascinated with viruses or the impact pandemics can have on society, small or large, there isn't a better read than this.

It’s especially prescient considering this book was written in 1994 and with what’s going on with COVID-19. Lots of details about research about looking at Asia, Africa, North America and South America and the effect of famine, poverty, natural disasters, refugee migration, squalid close living conditions affects disease transmission. Interesting during discussion of 80’s AIDS epidemic in USA how the transmission of disease in gay community, IV drug users and heterosexual prostitution encounters caused conservatives to want to not fund research due to their negative view of lifestyle and disease spread.

First, I want to focus on what I liked about Garrett's dense and detailed work. Garrett is a dedicated and specialized journalist. Her knowledge of not only the history but also the science in this historical book is impressive. Her chapter regarding the history of AIDS impressed me. I learned more in that one chapter about AIDS than any news article I have stumbled upon. Although the book is outdated (1994), she captures the early history and the socio-political aspects behind the woeful lack of research surrounding the disease. I also enjoyed her work on the ""cowboys"" of disease research. These men and women are all but lost in today's world and Garrett truly emphasizes why their absence is a detriment to public health today. What knocked the book down a few stars was a combination of stylistic choices and tone. It read like magazine journalism, which is one of my least favorite forms. In magazine journalism and features pieces, there is a tendency to assume the voice of the subject. She provides inner-monologue for different subjects as if they are characters and not people. This practice really overshadows her otherwise detailed and meticulous work. It's all well and good if you characterize a bacteria, but you can't say someone thought or said something if you don't have empirical proof. As someone who dabbled in journalism, this severely rubbed me the wrong way.There was also the tone of desperation towards the end regarding to eminent ""plague"". Since 1994, there have been several instances of world-wide disease that the science community successfully attacked. Is it a struggle every time a disease emerges? Yes. Is AIDS still a horrible problem? Yes. Are there practices that need to end? Of course. But is it inevitable that we will all die in some horrible plague? I don't know. I realize it is the title of her book, but I don't think she needed to end on such a paranoid note. If she wants to motivate the public health field, that's great. But I think this book was not meant for those people. It was, like a magazine, targeted towards ""everyone else."" Again, this book came out in 1994. Maybe the tone had a place then, but I don't think it resonates now. What is truly the use in horrifying everyone? We deal with public health challenges every day. And yes, we need to do more but we find ways to overcome. A lot has changed since 1994. I only hope readers in 2012 can recognize that as well.I still recommend this book if you want an interesting, although lengthy, read. I learned a great deal and plan to read more of Garrett's work. But take the tone of desperation with the smallest grain of salt. "
72,0140250913,http://goodreads.com/user/show/17443744-noah,5,"This was an excellent book. It was extremely interesting, had great writing, and did a great job of mixing history, statistics, science, and even dramatic narrative to keep me constantly interested. Because of this, it often did not even feel like I was reading a book about the science and history of disease outbreaks and instead was reading a thriller novel, which shifted between different times, places, and people, but still kept a common thread of the same organizations, the same or similar diseases, and even some people who kept showing up over and over throughout the story. To give a general outline of the book, I would say it almost feels like a really, really long essay. By this, I mean that it is organized into an introduction of the topic and message, the supporting information in between, and then a conclusion where the author tells you what it all means and how things can be fixed. And as far as supporting information goes, she supplies a lot. AIDS, Ebola, Legionnaire’s Disease- she goes through the science, history, and politics involved behind their discovery and the struggle to fight back against them. I feel like this book fell a little short of its intended goal however; while she does a great job with scaring people, showing them what is wrong, and stirring them up to want to change things, she does not explain enough about what can be done. While she devotes hundreds of pages to the disease outbreaks themselves, the conclusion is quite brief and to the point- which, although I usually like books that are very direct like this, I think it could do better with more explanation and examples in this case. Besides this flaw, which I think may just be more of a personal issue anyway, the book was great. Easily one of my favorites. It should be read by everyone, as it offers a glimpse into the current state of global public health that most people are not exposed to. "
73,0140250913,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2915426-tippy-jackson,4,"As you can see from the number of shelves this book is on, this book has everything. Although it's a little outdated, a lot of it is history and her points there are still relevant. In particular, the AIDS stuff is outdated, but her comments on the spread of HIV and the reaction, timing, history and politics of the disease is still relevant and is important for evaluating where we could have improved and will hopefully be applied in the future, should another disease like this emerge. Among my favorite thoughts, I found the use of DDT killing cats (and probably birds of prey) in Bolivia causing an influx of rats and a hemorrhagic fever outbreak to be very interesting, especially since I had recently read Silent Spring, where Rachael Carson gives examples of great studies that have shown pesticides effecting the environment in many similar ways. She also writes about DR bacteria having been selected for in areas where people were getting drugs on the black market and weren't taking them correctly and of course from the feeding of antibiotics to animals we consume. She also shows a direct correlation with the increase of poverty and the emergence of new diseases or outbreaks, with many examples. These are touchy social subjects and yet she strives to remain as scientific as possible.She loses points for the swine flu and legionnaires disease chapter, as it was boring and at times confusing and hard to know which disease she is talking about at a given point. Overall, I really liked this book and I would give it an extra half star if I could.Update: I just upped my review of this book because almost a decade after reading this book, I still find that its lessons are still with me. I reference this book all the time. It's wonderful."

At somewhere around 700 pages (of which each page feels like you're reading 3 typical pages), there are times where you just are almost confounded by the amount of information you're receiving. No doubt, the end result is a masterpiece that should be far more lauded than it currently is.With ""The Coming Plague,"" Laurie Garrett has given us something truly special. She is a master researcher, no doubt, but she enables the reader to make it through this semi-academic read by being a master storyteller as well. I can see why this is pretty commonly linked to Richard Preston's ""The Hot Zone,"" but while Preston uses a touch more flair and writer-devices to drive his story forward, Garrett finds a way to make each story/disease so important that you won't want to put the book down. Her recounting of each epidemic is beyond anything I've ever read before. You have to read it to believe it, but no matter what your take is, you will never look at the microbial world the same again.If you are in any way fascinated with viruses or the impact pandemics can have on society, small or large, there isn't a better read than this. Just know that there is someone out there who is jealous of you getting to read it for the first time."

The book discusses among other diseases AIDS, Ebola, malaria, TB and the steps taken to identify the pathogen, causes, vulnerable population, where it started, how it spread and how to treat. It’s especially prescient considering this book was written in 1994 and with what’s going on with COVID-19. Lots of details about research about looking at Asia, Africa, North America and South America and the effect of famine, poverty, natural disasters, refugee migration, squalid close living conditions affects disease transmission. Interesting during discussion of 80’s AIDS epidemic in USA how the transmission of disease in gay community, IV drug users and heterosexual prostitution encounters caused conservatives to want to not fund research due to their negative view of lifestyle and disease spread. This book has lots of information more than I can mention in a review.

There is no overview in this book. There is no high-level view. There is no summary. But it also isn't really the kind of book that goes out of date. Its more a history book than a science or medical book. And it takes a tour of all the big named diseases. Sure it's getting old. It predates the existence of an international internet.

102,0140250913,http://goodreads.com/user/show/17443744-noah,5,"This was an excellent book. It was extremely interesting, had great writing, and did a great job of mixing history, statistics, science, and even dramatic narrative to keep me constantly interested. Because of this, it often did not even feel like I was reading a book about the science and history of disease outbreaks and instead was reading a thriller novel, which shifted between different times, places, and people, but still kept a common thread of the same organizations, the same or similar diseases, and even some people who kept showing up over and over throughout the story. To give a general outline of the book, I would say it almost feels like a really, really long essay. By this, I mean that it is organized into an introduction of the topic and message, the supporting information in between, and then a conclusion where the author tells you what it all means and how things can be fixed. And as far as supporting information goes, she supplies a lot. AIDS, Ebola, Legionnaire’s Disease- she goes through the science, history, and politics involved behind their discovery and the struggle to fight back against them. I feel like this book fell a little short of its intended goal however; while she does a great job with scaring people, showing them what is wrong, and stirring them up to want to change things, she does not explain enough about what can be done. While she devotes hundreds of pages to the disease outbreaks themselves, the conclusion is quite brief and to the point- which, although I usually like books that are very direct like this, I think it could do better with more explanation and examples in this case. Besides this flaw, which I think may just be more of a personal issue anyway, the book was great. Easily one of my favorites. It should be read by everyone, as it offers a glimpse into the current state of global public health that most people are not exposed to. "

Among my favorite thoughts, I found the use of DDT killing cats (and probably birds of prey) in Bolivia causing an influx of rats and a hemorrhagic fever outbreak to be very interesting, especially since I had recently read Silent Spring, where Rachael Carson gives examples of great studies that have shown pesticides effecting the environment in many similar ways. She also writes about DR bacteria having been selected for in areas where people were getting drugs on the black market and weren't taking them correctly and of course from the feeding of antibiotics to animals we consume. She also shows a direct correlation with the increase of poverty and the emergence of new diseases or outbreaks, with many examples. These are touchy social subjects and yet she strives to remain as scientific as possible.She loses points for the swine flu and legionnaires disease chapter, as it was boring and at times confusing and hard to know which disease she is talking about at a given point.

The book discusses among other diseases AIDS, Ebola, malaria, TB and the steps taken to identify the pathogen, causes, vulnerable population, where it started, how it spread and how to treat. It’s especially prescient considering this book was written in 1994 and with what’s going on with COVID-19. Lots of details about research about looking at Asia, Africa, North America and South America and the effect of famine, poverty, natural disasters, refugee migration, squalid close living conditions affects disease transmission. Interesting during discussion of 80’s AIDS epidemic in USA how the transmission of disease in gay community, IV drug users and heterosexual prostitution encounters caused conservatives to want to not fund research due to their negative view of lifestyle and disease spread. This book has lots of information more than I can mention in a review.

There is no overview in this book. There is no high-level view. There is no summary. But it also isn't really the kind of book that goes out of date. Its more a history book than a science or medical book. And it takes a tour of all the big named diseases. Sure it's getting old. It predates the existence of an international internet. And some things are sure to have gotten better, though it seems like an awful lot did not. Still worth reading. And I'll be curious to compare it to newer books."

122,0140250913,http://goodreads.com/user/show/17020880-conner,5,"I picked up this book after I saw the author interviewed on ""Democracy Now"" on the eve of the Covid-19 pandemic, and nearly everything she predicted came to pass.With The Coming Plague Garrett has accomplished the seemingly impossible task of writing a popular history of epidemiology while sacrificing none of the complexity. Garrett has a gift for the didactic in the way she frames complex information with vivid storytelling. There are few subjects more difficult to fathom than the microscopic world of disease, and it would have been easy for this hulking book to become something dry and unreadable, but it never does. At times the book even feels like a real-life Michael Crichton novel. The book is scrupulously researched (it contains nearly 200 pages of endnotes) and a truly staggering accomplishment. Required reading for our own year of the plague, when seemingly everyone has deemed themselves an armchair epidemiologist. While it took me nearly 5 months to read, I learned more from this book than any amount of media coverage of Covid-19."
123,0140250913,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7999979-jessica,4,"interesting, engaging, all too relevant. I studied quite a bit on sociology/anthropology of disaster in college, and it's telling just how far off the topic of disease was from my radar until this pandemic, considering how it follows much of the same general principles (the social construction of ""natural"" disaster, how technology can exacerbate impact, how it compounds with existing vulnerabilities)."
124,0140250913,http://goodreads.com/user/show/12497050-mac,2,"This book had many quite interesting moments, particularly the sections on Toxic Shock Syndrome (TSS), HIV's beginnings in America, and the politics around global pandemics. The discussion of what exactly malaria was was also fascinating - it is a unique and confounding affliction. That said, the narrative was schizophrenic: is it a travel narrative of an international cohort of doctors that solve epidemics, or a piece of public policy writing? A lack of commitment to both leaves goals only superficially explored, and at 600+ pages, its length provides another compelling reason to go with one or the other. The travel narratives and personal histories are also flat and boring, when usually these kind of touches add verve to scientific journalism.Also, many topics are treated multiple times. I understand that I might need to be reminded of something that happened 500 pages ago, but many of the reminders are heavy-handed. Her point does come to a compelling conclusion at the end - we need better infrastructure to prevent disease, particularly after the gutting of the social safety net in the 80s and 90s - but it could have been said in far few pages, with half as many case studies.The argument maybe suffered in my eyes because of how little convincing I needed that we less solve problems than change old ones to new ones - antibiotics just creating new germs, antimalarials creating different types of disease, new plagues shamed the same old way - and so someone else might need this much convincing. It did reinforce my conviction that by former standards of development, America has greatly regressed, with TB infesting our major cities, measles striking our schoolchildren, AIDS endemic to the south.I learned a lot and many of the epigraphs added books to my reading list, but I would not advise suffering through it."
125,0140250913,http://goodreads.com/user/show/948248-corbin-dodge,4,"Both fascinating and frightening, The Coming Plague explores the dark side of human life and death. From the deep Congo where the Ebola virus lurks, to the streets of New York and San Francisco where the AIDS virus made its American debut, this book is sure to keep you on the edge of your seat. I highly praise Garrett for her medical storytelling abilities. She has a way of capturing her readers’ attention and keeping it--something rarely done in medically-descriptive writing. This book can be appreciated from both a physician's and a layman's perspective since she is able to breakdown research initiatives for each disease into a language that is understandable. Each chapter seems to follow the same format: 1) Introduce the first-cases of the disease, location, environment, symptoms, acute illness, and deaths of first-cases 2) Spread of disease, numbers, location, theories on the outbreak and causes3) History of related diseases and current threats4) Initial lab initiatives, successes, failures, funding & funding politics5) Resolution of funding issues, development of research initiatives, initial discoveries, questions from researchers, answers to questions one-by-one6) Developments of treatment (if any), patient testing of treatment (if any)7) Discussion of possible future outbreaks which leads to a ...? In the chapters final paragraph that leads into the next chapter/diseaseIn this way, every disease seems to be explored chronologically, but at the same time she is able to layer the book so that every chapter feeds into the next. This is a fascinating book and I recommend anyone with medical interests in epidemiological phenomena’s pick it up from their local bookstore."

We were in a way already dealing with some of the issues mentioned in the book. My job title at the time (my tongue-in-cheek title) was mad cow queen. I did research to verify the animal products we used and manufactured were bse-free. You have to wonder what people who don't want universal health care are thinking. With so many people out of work and losing their health insurance, do we really want them getting sick and passing the pandemic on to the rest of us."

131,0140250913,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1234027-liz,3,"Overall, I enjoyed this book, but I think the three-star rating is justified for several reasons. First, I want to focus on what I liked about Garrett's dense and detailed work. Garrett is a dedicated and specialized journalist. Her knowledge of not only the history but also the science in this historical book is impressive. Her chapter regarding the history of AIDS impressed me. I learned more in that one chapter about AIDS than any news article I have stumbled upon. Although the book is outdated (1994), she captures the early history and the socio-political aspects behind the woeful lack of research surrounding the disease. I also enjoyed her work on the ""cowboys"" of disease research. These men and women are all but lost in today's world and Garrett truly emphasizes why their absence is a detriment to public health today. What knocked the book down a few stars was a combination of stylistic choices and tone. It read like magazine journalism, which is one of my least favorite forms. In magazine journalism and features pieces, there is a tendency to assume the voice of the subject. She provides inner-monologue for different subjects as if they are characters and not people. This practice really overshadows her otherwise detailed and meticulous work. It's all well and good if you characterize a bacteria, but you can't say someone thought or said something if you don't have empirical proof. As someone who dabbled in journalism, this severely rubbed me the wrong way.There was also the tone of desperation towards the end regarding to eminent ""plague"". Since 1994, there have been several instances of world-wide disease that the science community successfully attacked. Is it a struggle every time a disease emerges? Yes. Is AIDS still a horrible problem? Yes. Are there practices that need to end? Of course. But is it inevitable that we will all die in some horrible plague? I don't know. I realize it is the title of her book, but I don't think she needed to end on such a paranoid note. If she wants to motivate the public health field, that's great. But I think this book was not meant for those people. It was, like a magazine, targeted towards ""everyone else."" Again, this book came out in 1994. Maybe the tone had a place then, but I don't think it resonates now. What is truly the use in horrifying everyone? We deal with public health challenges every day. And yes, we need to do more but we find ways to overcome. A lot has changed since 1994. I only hope readers in 2012 can recognize that as well.I still recommend this book if you want an interesting, although lengthy, read. I learned a great deal and plan to read more of Garrett's work. But take the tone of desperation with the smallest grain of salt. "

We were in a way already dealing with some of the issues mentioned in the book. My job title at the time (my tongue-in-cheek title) was mad cow queen. I did research to verify the animal products we used and manufactured were bse-free. You have to wonder what people who don't want universal health care are thinking.

160,0140250913,http://goodreads.com/user/show/21192580-kel-midthnaetitulla,1,Way too politically opinionated. It was hard to really focus on the facts due to her constant beat-downs on political figures whom I just don't care about. 
161,0140250913,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1234027-liz,3,"Overall, I enjoyed this book, but I think the three-star rating is justified for several reasons. First, I want to focus on what I liked about Garrett's dense and detailed work. Garrett is a dedicated and specialized journalist. Her knowledge of not only the history but also the science in this historical book is impressive. Her chapter regarding the history of AIDS impressed me. I learned more in that one chapter about AIDS than any news article I have stumbled upon. Although the book is outdated (1994), she captures the early history and the socio-political aspects behind the woeful lack of research surrounding the disease. I also enjoyed her work on the ""cowboys"" of disease research. These men and women are all but lost in today's world and Garrett truly emphasizes why their absence is a detriment to public health today. What knocked the book down a few stars was a combination of stylistic choices and tone. It read like magazine journalism, which is one of my least favorite forms. In magazine journalism and features pieces, there is a tendency to assume the voice of the subject. She provides inner-monologue for different subjects as if they are characters and not people. This practice really overshadows her otherwise detailed and meticulous work. It's all well and good if you characterize a bacteria, but you can't say someone thought or said something if you don't have empirical proof. As someone who dabbled in journalism, this severely rubbed me the wrong way.There was also the tone of desperation towards the end regarding to eminent ""plague"". Since 1994, there have been several instances of world-wide disease that the science community successfully attacked. Is it a struggle every time a disease emerges? Yes. Is AIDS still a horrible problem? Yes. Are there practices that need to end? Of course. But is it inevitable that we will all die in some horrible plague? I don't know. I realize it is the title of her book, but I don't think she needed to end on such a paranoid note. If she wants to motivate the public health field, that's great. But I think this book was not meant for those people. It was, like a magazine, targeted towards ""everyone else."" Again, this book came out in 1994. Maybe the tone had a place then, but I don't think it resonates now. What is truly the use in horrifying everyone? We deal with public health challenges every day. And yes, we need to do more but we find ways to overcome. A lot has changed since 1994. I only hope readers in 2012 can recognize that as well.I still recommend this book if you want an interesting, although lengthy, read. I learned a great deal and plan to read more of Garrett's work. But take the tone of desperation with the smallest grain of salt. "
162,0140250913,http://goodreads.com/user/show/17443744-noah,5,"This was an excellent book. It was extremely interesting, had great writing, and did a great job of mixing history, statistics, science, and even dramatic narrative to keep me constantly interested. Because of this, it often did not even feel like I was reading a book about the science and history of disease outbreaks and instead was reading a thriller novel, which shifted between different times, places, and people, but still kept a common thread of the same organizations, the same or similar diseases, and even some people who kept showing up over and over throughout the story. To give a general outline of the book, I would say it almost feels like a really, really long essay. By this, I mean that it is organized into an introduction of the topic and message, the supporting information in between, and then a conclusion where the author tells you what it all means and how things can be fixed. And as far as supporting information goes, she supplies a lot. AIDS, Ebola, Legionnaire’s Disease- she goes through the science, history, and politics involved behind their discovery and the struggle to fight back against them. I feel like this book fell a little short of its intended goal however; while she does a great job with scaring people, showing them what is wrong, and stirring them up to want to change things, she does not explain enough about what can be done. While she devotes hundreds of pages to the disease outbreaks themselves, the conclusion is quite brief and to the point- which, although I usually like books that are very direct like this, I think it could do better with more explanation and examples in this case. Besides this flaw, which I think may just be more of a personal issue anyway, the book was great. Easily one of my favorites. It should be read by everyone, as it offers a glimpse into the current state of global public health that most people are not exposed to. "
163,0140250913,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2915426-tippy-jackson,4,"As you can see from the number of shelves this book is on, this book has everything. Although it's a little outdated, a lot of it is history and her points there are still relevant. In particular, the AIDS stuff is outdated, but her comments on the spread of HIV and the reaction, timing, history and politics of the disease is still relevant and is important for evaluating where we could have improved and will hopefully be applied in the future, should another disease like this emerge. Among my favorite thoughts, I found the use of DDT killing cats (and probably birds of prey) in Bolivia causing an influx of rats and a hemorrhagic fever outbreak to be very interesting, especially since I had recently read Silent Spring, where Rachael Carson gives examples of great studies that have shown pesticides effecting the environment in many similar ways. She also writes about DR bacteria having been selected for in areas where people were getting drugs on the black market and weren't taking them correctly and of course from the feeding of antibiotics to animals we consume. She also shows a direct correlation with the increase of poverty and the emergence of new diseases or outbreaks, with many examples. These are touchy social subjects and yet she strives to remain as scientific as possible.She loses points for the swine flu and legionnaires disease chapter, as it was boring and at times confusing and hard to know which disease she is talking about at a given point. Overall, I really liked this book and I would give it an extra half star if I could.Update: I just upped my review of this book because almost a decade after reading this book, I still find that its lessons are still with me. I reference this book all the time. It's wonderful."

At somewhere around 700 pages (of which each page feels like you're reading 3 typical pages), there are times where you just are almost confounded by the amount of information you're receiving. No doubt, the end result is a masterpiece that should be far more lauded than it currently is.With ""The Coming Plague,"" Laurie Garrett has given us something truly special. She is a master researcher, no doubt, but she enables the reader to make it through this semi-academic read by being a master storyteller as well. I can see why this is pretty commonly linked to Richard Preston's ""The Hot Zone,"" but while Preston uses a touch more flair and writer-devices to drive his story forward, Garrett finds a way to make each story/disease so important that you won't want to put the book down. Her recounting of each epidemic is beyond anything I've ever read before. You have to read it to believe it, but no matter what your take is, you will never look at the microbial world the same again.If you are in any way fascinated with viruses or the impact pandemics can have on society, small or large, there isn't a better read than this. Just know that there is someone out there who is jealous of you getting to read it for the first time."

The chapters on HIV/AIDS, especially, should be required reading - it annoys me so much that ""And The Band Played On"" is hailed as the authoritative book on the emergence of HIV/AIDS, when the chapters in this book are more thorough and more factual (especially about poor Gaetan Dugas).

First, I want to focus on what I liked about Garrett's dense and detailed work. Garrett is a dedicated and specialized journalist. Her knowledge of not only the history but also the science in this historical book is impressive. Her chapter regarding the history of AIDS impressed me. I learned more in that one chapter about AIDS than any news article I have stumbled upon. Although the book is outdated (1994), she captures the early history and the socio-political aspects behind the woeful lack of research surrounding the disease. I also enjoyed her work on the ""cowboys"" of disease research. These men and women are all but lost in today's world and Garrett truly emphasizes why their absence is a detriment to public health today. What knocked the book down a few stars was a combination of stylistic choices and tone. It read like magazine journalism, which is one of my least favorite forms. In magazine journalism and features pieces, there is a tendency to assume the voice of the subject. She provides inner-monologue for different subjects as if they are characters and not people. This practice really overshadows her otherwise detailed and meticulous work. It's all well and good if you characterize a bacteria, but you can't say someone thought or said something if you don't have empirical proof. As someone who dabbled in journalism, this severely rubbed me the wrong way.There was also the tone of desperation towards the end regarding to eminent ""plague"". Since 1994, there have been several instances of world-wide disease that the science community successfully attacked. Is it a struggle every time a disease emerges? Yes. Is AIDS still a horrible problem? Yes. Are there practices that need to end? Of course. But is it inevitable that we will all die in some horrible plague? I don't know. I realize it is the title of her book, but I don't think she needed to end on such a paranoid note. If she wants to motivate the public health field, that's great. But I think this book was not meant for those people. It was, like a magazine, targeted towards ""everyone else."" Again, this book came out in 1994. Maybe the tone had a place then, but I don't think it resonates now. What is truly the use in horrifying everyone? We deal with public health challenges every day. And yes, we need to do more but we find ways to overcome. A lot has changed since 1994. I only hope readers in 2012 can recognize that as well.I still recommend this book if you want an interesting, although lengthy, read. I learned a great deal and plan to read more of Garrett's work.

192,0140250913,http://goodreads.com/user/show/17443744-noah,5,"This was an excellent book. It was extremely interesting, had great writing, and did a great job of mixing history, statistics, science, and even dramatic narrative to keep me constantly interested. Because of this, it often did not even feel like I was reading a book about the science and history of disease outbreaks and instead was reading a thriller novel, which shifted between different times, places, and people, but still kept a common thread of the same organizations, the same or similar diseases, and even some people who kept showing up over and over throughout the story. To give a general outline of the book, I would say it almost feels like a really, really long essay. By this, I mean that it is organized into an introduction of the topic and message, the supporting information in between, and then a conclusion where the author tells you what it all means and how things can be fixed. And as far as supporting information goes, she supplies a lot. AIDS, Ebola, Legionnaire’s Disease- she goes through the science, history, and politics involved behind their discovery and the struggle to fight back against them. I feel like this book fell a little short of its intended goal however; while she does a great job with scaring people, showing them what is wrong, and stirring them up to want to change things, she does not explain enough about what can be done. While she devotes hundreds of pages to the disease outbreaks themselves, the conclusion is quite brief and to the point- which, although I usually like books that are very direct like this, I think it could do better with more explanation and examples in this case. Besides this flaw, which I think may just be more of a personal issue anyway, the book was great. Easily one of my favorites. It should be read by everyone, as it offers a glimpse into the current state of global public health that most people are not exposed to. "

Among my favorite thoughts, I found the use of DDT killing cats (and probably birds of prey) in Bolivia causing an influx of rats and a hemorrhagic fever outbreak to be very interesting, especially since I had recently read Silent Spring, where Rachael Carson gives examples of great studies that have shown pesticides effecting the environment in many similar ways. She also writes about DR bacteria having been selected for in areas where people were getting drugs on the black market and weren't taking them correctly and of course from the feeding of antibiotics to animals we consume. She also shows a direct correlation with the increase of poverty and the emergence of new diseases or outbreaks, with many examples.

At somewhere around 700 pages (of which each page feels like you're reading 3 typical pages), there are times where you just are almost confounded by the amount of information you're receiving. No doubt, the end result is a masterpiece that should be far more lauded than it currently is.With ""The Coming Plague,"" Laurie Garrett has given us something truly special. She is a master researcher, no doubt, but she enables the reader to make it through this semi-academic read by being a master storyteller as well. I can see why this is pretty commonly linked to Richard Preston's ""The Hot Zone,"" but while Preston uses a touch more flair and writer-devices to drive his story forward, Garrett finds a way to make each story/disease so important that you won't want to put the book down. Her recounting of each epidemic is beyond anything I've ever read before. You have to read it to believe it, but no matter what your take is, you will never look at the microbial world the same again.If you are in any way fascinated with viruses or the impact pandemics can have on society, small or large, there isn't a better read than this.

Provides immense insight into the interaction between politics, disease and human nature - and casts a disturbing light on how our politics and human nature might lead to disease winning its war against humanity, in the end. The chapters on HIV/AIDS, especially, should be required reading - it annoys me so much that ""And The Band Played On"" is hailed as the authoritative book on the emergence of HIV/AIDS, when the chapters in this book are more thorough and more factual (especially about poor Gaetan Dugas).

The book discusses among other diseases AIDS, Ebola, malaria, TB and the steps taken to identify the pathogen, causes, vulnerable population, where it started, how it spread and how to treat. It’s especially prescient considering this book was written in 1994 and with what’s going on with COVID-19. Lots of details about research about looking at Asia, Africa, North America and South America and the effect of famine, poverty, natural disasters, refugee migration, squalid close living conditions affects disease transmission. Interesting during discussion of 80’s AIDS epidemic in USA how the transmission of disease in gay community, IV drug users and heterosexual prostitution encounters caused conservatives to want to not fund research due to their negative view of lifestyle and disease spread. This book has lots of information more than I can mention in a review. I think we need to respect science and the healthcare workers who do tireless research to understand about these infectious disease processes."

There is no overview in this book. There is no high-level view. There is no summary. But it also isn't really the kind of book that goes out of date. Its more a history book than a science or medical book. And it takes a tour of all the big named diseases. Sure it's getting old. It predates the existence of an international internet. And some things are sure to have gotten better, though it seems like an awful lot did not. Still worth reading. And I'll be curious to compare it to newer books."

212,0140250913,http://goodreads.com/user/show/17020880-conner,5,"I picked up this book after I saw the author interviewed on ""Democracy Now"" on the eve of the Covid-19 pandemic, and nearly everything she predicted came to pass.With The Coming Plague Garrett has accomplished the seemingly impossible task of writing a popular history of epidemiology while sacrificing none of the complexity. Garrett has a gift for the didactic in the way she frames complex information with vivid storytelling. There are few subjects more difficult to fathom than the microscopic world of disease, and it would have been easy for this hulking book to become something dry and unreadable, but it never does. At times the book even feels like a real-life Michael Crichton novel. The book is scrupulously researched (it contains nearly 200 pages of endnotes) and a truly staggering accomplishment. Required reading for our own year of the plague, when seemingly everyone has deemed themselves an armchair epidemiologist. While it took me nearly 5 months to read, I learned more from this book than any amount of media coverage of Covid-19."
213,0140250913,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7999979-jessica,4,"interesting, engaging, all too relevant. I studied quite a bit on sociology/anthropology of disaster in college, and it's telling just how far off the topic of disease was from my radar until this pandemic, considering how it follows much of the same general principles (the social construction of ""natural"" disaster, how technology can exacerbate impact, how it compounds with existing vulnerabilities)."
214,0140250913,http://goodreads.com/user/show/12497050-mac,2,"This book had many quite interesting moments, particularly the sections on Toxic Shock Syndrome (TSS), HIV's beginnings in America, and the politics around global pandemics. The discussion of what exactly malaria was was also fascinating - it is a unique and confounding affliction. That said, the narrative was schizophrenic: is it a travel narrative of an international cohort of doctors that solve epidemics, or a piece of public policy writing? A lack of commitment to both leaves goals only superficially explored, and at 600+ pages, its length provides another compelling reason to go with one or the other. The travel narratives and personal histories are also flat and boring, when usually these kind of touches add verve to scientific journalism.Also, many topics are treated multiple times. I understand that I might need to be reminded of something that happened 500 pages ago, but many of the reminders are heavy-handed. Her point does come to a compelling conclusion at the end - we need better infrastructure to prevent disease, particularly after the gutting of the social safety net in the 80s and 90s - but it could have been said in far few pages, with half as many case studies.The argument maybe suffered in my eyes because of how little convincing I needed that we less solve problems than change old ones to new ones - antibiotics just creating new germs, antimalarials creating different types of disease, new plagues shamed the same old way - and so someone else might need this much convincing. It did reinforce my conviction that by former standards of development, America has greatly regressed, with TB infesting our major cities, measles striking our schoolchildren, AIDS endemic to the south.I learned a lot and many of the epigraphs added books to my reading list, but I would not advise suffering through it."

From the deep Congo where the Ebola virus lurks, to the streets of New York and San Francisco where the AIDS virus made its American debut, this book is sure to keep you on the edge of your seat. I highly praise Garrett for her medical storytelling abilities. She has a way of capturing her readers’ attention and keeping it--something rarely done in medically-descriptive writing. This book can be appreciated from both a physician's and a layman's perspective since she is able to breakdown research initiatives for each disease into a language that is understandable. Each chapter seems to follow the same format: 1) Introduce the first-cases of the disease, location, environment, symptoms, acute illness, and deaths of first-cases 2) Spread of disease, numbers, location, theories on the outbreak and causes3) History of related diseases and current threats4) Initial lab initiatives, successes, failures, funding & funding politics5) Resolution of funding issues, development of research initiatives, initial discoveries, questions from researchers, answers to questions one-by-one6) Developments of treatment (if any), patient testing of treatment (if any)7) Discussion of possible future outbreaks which leads to a ...?

242,0140250913,http://goodreads.com/user/show/17020880-conner,5,"I picked up this book after I saw the author interviewed on ""Democracy Now"" on the eve of the Covid-19 pandemic, and nearly everything she predicted came to pass.With The Coming Plague Garrett has accomplished the seemingly impossible task of writing a popular history of epidemiology while sacrificing none of the complexity. Garrett has a gift for the didactic in the way she frames complex information with vivid storytelling. There are few subjects more difficult to fathom than the microscopic world of disease, and it would have been easy for this hulking book to become something dry and unreadable, but it never does. At times the book even feels like a real-life Michael Crichton novel. The book is scrupulously researched (it contains nearly 200 pages of endnotes) and a truly staggering accomplishment. Required reading for our own year of the plague, when seemingly everyone has deemed themselves an armchair epidemiologist. While it took me nearly 5 months to read, I learned more from this book than any amount of media coverage of Covid-19."
243,0140250913,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7999979-jessica,4,"interesting, engaging, all too relevant. I studied quite a bit on sociology/anthropology of disaster in college, and it's telling just how far off the topic of disease was from my radar until this pandemic, considering how it follows much of the same general principles (the social construction of ""natural"" disaster, how technology can exacerbate impact, how it compounds with existing vulnerabilities)."
244,0140250913,http://goodreads.com/user/show/12497050-mac,2,"This book had many quite interesting moments, particularly the sections on Toxic Shock Syndrome (TSS), HIV's beginnings in America, and the politics around global pandemics. The discussion of what exactly malaria was was also fascinating - it is a unique and confounding affliction. That said, the narrative was schizophrenic: is it a travel narrative of an international cohort of doctors that solve epidemics, or a piece of public policy writing? A lack of commitment to both leaves goals only superficially explored, and at 600+ pages, its length provides another compelling reason to go with one or the other. The travel narratives and personal histories are also flat and boring, when usually these kind of touches add verve to scientific journalism.Also, many topics are treated multiple times. I understand that I might need to be reminded of something that happened 500 pages ago, but many of the reminders are heavy-handed. Her point does come to a compelling conclusion at the end - we need better infrastructure to prevent disease, particularly after the gutting of the social safety net in the 80s and 90s - but it could have been said in far few pages, with half as many case studies.The argument maybe suffered in my eyes because of how little convincing I needed that we less solve problems than change old ones to new ones - antibiotics just creating new germs, antimalarials creating different types of disease, new plagues shamed the same old way - and so someone else might need this much convincing. It did reinforce my conviction that by former standards of development, America has greatly regressed, with TB infesting our major cities, measles striking our schoolchildren, AIDS endemic to the south.I learned a lot and many of the epigraphs added books to my reading list, but I would not advise suffering through it."
245,0140250913,http://goodreads.com/user/show/948248-corbin-dodge,4,"Both fascinating and frightening, The Coming Plague explores the dark side of human life and death. From the deep Congo where the Ebola virus lurks, to the streets of New York and San Francisco where the AIDS virus made its American debut, this book is sure to keep you on the edge of your seat. I highly praise Garrett for her medical storytelling abilities. She has a way of capturing her readers’ attention and keeping it--something rarely done in medically-descriptive writing. This book can be appreciated from both a physician's and a layman's perspective since she is able to breakdown research initiatives for each disease into a language that is understandable. Each chapter seems to follow the same format: 1) Introduce the first-cases of the disease, location, environment, symptoms, acute illness, and deaths of first-cases 2) Spread of disease, numbers, location, theories on the outbreak and causes3) History of related diseases and current threats4) Initial lab initiatives, successes, failures, funding & funding politics5) Resolution of funding issues, development of research initiatives, initial discoveries, questions from researchers, answers to questions one-by-one6) Developments of treatment (if any), patient testing of treatment (if any)7) Discussion of possible future outbreaks which leads to a ...? In the chapters final paragraph that leads into the next chapter/diseaseIn this way, every disease seems to be explored chronologically, but at the same time she is able to layer the book so that every chapter feeds into the next. This is a fascinating book and I recommend anyone with medical interests in epidemiological phenomena’s pick it up from their local bookstore."

We were in a way already dealing with some of the issues mentioned in the book. My job title at the time (my tongue-in-cheek title) was mad cow queen. I did research to verify the animal products we used and manufactured were bse-free. You have to wonder what people who don't want universal health care are thinking.

251,0140250913,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1234027-liz,3,"Overall, I enjoyed this book, but I think the three-star rating is justified for several reasons. First, I want to focus on what I liked about Garrett's dense and detailed work. Garrett is a dedicated and specialized journalist. Her knowledge of not only the history but also the science in this historical book is impressive. Her chapter regarding the history of AIDS impressed me. I learned more in that one chapter about AIDS than any news article I have stumbled upon. Although the book is outdated (1994), she captures the early history and the socio-political aspects behind the woeful lack of research surrounding the disease. I also enjoyed her work on the ""cowboys"" of disease research. These men and women are all but lost in today's world and Garrett truly emphasizes why their absence is a detriment to public health today. What knocked the book down a few stars was a combination of stylistic choices and tone. It read like magazine journalism, which is one of my least favorite forms. In magazine journalism and features pieces, there is a tendency to assume the voice of the subject. She provides inner-monologue for different subjects as if they are characters and not people. This practice really overshadows her otherwise detailed and meticulous work. It's all well and good if you characterize a bacteria, but you can't say someone thought or said something if you don't have empirical proof. As someone who dabbled in journalism, this severely rubbed me the wrong way.There was also the tone of desperation towards the end regarding to eminent ""plague"". Since 1994, there have been several instances of world-wide disease that the science community successfully attacked. Is it a struggle every time a disease emerges? Yes. Is AIDS still a horrible problem? Yes. Are there practices that need to end? Of course. But is it inevitable that we will all die in some horrible plague? I don't know. I realize it is the title of her book, but I don't think she needed to end on such a paranoid note. If she wants to motivate the public health field, that's great. But I think this book was not meant for those people. It was, like a magazine, targeted towards ""everyone else."" Again, this book came out in 1994. Maybe the tone had a place then, but I don't think it resonates now. What is truly the use in horrifying everyone? We deal with public health challenges every day. And yes, we need to do more but we find ways to overcome. A lot has changed since 1994. I only hope readers in 2012 can recognize that as well.I still recommend this book if you want an interesting, although lengthy, read. I learned a great deal and plan to read more of Garrett's work. But take the tone of desperation with the smallest grain of salt. "
252,0140250913,http://goodreads.com/user/show/17443744-noah,5,"This was an excellent book. It was extremely interesting, had great writing, and did a great job of mixing history, statistics, science, and even dramatic narrative to keep me constantly interested. Because of this, it often did not even feel like I was reading a book about the science and history of disease outbreaks and instead was reading a thriller novel, which shifted between different times, places, and people, but still kept a common thread of the same organizations, the same or similar diseases, and even some people who kept showing up over and over throughout the story. To give a general outline of the book, I would say it almost feels like a really, really long essay. By this, I mean that it is organized into an introduction of the topic and message, the supporting information in between, and then a conclusion where the author tells you what it all means and how things can be fixed. And as far as supporting information goes, she supplies a lot. AIDS, Ebola, Legionnaire’s Disease- she goes through the science, history, and politics involved behind their discovery and the struggle to fight back against them. I feel like this book fell a little short of its intended goal however; while she does a great job with scaring people, showing them what is wrong, and stirring them up to want to change things, she does not explain enough about what can be done. While she devotes hundreds of pages to the disease outbreaks themselves, the conclusion is quite brief and to the point- which, although I usually like books that are very direct like this, I think it could do better with more explanation and examples in this case. Besides this flaw, which I think may just be more of a personal issue anyway, the book was great. Easily one of my favorites. It should be read by everyone, as it offers a glimpse into the current state of global public health that most people are not exposed to. "
253,0140250913,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2915426-tippy-jackson,4,"As you can see from the number of shelves this book is on, this book has everything. Although it's a little outdated, a lot of it is history and her points there are still relevant. In particular, the AIDS stuff is outdated, but her comments on the spread of HIV and the reaction, timing, history and politics of the disease is still relevant and is important for evaluating where we could have improved and will hopefully be applied in the future, should another disease like this emerge. Among my favorite thoughts, I found the use of DDT killing cats (and probably birds of prey) in Bolivia causing an influx of rats and a hemorrhagic fever outbreak to be very interesting, especially since I had recently read Silent Spring, where Rachael Carson gives examples of great studies that have shown pesticides effecting the environment in many similar ways. She also writes about DR bacteria having been selected for in areas where people were getting drugs on the black market and weren't taking them correctly and of course from the feeding of antibiotics to animals we consume. She also shows a direct correlation with the increase of poverty and the emergence of new diseases or outbreaks, with many examples. These are touchy social subjects and yet she strives to remain as scientific as possible.She loses points for the swine flu and legionnaires disease chapter, as it was boring and at times confusing and hard to know which disease she is talking about at a given point. Overall, I really liked this book and I would give it an extra half star if I could.Update: I just upped my review of this book because almost a decade after reading this book, I still find that its lessons are still with me. I reference this book all the time. It's wonderful."

272,0140250913,http://goodreads.com/user/show/17020880-conner,5,"I picked up this book after I saw the author interviewed on ""Democracy Now"" on the eve of the Covid-19 pandemic, and nearly everything she predicted came to pass.With The Coming Plague Garrett has accomplished the seemingly impossible task of writing a popular history of epidemiology while sacrificing none of the complexity. Garrett has a gift for the didactic in the way she frames complex information with vivid storytelling. There are few subjects more difficult to fathom than the microscopic world of disease, and it would have been easy for this hulking book to become something dry and unreadable, but it never does. At times the book even feels like a real-life Michael Crichton novel. The book is scrupulously researched (it contains nearly 200 pages of endnotes) and a truly staggering accomplishment. Required reading for our own year of the plague, when seemingly everyone has deemed themselves an armchair epidemiologist. While it took me nearly 5 months to read, I learned more from this book than any amount of media coverage of Covid-19."
273,0140250913,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7999979-jessica,4,"interesting, engaging, all too relevant. I studied quite a bit on sociology/anthropology of disaster in college, and it's telling just how far off the topic of disease was from my radar until this pandemic, considering how it follows much of the same general principles (the social construction of ""natural"" disaster, how technology can exacerbate impact, how it compounds with existing vulnerabilities)."
274,0140250913,http://goodreads.com/user/show/12497050-mac,2,"This book had many quite interesting moments, particularly the sections on Toxic Shock Syndrome (TSS), HIV's beginnings in America, and the politics around global pandemics. The discussion of what exactly malaria was was also fascinating - it is a unique and confounding affliction. That said, the narrative was schizophrenic: is it a travel narrative of an international cohort of doctors that solve epidemics, or a piece of public policy writing? A lack of commitment to both leaves goals only superficially explored, and at 600+ pages, its length provides another compelling reason to go with one or the other. The travel narratives and personal histories are also flat and boring, when usually these kind of touches add verve to scientific journalism.Also, many topics are treated multiple times. I understand that I might need to be reminded of something that happened 500 pages ago, but many of the reminders are heavy-handed. Her point does come to a compelling conclusion at the end - we need better infrastructure to prevent disease, particularly after the gutting of the social safety net in the 80s and 90s - but it could have been said in far few pages, with half as many case studies.The argument maybe suffered in my eyes because of how little convincing I needed that we less solve problems than change old ones to new ones - antibiotics just creating new germs, antimalarials creating different types of disease, new plagues shamed the same old way - and so someone else might need this much convincing. It did reinforce my conviction that by former standards of development, America has greatly regressed, with TB infesting our major cities, measles striking our schoolchildren, AIDS endemic to the south.I learned a lot and many of the epigraphs added books to my reading list, but I would not advise suffering through it."
275,0140250913,http://goodreads.com/user/show/948248-corbin-dodge,4,"Both fascinating and frightening, The Coming Plague explores the dark side of human life and death. From the deep Congo where the Ebola virus lurks, to the streets of New York and San Francisco where the AIDS virus made its American debut, this book is sure to keep you on the edge of your seat. I highly praise Garrett for her medical storytelling abilities. She has a way of capturing her readers’ attention and keeping it--something rarely done in medically-descriptive writing. This book can be appreciated from both a physician's and a layman's perspective since she is able to breakdown research initiatives for each disease into a language that is understandable. Each chapter seems to follow the same format: 1) Introduce the first-cases of the disease, location, environment, symptoms, acute illness, and deaths of first-cases 2) Spread of disease, numbers, location, theories on the outbreak and causes3) History of related diseases and current threats4) Initial lab initiatives, successes, failures, funding & funding politics5) Resolution of funding issues, development of research initiatives, initial discoveries, questions from researchers, answers to questions one-by-one6) Developments of treatment (if any), patient testing of treatment (if any)7) Discussion of possible future outbreaks which leads to a ...? In the chapters final paragraph that leads into the next chapter/diseaseIn this way, every disease seems to be explored chronologically, but at the same time she is able to layer the book so that every chapter feeds into the next. This is a fascinating book and I recommend anyone with medical interests in epidemiological phenomena’s pick it up from their local bookstore."
276,0140250913,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2515592-jennifer-beadle,5,"I read this book when it first came out and I was working in a biological chemical factory. This really hit home to me. We were in a way already dealing with some of the issues mentioned in the book. My job title at the time (my tongue-in-cheek title) was mad cow queen. I did research to verify the animal products we used and manufactured were bse-free. You have to wonder what people who don't want universal health care are thinking. With so many people out of work and losing their health insurance, do we really want them getting sick and passing the pandemic on to the rest of us."
277,0140250913,http://goodreads.com/user/show/950049-amber,5,"This book truly is amazing and one of the most eye-opening books I have ever read. It explores every aspect of post Word War II diseases and their effects on humanity from a political, economical, and behavioral standpoint. While this is not a fast or easy read (I had a hard time getting through the last few chapters) it is well worth your time. Exploding with information. Fascinating. "
278,0140250913,http://goodreads.com/user/show/952703-stacy-chance,5,"The title puts me off a little, because it sounds like it will be a doomsday alarmist proclamation about how we are creating and ignoring new diseases, and that new diseases are somehow ""winning"" the evolutionary ""war"". But in essence, it is a thorough look at how and why ""new"" diseases emerge and the fight that goes on against new and old diseases every day. "

280,0140250913,http://goodreads.com/user/show/21192580-kel-midthnaetitulla,1,Way too politically opinionated. It was hard to really focus on the facts due to her constant beat-downs on political figures whom I just don't care about. 
281,0140250913,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1234027-liz,3,"Overall, I enjoyed this book, but I think the three-star rating is justified for several reasons. First, I want to focus on what I liked about Garrett's dense and detailed work. Garrett is a dedicated and specialized journalist. Her knowledge of not only the history but also the science in this historical book is impressive. Her chapter regarding the history of AIDS impressed me. I learned more in that one chapter about AIDS than any news article I have stumbled upon. Although the book is outdated (1994), she captures the early history and the socio-political aspects behind the woeful lack of research surrounding the disease. I also enjoyed her work on the ""cowboys"" of disease research. These men and women are all but lost in today's world and Garrett truly emphasizes why their absence is a detriment to public health today. What knocked the book down a few stars was a combination of stylistic choices and tone. It read like magazine journalism, which is one of my least favorite forms. In magazine journalism and features pieces, there is a tendency to assume the voice of the subject. She provides inner-monologue for different subjects as if they are characters and not people. This practice really overshadows her otherwise detailed and meticulous work. It's all well and good if you characterize a bacteria, but you can't say someone thought or said something if you don't have empirical proof. As someone who dabbled in journalism, this severely rubbed me the wrong way.There was also the tone of desperation towards the end regarding to eminent ""plague"". Since 1994, there have been several instances of world-wide disease that the science community successfully attacked. Is it a struggle every time a disease emerges? Yes. Is AIDS still a horrible problem? Yes. Are there practices that need to end? Of course. But is it inevitable that we will all die in some horrible plague? I don't know. I realize it is the title of her book, but I don't think she needed to end on such a paranoid note. If she wants to motivate the public health field, that's great. But I think this book was not meant for those people. It was, like a magazine, targeted towards ""everyone else."" Again, this book came out in 1994. Maybe the tone had a place then, but I don't think it resonates now. What is truly the use in horrifying everyone? We deal with public health challenges every day. And yes, we need to do more but we find ways to overcome. A lot has changed since 1994. I only hope readers in 2012 can recognize that as well.I still recommend this book if you want an interesting, although lengthy, read. I learned a great deal and plan to read more of Garrett's work. But take the tone of desperation with the smallest grain of salt. "
282,0140250913,http://goodreads.com/user/show/17443744-noah,5,"This was an excellent book. It was extremely interesting, had great writing, and did a great job of mixing history, statistics, science, and even dramatic narrative to keep me constantly interested. Because of this, it often did not even feel like I was reading a book about the science and history of disease outbreaks and instead was reading a thriller novel, which shifted between different times, places, and people, but still kept a common thread of the same organizations, the same or similar diseases, and even some people who kept showing up over and over throughout the story. To give a general outline of the book, I would say it almost feels like a really, really long essay. By this, I mean that it is organized into an introduction of the topic and message, the supporting information in between, and then a conclusion where the author tells you what it all means and how things can be fixed. And as far as supporting information goes, she supplies a lot. AIDS, Ebola, Legionnaire’s Disease- she goes through the science, history, and politics involved behind their discovery and the struggle to fight back against them. I feel like this book fell a little short of its intended goal however; while she does a great job with scaring people, showing them what is wrong, and stirring them up to want to change things, she does not explain enough about what can be done. While she devotes hundreds of pages to the disease outbreaks themselves, the conclusion is quite brief and to the point- which, although I usually like books that are very direct like this, I think it could do better with more explanation and examples in this case. Besides this flaw, which I think may just be more of a personal issue anyway, the book was great. Easily one of my favorites. It should be read by everyone, as it offers a glimpse into the current state of global public health that most people are not exposed to. "
283,0140250913,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2915426-tippy-jackson,4,"As you can see from the number of shelves this book is on, this book has everything. Although it's a little outdated, a lot of it is history and her points there are still relevant. In particular, the AIDS stuff is outdated, but her comments on the spread of HIV and the reaction, timing, history and politics of the disease is still relevant and is important for evaluating where we could have improved and will hopefully be applied in the future, should another disease like this emerge. Among my favorite thoughts, I found the use of DDT killing cats (and probably birds of prey) in Bolivia causing an influx of rats and a hemorrhagic fever outbreak to be very interesting, especially since I had recently read Silent Spring, where Rachael Carson gives examples of great studies that have shown pesticides effecting the environment in many similar ways. She also writes about DR bacteria having been selected for in areas where people were getting drugs on the black market and weren't taking them correctly and of course from the feeding of antibiotics to animals we consume. She also shows a direct correlation with the increase of poverty and the emergence of new diseases or outbreaks, with many examples. These are touchy social subjects and yet she strives to remain as scientific as possible.She loses points for the swine flu and legionnaires disease chapter, as it was boring and at times confusing and hard to know which disease she is talking about at a given point. Overall, I really liked this book and I would give it an extra half star if I could.Update: I just upped my review of this book because almost a decade after reading this book, I still find that its lessons are still with me. I reference this book all the time. It's wonderful."

285,0140250913,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2084139-bryce-holt,5,"The most impressive non-fiction read I've experienced in years. Make no mistakes, though...it's a bear. At somewhere around 700 pages (of which each page feels like you're reading 3 typical pages), there are times where you just are almost confounded by the amount of information you're receiving. No doubt, the end result is a masterpiece that should be far more lauded than it currently is.With ""The Coming Plague,"" Laurie Garrett has given us something truly special. She is a master researcher, no doubt, but she enables the reader to make it through this semi-academic read by being a master storyteller as well. I can see why this is pretty commonly linked to Richard Preston's ""The Hot Zone,"" but while Preston uses a touch more flair and writer-devices to drive his story forward, Garrett finds a way to make each story/disease so important that you won't want to put the book down. Her recounting of each epidemic is beyond anything I've ever read before. You have to read it to believe it, but no matter what your take is, you will never look at the microbial world the same again.If you are in any way fascinated with viruses or the impact pandemics can have on society, small or large, there isn't a better read than this. Just know that there is someone out there who is jealous of you getting to read it for the first time."
286,0140250913,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2890979-danielle,5,"The best and most important book written on disease ever. Criminally underrated. Provides immense insight into the interaction between politics, disease and human nature - and casts a disturbing light on how our politics and human nature might lead to disease winning its war against humanity, in the end. The chapters on HIV/AIDS, especially, should be required reading - it annoys me so much that ""And The Band Played On"" is hailed as the authoritative book on the emergence of HIV/AIDS, when the chapters in this book are more thorough and more factual (especially about poor Gaetan Dugas). If you liked ""The Hot Zone"", this will blow your socks off. Very lengthy, but worth it. "

Regarding Ebola and Marburg, after reading The Hot Zone, this book completes the information of how it started, without dwelling too much on the gruesome aspect of the disease."

But it is fascinating, hearing the tales of early scientific research into outbreaks, especially how many researchers studying infectious diseases and come down with symptoms device that maybe they’re just getting a cold. It’s very detailed but very interesting. It definitely makes you want to wash your hands more thoroughly and make sure all your vaccinations are up to date. "

The book discusses among other diseases AIDS, Ebola, malaria, TB and the steps taken to identify the pathogen, causes, vulnerable population, where it started, how it spread and how to treat. It’s especially prescient considering this book was written in 1994 and with what’s going on with COVID-19. Lots of details about research about looking at Asia, Africa, North America and South America and the effect of famine, poverty, natural disasters, refugee migration, squalid close living conditions affects disease transmission. Interesting during discussion of 80’s AIDS epidemic in USA how the transmission of disease in gay community, IV drug users and heterosexual prostitution encounters caused conservatives to want to not fund research due to their negative view of lifestyle and disease spread. This book has lots of information more than I can mention in a review.
