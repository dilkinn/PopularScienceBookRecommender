0,0525949690,http://goodreads.com/user/show/289556-jackie-the-librarian,3,"A book is the wrong medium for this information. As I read this book, I kept wishing I was watching a PBS show version of it instead, where I could HEAR the music Mr. Levitin was referencing, and see visuals of the brain showing what parts are being affected by music, and how they all link up. Instead of having to tell us in excruciating detail what an octave is, he could demonstrate on an instrument, and we could hear it for ourselves. When discussing half steps and whole steps, we could both hear them, and see how a piano's white and black keys work with the structure of the scale. Beyond all that, I'm a little disappointed in the focus of the book. Mr. Levitin says at one point that he is more interested in the mind, than in the brain. And yet, instead of telling us how all these brain interactions manifest in our minds, he focuses on details about the cerebellum and the amygdala. We learn what parts of the brain act together when listening to music, but not much what that MEANS to us mentally. I guess I wanted more psychology, less biology.That doesn't make the subject any less fascinating. I think my favorite chapter was the one on what makes a musician. It's not just innate talent. No, it takes hours and hours and hours of practice, 10,000 in fact to master an instrument (this may sound familiar to those of you who read Malcolm Gladwell's book Outliers). It may also take helpful physiology, like long fingers to reach keys on a piano easily. But humans are INNATELY musical, and how our brains and bodies react to music is astonishing.Other interesting things I learned:- humans have always made music, and that it likely predates language- music can comfort and inspire us, and has the power to change our mood through the chemistry in our brains- music activates both the oldest and newest parts of the brain- we all have expertise in music, because we all listen to it- the importance of timbre, the quality of sound that distinguishes a note played on a guitar from the same note played on a trumpet, and the quality that lets us recognize each other's voicesAnd I liked this quote: ""Music communicates to us emotionally through systematic violations of expectations.""And I kept thinking of this other quote: ""Writing about music is like dancing about architecture,"" (no, I can't tell you who said that, maybe Elvis Costello, maybe Laurie Anderson, maybe Steve Martin...)"
1,0525949690,http://goodreads.com/user/show/387514-matthew,3,"There's a lot of amazing stuff in this book to contemplate, but the author tries too hard to make it relevant for readers who listen to the Eagles and Mariah Carey (musicians he specifically sites), and he gets caught up in the most mundane details of his personal interactions with his colleagues at meetings and dinners and such, and who ordered what, and how everybody was dressed, and where everybody got their degrees.My girlfriend got me interested in it because I found her passionate explanations of the salient neuroscience very interesting, but that information could be contained in a book about a quarter of the length of this one. Read it, because you don't have Stacey to give you the short version, and you'll love learning about how deeply and profoundly music affects human and animal brains, but do yourself a favor and skip a few paragraphs every time Levitin starts to ramble on with his personal anecdotes which usually pertain only very tangentially to the science at hand."
2,0525949690,http://goodreads.com/user/show/402496-sam,3,Seemingly for musicians or composers this book is more fitting a read for scientists and doctors. Not much content is musicianship related. Middle third is a bore. What I learned:- There is no sound in space(there are no molecules to vibrate)- Virtuosity comes from hours of practice (talent and absolute pitch play a small role)- Learning to play an instrument after 20 is hard (the brain is done developing)- Percussion is a primitive musical trait (affirming my suspician drummers are apes)- People like music they can understand (an area between too elementary and too difficult)- Children who learn to play instruments have increased cognitive understanding and focus - Music and performance play a role in evolution (used to attract a mate)- Music is a stimulant and natural high (it opens neural pathways that trigger throughout the brain from the cerebral cortext to the frontal lobes)- Different handicaps react differently to music(Down syndrome do not like music. Williams does) I'll stop now. This list is already too long.
3,0525949690,http://goodreads.com/user/show/636104-patricia,3,"It wasn't until I was half-way through this book that things started to get really interesting. As a musician, the first half was like retaking Music 101, but I felt this was a book I need to read, so I plowed on. I am looking for answers to the questions: ""Why, when I near any musical interval, my brain automatically zips through all the tunes I know which start with that interval, and I start humming one of them?"" and ""Why the hell have I had '76 Trombones' on my mind for the last 6 weeks?"" Is this what happens when musicians age? I feel like I'm nearing the answers, and its getting quite interesting. (I'm still reading the book). I finally finished the book and solved the mystery of ""76 Trombones"": it just so happened my cousin who lives on the East coast was playing trumpet in a production of ""The Music Man"" that telepathic experience had nothing to do with the book. As for the intervals reminding me of tunes, that has something to do with the Exemplar theory which has to do with how musical prototypes are stored in and recalled from memory. Pretty interesting stuff, but I came away with the feeling that there is still not much scientific consensus about how the brain processes music. The book contained a lot of ambiguous ""Probablys"", and ""somehows"" and apart from a few interesting and compelling studies, I was ready to move on to something else. "
4,0525949690,http://goodreads.com/user/show/874706-mike-bularz,4,"From the reviews I've seen here, the material seems to have passed over most people's heads (by being too rough, or the phrase you'll come across a few times, ""I didn't feel like I walked away exclaiming 'eureka!'""... or the book angered more expert readers by its simplicity, but it wasn't meant to talk of new discoveries as much as it was meant for a general public. The book takes a while for an average person, and I'd say you have to have some knowledge of chorded instruments and such where you'd come across ideas such as frequencies ringing together to form major and minor chords. It covers various interesting topics, and I speculate the reason people walk away feeling not so enlightened is because after chapter 8+, chapters 1-5 are a distant memory. If you have trouble, jot down a few things, it helped me.There is one chapter that the author wastes time talking about a dinner with his idol neuro-scientists from which you will take not much away except for a list of forgettable names and how the next chapter's ideas were spurred by one of the professors' advice: ""Look at the connections [something along those lines at least]"".Overall, Im glad I read this book, and often check back to it as a reference, and it's great food for thought."
5,0525949690,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4086118-michael,4,"“A” for effort and ambition and “C” for execution. He tries to be all things to all people, bouncing too much from folksy to scholarly and from self-referential to didactic perspectives. Levitin has a substantial music background, both in performance and production, and a very productive track record in cognitive neuroscience. Thus, his personal ambition to account for the neural basis of music, music listening pleasure, and musical creativity is compelling to him, and that motivation is infectious enough to justify a reader eagerly grabbing the book up based on its title and blurb. Enquiring minds want to know. After hungrily penetrating 50 pages of so of the book, many readers are likely to feel duped. Progress on the target areas is accelerating, but it’s not that enlightening to the average reader. Yet, as Browning wrote, “A man’s reach should exceed his grasp, else what’s a heaven for.” As a musical ignoramus, I appreciated the Music 101—I think I can finally grasp what a “key” and a “major chord” are. And I was enlightened by his perspectives on how expectation and violation of chord progressions has a lot to do with enjoyment of music. As a former neuroscientist, I appreciated the review of progress in the field. As one would expect, music engages both primitive emotional circuits and higher analytic systems involved in memory, temporal information processing and prediction. The overlap with language systems is interesting, and speculation on cerebellar involvement beyond motor performance was fascinating. That people with Wilson’s syndrome are good at music and empathy while those with Autism Spectrum Disorders are not provides some important food for thought. But the brain stuff I don’t believe helps anyone appreciate why music is so special to our human culture or is so pleasurable.For this, he goes out of his field to summarize arguments against the notion that music is sort of an accident of evolution of cognitive skills with clear adaptive value. He quotes Pinker: “Music is auditory cheesecake…It just happens to tickle several important parts of the brain in a highly pleasurable way, as cheesecake tickles the palate.” In Gould’s architectural analogy, music is like “spandrels”, those elegant spaces between arches which were not invented for their own sake. Levitin assembles evidence for music prevalence in all current and past human cultures, its importance for social cohesion and courtship, and lands on the evolutionary psychology perspective that its adaptive value relates to sexual selection (i.e. musical skills conveyed reproductive advantages through mate selection). For the discussion on heritability of music skills, I felt he was fairly even handed, leaving open that even Mozart’s genius may have benefited mostly from practice and environment in the nature/nuture perspective. Musical skill fits in with the larger ongoing question of genetic contributions to artistic creativity. A nice emphasis in this book is Levitin’s consideration of how even the average person qualifies as an expert and skilled listener and how our current division between performers and listeners represents a violation of the ancient traditions of all members of society participating in both. "
6,0525949690,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2547702-gretchen-rubin,0,"So many people have recommended this book to me over the years, and finally I read it. Absolutely fascinating—and I'm not even a huge fan of music. Now I'm reading everything by Daniel Levitin."
7,0525949690,http://goodreads.com/user/show/148416-pamela-w,2,"I really despise myself for giving what should be an awesome book only 2 stars. I know I am mentally feeble, but was this ever dry!!! Interesting topic - neuroscience & music - but the author did go on at times (too much music theory, god I hated studying that and I'm a musician) and took the scientific aspects to a degree where I often found myself stopping to ponder ""what the hell is he talking about?"" It read like it could be someone's dissertation. The second half is slightly more interesting. I'm sure Oliver Sacks book re: dysfunctional psychological reactions/processing of music is going to be a more fun and interesting read, and let's face it, I am reading for fun, this is not a textbook for my evening class at The School of Rock. When I get to invite 4 people from history to a dinner party, I'll not invite Daniel Levitin; all the other guests will try to avoid him all night as he does go on and on (much like this review)."
8,0525949690,http://goodreads.com/user/show/52500467-whatireallyread,4,"Two random facts about me:1) I love music2) I love cognitive and neuroscienceSo I was thrilled about this book. And it was indeed pretty good. My main takeaway from it is that our enjoyment of music stems from the setting up and violation of expectations and human's innate instinct to seek out patterns in whatever stimuli that comes our way.I recommend the audiobook version because it provides musical examples of what the author is talking about, so I believe it's much more convenient to comprehend that the written version. It took a while to finish because every time I started listening to the book about music I got a massive urge to listen to some. So I had to scratch that itch, and that kept me distracted from reading Brain on Music in big chunks.It took a lot of set-up and some of the things described in this book I already knew, so they weren't as exciting, hence the 4 stars."
9,0525949690,http://goodreads.com/user/show/11251688-laura,4,"Fascinating study of both music and the brain. It isn't a particularly quick read because there are so many facts, studies and trivia related to each point the author is exploring. "
10,0525949690,http://goodreads.com/user/show/579935-ken,3,"This is one of those books that I think is a valuable read but not necessarily an enjoyable one..at least for the general reader. If you bring a background in neuroscience then this is a treasure chest of information. My personal interest lies in music specifically and I saw this as an opportunity to better understand how our brains engage with music. Coupled with Oliver Sacks collection ""The Man Who Mistook His Wife for a Hat"" we begin to unlock the mysterious properties of music to help us communicate/learn even when burdened with serious psychological disorders. Fascinating stuff. Levitin frequently lightens a very technical discussion with references to pop/jazz music but overall his analysis is complex and difficult to present in an easily readable format. It seems evident to me after reading both books that there is still much to be learned about the human brain, but music has a unique power to shape cultures and our minds in a way that other art forms cannot. Many of Levithans chapters are worth reading by themselves. For example, I found his writing on ""What Makes a Musician"" and why we are drawn to certain types of music (and remember certain songs) especially interesting. "
11,0525949690,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5647191-orsolya,5,"We tend to make music for as much granted as we do breathing. Music is EVERYWHERE. The same way that you encounter hundreds of advertisements in a day: you also encounter music in various forms.This is Your Brain on Music (yes, based on the popular egg-drug PSA, explores how music is processed within your brain and why we react the way we do. This journey within the musical brain begins with a brief description of music in terms of notes, patterns, tempo, etc. One can skip this section if already familiar or simply not interested. It won't hinder your understanding of the subsequent chapters. Levitin then dives into explaining such noteworthy topics as why we get songs stuck in our heads, why certain songs are equated with memories throughout our lives, and how our brain tends to know the next couple notes in a song even if we've never heard it before. All of these topics are augmented with thorough research and scientific explanations; yet, in a lamen's terms.You don't have to be a musician to be interested in this read, you merely have to an inquiring person. If nothing else, you will learn facts which will impress your friends and perhaps win you that spot on your favorite trivia game show. One thing is for certain: you will never look at music the same way again. "
12,0525949690,http://goodreads.com/user/show/10824531-marco,5,"Loved it! The book was highly enjoyable for me and I'm not a professional musician (or a neuroscientist), but I've always been aware of what music can do to me, from meditation to headbanging and beyond. I've read some people got disappointed of finding 'too much music theory' or 'too much neuroscience'; well honestly I don't think the book has to much of either of them, it's not written for neuroscientists or for professional musicians (even when I think both groups could enjoy it), and lets face it, you picked up a book about music and brains, what did you expect? Maybe some people wanted a book with 'fun facts' but guys, if you are willing to understand the surface of this things you MUST know the basics of both subjects, and that's precisely what Daniel Levitin presents here. Otherwise I invite you to pick up a copy of Reader's Digest and indulge yourself with some factoids.Due to space and traveling problems I don't keep a lot of books with me, but this one will stay in my library for sure."
13,0525949690,http://goodreads.com/user/show/297848-mattie,4,"Really cool book on the the brain's relationship with and to music. Although written for a general audience, Levitan doesn't significantly dumb down or shy away from the neuroscience at the very heart of the book. At the same time, Levitan let's a very wry, witty sense of humor season his writing. Finally, he's got both the musical and scientific chops to understand the subject matter from both sides. This means there's enough science and detail to impart some pretty technical information, but its presented in a way that you don't have to be a brain surgeon to understand. What is particularly nice is that he also addresses the emotional quality of music, not just the mathematical/structural, in its relation to the brain. Fascinating stuff."
14,0525949690,http://goodreads.com/user/show/666428-j,5,"Have you ever wondered how you can listen to an orchestra and pick out the melody, or pick out the violins from the whole ensemble, or pick out the first violin from the violin section, or separate the orchestra from the car alarm outside? If you ever wondered about music and why it is so appealing to us, you'll find this book interesting. Beginning with the basics of how musicians and scientists define music, it moves on to discuss how our brain and mind have evolved to understand music, the impact that music has on all aspects of our nervous system, and the role music has played in unlocking the secrets of the brain. It gave me a new found appreciation for the human mind and its inner workings, especially with regard to something I've always taken for granted."
15,0525949690,http://goodreads.com/user/show/223837-nicky,3,"Despite loving singing, and having been good enough to perform and not have people run away, I know very little about music. Not that Levitin would be a snob about that, from the sound of this book, but it still forms a bit of a barrier to understanding when someone starts talking about semitones. I can sing C on demand, and I know when something is out of tune — what more do you want? (Although unlike most people, I have a bad sense of timing, apparently: I routinely sing slower than the original version of anything I’m performing. Most people apparently preserve the timing of the version they know best. Trivia!)So anyway, the music side of this passed me by, mostly, despite the primer in the opening chapters. But the neuroscience behind music is fascinating, and Levitin explains it well. There are a few sections which drag as he spends too long explaining things, but on the other hand he references a wide selection of music, applying what he’s talking about to songs people often know. (Which again led me to wishing I knew more music, but this time popular music — I think I got one out of every five references? And my acquaintance with Bowie is pretty darn recent.)I feel like the best people to appreciate this have a bit more music theory and a bit less neuroscience in their background, but nonetheless, I found it an intriguing read.Originally posted here."
16,0525949690,http://goodreads.com/user/show/316746-bill,3,"Someone left this behind in the cubby of the plane seat on a flight I took in December. As I'd finished my magazines, I picked it up, and then couldn't put it down. What was most fascinating about the book was the ease at which concepts I'd struggled with years ago were made crisp, clear, and, well, obvious, as they should have been back then. Introductory concepts of music were never made as clear to me than from this. I don't think I could have found a fuller survey of the subject, tying it to subjects I'm interested in (math, cognition) if I'd looked, and there it was, for free.Surely an expert or someone who'd learned more of music or neuroscience would find it basic, but I'd recommend it for a good catchup on the subject and how our understanding of it is changing."
17,0525949690,http://goodreads.com/user/show/897874-bruce,2,"In Daniel Levitin's own words, ""This book is about the science of music, from the perspective of cognitive neuroscience…. I'll discuss some of the latest studies I and other researchers in our field have conducted on music, musical meaning, and musical pleasure…. [H]ow can we account for wide differences in musical preference -- why is it that one man's Mozart is another man's Madonna?"" (p. 11) After reading these 270 pages, I'm sure I can't tell you. I'm pretty disappointed, but then I had really high expectations for this book which it failed to meet (I should know by now never to read the back-cover hype, let alone the 4 pages of promotional blurbs that preceded the table of contents).But before confessing my own failings here, let me lay a little blame at the author's feet. Right off the bat, he states, ""It's a shame that many people are intimidated by the jargon musicians, music theorists, and cognitive scientists throw around. There is specialized vocabulary in every field of inquiry (try to make sense of a full blood-analysis report from your doctor). But in the case of music, music experts and scientists could do a better job of making their work accessible. That is something I tried to accomplish in this book."" (p. 10) Levitin also talks about harboring a preference for identifying how the brain interprets moving air molecules as music and the behavioral/emotional significance/origins of this auditory processing over simply mapping where in the brain music triggers neurons.To that, I say, ha, ha, and double-ha. We take you live to a typical passage (p. 191), which begins as follows: ""We found exactly what we had hoped. Listening to music caused a cascade of brain regions to become activated in a particular order: first, auditory cortex for initial processing of the components of the sound. Then the frontal regions, such as BA44 and BA47, that we had previously identified as being involved in processing musical structure and expectations. Finally, a network of regions -- the mesolimbic system -- involved in arousal, pleasure, and the transmission of opiods and the production fo dopamine, culminating in activation in the nucleus accumbens. And the cerebellum and basal ganglia were active throughout, presumably supporting the processing of rhythm and meter.""If you got that, this book is for you (but not me, alas). Levitin devotes the first 1/5 of this book to defining musical terms (tuning, timbre, scale) he will not really use later. It's interesting, but cognitively irrelevant. There is some fun anecdotal stuff buried in here (did you know that if you chop off the 'attack' of a piano from a recording and just play the body of the pitch, it sounds indistinguishable from a flute? did you know that music appreciation and sociability are closely correlated?), but the questions posed in the introduction are never answered. Is music a by-product of speech, etc. or a seminal human intuition? Ummm… not sure. How and when are music preferences established? Ummm… mostly from exposure during one's teens, but possibly also from that in the womb, early childhood, and later in life. Why? Don't know. Repetition, perhaps?I give this book 2 stars for the extensive annotated bibliography at the end and (ironically, considering the author's stated subject matter preferences) the trivially-interesting pictographic brain mappings of music function in the appendix. What a bummer."
18,0525949690,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5870882-sunny,4,"I have to admit that this took me a while to read because it got a bit too technical for me in the middle but the beginning and the ending were very very good. The book is about, as it says on the tin, the effect of music on the brain. The book gets quite scientific in places and reminded me of Doidge’s the brain that changes itself, which is a total must read. The book also looks at certain songs that have stood the test of time and explains why the human ear enamours itself to them and not to others. Daniel gives many examples of songs from the past and present ranging from jazz, or classic to hip hop to heavy metal and he highlights specific reasons why they are as classy as they are. Near the end the book talks about the psychology of music and why it is pertinent to us as humans and why we should listen to music because of the beneficial effects it can have on the physiology of our brains. It’s pretty much certain that excellence in music will lead to excellence in many other fields in life. There were a few really interesting things that came out of the book:•	Sounds are so important to us and help us understand reality but sometimes we just get it wrong. Hands up how many of you did the alphabet when you were young and genuinely thought there was a letter after “k” called “ellemenno”? Ok maybe you didn’t but I bet you are reciting the alphabet in your mind now around that letter :)•	Here is how a piano actually works if you ever wondered: keys to the left of a keyboard hit longer thicker strings while keys to the right hit thinner shorter strings. The vibrations of the strings causes them to nudge air molecules which vibrate at the same rate. These vibrating molecules reach our ears which cause our ear drums to wiggle in and out at the same frequency. That’s how we hear. :)•	Our memory system stores information about the relationship between objects and ideas but not necessarily details about the objects themselves. If you want to remember something try to create many associated tags and links to that object. The greater the number of meaningful links and tags the more you will remember about that object through the linking system. The book had chapters on subjects such as: what is music? Foot tapping, anticipation, how do we categorise music, music emotion and the reptilian brain, what makes a musician, why do we like the music we like and the music instinct."
19,0525949690,http://goodreads.com/user/show/768075-jessica,5,"People often ask me about how I can be a musician and into sign language. It occurs for them like there is a dichotomy at play. I've never experienced my work in either area to be at odds with the other.This week I'm reading the coolest book I've read in a while: This is Your Brain on Music by Daniel J. Levitin. He was once a musician and sound engineer, but now is a neuroscientist (another set of odd-bedfellow occupations). A Publishers Weekly review says ""This is likely the only book whose jacket sports blurbs from both Oliver Sacks and Stevie Wonder."" In the past few days he has enlightened me to myriad fascinating aspects of my relationship to music, both as a musician and as a human being.My favorite among these revelations thus far is the following passage, which validates my feeling that signing and singing aren't so different, despite their apparent disparity: ""Most astonishing was that the left-hemisphere regions that we found were active in tracking musical structure were the very same ones that are active when deaf people are communicating by sign language. This suggested that what we had identified in the brain wasn't a region hat simply processed whether a chord sequence was sensible, or whether a spoken sentence was sensible. We were now looking at a region that responded to sight--to the visual organization of words conveyed through American Sign Language. We found evidence for the existence of a brain region that processes structure in general, when that structure is conveyed over time. Although the inputs to this region must have come from different neural populationşand the outputs of it had to go through distinctive networks, there it was--a region that kept popping up in any task that involved organizing information over time.""Brains are neat, mine included."
20,0525949690,http://goodreads.com/user/show/117056-andrew,1,"I was going to keep reading this book until the new year, but I've decided to stop. I would think the combined topics of music and science would interest me, but it didn't, at least not in the way this author tackled it. Being a musician and a music scholar myself, I disagree with some of his statements, many of which don't seem to be scientific and are based in opinion rather than fact. He asserts that most people can tell when two different instruments are being played simultaneously, but I know that sometimes two instruments played together can sound like one (like when a flute and oboe are played at the same time, it sounds like a unidentified wind instrument, and to the untrained ear, which is the intended audience for this book, the individual timbres may be undetectable). This is only one of the false, broad generalizations he constantly makes. He also insists that music theory and notation are needlessly complicated and intentionally designed so to confuse laymen, which I think is preposterous. Anyone can learn to read music. I might have enjoyed the book more if I'd skipped the introductory lessons on basic music theory, but I wanted to see what he had to say about it. I'd be open to reading another book on the science of how we perceive music."
21,0525949690,http://goodreads.com/user/show/70114-rosie,4,"So far it's off to a sort of dry start. I'm led to believe that it will get better when he starts getting into the subject matter a bit more, but the first chapter is basically a quick and dirty introduction to music theory, most of which I am already quite familiar with. I'll force myself to get into the second chapter and see how it goes from there.After finishing, I can say this book has a lot of information in it. Levitin explores the Cerebellum's role in processing music, which was fascinating. He also discusses the evolutionary reasons that music has continued to exist. As he says, it is not just auditory cheesecake. I'd recommend this book to anyone who is interested in Cognitive Neuroscience, music, or both."
22,0525949690,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5130906-mikael-lind,2,"I'm not sure if I'm happy with having read this book, i.e. if the read was time well spent or not. The book is far too long for its content, and a bit hit-and-miss. I couldn't really relate to many of the bands that Levitin was referring to (Sting, Eagles), except for some fun facts about the Beatles. Also, some of his personal anecdotes are really boring and didn't help explaining the topic he was discussing.There's an annoying mind/brain dualism in this book. Despite discussing Wittgenstein in a part of the book, Levitin should study him more carefully next time and try to understand the point he was trying to make with his later philosophy. Levitin writes about pitch that it ""is the end product of a chain of mental events that gives rise to an entirely subjective, internal mental representation or quality"". I would say that this is wrong. First of all, pitch is partly the product of the frequency of the sound itself (the physical, out-there-in-the-world property). Second, pitch is not entirely subjective, since pitch is in a great extent part of a cultural heritage. He writes himself that ""[f]or reasons that are largely cultural, we tend to associate major scales with happy or triumphant emotions, and minor scales with sad or defeated emotions."" The pitches in a specific scale is largely a cultural product, but also depends on the intrinsic harmonious properties of the certain sounds themselves, such as overtones (how and how much is still a subject to debate). So the subjective, ""mental"" part of pitch is caught up in this inter-subjective reality, so to speak, even though there are idiosyncratic variations of pitch cognition between listeners.Another example of Levitin's dualism is this: ""Our brains can estimate the size of an enclosed space on the basis of the reverberation and echo present in the signal that hits our ears. Even though few of us understand the equations necessary to describe how one room differs from another, all of us can tell whether we're standing in a small, tiled bathroom, a medium-sized concert hall, or a large church with high ceilings."" Of course, the computational process in the brain is a part of what makes it possible for us to experience different reverberation, but it is misleading to say that ""we"" don't learn about reverberational properties but our ""brains"" do. Certainly, after being exposed to different reverberation all your life, you learn how to distinguish between them; you know how your voice sounds when you're talking inside a church. When you experience a certain reverberation and understand it, then the reverberation that you are conscious of and the computational functions in your brain that make this experience possible, are not two different things but two sides of the same coin.Levitin's attempt to explain why music moves us is slightly interesting, but, again, he confuses us with his dualism. ""As the music unfolds, the brain constantly updates its estimates of when new beats will occur, and takes satisfaction in matching a mental beat with a real-in-the-world one, and takes delight when a skillful musician violates that expectation in an interesting way"". What on earth do we make of this? Because our brains like it? This just creates another question; why do our ""brains"" like music - why does the cerebellum find ""pleasure in adjusting itself to stay synchronized""? There's no ""find pleasure"" without a subject, but who is Levitin's subject? The brain? I would say this: Brains do not find pleasure in doing things, PEOPLE find pleasure in doing things! People like to have expectations about the music, people like to match rhythms and follow melodies. The brain is what makes our experience possible. It is not an aswer to the question ""why do we like music?"" to say ""because the brain likes music!"", because it just creates another question: ""But why does the brain like music? Who is in the brain liking this music if not the person in which the brain is situated?"" Levitin is not alone in presenting this flawed explanation; we see it everywhere in contemprary neuroscience.It doesn't get better when Levitin tries to tackle complexity in music. To an adult, he says, there is music that is too simple to be challenging enough, so s/he will not like it so much. As the music gets more complex, s/he will like it more and more, but then there's a peak, a personal preference about how much complexity can be tolerated, and after that peak, the pleasure s/he gets from the music is falling again until the music is so complex that s/he will simply hate it. This is an inverted-U graph, Levitin tells us, is ""intended to acount for [the] variable"" why we might ""like or dislike a piece of music ... because of its simplicity or complexity"". I just want to say that the graph is simply wrong. Think about a beautiful fugue by Bach. Most people would like it a lot, and yet it is very complex. The reason is that people can like it DESPITE its complexity; i.e. you don't NEED to understand the complexity in order to like the piece. Still, it is also possible to penetrate the complexity and try to get a deeper understanding of the piece. There's pleasure on the surface as well as pleasure beneath it!The final chapter about music and evolution is the most interesting one. I'm not sure I agree with Levitin when he says that a lot of birdsong is recursive; I would say that that statement is certainly a question that is still up for discussion. However, Levitin does pretty well in disproving Pinker's thesis that music has no adaptory function, and I would say that for those not interested in penetrating the whole book, the last chapter will probably do just fine on its own.There are much better books on music out there. Anthony Storr's Music and the Mind is one, and also, half-way finished with Philip Ball's The Music Instinct, I would say that one is so far more substantial and less confusing."

A lot of the reviews seem to be complaining about the writing style and the author's tone, but honestly I don't remember much about either of those (it's been months since I read this book; I just happened to be thinking about it again today). What I remember most clearly was the ideas, and how it got me thinking about both music and the brain in new ways. I have a keen (if amateur) interest in brains, so approaching it from a familiar direction (music) was a good intro to the neurology.I guess what I'm saying is: it was my first popular neurology book. You never forget your first!"
24,0525949690,http://goodreads.com/user/show/579016-reenie,2,"My boyfriend will be very glad that I'm done with this book, since I kept on complaining all the way through as I read it.It definitely does have some interesting facts and ideas within it, so it's vaguely interesting, but more importantly, it's also profoundly irritating. At least for me. Partly due to some logical or factual errors or selective readings of data, and partly (or maybe mostly, come to think of it) due to something in the demeanour that comes across from the author. He's really bloody irritating, and I would have been more taken with the book if he'd just held off the name-dropping a little more.Really. Francis Crick was freaking awesome, and potentially one of the smartest/most insightful scientists ever, but I don't really need to hear all about the 30 minute meeting you had with him once where you talked about your research on a field where he wasn't a particular expert. Especially not about what his hands looked like as he played with his dessert. Actually, in other circumstances I really would like to hear about it, and I am really very jealous of people that did get to meet and talk with Crick, but the fact that one does talk with a genius does not endow your scientific endeavours with any greater meaning or truth. To borrow Levitin's tendency (which I did like) of illustrating with rock analogies, having talked with Jimi Hendrix about chord progressions does not make your bands' songs any more interesting or good, so shut up about that time you guys did heroin together, would you?Okay, I'm rambling... in summary, for me this book definitely has some interesting ideas, but if you are going to read it, keep your skeptics society baseball cap firmly in place for the duration."
25,0525949690,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2266805-andrew-ludke,5,"I read this after reading Oliver Sacks book ""Musicophilia"" and it is a great follow up. Did you know that what goes in the ear exists in the brain ... I mean really exists. If you hear a frequency of 440hz, an 'A' on the piano keyboard, there exists an electrical signal in your brain with a frequency of exactly 440Hz. Did you know that every natural tone rings a series of mathematically related tones called the overtone series. The relative volume of these overtones creates timbre. Timbre is what makes a trumpet sound like a trumpet and a piano sound like a piano even though they are both playing a 'A' 440. OK that's not such a stretch, but did you know that if we were to electronically remove one of the overtones, the first overtone is the octave or doubling so 880hz, you brain replaces the missing frequency. Think about that, what comes in the ear is unnaturally missing a frequency, but your brain replaces it ... through brain scans we see the 880hz added back in neurologically in the brain. You might say, wow humans are amazing creatures, but this is not solely a human capability. The same experiment was performed on a rabbit and the rabbit's brain also recognizes the discrepancy and compensates for it. OK now here's the really cool part. The experimenters to the signal being read back from brain scans and passed it through an audio amplified and finally to a speaker and the rabbits brain played back the missing frequency. This book should be read by anyone curious about how and why music effects us so deeply and wants to know a little more about how this all works in the brain. I was sad to come to the last page ... like a hip new song, I wanted to play it again."

27,0525949690,http://goodreads.com/user/show/85022-seth,3,"Levitin goes too far out of his way to make the book appeal to the layman. His tone isn't condescending, but he came across as an academic out of his element. Much of the research he cites is very fascinating. When it's all said and done though, I didn't walk away feeling like I had a much better grasp of what my brain is actually like on music. Levitin spends most of the book citing other research and did not assert his own opinions until the very end. I found his own views fascinating, but even then he couldn't tie it all together into something meaningful.This book was given to me as a present from a friend. I'm a musician by hobby and a nerd (software developer) by trade. For these reasons, I enjoyed the book despite its failings."

29,0525949690,http://goodreads.com/user/show/49847688-emily,3,"This was interesting, but not always the most enjoyable. If you have any basic understanding of neuroscience (I'm talking VERY basic understanding of neurons, the structure of the brain, etc.) and music (I'm talking third grade piano lessons), a lot of this books is tedious. Levitin clearly wants this book to be accessible to anyone, and while that's GREAT, it also means that a lot of groundwork needs to be laid down. Because of this, a lot of time is dedicated to defining things, which is... boring. Once Levitin gets into the actual analysis of how your brain processes and interacts with music, I was WAY more interested! This analysis is where the book succeeds. Unfortunately, it takes a lot of wading through definitions to get to that analysis."
30,0525949690,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3126915-imi,4,"An enjoyable and clearly explained introduction this this fascinating topic. Aimed at both the lay- scientist/psychologist and musician, Levitin aims to explain how both this very technical topics are linked in a way anyone can follow. I have musical background, but am not hugely knowledgeable about the technicalities, and am most definitely not a scientist, despite having a keen interest in neuroscience. This book was really well done, and avoided being too complex, without being oversimplified. "
31,0525949690,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5593045-loring-wirbel,4," Two friends called this book the perfect companion to David Byrne's ""How Music Works,"" and I heartily agree. Where Byrne covers issues of cultural cues and personal responses to music in a broad sense, Levitin dives deep into the neural processing that goes on in music interpretation, and the emotional cerebellar responses that come along for the ride. As a former recording engineer that went back to school to become a cognitive neuroscientist, Levitin gives us just the right balance of personal experience and biological detail. You won't find any of the heavy math of Stephen Grossberg's ""Neural Networks and Natural Intelligence"" or Pentti Kanerva's ""Sparse Distributed Memory,"" but you will find a commoner's explanation, fairly accurate, of how neural networks store artistic memories and attach emotional responses to those memories. We also get a lot of wonderful anecdotes of how Arnold Schonberg set free the boundaries in classical music, how Steely Dan re-invented pop composition, how Joni Mitchell confused and liberated bass players by refusing to use conventional chord systems. We even get Levitin's fascinating story of how he met James Watson and Francis Crick at separate times, under wildly different circumstances. At times, Levitin drifts a little bit into celebrity name-dropping, but with so many unique stories to tell, he can be forgiven a little star-bragging. Those not familiar with theories of how music and language are processed in the human brain may find the entire book an astonishing revelation from beginning to end. Even in the early chapters, I was taken aback by findings such as how a deaf person processes ASL in a manner more similar to a hearing person processing music, than to the processing of language. The chapter on music talent and the development of expertise, in particular, has something for everyone. The final two chapters should bedazzle all readers, no matter how familiar they are with the topic. In his analysis of why we like the music we do, Levitin first takes us to rhythms heard in the womb or in the very early weeks of newborn life, and carries us through the high point of music association with emotions during adolescence. He also has a dual-edged explanation for why people sometimes run away from music they are unfamilar with, sometimes viscerally groaning ""That's not music!"" In the first instance, new forms of music must be placed within a schema or framework, and the brain's ability to adopt new schemas hits its high point about the time empathic genes and mirror neurons are developed, at about 20 years old. Some people can keep this flexibility through their lives, but many begin losing neural plasticity in their mid-20s. In the second instance, people need schemas as a sense of safety and security. If they are not adventurous, they may respond to ""weird"" music with a sense of fear and disgust. This should not surprise us, Levitin says. In the same sense that we cannot remove fight/flight mechanisms from our nature, we cannot totally remove our innate desire for safety, familiarity, and security, though we can choose to consciously override that tendency to a certain extent. In his last chapter on the evolutionary utility of music, Levitin gets to tweak the nose of cognitive researcher Steven Pinker ever so slightly. (I am a fan of many of Pinker's ideas, but I consider Pinker someone like Malcolm Gladwell - a writer who could use a come-uppance now and then.) Pinker thought of music as ""auditory cheesecake,"" or an ""evolutionary spandrel,"" something largely useless, for pleasure purposes only, that rode the coattails of language as it evolved. Levitin heartily disagrees, and says that music co-evolved with dance as a means of sexual selection-expression and of tying emotion intimately to neural processes. I not only agree with Levitin, I think he unwittingly identified the Pinker problem when he quoted autistic researcher Temple Grandin, who said ""I think music is pretty, but I just don't get it."" Perhaps those who do not passionately ""get"" music are partially autistic, though still capable of deep expression on a pure language level. I have friends who are equally talented writers, but differ in their ability to emotionally attach to music. Grandin and Pinker deserve our empathy, because they don't quite understand what Levitin understands very well - music is the core, language comes along for the ride."
32,0525949690,http://goodreads.com/user/show/38036772-annie,4,"Turns out this guy’s a professor at my alma mater, McGill, which is always cool. If I’d known I’d have snuck into one of his lectures last year. Really enjoyed this! I’ve played instruments all my life and so the music theory wasn’t new to me, but I really liked learning about frequencies and how synthesizers work. It took me much longer than it probably should have to read this book because I kept wanting to play the songs he mentions to hear what he’s talking about (it’s really fun and I learned a lot doing that). It’s handy to keep Youtube at your fingertips when reading (this isn’t a book to read on your commute) to play the notes and songs he references. I’m also now strangely obsessed with the song Straight Up by Paula Abdul because of the way he described the unique conglomeration of sound. It’s weird.I actually think this changed the way I listen to music. "
33,0525949690,http://goodreads.com/user/show/123397-andrew,1,"This is one of the most trite books I have ever read. I am not over/ underblowing it. I literally learned nothing more in the entire book than: making and listening to music affects all parts of the brain. There is nothing more profound than that, and the science is written at high school junior level. There are plenty of books that discuss neuroscience for the masses, and manage to blend descriptions of all their buddies' research with accessible conclusions (Antonio Damasio's boooks come to mind), but Levitin's is a complete blank. The blurbs of praise in the front couple of pages from all the major newspapers in the USA that say the book gave them ""insight"" or ""illumination"" literally send chills down my spine: our culture is stupid beyond my wildest cynicism."
34,0525949690,http://goodreads.com/user/show/216284-mark,3,"This is really an excellent book, and the neuroscience is enhanced by Levitin's many references to pop and rock songs, based on his experience in his earlier career as a recording engineer. The only reason I held back a little is that the beginning of the book lays out music theory terms and definitions in a sort of obligatory way and you have to get through that before you get to the more interesting material on brain scans and experiments."

More or less a brain dump of everything they've learned at McGill University's Laboratory for Musical Perception, Cognition and Expertise glued together with amusing anecdotes. "

Sources aren't listed, and there are frequent white-lie errors (i.e. scientists directing images to your right or left brain by exposing one eye at a time). A good teaser for musicians and music fans interested in the brain -- but nothing particularly sophisticated. I'm getting much more out of David Huron's SWEET ANTICIPATION, which has fewer references to brain areas, but much more interesting ideas about underlying psychology."

Do not believe any of the hype surrounding this tripe (and sadly that rhyme I just made is probably far funnier than any of the ""jokes"" littered throughout this book). What a fool I am for reading this book for as long as I did."
38,0525949690,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2664606-k-lincoln,5,"From the perspective of someone with a lifelong passion for a wide range of music and with a job based on language acquisition, this book was utterly fascinating.It's dense. My background in linguistics from college (with a dash of cognitive science) really helped in the scientific language as well as the idea of linking functions to specific parts of the brain. If you're not familiar with that, I recommend referencing the handy dandy brain diagram at the back of the book showing where different functions of humans experiencing music (recognizing pitch, experiencing emotion, forecasting a change in music chord, memory, etc) resides as you read.The cool thing about this book is that Levitin himself is a musician and goes at musical processing within the context of a musicians inside knowledge and love for it. He brings up questions at the beginning that I never really considered before, like the amazing ability humans have to recognize the tune ""happy birthday"" regardless of what speed it is sung, what pitch it starts on, if half of it speeds up, etc. and what that implies about the way our brains work.""The story of your brain on music is the story of an exquisite orchestration of brain regions, involving the oldest and newest parts of the human brain, and regions as far apart as the cerebellum in the back of the head and the frontal lobes just behind your eyes...When we love a piece of music, it reminds us of other music we have heard, and it activates memory traces of emotional times in our lives.""Excellent book for anyone interested in human emotion, cognition, musicians, or the concept of talent."
39,0525949690,http://goodreads.com/user/show/25371127-rossdavidh,3,"Subtitle: The Science of a Human ObsessionIt is to Levitin's credit that he manages to wait until 100 pages have gone by before he even mentions Steven Pinker, and not until the last chapter before he recounts the now infamous story of Pinker's 1997 keynote address to the conference at MIT where scientists who study music and the mind had gathered to share what they had learned.Pinker, who studies language rather than music, told those gathered there that music was a ""spandrel"", a term invented by Stephen Jay Gould for something which evolves not because it is useful, but rather as a byproduct of something else. Language, said Pinker, evolved because it is useful (Pinker studies language and the mind). Music has a lot in common with language, including pattern recognition, prosody, rhythm, recursion, and so on. It is also processed in parts of the brain which are more or less the mirror image of the parts on the other side which process language. Forget about trying to decide why humans evolved an appreciation for music, said Pinker. Music is ""auditory cheesecake"", and our appreciation of it is just a side effect of our use of language.Needless to say, those who devote their professional lives to studying music and the mind, don't generally agree that their topic is a spandrel. Also, it should be said, the years since 1997 have not been kind to Pinker's thesis, as evidence has piled up that humans had music before they had language, can lose the ability to comprehend language without losing the ability to appreciate music and vice versa, and study of other species' use of music shows that it shares more with ours than just the name. Still, Pinker's remark stung a little to those in the field, I think.Fortunately, Levitin doesn't spend most of the book bashing Pinker, but rather taking us on a tour of the (quite sizeable) amount that we've learned about music and the brain in the last twenty or thirty years. Some of it he has had a hand in discovering himself, as a professor of psychology and neuroscience at McGill University in Montreal. He also had a previous career as a sound engineer, session musician, etc. for groups like Stevie Wonder and Blue Oyster Cult (if there is anything those two have in common besides being successful). He has a wide range of musical information and examples at his fingertips, and to illustrate a point (in a text format) he can give the reader examples from the Beatles, children's songs, classical music, jazz, and much else. Levitin clearly knows his subject, and knows how to teach it.One question worth asking, of course, is whether or not we need to understand the 'why' of music. On one level, of course, we do not; one can appreciate music perfectly well without understanding anything about it intellectually. I read dutifully the chapter where he tried to explain to me the difference between timbre, texture, contour, pitch, and so forth, but I cannot claim to remember anything of the difference between them now. However, apparently other (non-intellectual) parts of my brain DO know about these things, if not the words for them, and this is one of the points Levitin makes repeatedly: you are an expert at music, whether you know anything about playing it or not. We can recognize the same tune played in a different speed, with different instruments, different words, and done in a different key so that literally none of the notes are the same. We can also do so without any particular effort. It is as if a short story were understood by us whether it were told to us in English, German, Chinese, or Arabic. There are few things which we are as expert at as listening to music (probably because we do it so much).So, if for no reason other than that, it is a topic worth investigating as to how the brain processes music. It is also probably cause for concern that something virtually all humans used to do (make music) is now something we only pay others to do, and rarely or never do ourselves. One more reason to pay for the kid's music lessons (or your own). Probably also one more reason that school districts' picking on the music program when cutting costs, is an unwise decision.But whether you ever intend to play music or not, anything which your own brain spends that much of its time doing (listening to music) should be something you have some curiousity about. Thirty years ago, there wouldn't be much to tell you about how your brain processes all that music throws at it. Thanks to Levitin and others like him, we now know quite a bit, and this book is an enjoyable introduction to it."
40,0525949690,http://goodreads.com/user/show/35040613-rania,4,"Music has many advantages and disadvantages for your brain including damage and concentration and that’s what “This Is Your Brain on Music: The Science of a Human Obsession” by Daniel J. Levitin mostly talks about. There are many kinds of brains some sensible and other less fragile than the rest. There are nine different kinds of intelligence in a brain. Some of the nine organisms do not support music or else they do. Music has an understandable role in life because of the nine bits of intelligence organisms in the brain. Your mood around music is significant whether your brain organism likes it or not. When most of the nine organisms don't like that sound it completely changes the way a person feels or concentrate because of the brain’s reaction. My favorite paragraph in this book is the part when the author Daniel J. Levitin finally explains the cause of the brain's reaction to music. The rest of the paragraphs were useless because of the fact that they didn’t explain anything about what the topic is all about. For this reason the title of this book is wrong, if I could rename it I would title it “Music’s Attitude”. This would be an amazing title because that’s basically what the book’s information is all about, and it would help the reader understand the book better. The author is really into this topic, he is a big scientist that is very proud of his researches. The scientist explains the process clearly of what he did to an outcome this idea. Daniel has showed clearly his researches but, unfortunately, didn't choose the written title for his amazing book.This book had ups and downs, mostly ups when the scientist finally explains how he came up with this amazing idea. When the author was young around the 70’s he couldn't concentrate with noise or any sound around but for his friends, it was the opposite. That caused J. Levitin being left out and he really wanted to stay with his friends but, couldn't because of the fact that his mom told him to stay away from the noise. That followed him to university so he found a friend that had the same issue as him and collaborated together to find out when. Here's my least favorite part coming, Daniel was a strong curious scientist that didn't really need help to develop his research but wanted to do something for once with someone. His friend was pretending to work and earned money for doing anything just creating this bad title of this book. I wouldn't read another novel from Daniel J. Levitin because of the fact that he only publishes a scientific book and that's not what I like to read for entertainment. I would recommend this book to all the people that have the same problem as this talented scientist, not supporting noise to finally discover the reason of this cause. Students would mostly like this book because they are still growing with curiosity and always wants to learn some more. Inconveniently this book has more ups because of the problem solving that Daniel finally gave out the secret of this cause. "
41,0525949690,http://goodreads.com/user/show/59278313-julia,4,"Levitin's scientific and musical experiences uniquely qualified him to author this book, and his writing is both engaging and accessible to the novice, in either (or both) domains. He is candid and enthusiastic, and though I am naturally disposed to be in regard to these topics, I found myself energized anew by what was familiar and fascinated by what I learned. It lost some momentum in the latter third, or perhaps I simply fatigued. Some may think it impressive that Levitin is able to present myriad explanations founded in solid data to reveal why music affects us, how it does so, why we like what we like, etc. and still keep the reader in awe. Wouldn't knowing the minutiae of music processing in the brain ruin the magic? I would argue the antithesis, and I believe Levitin would agree: The more you know about music (and the brain), the more miraculous it all becomes, and the more you realize is still a mystery. "

43,0525949690,http://goodreads.com/user/show/426277-james,4,"Daniel J. Levitin’s This Is Your Brain On Music: The Science of a Human Obsession is a fascinating study about what happens in the brain when we listen to music. Levitin, a neuroscientist and former session musician and producer, has crafted an excellent study that both scientists and lay readers whose grasp of science is somewhat limited will find informative.Perhaps best of all, Levitin’s book doesn’t ruin the enjoyment of listening to music.Levitin primarily takes a thematic approach in examining how the brain functions when listening to music. Although the first chapter, which explains the basics of music like pitch, timbre, meter, may be sow-going for the musically-challenged, the remaining chapters are enlightening. With topics including how the brain remembers and recalls music, why music can impact our moods, and why musical preferences can vary from person to person, Levitin explains the processes occurring in the brain without overwhelming the reader with overly-technical and academically-dry details.Perhaps the most interesting chapter is the final one, which makes a case for the evolutionary origins of music, arguing against scientists who believe music was a happy accident or an unplanned byproduct of language development. Levitin shows how music may have played a role in human survival and evolution, including aiding in cognitive development, serving as a key factor in promoting early human interactions, and giving musical males an extra advantage in the grand reproductive race.Written for non-experts who might not know the difference between a hippocampus and a hippopotamus, This Is Your Brain On Music successfully manages to explain how we listen to music without reducing music to a series of neurons and brain waves. Levitin writes in an intelligent but not overbearing or condescending tone; his passion for music is apparent throughout the book. An excellent integration of science and music, Levitin’s book examines the brain’s role in listening to and processing music without downplaying any of the emotions we experience when listening to music. I enjoyed the book, particularly the science of the brain and its relation to music."
44,0525949690,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5696672-james,1,"To start, if you have had even the most basic course in music theory (and that very much includes middle school band/choir), two thirds of this book will be redundant. Not the first chapter, as he warns, but the vast majority of the book. Somehow he managed to write just under 300 pages, repeat himself over and over, and not really say anything. He notes that this was not written for his colleagues (that quickly becomes obvious) but I often found myself wishing that it was. Sure, when reading someone such as Neil deGrasse Tyson, you are grateful for him simplifying astrophysics for us, but how are we to expand our minds when Levitin dumbs it down this much? If you know nothing of music, maybe you’ll love this. Hard for me to say. I want to make it clear though: my knowledge of music is so limited that the majority of you probably know as much/more than I do. He just offers so little here. You’ll also have to slug through face palm inducing cheesiness, inane tangents from his personal life, and a host of references which do nothing for someone reading text. Another reviewer mentioned the failure of this medium for the message...almost anything other than a book would have elevated this experience drastically. There are so many references in the music theory section to timbre, pitch, and rhythm that are dull in text where they could click in someone’s mind when played via audiobook or through a tv broadcast. If you are looking for fascinating studies, interesting anecdotes, and a clear message, look elsewhere. "
45,0525949690,http://goodreads.com/user/show/262254-greg,4,"A really amazing book that takes a look at our love of music from a cognitive neuroscientific standpoint. The book was written by a cognitive scientist with an extensive background in the music industry(as a musician, producer, and recording engineer) which makes him pretty damn qualified in my opinion to write about the subject.The book tackles this subject from all angles, starting with some basics about music and music theory, and then working into the functioning of the auditory system(both from a physiological standpoint and a neuroscientific standpoint). He then proceeds into the higher order processing of music and the cross modal nature of our music experience, describing all the different areas of our brain involved in our experience and enjoyment of music. Levitin uses many examples ranging from classical music to rock and roll to illustrate his points and help the reader connect to the science. A quick plug for the audio book, they really take advantage of the audio format and will play examples ranging from simple sounds to full melodies to help the listener understand the topic being discussed, which was extremely helpful for me.Music has always been a really integral part of my life and this book was a really fascinating exploration of the subject.

46,0525949690,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1633145-james,3,"Not nearly as good as I thought it would be. Music + psychological neuroscience? Sounded right up my alley. Actually it was very interesting in some places, but very dry and boring in others. A lot of it was reviewing musical and psychological concepts with which I'm already familiar. I can see why the author reviewed these things, but I ended up skimming them. To others not familiar with these concepts, though, I suspect it would be very boring. The parts that were the most interesting to me were whenever the author explained scientifically why particular songs created the desired effect on people. It was even more interesting to me when I was familiar with the song and could bring it up in my head.Other interesting subjects included explanations for specific music-mind/brain phenomena that happen to everyone or to music lovers (such as getting a song stuck in your head or why you like particular music), the scientific evidence for in utero exposure to music as well as early childhood, and exploring what goes into making a music expert and a famous musician (not the same thing it turns out).Overall, okay, but probably definitely not for people who aren't interested in music and the scientific reasons for its perplexities."
47,0525949690,http://goodreads.com/user/show/894154-jocelyn,3,"I read this as a follow-up to Musicophilia by Oliver Sacks (which I enjoyed reading -- and reviewing!) It answered the questions that Sacks does not address, such as what parts of our brains process music, why music affects us emotionally, and whether musicianship conferred an evolutionary advantage on our ancestors. Plus Levitin also discusses the basics, like pitch and frequency, timbre, and rhythm. I liked the part where he explains how composers and performers move us and interest us by violating our expectations: for example, not returning the melody to the tonic, or using sycopation to throw off the rhythm. I also liked the observation that music has historically been connected to movement (dancing, marching, rocking, etc.) Children know this instinctively. Only in the last 500 years or so have we developed a culture where we sit around quietly and listen to professional musicians. Maybe this is why I would much rather perform music than listen to it.This is not a particularly difficult book to read, but it's not perfect either. There are many awkward transitions, plus Levitin is so immersed in the world of music and academia, he sometimes forgets to filter out details that are not really interesting to those who are not."
48,0525949690,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1919652-jed,3,"In short, I enjoyed this book enough while I was reading it; I was glad when it was over; I hardly can remember anything about it now.It's a bit like watching a popular education channel (Discovery, Nat. Geo., History, etc) late at night: it serves the purpose of passing the time, but probably isn't going to blow your mind.If you are interested in music cognition, it's probably worth checking out. If you really don't know anything about music theory (I mean, like you were out sick for a whole school year and never even learned the basics of reading music) you might find it a struggle. However, the author uses popular music, as well as classical, jazz, etc, to illustrate points. He does a good job of making it all friendly and accessible.I have to give him credit for taking on Stephen Pinker. Man, that took cojones. I'm not equipped to say whose scientific opinion is correct. I admire Pinker a lot, but Levitin's arguments about the evolutionary value of musicianship also seemed valid.As for this loopy star system, I understand 3 to mean 'I liked it."" Not the equivalent of a C in an A-F system. I liked the book. I didn't love it. I wasn't over the moon, but there was also nothing ""wrong"" with it as such."
49,0525949690,http://goodreads.com/user/show/20357082-dane,2,"I took a huge (possibly six or seven month) break halfway through this. Most of it leaked out of my head. I really did enjoy the insights and fascinating studies, and as always enjoyed the evolution discussion at the end of the book (I'm a sucker for evolutionary biology) in which Levitin challenges the notion that music is ""auditory cheesecake,"" and instead hints at many meanings in our survival and reproduction. I think what made me walk away from the book for so long is that he inserts way too much casual autobiographical bragging into the book. I feel like, in a piece like this, the beginning is the place for credentials and anecdotes. But throughout the whole thing I had to learn about his cool musical background, his admirable jump into neuroscience scholarship later in his life, and his weird name-dropping (two separate dinner parties with Francis Crick and Joni Mitchell, respectively). It made the book warmer than your typical neuroscience nonfiction, but it still slowed the book down for me."
50,0525949690,http://goodreads.com/user/show/53373139-j-a-willoughby,5,"This book is not for the faint of heart. It is a complete and total dichotomy of our obsession with music, like the title says. It reads like a textbook, thoroughly explaining the most basic of things - ""a single tone cannot be dissonant"" - to analyzing chord progressions in rock songs. It also dives into how we hear the things we do, how music is perceived and appreciated (or not) by our brains. Being a lifelong musician I knew a lot of what was in the book and breezed over it. But understanding the science and psychology behind it all and the inference that music is ingrained in us is fascinating. It prompted even more questions from me, trying to analyze specific (mostly dissonant) intervals and how they might be connected to our evolution, a project of my own I would like to undertake sometime in the future. If you need to know the ""whys"" of things this book will satisfy you, and about our love affair with music. "
51,0525949690,http://goodreads.com/user/show/31382574-andrew,2,I think the title is misleading. This book was a biography with some asides concerning the science of music. I read this when I was first starting to learn music theory and develop my own compositions and sounds. I don't think this book helped me in those activities. I think the most important thing I took away from this was from the biography bits where Levitin states that he decideded at a relatively late age to go back to school. Because he had no specialty he was free to choice any path he wanted to take. I see many people around me either choose their career while still a teenager and enter into college right after highschool or just never go to college and stick to a low-education career (and hopefully get promoted into a nice job). It's nice to see someone change their career outlook so drastically and succeed in it.
52,0525949690,http://goodreads.com/user/show/46243903-beth,1,"A complete waste of time. This book is highly technical in the areas of music as well as brain anatomy. In addition, familiarity with very obscure musicians is necessary to truly understand the point the author is trying to make. Mr. Levitin is very knowledgeable in his field of expertise, and he lets you know it, but he doesn't do a good job of relaying that information to the reader. Finally, the author writes from an evolutionary worldview full. The last chapter on the evolution of music is completely useless. For example the author writes: ""The best estimates are that it takes a minimum of fifty thousand years for an adaptation to show up in the human genome...When we ask about the evolutionary basis for music, it does no good to think about Britney or Bach. We have to think what music was like around fifty thousands years ago,"" (pp. 256-257)."
53,0525949690,http://goodreads.com/user/show/442654-andrew,0,"A rather clever, fun little book. A lot of it is really basic for anyone who's studied music theory at all, but even those parts have lots of brief, interesting anecdotes. It's definitely more a music book than a science book... which, as someone who worked at a radio station while a science major, I have no problem with. The weakest parts come towards the end... my general skepticism towards evolutionary psychology definitely colored my opinions of the closing chapter especially. However, while he doesn't prove to me that music is an evolutionary characteristic, he does provide us with a charming, hypothetical argument. And I really don't mean that to sound condescending, but that's the best way I can think to phrase it."
54,0525949690,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5406917-emily,1,"Terrible book. It barely scratched the surface of the science and psychology of music. The author was vague and insufferably cocky, going on irrelevant tangents as if merely to fill space, telling stories about famous musicians he'd worked with, and spent half the book just explaining what music is, as if the reader had never heard of it. I felt like I was being patronized. However, it was at the point in the book where the author casually stated that ""Adam and Eve"" were our ""first ancestors"" that I could not read another page. How am I to trust the credibility of someone who presents religious myths as facts, much less in a book that is supposed to be about science! If you wanted to be mentally stimulated, there's got to be something better out there. This book will leave you wanting."
55,0525949690,http://goodreads.com/user/show/134756-emily,3,"I found myself reading this book very, very quickly. Why? Well, the sections explaining the language and technical aspects of music all consisted of information I already knew, so I zipped through them. The sections explaining the science of the brain while playing or listening to music were so over my head that I subconsciously decided to speed-read rather than really engage with the complexity of the material. And this is neuroscience for dummies! All that said, the work and studies done by Levitin and his colleagues is fascinating and very cool. I just can't claim to follow all of the details."
56,0525949690,http://goodreads.com/user/show/12266091-andrei-pogorilowski,5,"I have read Levitin's work while gathering information for a book of my own. Previously I had knowledge of his ""Memory for musical tempo: Additional evidence that auditory memory is absolute"" (http://cogprints.org/644/1/tempo.htm%...%) and expected to read something similar – only to find myself immersed into a highly enjoyable book, full of anecdotes and interesting facts. TIYBOM deserves to be a bestseller and the only thing that I regret is that musical time (cognition) did not become a chapter of this fine work."
57,0525949690,http://goodreads.com/user/show/657502-jo,4,"Very good intro book into music and the brain. Discusses topics such as how we may process music, why do we like certain types of music and dislike others, does music serve an evolutionary purpose, what areas of the brain are involved in different aspects of music making and how damaging the brain can affect certain abilities and leave others fully intact, and what may make a professional caliber musician versus what may not. Super entertaining!"
58,0525949690,http://goodreads.com/user/show/32324-clara,3,"I enjoyed reading this book a lot because it effectively addresses some core cognitive neuroscience questions I'm just beginning to appreciate, namely categorization and expertise; however a few sections struck me as sloppy and poorly written.

61,0525949690,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5-elizabeth,0,I'm loving this book so far. My music teacher was never this clear...
62,0525949690,http://goodreads.com/user/show/57212992-brooke-bell,4," This nonfiction book was fantastic because it expanded on music broken down to its core and the brain in relation to it. My factual understand of music and the human brain prior to reading this was barely base level but that drastically changed. It fully dove into the concepts, definitions, and cultural aspects of music throughout history. In the process it incorporated how as humans we respond to different cultural situations while bring the information to a level that someone with little understanding could comprehend.  I loved how much my knowledge of music expanded through reading this. At first glance the title could turn people away for as it could seem dry, but the author, Daniel J. Levitin, did an outstanding job writing this novel. This was done by his well thought out placement of stories from his own life or cultural music references. While trying to explain concepts and placing numerous definitions in a novel it is difficult to keep audiences engaged, but Levitin avoided this problem virtually effortlessly.  Another aspect of the book I thoroughly enjoyed learning about was the human brain. While I was very engaged at the mention of big name musicians and bands the end connection always fell back to relation to the brain interaction. Even if the complicated terminology would at times go over my head, I still understood the overall message of the information. Levitin did a wonderful job of addressing the other notable people in his neurological field of study and either agreeing or disagreeing in a well argued manner. All and all his writing style left a pattern of the inability to avoid thinking about the concepts placed before you. The whole book expands your base knowledge but gives you an experience on how music has, is, and still will shape humanity."
63,0525949690,http://goodreads.com/user/show/25309260-allison-soulier,3,"""This is Your Brain on Music: The Science of a Human Obsession"" is written by Daniel J. Levitin. It was published by Dutton Penguin in 2006. It is a science text. I gave it a 3 out of 5 stars because the first few chapters were slow for me because I was bogged down with some many vocabulary terms I was unfamiliar with. However, it picked up towards the end and provided some interesting information. ""This Is Your Brain on Music"" describes the different components of music and makes connections to how the different parts of the brain processes these musical components. A huge focus of the text is on the cognitive processes of music and how they have evolved over time in accordance with musical evolution. The aim of ""This Is Your Brain on Music"" was to make recent findings in cognitive neuroscience of music accessible to the educated layperson. Characteristics and theoretical parameters of music are explained alongside scientific findings about how the brain interprets and processes these characteristics. The neuroanatomy of musical expectation, emotion, listening and performance is discussed. The text is meant for grades 9-12, but I would definitely would not teach it except in the 12th grade, probably an honors class. It almost is more aimed towards college-level reading, however. It's Lexile level is a 1360L and Guided Reading level is a Z. My only teaching idea would be to have students pick an instrument and do a research project based on the different criteria discussed in the book on reasons music connects to the brain (L.11-12.1-1. Demonstrate command of the conventions of standard English grammar and usage whenwriting or speaking.a. Apply the understanding that usage is a matter of convention, can change over time, andis sometimes contested.b. Resolve issues of complex or contested usage, consulting references (e.g., MerriamWebster’sDictionary of English Usage, Garner’s Modern American Usage) as needed.)"
64,0525949690,http://goodreads.com/user/show/8156215-ann,4,"This was an interesting book, even if it may be a bit out of date (2006 copyright): part narrative, part neuroscience part music. The author is able to communicate fairly complex neuroscience in an accessible, yet compelling way. He includes some scientific experiments as well as a diversity of musical and musician examples, adding many of his personal stories as well. There is a useful appendix on brain structures in case you are unfamiliar or rusty on these, and one on musical chords as well.I thought Levitin was a bit off when he claimed that the auditory processing that he does was nothing like what his dog does -- dogs and humans are a bit too close phylogenetically for that and he should know better. I was also surprised that he did not initially make the connection between music and the cerebellum in terms of communication/expression via dance/ritual. It seems to me that one reason we have music is as a fundamental means of communication and the cerebellum would be part of coordinating this through physical movement, etc. Levitin does touch on this later in the book but never actually seems to make this connection, rather he focuses on the possibility of music used in courtship, perhaps a more narrow form communication.At any rate, any one interested in music, brain function, and how the two come together will enjoy this book."
65,0525949690,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3954160-gonza,3,"As usual my super huge expectations didn't help me to appreciate the book as I should, as a little excuse I have to say that as a amateur musician who started to learn a new instrument at 40 I was a little bit pissed off and as a neuroscience aficionados, there were not so much stuff that I didn't know, plus the author rambles a lot. I think it would have been better when there were some sort of playlist on youtube, that we could have follow to switch immediately to audio mode while we were reading the book or more brain related pictures and not only on the appendix, but still it was a worthy reading. Come al solito le mie aspettative troppo alte non mi hanno aiutato ad appezzare il libro come avrei potuto, ma sicuramente da musicista per hobby che ha iniziato a suonare il clarinetto a 40 anni, é possibile che non avrei comunque gradito l'informazione che dopo i 20 anni non c'é trippa per gatti. Inoltre c'era poco contenuto per quanto riguarda la parte neuropsicologica e secondo me troppe chiacchiere dell'autore. Magari anche una piccola playlist su youtube da ascoltare in contemporanea con la lettura del libro avrebbe aiutato e anche qualche immagine migliore del cervello. A parte questo, valeva la pena leggerlo."
66,0525949690,http://goodreads.com/user/show/62352876-richard,5,"WOW - this is a very detailed, informative, and eye-opening examination of what music is and why we are so excited by it. The author, Daniel Levitin, has a wide and varied background - from performing in a high school rock band, to being a successful record producer, to a PhD in the field, to running the Laboratory for Musical Perception, Cognition, and Expertise at McGill University.As Levitin points out, our culture is willing to spend as much money on good concert tickets as would feed a family of four - it is THAT important to us. He then spends nearly three hundred pages explaining why we have evolved in this fashion.Levitin promises to keep the musical jargon down to a minimum so that non-musicians can enjoy and understand the book and he keeps to this pledge. He does spend many pages on the physiology and the inner workings of the human brain that requires quite a bit of concentration and brain power. Luckily, he relates all of this information directly to our understanding and appreciation of music.If you love music, play an instrument, or just want to understand why you can't help tapping your foot to a beat - read this book!"
67,0525949690,http://goodreads.com/user/show/25629613-peter-spung,5,"I loved this book. As a music lover, musician, science geek and one who is filled with wonder about the human condition and curiousity about how everything works, this book appealed to all of my preferences. Our brains are hard wired for music, deep in our old (eg cerebellum) and new (eg cerebral cortex) brains, which evolved over a long period. Music listening and especially learning and performing activate parts and connections all over brains, more than almost any other activity. It promotes or facilitates all kinds of emotions, physical movements, and social interactions. The author explains why, using his own experience as a musician, composer, producer, and now neuroscientist and researcher into the psychology of electronic communication in the Lab for Musical Perception, Cognition and Expertise at McGill University.If you have friends who are curious about the ""why"" of music, and its effects on our cognition and emotions, give them this book. You and they will not regret it.Warning: while reading this, the author Levitin often refers to songs among a wide variety of genres, and you'll want to listen to them as you go."

Overall, it was disappointing and I won't be sharing it with my music-loving family, as originally planned.Also: An author's credentials belong on the dust jacket. And I don't need to know the curriculum vitae of every person you mention--If the dust jacket tells me you are an expert, I trust you to only include credible facts from credible individuals!! "

However, he pulls together a really interesting set of research in a way that's really readable. One thing I will say is that I'd be interested to see how much has changed and how much more we've learned in the 13 years since this was published - I expect quite a lot."
70,0525949690,http://goodreads.com/user/show/75843534-jason-mccaffrey,5,"I loved this book! I learned as much about music theory as I did about neuroscience. Heavy concepts with lots of associated and necessary jargon somehow delivered in a really easy and accessible way. Levitin mentions early on that he's trying to keep it easy for the layman. And he nails that without ever seeming like he's patronizing. Another reviewer mentioned that this book would be better as a documentary, and I can't disagree with that. I would recommend at least reading with access to a music streaming service at close hand. There are a lot of references to songs by title and artist that are designed to help illustrate the points he's making."
71,0525949690,http://goodreads.com/user/show/18856924-melissa-symanczyk,3,"I went into this expecting it to be the kind of funny, anecdote-stuffed science that Mary Roach writes. Instead, this is clearly a book written by a scientist trying his damndest to walk the fine line between making complex ideas simple enough for a layperson to understand while retaining the actual science, and I think whether it works is going to be largely dependent on the reader. I think a good editor could've tightened it up a bit.The first couple of chapters on basic music theory and vocabulary could have been replaced with a beefy glossary, but once we get into things there are some really interesting revelations. I now have a greater appreciation of the many different ways that music is processed by the brain, and what a unique gift music actually is. Some interesting thoughts on the evolutionary purpose of music as well that I'd never really thought about."

80,0525949690,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7605433-stephen-palmer,3,"A couple of months ago I watched Stewart Copeland's three-part tv series 'Adventures In Music,' which aimed to get to the heart of what music is and why it means so much to us. The series was very enjoyable, and in one of the episodes there were interviews with Daniel Levitin, so I bought his book 'This Is Your Brain On Music.'I have to say, though it's not a bad book, it is rather dry, and I did struggle with it. The opening three chapters (as the author observes) can be skipped by anyone reasonably au fait with music, while the rest, which is mostly neurology and brain science, is interesting enough but not terribly engaging. I confess I skipped a few sections.It could be that a book simply isn't the right vehicle for this topic. There was nothing specifically wrong here, but I found the continuing descriptions of brain operation to be a case of diminishing returns. Perhaps the book should be televised.Interesting, then, but arid."

It was so technical that I couldn't keep track of everything without listening very intently and I usually listen to audio books while walking or doing chores so I kept missing things and having to rewind.

83,0525949690,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7116910-bernard-o-leary,5,"I've got an earworm right now. It's ""Sorry"" by Justin Bieber. Judge me if you like, but if you've know the song then you're probably humming it now too. This may not seem like a big deal, but think about the astonishing cognitive processes that made all of this possible: the ability to hear, to distinguish individual sounds, to detect musical patterns like rhythm, to interact with them on both an intellectual and emotional level, even to start dancing if the mood were to take me. I can ""record"" the song and play it back in my head, as I am doing now, and I could sing it out loud if I felt like it, possibly with a whole new arrangement. How is any of this even possible?Levitin starts his exploration of music by talking about what music actually is, taking us through the terminology of music and looking a little at the physics of music too. For example, I only had a vague understanding of timbre before reading this. I certainly didn't know that instruments resonate simultaneously on multiple frequencies, and that these frequencies are all multiples of each other (i.e. a tuba resonates on 200hz, and 400hz, 600hz, 800hz, and so on), and that the strength of each frequency can vary, and that this pattern is what gives each instrument its individual auditory flavour, or timbre. However, nobody's ever rushed out to buy a copy of Now That's What I Call A Mathematically Balanced Series Of Vibrations. Describing music as an external phenomenon is the easy bit; the rest of the book is about describing what happens in the brain when it encounters music, and this is a bit of a challenge because nobody really knows very much about how the brain does anything. Levitin is something of a dualist, taking care to separate out the neurological stuff from the discussions of higher-level cognitive functions, or the hardware from the software, as it were. The software side of things is especially fascinating, mainly because of the things we take for granted which are maddeningly complicated. For example, consider something that people do millions of times each day all over the world, which is to sing ""Happy Birthday"". The process is normally: somebody will pick a note at random, hold it for a second while everyone joins in, and then the entire group will create a new arrangement for the song based on that starting note. We all do this perfectly and without hesitation every time, yet most of us insist that we have no musical ability.Levitin mentions a conversation with a colleague who was studying a remote tribe, and confused everyone by telling them he couldn't sing. To them, singing was like walking and talking, it's just a basic element of normal human existence. The fact that our society has decided that music-making is a restricted activity, only appropriate for experts, is a cultural oddity. Every human has a extraordinary sophisticated understanding of music, as evidenced by a number of studies that Levitin walks us through. Even the ability to have an earworm, annoying as it might be, is a unique cognitive process unlike any other. Music is different from any other kind of stimulus, on a neurological level, because it seems to activate every part of the brain simultaneously. Left and right hemisphere, amygdala and frontal lobes, they all light up when you hear banging choons. Maybe that's why listening to music can be so overwhelming, and carry people out of themselves in a way that no other artform can.Levitin tries to explore the hardware side of things, but is hampered by the fact that nobody truly understands the brain. He attempts to use evolutionary psychology to build a theory about why music pleases us so much, and this is mainly based around how rhythm was an important part of assessing threats in auditory data when we were in the early mammalian stage, and that music gently subverts our expectations of rhythm in a way that tickles us. Is any of that true? I'm always a little suspicious of such explanations. The truth is that this book doesn't offer very many answers, but it asks some fascinating questions that make you realise how miraculous music is. Yes, even Justin Bieber."

Letvin delves into the science behind the human brain and its innate ability to pick up on patterns, recognize variations, and distinguish good versus bad music (a highly subjective topic nonetheless covered well). While the book is intriguing to the reader, Letvin perhaps spends too much time in the depths of musical minushia, at times making the book a rather dry read for those without the knowledge required to appreciate the detail in which he is describing. However, it is certainly captivating to the sort of person with even novice level prior knowledge of music theory. Another shortcoming of the book is the way Letvin seems to get sidetracked throughout the book, allowing himself to get caught up in minute, trivial details of his personal accounts and leaving the reader to make minimally book related inferences. The overall quality of the book is enhanced through its conversion to an audio book, as this is a book about music and reading notes on a page is an entirely different experience than listening to the music samples which coincide with the book content. Letvin does well to offer the reader context in the beginning of the book, by dedicating paragraph by paragraph to definitions of certain music related vocabulary some readers would have otherwise been lost on, such as timbre, contour, reverberation, meter, and pitch. While these words individually make sense to many readers, the lengthy definitions provide more specific detail and serve only to aid Letvin throughout the book. Overall, while the book may at times be a bit dry, anyone with an interest in music theory and how it affects the brain, anyone interested in neuroscience and human obsession, or anyone interested in how these two topics relate to one another will be pleased with this book."

86,0525949690,http://goodreads.com/user/show/31899243-kelli-thompson,1,"I did not finish this book because it's utter crap. As soon as he said that ""all life is sacred"" after a 50 page rant about how he went to Stanford and his half assed attempts and explaining music without actually showing to us, I cannot continue to hear his philosophical opinions about how music connects us to our inner selves. I wanted neuroscience dammit. I got psychology mixed with philosophy. This book feels like his tribute to himself and his own greatness, spending 90 pages to show us exactly one thing that I was interested in. I will seek my information elsewhere. I will likely be able to get twice as much information in a fourth of the space with none of the stupid preaching. "
87,0525949690,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3024716-geoffrey-fox,4,"Hard to believe, but this book is as good as its blurbs. Levitin is both a musician and a neuroscientist, who got into the science to understand better the music he was playing or engineering for rock bands. He knows far more music than I do, drawing on all genres to illustrate what it does, how it does it and why it matters. ""Musical activity involves nearly every region of the brain that we know about, and nearly every neural subsystem."" (pp. 85-86) And, he argues (against Pinker and other skeptics), it is not a superfluous byproduct of evolution, but has been essential to our survival and most probably, as Darwin himself believed, is even older than language.Just how do we remember songs, even when the pitch, rhythm and timbre are all altered? And just what are pitch, rhythm and timbre, and how do they affect our brains? And why do you like heavy metal (or whatever you like), while I … well, many other things? These are just some of the mysteries that scientists are beginning to solve.And what must occur in the brain for a musician to achieve full physical skill (of voice, strings, horn, whatever) and sensibility? It takes at least 10,000 hours of practice, says Levitin, for the brain to achieve complete mastery of anything (auto mechanics, fiction writing, musical composition or performance, or anything else). ""Although people differ in how long it takes them to consolidate information neurally, it remains true that increased practice leads to a greater number of neural traces, which can combine to create a stronger memory representation."" (p. 197) Talent — a genetic predisposition, that difference in learning time he mentions — is a big help, but it's not enough without practice. Levitin's style is lively, his examples well chosen (even though I didn't recognize all the music he expected me to know), and his openness to examining contrary hypotheses makes him a credible guide. I especially appreciated his comments on performance and how a musician learns new pieces, by ""chunking"" — that is, learning whole groups or sequences of chords, melodies, etc. rather than all the individual notes a beginning piano player struggles to memorize. And best of all, the sheer emotion of listening and playing. That's what I want to hold on to as I get back to practicing. And I now have a clearer idea of the ""schema"" to listen for in classic jazz (I sort of knew, but never had it explained before) and how to appreciate the clever transformation Mahler achieves in his Fifth, or what and how Joni Mitchell accomplishes with her alternative guitar tunings. So why four and not five stars? My very personal reaction: the first couple of chapters were too cute and anecdotal, an unnecessary (for me) warm-up for the truly informative, analytical stuff to come. But if you've never thought much about notes or scales or timbre, maybe you'll need that. "
88,0525949690,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5128053-drew-patrick-smith,4,"Review from the PFS Book Club...What I Liked: For a science book that had to deal with two horribly advanced sets of terminology (music terms and anatomy terms), this book was utterly readable. From what could have been a horrible mess of confusion, Levitin manages to create a straight-forward, well-planned book that covers a variety of topics that generally makes sense to the reader. And the bonus is that the book covers topics that your everyday person would find interesting, as his base of musical knowledge is so broad that he can explain the science without talking down to the reader.The breadth of topics broached in this book are also quite impressive, with the 9 chapters divided up into smaller sections. Levitin conveys a lot of information in a short space (the book isn't really that long for nonfiction) and does so with a down-to-earth tone that I think a lot of readers would enjoy. This isn't a professor talking to a student, but rather an expert teaching their friend about what they do.I also truly appreciated the way Levitin looks at both science and music. There's this awe in his tone that must come from the author naturally, because that's the way he feels - there's no guile or trickery-in-style here, just straight-forward love of what he does. And the way he can describe the music of the Beatles, Bach, or Bon Jovi in equal terms is refreshing. All music for Levitin is worthwhile, from prehuman drumming to the atonal madness of the 20th century. And it's that appreciation for his subject that brings this book to a higher level.What I Didn't Like: The book goes by too fast. There's so much in here, that Levitin sometimes does get lost in his topics - going on too long in some sections about music terminology that didn't even grab my attention as a musician or a long discussion on the anatomy of the brain, throwing out way too many words that the average reader won't take the time to understand. When he gets into these pigeon-holed segments, especially in comparison to the other parts of the book where he's so focused, the reader (like me) will start to skim and probably miss something important.Last Thought: If you love music and want to feel smart at a dinner party, this is a good place to go."
89,0525949690,http://goodreads.com/user/show/217489-naeem,2,"I was keen on this book in the beginning for two reasons. First, it give me the basics of music theory 101 in a concise manner. I really needed that. Second, and more important, he went to some length to separate the universal elements of music from the culturally relative aspects. For example, an octave, he argues is a quality of sound itself -- an aspect of the physical world. But how different societies treat octaves depends on their musical traditions. Levitin is very compelling and clear in his explanations. But at some point I grew tired, then annoyed, and then a touch angry. Tired because while Levitin says that he wants to talk NOT about the brain but instead about the mind, he spends most of his energy talking about the brain. For Levitin the mind is the entity that makes the different parts of the brain into a whole. For me, mind is a historical, cultural, and psychological entity. So while I appreciated learning about what brain scientists have done with music, that isn't really where my interests are. Annoyed because, as a former rock musician, engineer, and producer he constantly references artists who are mostly white and north american. He gives examples of music that I consider to be anti-music (a term coined by Mat Callahan in his  Trouble with Music). And finally angry, because, as much as he doesn't want to, and as much as he would be astounded at the my accusation, Levitin produces a book that ignores the fuller world of music. It would be like writing a book on trees that concentrated mostly on trees in north America. Maybe he doesn't know anything else. But I happen to think that a focus on so called hard sciences is actually a way to avoid world politics.Finally, for me, music is tied up with the divine and the sacred. And this too he ignores. "

92,0525949690,http://goodreads.com/user/show/57212992-brooke-bell,4," This nonfiction book was fantastic because it expanded on music broken down to its core and the brain in relation to it. My factual understand of music and the human brain prior to reading this was barely base level but that drastically changed. It fully dove into the concepts, definitions, and cultural aspects of music throughout history. In the process it incorporated how as humans we respond to different cultural situations while bring the information to a level that someone with little understanding could comprehend.  I loved how much my knowledge of music expanded through reading this. At first glance the title could turn people away for as it could seem dry, but the author, Daniel J. Levitin, did an outstanding job writing this novel. This was done by his well thought out placement of stories from his own life or cultural music references. While trying to explain concepts and placing numerous definitions in a novel it is difficult to keep audiences engaged, but Levitin avoided this problem virtually effortlessly.  Another aspect of the book I thoroughly enjoyed learning about was the human brain. While I was very engaged at the mention of big name musicians and bands the end connection always fell back to relation to the brain interaction. Even if the complicated terminology would at times go over my head, I still understood the overall message of the information. Levitin did a wonderful job of addressing the other notable people in his neurological field of study and either agreeing or disagreeing in a well argued manner. All and all his writing style left a pattern of the inability to avoid thinking about the concepts placed before you. The whole book expands your base knowledge but gives you an experience on how music has, is, and still will shape humanity."
93,0525949690,http://goodreads.com/user/show/25309260-allison-soulier,3,"""This is Your Brain on Music: The Science of a Human Obsession"" is written by Daniel J. Levitin. It was published by Dutton Penguin in 2006. It is a science text. I gave it a 3 out of 5 stars because the first few chapters were slow for me because I was bogged down with some many vocabulary terms I was unfamiliar with. However, it picked up towards the end and provided some interesting information. ""This Is Your Brain on Music"" describes the different components of music and makes connections to how the different parts of the brain processes these musical components. A huge focus of the text is on the cognitive processes of music and how they have evolved over time in accordance with musical evolution. The aim of ""This Is Your Brain on Music"" was to make recent findings in cognitive neuroscience of music accessible to the educated layperson. Characteristics and theoretical parameters of music are explained alongside scientific findings about how the brain interprets and processes these characteristics. The neuroanatomy of musical expectation, emotion, listening and performance is discussed. The text is meant for grades 9-12, but I would definitely would not teach it except in the 12th grade, probably an honors class. It almost is more aimed towards college-level reading, however. It's Lexile level is a 1360L and Guided Reading level is a Z. My only teaching idea would be to have students pick an instrument and do a research project based on the different criteria discussed in the book on reasons music connects to the brain (L.11-12.1-1. Demonstrate command of the conventions of standard English grammar and usage whenwriting or speaking.a. Apply the understanding that usage is a matter of convention, can change over time, andis sometimes contested.b. Resolve issues of complex or contested usage, consulting references (e.g., MerriamWebster’sDictionary of English Usage, Garner’s Modern American Usage) as needed.)"
94,0525949690,http://goodreads.com/user/show/8156215-ann,4,"This was an interesting book, even if it may be a bit out of date (2006 copyright): part narrative, part neuroscience part music. The author is able to communicate fairly complex neuroscience in an accessible, yet compelling way. He includes some scientific experiments as well as a diversity of musical and musician examples, adding many of his personal stories as well. There is a useful appendix on brain structures in case you are unfamiliar or rusty on these, and one on musical chords as well.I thought Levitin was a bit off when he claimed that the auditory processing that he does was nothing like what his dog does -- dogs and humans are a bit too close phylogenetically for that and he should know better. I was also surprised that he did not initially make the connection between music and the cerebellum in terms of communication/expression via dance/ritual. It seems to me that one reason we have music is as a fundamental means of communication and the cerebellum would be part of coordinating this through physical movement, etc. Levitin does touch on this later in the book but never actually seems to make this connection, rather he focuses on the possibility of music used in courtship, perhaps a more narrow form communication.At any rate, any one interested in music, brain function, and how the two come together will enjoy this book."
95,0525949690,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3954160-gonza,3,"As usual my super huge expectations didn't help me to appreciate the book as I should, as a little excuse I have to say that as a amateur musician who started to learn a new instrument at 40 I was a little bit pissed off and as a neuroscience aficionados, there were not so much stuff that I didn't know, plus the author rambles a lot. I think it would have been better when there were some sort of playlist on youtube, that we could have follow to switch immediately to audio mode while we were reading the book or more brain related pictures and not only on the appendix, but still it was a worthy reading. Come al solito le mie aspettative troppo alte non mi hanno aiutato ad appezzare il libro come avrei potuto, ma sicuramente da musicista per hobby che ha iniziato a suonare il clarinetto a 40 anni, é possibile che non avrei comunque gradito l'informazione che dopo i 20 anni non c'é trippa per gatti. Inoltre c'era poco contenuto per quanto riguarda la parte neuropsicologica e secondo me troppe chiacchiere dell'autore. Magari anche una piccola playlist su youtube da ascoltare in contemporanea con la lettura del libro avrebbe aiutato e anche qualche immagine migliore del cervello. A parte questo, valeva la pena leggerlo."
96,0525949690,http://goodreads.com/user/show/62352876-richard,5,"WOW - this is a very detailed, informative, and eye-opening examination of what music is and why we are so excited by it. The author, Daniel Levitin, has a wide and varied background - from performing in a high school rock band, to being a successful record producer, to a PhD in the field, to running the Laboratory for Musical Perception, Cognition, and Expertise at McGill University.As Levitin points out, our culture is willing to spend as much money on good concert tickets as would feed a family of four - it is THAT important to us. He then spends nearly three hundred pages explaining why we have evolved in this fashion.Levitin promises to keep the musical jargon down to a minimum so that non-musicians can enjoy and understand the book and he keeps to this pledge. He does spend many pages on the physiology and the inner workings of the human brain that requires quite a bit of concentration and brain power. Luckily, he relates all of this information directly to our understanding and appreciation of music.If you love music, play an instrument, or just want to understand why you can't help tapping your foot to a beat - read this book!"
97,0525949690,http://goodreads.com/user/show/25629613-peter-spung,5,"I loved this book. As a music lover, musician, science geek and one who is filled with wonder about the human condition and curiousity about how everything works, this book appealed to all of my preferences. Our brains are hard wired for music, deep in our old (eg cerebellum) and new (eg cerebral cortex) brains, which evolved over a long period. Music listening and especially learning and performing activate parts and connections all over brains, more than almost any other activity. It promotes or facilitates all kinds of emotions, physical movements, and social interactions. The author explains why, using his own experience as a musician, composer, producer, and now neuroscientist and researcher into the psychology of electronic communication in the Lab for Musical Perception, Cognition and Expertise at McGill University.If you have friends who are curious about the ""why"" of music, and its effects on our cognition and emotions, give them this book. You and they will not regret it.Warning: while reading this, the author Levitin often refers to songs among a wide variety of genres, and you'll want to listen to them as you go."
98,0525949690,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5893251-sally,2,"I learned some interesting facts, yes. But I found myself skimming through much of this without even feeling bad about it. Overall, it was disappointing and I won't be sharing it with my music-loving family, as originally planned.Also: An author's credentials belong on the dust jacket. And I don't need to know the curriculum vitae of every person you mention--If the dust jacket tells me you are an expert, I trust you to only include credible facts from credible individuals!! "
99,0525949690,http://goodreads.com/user/show/9460786-kaitlin,4,"I still don't really think of myself as a musical expert but I have a lot more knowledge than the layperson, so a lot of the descriptions of various concepts were very redundant for me, with both music and biology. However, he pulls together a really interesting set of research in a way that's really readable. One thing I will say is that I'd be interested to see how much has changed and how much more we've learned in the 13 years since this was published - I expect quite a lot."
100,0525949690,http://goodreads.com/user/show/75843534-jason-mccaffrey,5,"I loved this book! I learned as much about music theory as I did about neuroscience. Heavy concepts with lots of associated and necessary jargon somehow delivered in a really easy and accessible way. Levitin mentions early on that he's trying to keep it easy for the layman. And he nails that without ever seeming like he's patronizing. Another reviewer mentioned that this book would be better as a documentary, and I can't disagree with that. I would recommend at least reading with access to a music streaming service at close hand. There are a lot of references to songs by title and artist that are designed to help illustrate the points he's making."
101,0525949690,http://goodreads.com/user/show/18856924-melissa-symanczyk,3,"I went into this expecting it to be the kind of funny, anecdote-stuffed science that Mary Roach writes. Instead, this is clearly a book written by a scientist trying his damndest to walk the fine line between making complex ideas simple enough for a layperson to understand while retaining the actual science, and I think whether it works is going to be largely dependent on the reader. I think a good editor could've tightened it up a bit.The first couple of chapters on basic music theory and vocabulary could have been replaced with a beefy glossary, but once we get into things there are some really interesting revelations. I now have a greater appreciation of the many different ways that music is processed by the brain, and what a unique gift music actually is. Some interesting thoughts on the evolutionary purpose of music as well that I'd never really thought about."

The series was very enjoyable, and in one of the episodes there were interviews with Daniel Levitin, so I bought his book 'This Is Your Brain On Music.'I have to say, though it's not a bad book, it is rather dry, and I did struggle with it. The opening three chapters (as the author observes) can be skipped by anyone reasonably au fait with music, while the rest, which is mostly neurology and brain science, is interesting enough but not terribly engaging. I confess I skipped a few sections.It could be that a book simply isn't the right vehicle for this topic. There was nothing specifically wrong here, but I found the continuing descriptions of brain operation to be a case of diminishing returns. Perhaps the book should be televised.Interesting, then, but arid."

113,0525949690,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7116910-bernard-o-leary,5,"I've got an earworm right now. It's ""Sorry"" by Justin Bieber. Judge me if you like, but if you've know the song then you're probably humming it now too. This may not seem like a big deal, but think about the astonishing cognitive processes that made all of this possible: the ability to hear, to distinguish individual sounds, to detect musical patterns like rhythm, to interact with them on both an intellectual and emotional level, even to start dancing if the mood were to take me. I can ""record"" the song and play it back in my head, as I am doing now, and I could sing it out loud if I felt like it, possibly with a whole new arrangement. How is any of this even possible?Levitin starts his exploration of music by talking about what music actually is, taking us through the terminology of music and looking a little at the physics of music too. For example, I only had a vague understanding of timbre before reading this. I certainly didn't know that instruments resonate simultaneously on multiple frequencies, and that these frequencies are all multiples of each other (i.e. a tuba resonates on 200hz, and 400hz, 600hz, 800hz, and so on), and that the strength of each frequency can vary, and that this pattern is what gives each instrument its individual auditory flavour, or timbre. However, nobody's ever rushed out to buy a copy of Now That's What I Call A Mathematically Balanced Series Of Vibrations. Describing music as an external phenomenon is the easy bit; the rest of the book is about describing what happens in the brain when it encounters music, and this is a bit of a challenge because nobody really knows very much about how the brain does anything. Levitin is something of a dualist, taking care to separate out the neurological stuff from the discussions of higher-level cognitive functions, or the hardware from the software, as it were. The software side of things is especially fascinating, mainly because of the things we take for granted which are maddeningly complicated. For example, consider something that people do millions of times each day all over the world, which is to sing ""Happy Birthday"". The process is normally: somebody will pick a note at random, hold it for a second while everyone joins in, and then the entire group will create a new arrangement for the song based on that starting note. We all do this perfectly and without hesitation every time, yet most of us insist that we have no musical ability.Levitin mentions a conversation with a colleague who was studying a remote tribe, and confused everyone by telling them he couldn't sing. To them, singing was like walking and talking, it's just a basic element of normal human existence. The fact that our society has decided that music-making is a restricted activity, only appropriate for experts, is a cultural oddity. Every human has a extraordinary sophisticated understanding of music, as evidenced by a number of studies that Levitin walks us through. Even the ability to have an earworm, annoying as it might be, is a unique cognitive process unlike any other. Music is different from any other kind of stimulus, on a neurological level, because it seems to activate every part of the brain simultaneously. Left and right hemisphere, amygdala and frontal lobes, they all light up when you hear banging choons. Maybe that's why listening to music can be so overwhelming, and carry people out of themselves in a way that no other artform can.Levitin tries to explore the hardware side of things, but is hampered by the fact that nobody truly understands the brain. He attempts to use evolutionary psychology to build a theory about why music pleases us so much, and this is mainly based around how rhythm was an important part of assessing threats in auditory data when we were in the early mammalian stage, and that music gently subverts our expectations of rhythm in a way that tickles us. Is any of that true? I'm always a little suspicious of such explanations. The truth is that this book doesn't offer very many answers, but it asks some fascinating questions that make you realise how miraculous music is. Yes, even Justin Bieber."

Levitin is both a musician and a neuroscientist, who got into the science to understand better the music he was playing or engineering for rock bands. He knows far more music than I do, drawing on all genres to illustrate what it does, how it does it and why it matters. ""Musical activity involves nearly every region of the brain that we know about, and nearly every neural subsystem."" (pp. 85-86) And, he argues (against Pinker and other skeptics), it is not a superfluous byproduct of evolution, but has been essential to our survival and most probably, as Darwin himself believed, is even older than language.Just how do we remember songs, even when the pitch, rhythm and timbre are all altered? And just what are pitch, rhythm and timbre, and how do they affect our brains? And why do you like heavy metal (or whatever you like), while I … well, many other things? These are just some of the mysteries that scientists are beginning to solve.And what must occur in the brain for a musician to achieve full physical skill (of voice, strings, horn, whatever) and sensibility? It takes at least 10,000 hours of practice, says Levitin, for the brain to achieve complete mastery of anything (auto mechanics, fiction writing, musical composition or performance, or anything else). ""Although people differ in how long it takes them to consolidate information neurally, it remains true that increased practice leads to a greater number of neural traces, which can combine to create a stronger memory representation."" (p. 197) Talent — a genetic predisposition, that difference in learning time he mentions — is a big help, but it's not enough without practice. Levitin's style is lively, his examples well chosen (even though I didn't recognize all the music he expected me to know), and his openness to examining contrary hypotheses makes him a credible guide. I especially appreciated his comments on performance and how a musician learns new pieces, by ""chunking"" — that is, learning whole groups or sequences of chords, melodies, etc. rather than all the individual notes a beginning piano player struggles to memorize. And best of all, the sheer emotion of listening and playing. That's what I want to hold on to as I get back to practicing. And I now have a clearer idea of the ""schema"" to listen for in classic jazz (I sort of knew, but never had it explained before) and how to appreciate the clever transformation Mahler achieves in his Fifth, or what and how Joni Mitchell accomplishes with her alternative guitar tunings. So why four and not five stars? My very personal reaction: the first couple of chapters were too cute and anecdotal, an unnecessary (for me) warm-up for the truly informative, analytical stuff to come. But if you've never thought much about notes or scales or timbre, maybe you'll need that. "
118,0525949690,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5128053-drew-patrick-smith,4,"Review from the PFS Book Club...What I Liked: For a science book that had to deal with two horribly advanced sets of terminology (music terms and anatomy terms), this book was utterly readable. From what could have been a horrible mess of confusion, Levitin manages to create a straight-forward, well-planned book that covers a variety of topics that generally makes sense to the reader. And the bonus is that the book covers topics that your everyday person would find interesting, as his base of musical knowledge is so broad that he can explain the science without talking down to the reader.The breadth of topics broached in this book are also quite impressive, with the 9 chapters divided up into smaller sections. Levitin conveys a lot of information in a short space (the book isn't really that long for nonfiction) and does so with a down-to-earth tone that I think a lot of readers would enjoy. This isn't a professor talking to a student, but rather an expert teaching their friend about what they do.I also truly appreciated the way Levitin looks at both science and music. There's this awe in his tone that must come from the author naturally, because that's the way he feels - there's no guile or trickery-in-style here, just straight-forward love of what he does. And the way he can describe the music of the Beatles, Bach, or Bon Jovi in equal terms is refreshing. All music for Levitin is worthwhile, from prehuman drumming to the atonal madness of the 20th century. And it's that appreciation for his subject that brings this book to a higher level.What I Didn't Like: The book goes by too fast. There's so much in here, that Levitin sometimes does get lost in his topics - going on too long in some sections about music terminology that didn't even grab my attention as a musician or a long discussion on the anatomy of the brain, throwing out way too many words that the average reader won't take the time to understand. When he gets into these pigeon-holed segments, especially in comparison to the other parts of the book where he's so focused, the reader (like me) will start to skim and probably miss something important.Last Thought: If you love music and want to feel smart at a dinner party, this is a good place to go."
119,0525949690,http://goodreads.com/user/show/217489-naeem,2,"I was keen on this book in the beginning for two reasons. First, it give me the basics of music theory 101 in a concise manner. I really needed that. Second, and more important, he went to some length to separate the universal elements of music from the culturally relative aspects. For example, an octave, he argues is a quality of sound itself -- an aspect of the physical world. But how different societies treat octaves depends on their musical traditions. Levitin is very compelling and clear in his explanations. But at some point I grew tired, then annoyed, and then a touch angry. Tired because while Levitin says that he wants to talk NOT about the brain but instead about the mind, he spends most of his energy talking about the brain. For Levitin the mind is the entity that makes the different parts of the brain into a whole. For me, mind is a historical, cultural, and psychological entity. So while I appreciated learning about what brain scientists have done with music, that isn't really where my interests are. Annoyed because, as a former rock musician, engineer, and producer he constantly references artists who are mostly white and north american. He gives examples of music that I consider to be anti-music (a term coined by Mat Callahan in his  Trouble with Music). And finally angry, because, as much as he doesn't want to, and as much as he would be astounded at the my accusation, Levitin produces a book that ignores the fuller world of music. It would be like writing a book on trees that concentrated mostly on trees in north America. Maybe he doesn't know anything else. But I happen to think that a focus on so called hard sciences is actually a way to avoid world politics.Finally, for me, music is tied up with the divine and the sacred. And this too he ignores. "

Did I learn anything nothing that isn't common sense. Good to be reminded though.
121,0525949690,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5-elizabeth,0,I'm loving this book so far. My music teacher was never this clear...
122,0525949690,http://goodreads.com/user/show/57212992-brooke-bell,4," This nonfiction book was fantastic because it expanded on music broken down to its core and the brain in relation to it. My factual understand of music and the human brain prior to reading this was barely base level but that drastically changed. It fully dove into the concepts, definitions, and cultural aspects of music throughout history. In the process it incorporated how as humans we respond to different cultural situations while bring the information to a level that someone with little understanding could comprehend.  I loved how much my knowledge of music expanded through reading this. At first glance the title could turn people away for as it could seem dry, but the author, Daniel J. Levitin, did an outstanding job writing this novel. This was done by his well thought out placement of stories from his own life or cultural music references. While trying to explain concepts and placing numerous definitions in a novel it is difficult to keep audiences engaged, but Levitin avoided this problem virtually effortlessly.  Another aspect of the book I thoroughly enjoyed learning about was the human brain. While I was very engaged at the mention of big name musicians and bands the end connection always fell back to relation to the brain interaction. Even if the complicated terminology would at times go over my head, I still understood the overall message of the information. Levitin did a wonderful job of addressing the other notable people in his neurological field of study and either agreeing or disagreeing in a well argued manner. All and all his writing style left a pattern of the inability to avoid thinking about the concepts placed before you. The whole book expands your base knowledge but gives you an experience on how music has, is, and still will shape humanity."
123,0525949690,http://goodreads.com/user/show/25309260-allison-soulier,3,"""This is Your Brain on Music: The Science of a Human Obsession"" is written by Daniel J. Levitin. It was published by Dutton Penguin in 2006. It is a science text. I gave it a 3 out of 5 stars because the first few chapters were slow for me because I was bogged down with some many vocabulary terms I was unfamiliar with. However, it picked up towards the end and provided some interesting information. ""This Is Your Brain on Music"" describes the different components of music and makes connections to how the different parts of the brain processes these musical components. A huge focus of the text is on the cognitive processes of music and how they have evolved over time in accordance with musical evolution. The aim of ""This Is Your Brain on Music"" was to make recent findings in cognitive neuroscience of music accessible to the educated layperson. Characteristics and theoretical parameters of music are explained alongside scientific findings about how the brain interprets and processes these characteristics. The neuroanatomy of musical expectation, emotion, listening and performance is discussed. The text is meant for grades 9-12, but I would definitely would not teach it except in the 12th grade, probably an honors class. It almost is more aimed towards college-level reading, however. It's Lexile level is a 1360L and Guided Reading level is a Z. My only teaching idea would be to have students pick an instrument and do a research project based on the different criteria discussed in the book on reasons music connects to the brain (L.11-12.1-1. Demonstrate command of the conventions of standard English grammar and usage whenwriting or speaking.a. Apply the understanding that usage is a matter of convention, can change over time, andis sometimes contested.b. Resolve issues of complex or contested usage, consulting references (e.g., MerriamWebster’sDictionary of English Usage, Garner’s Modern American Usage) as needed.)"
124,0525949690,http://goodreads.com/user/show/8156215-ann,4,"This was an interesting book, even if it may be a bit out of date (2006 copyright): part narrative, part neuroscience part music. The author is able to communicate fairly complex neuroscience in an accessible, yet compelling way. He includes some scientific experiments as well as a diversity of musical and musician examples, adding many of his personal stories as well. There is a useful appendix on brain structures in case you are unfamiliar or rusty on these, and one on musical chords as well.I thought Levitin was a bit off when he claimed that the auditory processing that he does was nothing like what his dog does -- dogs and humans are a bit too close phylogenetically for that and he should know better. I was also surprised that he did not initially make the connection between music and the cerebellum in terms of communication/expression via dance/ritual. It seems to me that one reason we have music is as a fundamental means of communication and the cerebellum would be part of coordinating this through physical movement, etc. Levitin does touch on this later in the book but never actually seems to make this connection, rather he focuses on the possibility of music used in courtship, perhaps a more narrow form communication.At any rate, any one interested in music, brain function, and how the two come together will enjoy this book."
125,0525949690,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3954160-gonza,3,"As usual my super huge expectations didn't help me to appreciate the book as I should, as a little excuse I have to say that as a amateur musician who started to learn a new instrument at 40 I was a little bit pissed off and as a neuroscience aficionados, there were not so much stuff that I didn't know, plus the author rambles a lot. I think it would have been better when there were some sort of playlist on youtube, that we could have follow to switch immediately to audio mode while we were reading the book or more brain related pictures and not only on the appendix, but still it was a worthy reading. Come al solito le mie aspettative troppo alte non mi hanno aiutato ad appezzare il libro come avrei potuto, ma sicuramente da musicista per hobby che ha iniziato a suonare il clarinetto a 40 anni, é possibile che non avrei comunque gradito l'informazione che dopo i 20 anni non c'é trippa per gatti. Inoltre c'era poco contenuto per quanto riguarda la parte neuropsicologica e secondo me troppe chiacchiere dell'autore. Magari anche una piccola playlist su youtube da ascoltare in contemporanea con la lettura del libro avrebbe aiutato e anche qualche immagine migliore del cervello. A parte questo, valeva la pena leggerlo."
126,0525949690,http://goodreads.com/user/show/62352876-richard,5,"WOW - this is a very detailed, informative, and eye-opening examination of what music is and why we are so excited by it. The author, Daniel Levitin, has a wide and varied background - from performing in a high school rock band, to being a successful record producer, to a PhD in the field, to running the Laboratory for Musical Perception, Cognition, and Expertise at McGill University.As Levitin points out, our culture is willing to spend as much money on good concert tickets as would feed a family of four - it is THAT important to us. He then spends nearly three hundred pages explaining why we have evolved in this fashion.Levitin promises to keep the musical jargon down to a minimum so that non-musicians can enjoy and understand the book and he keeps to this pledge. He does spend many pages on the physiology and the inner workings of the human brain that requires quite a bit of concentration and brain power. Luckily, he relates all of this information directly to our understanding and appreciation of music.If you love music, play an instrument, or just want to understand why you can't help tapping your foot to a beat - read this book!"
127,0525949690,http://goodreads.com/user/show/25629613-peter-spung,5,"I loved this book. As a music lover, musician, science geek and one who is filled with wonder about the human condition and curiousity about how everything works, this book appealed to all of my preferences. Our brains are hard wired for music, deep in our old (eg cerebellum) and new (eg cerebral cortex) brains, which evolved over a long period. Music listening and especially learning and performing activate parts and connections all over brains, more than almost any other activity. It promotes or facilitates all kinds of emotions, physical movements, and social interactions. The author explains why, using his own experience as a musician, composer, producer, and now neuroscientist and researcher into the psychology of electronic communication in the Lab for Musical Perception, Cognition and Expertise at McGill University.If you have friends who are curious about the ""why"" of music, and its effects on our cognition and emotions, give them this book. You and they will not regret it.Warning: while reading this, the author Levitin often refers to songs among a wide variety of genres, and you'll want to listen to them as you go."
128,0525949690,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5893251-sally,2,"I learned some interesting facts, yes. But I found myself skimming through much of this without even feeling bad about it. Overall, it was disappointing and I won't be sharing it with my music-loving family, as originally planned.Also: An author's credentials belong on the dust jacket. And I don't need to know the curriculum vitae of every person you mention--If the dust jacket tells me you are an expert, I trust you to only include credible facts from credible individuals!! "
129,0525949690,http://goodreads.com/user/show/9460786-kaitlin,4,"I still don't really think of myself as a musical expert but I have a lot more knowledge than the layperson, so a lot of the descriptions of various concepts were very redundant for me, with both music and biology. However, he pulls together a really interesting set of research in a way that's really readable. One thing I will say is that I'd be interested to see how much has changed and how much more we've learned in the 13 years since this was published - I expect quite a lot."
130,0525949690,http://goodreads.com/user/show/75843534-jason-mccaffrey,5,"I loved this book! I learned as much about music theory as I did about neuroscience. Heavy concepts with lots of associated and necessary jargon somehow delivered in a really easy and accessible way. Levitin mentions early on that he's trying to keep it easy for the layman. And he nails that without ever seeming like he's patronizing. Another reviewer mentioned that this book would be better as a documentary, and I can't disagree with that. I would recommend at least reading with access to a music streaming service at close hand. There are a lot of references to songs by title and artist that are designed to help illustrate the points he's making."
131,0525949690,http://goodreads.com/user/show/18856924-melissa-symanczyk,3,"I went into this expecting it to be the kind of funny, anecdote-stuffed science that Mary Roach writes. Instead, this is clearly a book written by a scientist trying his damndest to walk the fine line between making complex ideas simple enough for a layperson to understand while retaining the actual science, and I think whether it works is going to be largely dependent on the reader. I think a good editor could've tightened it up a bit.The first couple of chapters on basic music theory and vocabulary could have been replaced with a beefy glossary, but once we get into things there are some really interesting revelations. I now have a greater appreciation of the many different ways that music is processed by the brain, and what a unique gift music actually is. Some interesting thoughts on the evolutionary purpose of music as well that I'd never really thought about."
132,0525949690,http://goodreads.com/user/show/45791932-paul-edlund,4,"4.5 stars. This book is what would happen if Steven Pinker and Rick Beato had a baby. A fascinating mix of music theory, cognitive psychology, and evolution theory. My only caveat (not the best word, perhaps) is that it was published in 2005 and a LOT of science has happened since then. Guess I'll have to go down that rabbit hole."
133,0525949690,http://goodreads.com/user/show/64922807-gemma-golley,3,"interesting content, but I really wanted to hear about how the brain is affected by music. that only happened in the last part of the book, which is disappointing. the rest was just talking about music theory, which sure, was interesting but it wasn't very engaging."

139,0525949690,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5009036-melody,4,An excellent read on the neuroscience of music. How our brains react to music and how music effects our brains. I enjoyed it greatly and learned a lot.
140,0525949690,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7605433-stephen-palmer,3,"A couple of months ago I watched Stewart Copeland's three-part tv series 'Adventures In Music,' which aimed to get to the heart of what music is and why it means so much to us. The series was very enjoyable, and in one of the episodes there were interviews with Daniel Levitin, so I bought his book 'This Is Your Brain On Music.'I have to say, though it's not a bad book, it is rather dry, and I did struggle with it. The opening three chapters (as the author observes) can be skipped by anyone reasonably au fait with music, while the rest, which is mostly neurology and brain science, is interesting enough but not terribly engaging. I confess I skipped a few sections.It could be that a book simply isn't the right vehicle for this topic. There was nothing specifically wrong here, but I found the continuing descriptions of brain operation to be a case of diminishing returns. Perhaps the book should be televised.Interesting, then, but arid."
141,0525949690,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7864656-claire-b,2,I stopped halfway. It was so technical that I couldn't keep track of everything without listening very intently and I usually listen to audio books while walking or doing chores so I kept missing things and having to rewind. I grew bored quickly. But what I did hear was mildly interesting. I imagine if I had more of an attention span I would have enjoyed it.
142,0525949690,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7136086-stephanie,4,My audiobook version of this went a little wonky towards the end so I am not quite sure how the book ended but this was quite the informative piece on the science behind how we listen to and enjoy music.

143,0525949690,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7116910-bernard-o-leary,5,"I've got an earworm right now. It's ""Sorry"" by Justin Bieber. Judge me if you like, but if you've know the song then you're probably humming it now too. This may not seem like a big deal, but think about the astonishing cognitive processes that made all of this possible: the ability to hear, to distinguish individual sounds, to detect musical patterns like rhythm, to interact with them on both an intellectual and emotional level, even to start dancing if the mood were to take me. I can ""record"" the song and play it back in my head, as I am doing now, and I could sing it out loud if I felt like it, possibly with a whole new arrangement. How is any of this even possible?Levitin starts his exploration of music by talking about what music actually is, taking us through the terminology of music and looking a little at the physics of music too. For example, I only had a vague understanding of timbre before reading this. I certainly didn't know that instruments resonate simultaneously on multiple frequencies, and that these frequencies are all multiples of each other (i.e. a tuba resonates on 200hz, and 400hz, 600hz, 800hz, and so on), and that the strength of each frequency can vary, and that this pattern is what gives each instrument its individual auditory flavour, or timbre. However, nobody's ever rushed out to buy a copy of Now That's What I Call A Mathematically Balanced Series Of Vibrations. Describing music as an external phenomenon is the easy bit; the rest of the book is about describing what happens in the brain when it encounters music, and this is a bit of a challenge because nobody really knows very much about how the brain does anything. Levitin is something of a dualist, taking care to separate out the neurological stuff from the discussions of higher-level cognitive functions, or the hardware from the software, as it were. The software side of things is especially fascinating, mainly because of the things we take for granted which are maddeningly complicated. For example, consider something that people do millions of times each day all over the world, which is to sing ""Happy Birthday"". The process is normally: somebody will pick a note at random, hold it for a second while everyone joins in, and then the entire group will create a new arrangement for the song based on that starting note. We all do this perfectly and without hesitation every time, yet most of us insist that we have no musical ability.Levitin mentions a conversation with a colleague who was studying a remote tribe, and confused everyone by telling them he couldn't sing. To them, singing was like walking and talking, it's just a basic element of normal human existence. The fact that our society has decided that music-making is a restricted activity, only appropriate for experts, is a cultural oddity. Every human has a extraordinary sophisticated understanding of music, as evidenced by a number of studies that Levitin walks us through. Even the ability to have an earworm, annoying as it might be, is a unique cognitive process unlike any other. Music is different from any other kind of stimulus, on a neurological level, because it seems to activate every part of the brain simultaneously. Left and right hemisphere, amygdala and frontal lobes, they all light up when you hear banging choons. Maybe that's why listening to music can be so overwhelming, and carry people out of themselves in a way that no other artform can.Levitin tries to explore the hardware side of things, but is hampered by the fact that nobody truly understands the brain. He attempts to use evolutionary psychology to build a theory about why music pleases us so much, and this is mainly based around how rhythm was an important part of assessing threats in auditory data when we were in the early mammalian stage, and that music gently subverts our expectations of rhythm in a way that tickles us. Is any of that true? I'm always a little suspicious of such explanations. The truth is that this book doesn't offer very many answers, but it asks some fascinating questions that make you realise how miraculous music is. Yes, even Justin Bieber."
144,0525949690,http://goodreads.com/user/show/109224631-brian-fox,3,"This is Your Brain on Music: The Science of a Human Obsession by Daniel J. Letvin delves into the science behind the human brain and its innate ability to pick up on patterns, recognize variations, and distinguish good versus bad music (a highly subjective topic nonetheless covered well). While the book is intriguing to the reader, Letvin perhaps spends too much time in the depths of musical minushia, at times making the book a rather dry read for those without the knowledge required to appreciate the detail in which he is describing. However, it is certainly captivating to the sort of person with even novice level prior knowledge of music theory. Another shortcoming of the book is the way Letvin seems to get sidetracked throughout the book, allowing himself to get caught up in minute, trivial details of his personal accounts and leaving the reader to make minimally book related inferences. The overall quality of the book is enhanced through its conversion to an audio book, as this is a book about music and reading notes on a page is an entirely different experience than listening to the music samples which coincide with the book content. Letvin does well to offer the reader context in the beginning of the book, by dedicating paragraph by paragraph to definitions of certain music related vocabulary some readers would have otherwise been lost on, such as timbre, contour, reverberation, meter, and pitch. While these words individually make sense to many readers, the lengthy definitions provide more specific detail and serve only to aid Letvin throughout the book. Overall, while the book may at times be a bit dry, anyone with an interest in music theory and how it affects the brain, anyone interested in neuroscience and human obsession, or anyone interested in how these two topics relate to one another will be pleased with this book."

As soon as he said that ""all life is sacred"" after a 50 page rant about how he went to Stanford and his half assed attempts and explaining music without actually showing to us, I cannot continue to hear his philosophical opinions about how music connects us to our inner selves. I wanted neuroscience dammit. I got psychology mixed with philosophy. This book feels like his tribute to himself and his own greatness, spending 90 pages to show us exactly one thing that I was interested in. I will seek my information elsewhere. I will likely be able to get twice as much information in a fourth of the space with none of the stupid preaching. "
147,0525949690,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3024716-geoffrey-fox,4,"Hard to believe, but this book is as good as its blurbs. Levitin is both a musician and a neuroscientist, who got into the science to understand better the music he was playing or engineering for rock bands. He knows far more music than I do, drawing on all genres to illustrate what it does, how it does it and why it matters. ""Musical activity involves nearly every region of the brain that we know about, and nearly every neural subsystem."" (pp. 85-86) And, he argues (against Pinker and other skeptics), it is not a superfluous byproduct of evolution, but has been essential to our survival and most probably, as Darwin himself believed, is even older than language.Just how do we remember songs, even when the pitch, rhythm and timbre are all altered? And just what are pitch, rhythm and timbre, and how do they affect our brains? And why do you like heavy metal (or whatever you like), while I … well, many other things? These are just some of the mysteries that scientists are beginning to solve.And what must occur in the brain for a musician to achieve full physical skill (of voice, strings, horn, whatever) and sensibility? It takes at least 10,000 hours of practice, says Levitin, for the brain to achieve complete mastery of anything (auto mechanics, fiction writing, musical composition or performance, or anything else). ""Although people differ in how long it takes them to consolidate information neurally, it remains true that increased practice leads to a greater number of neural traces, which can combine to create a stronger memory representation."" (p. 197) Talent — a genetic predisposition, that difference in learning time he mentions — is a big help, but it's not enough without practice. Levitin's style is lively, his examples well chosen (even though I didn't recognize all the music he expected me to know), and his openness to examining contrary hypotheses makes him a credible guide. I especially appreciated his comments on performance and how a musician learns new pieces, by ""chunking"" — that is, learning whole groups or sequences of chords, melodies, etc. rather than all the individual notes a beginning piano player struggles to memorize. And best of all, the sheer emotion of listening and playing. That's what I want to hold on to as I get back to practicing. And I now have a clearer idea of the ""schema"" to listen for in classic jazz (I sort of knew, but never had it explained before) and how to appreciate the clever transformation Mahler achieves in his Fifth, or what and how Joni Mitchell accomplishes with her alternative guitar tunings. So why four and not five stars? My very personal reaction: the first couple of chapters were too cute and anecdotal, an unnecessary (for me) warm-up for the truly informative, analytical stuff to come. But if you've never thought much about notes or scales or timbre, maybe you'll need that. "
148,0525949690,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5128053-drew-patrick-smith,4,"Review from the PFS Book Club...What I Liked: For a science book that had to deal with two horribly advanced sets of terminology (music terms and anatomy terms), this book was utterly readable. From what could have been a horrible mess of confusion, Levitin manages to create a straight-forward, well-planned book that covers a variety of topics that generally makes sense to the reader. And the bonus is that the book covers topics that your everyday person would find interesting, as his base of musical knowledge is so broad that he can explain the science without talking down to the reader.The breadth of topics broached in this book are also quite impressive, with the 9 chapters divided up into smaller sections. Levitin conveys a lot of information in a short space (the book isn't really that long for nonfiction) and does so with a down-to-earth tone that I think a lot of readers would enjoy. This isn't a professor talking to a student, but rather an expert teaching their friend about what they do.I also truly appreciated the way Levitin looks at both science and music. There's this awe in his tone that must come from the author naturally, because that's the way he feels - there's no guile or trickery-in-style here, just straight-forward love of what he does. And the way he can describe the music of the Beatles, Bach, or Bon Jovi in equal terms is refreshing. All music for Levitin is worthwhile, from prehuman drumming to the atonal madness of the 20th century. And it's that appreciation for his subject that brings this book to a higher level.What I Didn't Like: The book goes by too fast. There's so much in here, that Levitin sometimes does get lost in his topics - going on too long in some sections about music terminology that didn't even grab my attention as a musician or a long discussion on the anatomy of the brain, throwing out way too many words that the average reader won't take the time to understand. When he gets into these pigeon-holed segments, especially in comparison to the other parts of the book where he's so focused, the reader (like me) will start to skim and probably miss something important.Last Thought: If you love music and want to feel smart at a dinner party, this is a good place to go."
149,0525949690,http://goodreads.com/user/show/217489-naeem,2,"I was keen on this book in the beginning for two reasons. First, it give me the basics of music theory 101 in a concise manner. I really needed that. Second, and more important, he went to some length to separate the universal elements of music from the culturally relative aspects. For example, an octave, he argues is a quality of sound itself -- an aspect of the physical world. But how different societies treat octaves depends on their musical traditions. Levitin is very compelling and clear in his explanations. But at some point I grew tired, then annoyed, and then a touch angry. Tired because while Levitin says that he wants to talk NOT about the brain but instead about the mind, he spends most of his energy talking about the brain. For Levitin the mind is the entity that makes the different parts of the brain into a whole. For me, mind is a historical, cultural, and psychological entity. So while I appreciated learning about what brain scientists have done with music, that isn't really where my interests are. Annoyed because, as a former rock musician, engineer, and producer he constantly references artists who are mostly white and north american. He gives examples of music that I consider to be anti-music (a term coined by Mat Callahan in his  Trouble with Music). And finally angry, because, as much as he doesn't want to, and as much as he would be astounded at the my accusation, Levitin produces a book that ignores the fuller world of music. It would be like writing a book on trees that concentrated mostly on trees in north America. Maybe he doesn't know anything else. But I happen to think that a focus on so called hard sciences is actually a way to avoid world politics.Finally, for me, music is tied up with the divine and the sacred. And this too he ignores. "

Did I learn anything nothing that isn't common sense. Good to be reminded though.
151,0525949690,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5-elizabeth,0,I'm loving this book so far. My music teacher was never this clear...
152,0525949690,http://goodreads.com/user/show/57212992-brooke-bell,4," This nonfiction book was fantastic because it expanded on music broken down to its core and the brain in relation to it. My factual understand of music and the human brain prior to reading this was barely base level but that drastically changed. It fully dove into the concepts, definitions, and cultural aspects of music throughout history. In the process it incorporated how as humans we respond to different cultural situations while bring the information to a level that someone with little understanding could comprehend.  I loved how much my knowledge of music expanded through reading this. At first glance the title could turn people away for as it could seem dry, but the author, Daniel J. Levitin, did an outstanding job writing this novel. This was done by his well thought out placement of stories from his own life or cultural music references. While trying to explain concepts and placing numerous definitions in a novel it is difficult to keep audiences engaged, but Levitin avoided this problem virtually effortlessly.  Another aspect of the book I thoroughly enjoyed learning about was the human brain. While I was very engaged at the mention of big name musicians and bands the end connection always fell back to relation to the brain interaction. Even if the complicated terminology would at times go over my head, I still understood the overall message of the information. Levitin did a wonderful job of addressing the other notable people in his neurological field of study and either agreeing or disagreeing in a well argued manner. All and all his writing style left a pattern of the inability to avoid thinking about the concepts placed before you. The whole book expands your base knowledge but gives you an experience on how music has, is, and still will shape humanity."
153,0525949690,http://goodreads.com/user/show/25309260-allison-soulier,3,"""This is Your Brain on Music: The Science of a Human Obsession"" is written by Daniel J. Levitin. It was published by Dutton Penguin in 2006. It is a science text. I gave it a 3 out of 5 stars because the first few chapters were slow for me because I was bogged down with some many vocabulary terms I was unfamiliar with. However, it picked up towards the end and provided some interesting information. ""This Is Your Brain on Music"" describes the different components of music and makes connections to how the different parts of the brain processes these musical components. A huge focus of the text is on the cognitive processes of music and how they have evolved over time in accordance with musical evolution. The aim of ""This Is Your Brain on Music"" was to make recent findings in cognitive neuroscience of music accessible to the educated layperson. Characteristics and theoretical parameters of music are explained alongside scientific findings about how the brain interprets and processes these characteristics. The neuroanatomy of musical expectation, emotion, listening and performance is discussed. The text is meant for grades 9-12, but I would definitely would not teach it except in the 12th grade, probably an honors class. It almost is more aimed towards college-level reading, however. It's Lexile level is a 1360L and Guided Reading level is a Z. My only teaching idea would be to have students pick an instrument and do a research project based on the different criteria discussed in the book on reasons music connects to the brain (L.11-12.1-1. Demonstrate command of the conventions of standard English grammar and usage whenwriting or speaking.a. Apply the understanding that usage is a matter of convention, can change over time, andis sometimes contested.b. Resolve issues of complex or contested usage, consulting references (e.g., MerriamWebster’sDictionary of English Usage, Garner’s Modern American Usage) as needed.)"
154,0525949690,http://goodreads.com/user/show/8156215-ann,4,"This was an interesting book, even if it may be a bit out of date (2006 copyright): part narrative, part neuroscience part music. The author is able to communicate fairly complex neuroscience in an accessible, yet compelling way. He includes some scientific experiments as well as a diversity of musical and musician examples, adding many of his personal stories as well. There is a useful appendix on brain structures in case you are unfamiliar or rusty on these, and one on musical chords as well.I thought Levitin was a bit off when he claimed that the auditory processing that he does was nothing like what his dog does -- dogs and humans are a bit too close phylogenetically for that and he should know better. I was also surprised that he did not initially make the connection between music and the cerebellum in terms of communication/expression via dance/ritual. It seems to me that one reason we have music is as a fundamental means of communication and the cerebellum would be part of coordinating this through physical movement, etc. Levitin does touch on this later in the book but never actually seems to make this connection, rather he focuses on the possibility of music used in courtship, perhaps a more narrow form communication.At any rate, any one interested in music, brain function, and how the two come together will enjoy this book."
155,0525949690,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3954160-gonza,3,"As usual my super huge expectations didn't help me to appreciate the book as I should, as a little excuse I have to say that as a amateur musician who started to learn a new instrument at 40 I was a little bit pissed off and as a neuroscience aficionados, there were not so much stuff that I didn't know, plus the author rambles a lot. I think it would have been better when there were some sort of playlist on youtube, that we could have follow to switch immediately to audio mode while we were reading the book or more brain related pictures and not only on the appendix, but still it was a worthy reading. Come al solito le mie aspettative troppo alte non mi hanno aiutato ad appezzare il libro come avrei potuto, ma sicuramente da musicista per hobby che ha iniziato a suonare il clarinetto a 40 anni, é possibile che non avrei comunque gradito l'informazione che dopo i 20 anni non c'é trippa per gatti. Inoltre c'era poco contenuto per quanto riguarda la parte neuropsicologica e secondo me troppe chiacchiere dell'autore. Magari anche una piccola playlist su youtube da ascoltare in contemporanea con la lettura del libro avrebbe aiutato e anche qualche immagine migliore del cervello. A parte questo, valeva la pena leggerlo."
156,0525949690,http://goodreads.com/user/show/62352876-richard,5,"WOW - this is a very detailed, informative, and eye-opening examination of what music is and why we are so excited by it. The author, Daniel Levitin, has a wide and varied background - from performing in a high school rock band, to being a successful record producer, to a PhD in the field, to running the Laboratory for Musical Perception, Cognition, and Expertise at McGill University.As Levitin points out, our culture is willing to spend as much money on good concert tickets as would feed a family of four - it is THAT important to us. He then spends nearly three hundred pages explaining why we have evolved in this fashion.Levitin promises to keep the musical jargon down to a minimum so that non-musicians can enjoy and understand the book and he keeps to this pledge. He does spend many pages on the physiology and the inner workings of the human brain that requires quite a bit of concentration and brain power. Luckily, he relates all of this information directly to our understanding and appreciation of music.If you love music, play an instrument, or just want to understand why you can't help tapping your foot to a beat - read this book!"
157,0525949690,http://goodreads.com/user/show/25629613-peter-spung,5,"I loved this book. As a music lover, musician, science geek and one who is filled with wonder about the human condition and curiousity about how everything works, this book appealed to all of my preferences. Our brains are hard wired for music, deep in our old (eg cerebellum) and new (eg cerebral cortex) brains, which evolved over a long period. Music listening and especially learning and performing activate parts and connections all over brains, more than almost any other activity. It promotes or facilitates all kinds of emotions, physical movements, and social interactions. The author explains why, using his own experience as a musician, composer, producer, and now neuroscientist and researcher into the psychology of electronic communication in the Lab for Musical Perception, Cognition and Expertise at McGill University.If you have friends who are curious about the ""why"" of music, and its effects on our cognition and emotions, give them this book. You and they will not regret it.Warning: while reading this, the author Levitin often refers to songs among a wide variety of genres, and you'll want to listen to them as you go."
158,0525949690,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5893251-sally,2,"I learned some interesting facts, yes. But I found myself skimming through much of this without even feeling bad about it. Overall, it was disappointing and I won't be sharing it with my music-loving family, as originally planned.Also: An author's credentials belong on the dust jacket. And I don't need to know the curriculum vitae of every person you mention--If the dust jacket tells me you are an expert, I trust you to only include credible facts from credible individuals!! "
159,0525949690,http://goodreads.com/user/show/9460786-kaitlin,4,"I still don't really think of myself as a musical expert but I have a lot more knowledge than the layperson, so a lot of the descriptions of various concepts were very redundant for me, with both music and biology. However, he pulls together a really interesting set of research in a way that's really readable. One thing I will say is that I'd be interested to see how much has changed and how much more we've learned in the 13 years since this was published - I expect quite a lot."
160,0525949690,http://goodreads.com/user/show/75843534-jason-mccaffrey,5,"I loved this book! I learned as much about music theory as I did about neuroscience. Heavy concepts with lots of associated and necessary jargon somehow delivered in a really easy and accessible way. Levitin mentions early on that he's trying to keep it easy for the layman. And he nails that without ever seeming like he's patronizing. Another reviewer mentioned that this book would be better as a documentary, and I can't disagree with that. I would recommend at least reading with access to a music streaming service at close hand. There are a lot of references to songs by title and artist that are designed to help illustrate the points he's making."
161,0525949690,http://goodreads.com/user/show/18856924-melissa-symanczyk,3,"I went into this expecting it to be the kind of funny, anecdote-stuffed science that Mary Roach writes. Instead, this is clearly a book written by a scientist trying his damndest to walk the fine line between making complex ideas simple enough for a layperson to understand while retaining the actual science, and I think whether it works is going to be largely dependent on the reader. I think a good editor could've tightened it up a bit.The first couple of chapters on basic music theory and vocabulary could have been replaced with a beefy glossary, but once we get into things there are some really interesting revelations. I now have a greater appreciation of the many different ways that music is processed by the brain, and what a unique gift music actually is. Some interesting thoughts on the evolutionary purpose of music as well that I'd never really thought about."
162,0525949690,http://goodreads.com/user/show/45791932-paul-edlund,4,"4.5 stars. This book is what would happen if Steven Pinker and Rick Beato had a baby. A fascinating mix of music theory, cognitive psychology, and evolution theory. My only caveat (not the best word, perhaps) is that it was published in 2005 and a LOT of science has happened since then. Guess I'll have to go down that rabbit hole."
163,0525949690,http://goodreads.com/user/show/64922807-gemma-golley,3,"interesting content, but I really wanted to hear about how the brain is affected by music. that only happened in the last part of the book, which is disappointing. the rest was just talking about music theory, which sure, was interesting but it wasn't very engaging."
164,0525949690,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1024517-rachel,4,Fabulous book; even better to read and come across a study by future SIL!

169,0525949690,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5009036-melody,4,An excellent read on the neuroscience of music. How our brains react to music and how music effects our brains. I enjoyed it greatly and learned a lot.
170,0525949690,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7605433-stephen-palmer,3,"A couple of months ago I watched Stewart Copeland's three-part tv series 'Adventures In Music,' which aimed to get to the heart of what music is and why it means so much to us. The series was very enjoyable, and in one of the episodes there were interviews with Daniel Levitin, so I bought his book 'This Is Your Brain On Music.'I have to say, though it's not a bad book, it is rather dry, and I did struggle with it. The opening three chapters (as the author observes) can be skipped by anyone reasonably au fait with music, while the rest, which is mostly neurology and brain science, is interesting enough but not terribly engaging. I confess I skipped a few sections.It could be that a book simply isn't the right vehicle for this topic. There was nothing specifically wrong here, but I found the continuing descriptions of brain operation to be a case of diminishing returns. Perhaps the book should be televised.Interesting, then, but arid."
171,0525949690,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7864656-claire-b,2,I stopped halfway. It was so technical that I couldn't keep track of everything without listening very intently and I usually listen to audio books while walking or doing chores so I kept missing things and having to rewind. I grew bored quickly. But what I did hear was mildly interesting. I imagine if I had more of an attention span I would have enjoyed it.
172,0525949690,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7136086-stephanie,4,My audiobook version of this went a little wonky towards the end so I am not quite sure how the book ended but this was quite the informative piece on the science behind how we listen to and enjoy music. I learned quite a bit from this book. It was much more in depth than I was expecting. 
173,0525949690,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7116910-bernard-o-leary,5,"I've got an earworm right now. It's ""Sorry"" by Justin Bieber. Judge me if you like, but if you've know the song then you're probably humming it now too. This may not seem like a big deal, but think about the astonishing cognitive processes that made all of this possible: the ability to hear, to distinguish individual sounds, to detect musical patterns like rhythm, to interact with them on both an intellectual and emotional level, even to start dancing if the mood were to take me. I can ""record"" the song and play it back in my head, as I am doing now, and I could sing it out loud if I felt like it, possibly with a whole new arrangement. How is any of this even possible?Levitin starts his exploration of music by talking about what music actually is, taking us through the terminology of music and looking a little at the physics of music too. For example, I only had a vague understanding of timbre before reading this. I certainly didn't know that instruments resonate simultaneously on multiple frequencies, and that these frequencies are all multiples of each other (i.e. a tuba resonates on 200hz, and 400hz, 600hz, 800hz, and so on), and that the strength of each frequency can vary, and that this pattern is what gives each instrument its individual auditory flavour, or timbre. However, nobody's ever rushed out to buy a copy of Now That's What I Call A Mathematically Balanced Series Of Vibrations. Describing music as an external phenomenon is the easy bit; the rest of the book is about describing what happens in the brain when it encounters music, and this is a bit of a challenge because nobody really knows very much about how the brain does anything. Levitin is something of a dualist, taking care to separate out the neurological stuff from the discussions of higher-level cognitive functions, or the hardware from the software, as it were. The software side of things is especially fascinating, mainly because of the things we take for granted which are maddeningly complicated. For example, consider something that people do millions of times each day all over the world, which is to sing ""Happy Birthday"". The process is normally: somebody will pick a note at random, hold it for a second while everyone joins in, and then the entire group will create a new arrangement for the song based on that starting note. We all do this perfectly and without hesitation every time, yet most of us insist that we have no musical ability.Levitin mentions a conversation with a colleague who was studying a remote tribe, and confused everyone by telling them he couldn't sing. To them, singing was like walking and talking, it's just a basic element of normal human existence. The fact that our society has decided that music-making is a restricted activity, only appropriate for experts, is a cultural oddity. Every human has a extraordinary sophisticated understanding of music, as evidenced by a number of studies that Levitin walks us through. Even the ability to have an earworm, annoying as it might be, is a unique cognitive process unlike any other. Music is different from any other kind of stimulus, on a neurological level, because it seems to activate every part of the brain simultaneously. Left and right hemisphere, amygdala and frontal lobes, they all light up when you hear banging choons. Maybe that's why listening to music can be so overwhelming, and carry people out of themselves in a way that no other artform can.Levitin tries to explore the hardware side of things, but is hampered by the fact that nobody truly understands the brain. He attempts to use evolutionary psychology to build a theory about why music pleases us so much, and this is mainly based around how rhythm was an important part of assessing threats in auditory data when we were in the early mammalian stage, and that music gently subverts our expectations of rhythm in a way that tickles us. Is any of that true? I'm always a little suspicious of such explanations. The truth is that this book doesn't offer very many answers, but it asks some fascinating questions that make you realise how miraculous music is. Yes, even Justin Bieber."
174,0525949690,http://goodreads.com/user/show/109224631-brian-fox,3,"This is Your Brain on Music: The Science of a Human Obsession by Daniel J. Letvin delves into the science behind the human brain and its innate ability to pick up on patterns, recognize variations, and distinguish good versus bad music (a highly subjective topic nonetheless covered well). While the book is intriguing to the reader, Letvin perhaps spends too much time in the depths of musical minushia, at times making the book a rather dry read for those without the knowledge required to appreciate the detail in which he is describing. However, it is certainly captivating to the sort of person with even novice level prior knowledge of music theory. Another shortcoming of the book is the way Letvin seems to get sidetracked throughout the book, allowing himself to get caught up in minute, trivial details of his personal accounts and leaving the reader to make minimally book related inferences. The overall quality of the book is enhanced through its conversion to an audio book, as this is a book about music and reading notes on a page is an entirely different experience than listening to the music samples which coincide with the book content. Letvin does well to offer the reader context in the beginning of the book, by dedicating paragraph by paragraph to definitions of certain music related vocabulary some readers would have otherwise been lost on, such as timbre, contour, reverberation, meter, and pitch. While these words individually make sense to many readers, the lengthy definitions provide more specific detail and serve only to aid Letvin throughout the book. Overall, while the book may at times be a bit dry, anyone with an interest in music theory and how it affects the brain, anyone interested in neuroscience and human obsession, or anyone interested in how these two topics relate to one another will be pleased with this book."
175,0525949690,http://goodreads.com/user/show/33412063-minh,4,Took me years to finish this but I'll probably read it again.
176,0525949690,http://goodreads.com/user/show/31899243-kelli-thompson,1,"I did not finish this book because it's utter crap. As soon as he said that ""all life is sacred"" after a 50 page rant about how he went to Stanford and his half assed attempts and explaining music without actually showing to us, I cannot continue to hear his philosophical opinions about how music connects us to our inner selves. I wanted neuroscience dammit. I got psychology mixed with philosophy. This book feels like his tribute to himself and his own greatness, spending 90 pages to show us exactly one thing that I was interested in. I will seek my information elsewhere. I will likely be able to get twice as much information in a fourth of the space with none of the stupid preaching. "
177,0525949690,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3024716-geoffrey-fox,4,"Hard to believe, but this book is as good as its blurbs. Levitin is both a musician and a neuroscientist, who got into the science to understand better the music he was playing or engineering for rock bands. He knows far more music than I do, drawing on all genres to illustrate what it does, how it does it and why it matters. ""Musical activity involves nearly every region of the brain that we know about, and nearly every neural subsystem."" (pp. 85-86) And, he argues (against Pinker and other skeptics), it is not a superfluous byproduct of evolution, but has been essential to our survival and most probably, as Darwin himself believed, is even older than language.Just how do we remember songs, even when the pitch, rhythm and timbre are all altered? And just what are pitch, rhythm and timbre, and how do they affect our brains? And why do you like heavy metal (or whatever you like), while I … well, many other things? These are just some of the mysteries that scientists are beginning to solve.And what must occur in the brain for a musician to achieve full physical skill (of voice, strings, horn, whatever) and sensibility? It takes at least 10,000 hours of practice, says Levitin, for the brain to achieve complete mastery of anything (auto mechanics, fiction writing, musical composition or performance, or anything else). ""Although people differ in how long it takes them to consolidate information neurally, it remains true that increased practice leads to a greater number of neural traces, which can combine to create a stronger memory representation."" (p. 197) Talent — a genetic predisposition, that difference in learning time he mentions — is a big help, but it's not enough without practice. Levitin's style is lively, his examples well chosen (even though I didn't recognize all the music he expected me to know), and his openness to examining contrary hypotheses makes him a credible guide. I especially appreciated his comments on performance and how a musician learns new pieces, by ""chunking"" — that is, learning whole groups or sequences of chords, melodies, etc. rather than all the individual notes a beginning piano player struggles to memorize. And best of all, the sheer emotion of listening and playing. That's what I want to hold on to as I get back to practicing. And I now have a clearer idea of the ""schema"" to listen for in classic jazz (I sort of knew, but never had it explained before) and how to appreciate the clever transformation Mahler achieves in his Fifth, or what and how Joni Mitchell accomplishes with her alternative guitar tunings. So why four and not five stars? My very personal reaction: the first couple of chapters were too cute and anecdotal, an unnecessary (for me) warm-up for the truly informative, analytical stuff to come. But if you've never thought much about notes or scales or timbre, maybe you'll need that. "
178,0525949690,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5128053-drew-patrick-smith,4,"Review from the PFS Book Club...What I Liked: For a science book that had to deal with two horribly advanced sets of terminology (music terms and anatomy terms), this book was utterly readable. From what could have been a horrible mess of confusion, Levitin manages to create a straight-forward, well-planned book that covers a variety of topics that generally makes sense to the reader. And the bonus is that the book covers topics that your everyday person would find interesting, as his base of musical knowledge is so broad that he can explain the science without talking down to the reader.The breadth of topics broached in this book are also quite impressive, with the 9 chapters divided up into smaller sections. Levitin conveys a lot of information in a short space (the book isn't really that long for nonfiction) and does so with a down-to-earth tone that I think a lot of readers would enjoy. This isn't a professor talking to a student, but rather an expert teaching their friend about what they do.I also truly appreciated the way Levitin looks at both science and music. There's this awe in his tone that must come from the author naturally, because that's the way he feels - there's no guile or trickery-in-style here, just straight-forward love of what he does. And the way he can describe the music of the Beatles, Bach, or Bon Jovi in equal terms is refreshing. All music for Levitin is worthwhile, from prehuman drumming to the atonal madness of the 20th century. And it's that appreciation for his subject that brings this book to a higher level.What I Didn't Like: The book goes by too fast. There's so much in here, that Levitin sometimes does get lost in his topics - going on too long in some sections about music terminology that didn't even grab my attention as a musician or a long discussion on the anatomy of the brain, throwing out way too many words that the average reader won't take the time to understand. When he gets into these pigeon-holed segments, especially in comparison to the other parts of the book where he's so focused, the reader (like me) will start to skim and probably miss something important.Last Thought: If you love music and want to feel smart at a dinner party, this is a good place to go."

Levitin is very compelling and clear in his explanations. But at some point I grew tired, then annoyed, and then a touch angry. Tired because while Levitin says that he wants to talk NOT about the brain but instead about the mind, he spends most of his energy talking about the brain. For Levitin the mind is the entity that makes the different parts of the brain into a whole. For me, mind is a historical, cultural, and psychological entity. So while I appreciated learning about what brain scientists have done with music, that isn't really where my interests are. Annoyed because, as a former rock musician, engineer, and producer he constantly references artists who are mostly white and north american. He gives examples of music that I consider to be anti-music (a term coined by Mat Callahan in his  Trouble with Music). And finally angry, because, as much as he doesn't want to, and as much as he would be astounded at the my accusation, Levitin produces a book that ignores the fuller world of music. It would be like writing a book on trees that concentrated mostly on trees in north America. Maybe he doesn't know anything else. But I happen to think that a focus on so called hard sciences is actually a way to avoid world politics.Finally, for me, music is tied up with the divine and the sacred. And this too he ignores. "

181,0525949690,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5-elizabeth,0,I'm loving this book so far. My music teacher was never this clear...
182,0525949690,http://goodreads.com/user/show/57212992-brooke-bell,4," This nonfiction book was fantastic because it expanded on music broken down to its core and the brain in relation to it. My factual understand of music and the human brain prior to reading this was barely base level but that drastically changed. It fully dove into the concepts, definitions, and cultural aspects of music throughout history. In the process it incorporated how as humans we respond to different cultural situations while bring the information to a level that someone with little understanding could comprehend.  I loved how much my knowledge of music expanded through reading this. At first glance the title could turn people away for as it could seem dry, but the author, Daniel J. Levitin, did an outstanding job writing this novel. This was done by his well thought out placement of stories from his own life or cultural music references. While trying to explain concepts and placing numerous definitions in a novel it is difficult to keep audiences engaged, but Levitin avoided this problem virtually effortlessly.  Another aspect of the book I thoroughly enjoyed learning about was the human brain. While I was very engaged at the mention of big name musicians and bands the end connection always fell back to relation to the brain interaction. Even if the complicated terminology would at times go over my head, I still understood the overall message of the information. Levitin did a wonderful job of addressing the other notable people in his neurological field of study and either agreeing or disagreeing in a well argued manner. All and all his writing style left a pattern of the inability to avoid thinking about the concepts placed before you. The whole book expands your base knowledge but gives you an experience on how music has, is, and still will shape humanity."
183,0525949690,http://goodreads.com/user/show/25309260-allison-soulier,3,"""This is Your Brain on Music: The Science of a Human Obsession"" is written by Daniel J. Levitin. It was published by Dutton Penguin in 2006. It is a science text. I gave it a 3 out of 5 stars because the first few chapters were slow for me because I was bogged down with some many vocabulary terms I was unfamiliar with. However, it picked up towards the end and provided some interesting information. ""This Is Your Brain on Music"" describes the different components of music and makes connections to how the different parts of the brain processes these musical components. A huge focus of the text is on the cognitive processes of music and how they have evolved over time in accordance with musical evolution. The aim of ""This Is Your Brain on Music"" was to make recent findings in cognitive neuroscience of music accessible to the educated layperson. Characteristics and theoretical parameters of music are explained alongside scientific findings about how the brain interprets and processes these characteristics. The neuroanatomy of musical expectation, emotion, listening and performance is discussed. The text is meant for grades 9-12, but I would definitely would not teach it except in the 12th grade, probably an honors class. It almost is more aimed towards college-level reading, however. It's Lexile level is a 1360L and Guided Reading level is a Z. My only teaching idea would be to have students pick an instrument and do a research project based on the different criteria discussed in the book on reasons music connects to the brain (L.11-12.1-1. Demonstrate command of the conventions of standard English grammar and usage whenwriting or speaking.a. Apply the understanding that usage is a matter of convention, can change over time, andis sometimes contested.b. Resolve issues of complex or contested usage, consulting references (e.g., MerriamWebster’sDictionary of English Usage, Garner’s Modern American Usage) as needed.)"
184,0525949690,http://goodreads.com/user/show/8156215-ann,4,"This was an interesting book, even if it may be a bit out of date (2006 copyright): part narrative, part neuroscience part music. The author is able to communicate fairly complex neuroscience in an accessible, yet compelling way. He includes some scientific experiments as well as a diversity of musical and musician examples, adding many of his personal stories as well. There is a useful appendix on brain structures in case you are unfamiliar or rusty on these, and one on musical chords as well.I thought Levitin was a bit off when he claimed that the auditory processing that he does was nothing like what his dog does -- dogs and humans are a bit too close phylogenetically for that and he should know better. I was also surprised that he did not initially make the connection between music and the cerebellum in terms of communication/expression via dance/ritual. It seems to me that one reason we have music is as a fundamental means of communication and the cerebellum would be part of coordinating this through physical movement, etc. Levitin does touch on this later in the book but never actually seems to make this connection, rather he focuses on the possibility of music used in courtship, perhaps a more narrow form communication.At any rate, any one interested in music, brain function, and how the two come together will enjoy this book."
185,0525949690,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3954160-gonza,3,"As usual my super huge expectations didn't help me to appreciate the book as I should, as a little excuse I have to say that as a amateur musician who started to learn a new instrument at 40 I was a little bit pissed off and as a neuroscience aficionados, there were not so much stuff that I didn't know, plus the author rambles a lot. I think it would have been better when there were some sort of playlist on youtube, that we could have follow to switch immediately to audio mode while we were reading the book or more brain related pictures and not only on the appendix, but still it was a worthy reading. Come al solito le mie aspettative troppo alte non mi hanno aiutato ad appezzare il libro come avrei potuto, ma sicuramente da musicista per hobby che ha iniziato a suonare il clarinetto a 40 anni, é possibile che non avrei comunque gradito l'informazione che dopo i 20 anni non c'é trippa per gatti. Inoltre c'era poco contenuto per quanto riguarda la parte neuropsicologica e secondo me troppe chiacchiere dell'autore. Magari anche una piccola playlist su youtube da ascoltare in contemporanea con la lettura del libro avrebbe aiutato e anche qualche immagine migliore del cervello. A parte questo, valeva la pena leggerlo."
186,0525949690,http://goodreads.com/user/show/62352876-richard,5,"WOW - this is a very detailed, informative, and eye-opening examination of what music is and why we are so excited by it. The author, Daniel Levitin, has a wide and varied background - from performing in a high school rock band, to being a successful record producer, to a PhD in the field, to running the Laboratory for Musical Perception, Cognition, and Expertise at McGill University.As Levitin points out, our culture is willing to spend as much money on good concert tickets as would feed a family of four - it is THAT important to us. He then spends nearly three hundred pages explaining why we have evolved in this fashion.Levitin promises to keep the musical jargon down to a minimum so that non-musicians can enjoy and understand the book and he keeps to this pledge. He does spend many pages on the physiology and the inner workings of the human brain that requires quite a bit of concentration and brain power. Luckily, he relates all of this information directly to our understanding and appreciation of music.If you love music, play an instrument, or just want to understand why you can't help tapping your foot to a beat - read this book!"
187,0525949690,http://goodreads.com/user/show/25629613-peter-spung,5,"I loved this book. As a music lover, musician, science geek and one who is filled with wonder about the human condition and curiousity about how everything works, this book appealed to all of my preferences. Our brains are hard wired for music, deep in our old (eg cerebellum) and new (eg cerebral cortex) brains, which evolved over a long period. Music listening and especially learning and performing activate parts and connections all over brains, more than almost any other activity. It promotes or facilitates all kinds of emotions, physical movements, and social interactions. The author explains why, using his own experience as a musician, composer, producer, and now neuroscientist and researcher into the psychology of electronic communication in the Lab for Musical Perception, Cognition and Expertise at McGill University.If you have friends who are curious about the ""why"" of music, and its effects on our cognition and emotions, give them this book. You and they will not regret it.Warning: while reading this, the author Levitin often refers to songs among a wide variety of genres, and you'll want to listen to them as you go."
188,0525949690,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5893251-sally,2,"I learned some interesting facts, yes. But I found myself skimming through much of this without even feeling bad about it. Overall, it was disappointing and I won't be sharing it with my music-loving family, as originally planned.Also: An author's credentials belong on the dust jacket. And I don't need to know the curriculum vitae of every person you mention--If the dust jacket tells me you are an expert, I trust you to only include credible facts from credible individuals!! "
189,0525949690,http://goodreads.com/user/show/9460786-kaitlin,4,"I still don't really think of myself as a musical expert but I have a lot more knowledge than the layperson, so a lot of the descriptions of various concepts were very redundant for me, with both music and biology. However, he pulls together a really interesting set of research in a way that's really readable. One thing I will say is that I'd be interested to see how much has changed and how much more we've learned in the 13 years since this was published - I expect quite a lot."
190,0525949690,http://goodreads.com/user/show/75843534-jason-mccaffrey,5,"I loved this book! I learned as much about music theory as I did about neuroscience. Heavy concepts with lots of associated and necessary jargon somehow delivered in a really easy and accessible way. Levitin mentions early on that he's trying to keep it easy for the layman. And he nails that without ever seeming like he's patronizing. Another reviewer mentioned that this book would be better as a documentary, and I can't disagree with that. I would recommend at least reading with access to a music streaming service at close hand. There are a lot of references to songs by title and artist that are designed to help illustrate the points he's making."
191,0525949690,http://goodreads.com/user/show/18856924-melissa-symanczyk,3,"I went into this expecting it to be the kind of funny, anecdote-stuffed science that Mary Roach writes. Instead, this is clearly a book written by a scientist trying his damndest to walk the fine line between making complex ideas simple enough for a layperson to understand while retaining the actual science, and I think whether it works is going to be largely dependent on the reader. I think a good editor could've tightened it up a bit.The first couple of chapters on basic music theory and vocabulary could have been replaced with a beefy glossary, but once we get into things there are some really interesting revelations. I now have a greater appreciation of the many different ways that music is processed by the brain, and what a unique gift music actually is. Some interesting thoughts on the evolutionary purpose of music as well that I'd never really thought about."
192,0525949690,http://goodreads.com/user/show/45791932-paul-edlund,4,"4.5 stars. This book is what would happen if Steven Pinker and Rick Beato had a baby. A fascinating mix of music theory, cognitive psychology, and evolution theory. My only caveat (not the best word, perhaps) is that it was published in 2005 and a LOT of science has happened since then. Guess I'll have to go down that rabbit hole."
193,0525949690,http://goodreads.com/user/show/64922807-gemma-golley,3,"interesting content, but I really wanted to hear about how the brain is affected by music. that only happened in the last part of the book, which is disappointing. the rest was just talking about music theory, which sure, was interesting but it wasn't very engaging."

199,0525949690,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5009036-melody,4,An excellent read on the neuroscience of music. How our brains react to music and how music effects our brains. I enjoyed it greatly and learned a lot.
200,0525949690,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7605433-stephen-palmer,3,"A couple of months ago I watched Stewart Copeland's three-part tv series 'Adventures In Music,' which aimed to get to the heart of what music is and why it means so much to us. The series was very enjoyable, and in one of the episodes there were interviews with Daniel Levitin, so I bought his book 'This Is Your Brain On Music.'I have to say, though it's not a bad book, it is rather dry, and I did struggle with it. The opening three chapters (as the author observes) can be skipped by anyone reasonably au fait with music, while the rest, which is mostly neurology and brain science, is interesting enough but not terribly engaging. I confess I skipped a few sections.It could be that a book simply isn't the right vehicle for this topic. There was nothing specifically wrong here, but I found the continuing descriptions of brain operation to be a case of diminishing returns. Perhaps the book should be televised.Interesting, then, but arid."
201,0525949690,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7864656-claire-b,2,I stopped halfway. It was so technical that I couldn't keep track of everything without listening very intently and I usually listen to audio books while walking or doing chores so I kept missing things and having to rewind. I grew bored quickly. But what I did hear was mildly interesting. I imagine if I had more of an attention span I would have enjoyed it.
202,0525949690,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7136086-stephanie,4,My audiobook version of this went a little wonky towards the end so I am not quite sure how the book ended but this was quite the informative piece on the science behind how we listen to and enjoy music. I learned quite a bit from this book. It was much more in depth than I was expecting. 
203,0525949690,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7116910-bernard-o-leary,5,"I've got an earworm right now. It's ""Sorry"" by Justin Bieber. Judge me if you like, but if you've know the song then you're probably humming it now too. This may not seem like a big deal, but think about the astonishing cognitive processes that made all of this possible: the ability to hear, to distinguish individual sounds, to detect musical patterns like rhythm, to interact with them on both an intellectual and emotional level, even to start dancing if the mood were to take me. I can ""record"" the song and play it back in my head, as I am doing now, and I could sing it out loud if I felt like it, possibly with a whole new arrangement. How is any of this even possible?Levitin starts his exploration of music by talking about what music actually is, taking us through the terminology of music and looking a little at the physics of music too. For example, I only had a vague understanding of timbre before reading this. I certainly didn't know that instruments resonate simultaneously on multiple frequencies, and that these frequencies are all multiples of each other (i.e. a tuba resonates on 200hz, and 400hz, 600hz, 800hz, and so on), and that the strength of each frequency can vary, and that this pattern is what gives each instrument its individual auditory flavour, or timbre. However, nobody's ever rushed out to buy a copy of Now That's What I Call A Mathematically Balanced Series Of Vibrations. Describing music as an external phenomenon is the easy bit; the rest of the book is about describing what happens in the brain when it encounters music, and this is a bit of a challenge because nobody really knows very much about how the brain does anything. Levitin is something of a dualist, taking care to separate out the neurological stuff from the discussions of higher-level cognitive functions, or the hardware from the software, as it were. The software side of things is especially fascinating, mainly because of the things we take for granted which are maddeningly complicated. For example, consider something that people do millions of times each day all over the world, which is to sing ""Happy Birthday"". The process is normally: somebody will pick a note at random, hold it for a second while everyone joins in, and then the entire group will create a new arrangement for the song based on that starting note. We all do this perfectly and without hesitation every time, yet most of us insist that we have no musical ability.Levitin mentions a conversation with a colleague who was studying a remote tribe, and confused everyone by telling them he couldn't sing. To them, singing was like walking and talking, it's just a basic element of normal human existence. The fact that our society has decided that music-making is a restricted activity, only appropriate for experts, is a cultural oddity. Every human has a extraordinary sophisticated understanding of music, as evidenced by a number of studies that Levitin walks us through. Even the ability to have an earworm, annoying as it might be, is a unique cognitive process unlike any other. Music is different from any other kind of stimulus, on a neurological level, because it seems to activate every part of the brain simultaneously. Left and right hemisphere, amygdala and frontal lobes, they all light up when you hear banging choons. Maybe that's why listening to music can be so overwhelming, and carry people out of themselves in a way that no other artform can.Levitin tries to explore the hardware side of things, but is hampered by the fact that nobody truly understands the brain. He attempts to use evolutionary psychology to build a theory about why music pleases us so much, and this is mainly based around how rhythm was an important part of assessing threats in auditory data when we were in the early mammalian stage, and that music gently subverts our expectations of rhythm in a way that tickles us. Is any of that true? I'm always a little suspicious of such explanations. The truth is that this book doesn't offer very many answers, but it asks some fascinating questions that make you realise how miraculous music is. Yes, even Justin Bieber."
204,0525949690,http://goodreads.com/user/show/109224631-brian-fox,3,"This is Your Brain on Music: The Science of a Human Obsession by Daniel J. Letvin delves into the science behind the human brain and its innate ability to pick up on patterns, recognize variations, and distinguish good versus bad music (a highly subjective topic nonetheless covered well). While the book is intriguing to the reader, Letvin perhaps spends too much time in the depths of musical minushia, at times making the book a rather dry read for those without the knowledge required to appreciate the detail in which he is describing. However, it is certainly captivating to the sort of person with even novice level prior knowledge of music theory. Another shortcoming of the book is the way Letvin seems to get sidetracked throughout the book, allowing himself to get caught up in minute, trivial details of his personal accounts and leaving the reader to make minimally book related inferences. The overall quality of the book is enhanced through its conversion to an audio book, as this is a book about music and reading notes on a page is an entirely different experience than listening to the music samples which coincide with the book content. Letvin does well to offer the reader context in the beginning of the book, by dedicating paragraph by paragraph to definitions of certain music related vocabulary some readers would have otherwise been lost on, such as timbre, contour, reverberation, meter, and pitch. While these words individually make sense to many readers, the lengthy definitions provide more specific detail and serve only to aid Letvin throughout the book. Overall, while the book may at times be a bit dry, anyone with an interest in music theory and how it affects the brain, anyone interested in neuroscience and human obsession, or anyone interested in how these two topics relate to one another will be pleased with this book."
205,0525949690,http://goodreads.com/user/show/33412063-minh,4,Took me years to finish this but I'll probably read it again.
206,0525949690,http://goodreads.com/user/show/31899243-kelli-thompson,1,"I did not finish this book because it's utter crap. As soon as he said that ""all life is sacred"" after a 50 page rant about how he went to Stanford and his half assed attempts and explaining music without actually showing to us, I cannot continue to hear his philosophical opinions about how music connects us to our inner selves. I wanted neuroscience dammit. I got psychology mixed with philosophy. This book feels like his tribute to himself and his own greatness, spending 90 pages to show us exactly one thing that I was interested in. I will seek my information elsewhere. I will likely be able to get twice as much information in a fourth of the space with none of the stupid preaching. "
207,0525949690,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3024716-geoffrey-fox,4,"Hard to believe, but this book is as good as its blurbs. Levitin is both a musician and a neuroscientist, who got into the science to understand better the music he was playing or engineering for rock bands. He knows far more music than I do, drawing on all genres to illustrate what it does, how it does it and why it matters. ""Musical activity involves nearly every region of the brain that we know about, and nearly every neural subsystem."" (pp. 85-86) And, he argues (against Pinker and other skeptics), it is not a superfluous byproduct of evolution, but has been essential to our survival and most probably, as Darwin himself believed, is even older than language.Just how do we remember songs, even when the pitch, rhythm and timbre are all altered? And just what are pitch, rhythm and timbre, and how do they affect our brains? And why do you like heavy metal (or whatever you like), while I … well, many other things? These are just some of the mysteries that scientists are beginning to solve.And what must occur in the brain for a musician to achieve full physical skill (of voice, strings, horn, whatever) and sensibility? It takes at least 10,000 hours of practice, says Levitin, for the brain to achieve complete mastery of anything (auto mechanics, fiction writing, musical composition or performance, or anything else). ""Although people differ in how long it takes them to consolidate information neurally, it remains true that increased practice leads to a greater number of neural traces, which can combine to create a stronger memory representation."" (p. 197) Talent — a genetic predisposition, that difference in learning time he mentions — is a big help, but it's not enough without practice. Levitin's style is lively, his examples well chosen (even though I didn't recognize all the music he expected me to know), and his openness to examining contrary hypotheses makes him a credible guide. I especially appreciated his comments on performance and how a musician learns new pieces, by ""chunking"" — that is, learning whole groups or sequences of chords, melodies, etc. rather than all the individual notes a beginning piano player struggles to memorize. And best of all, the sheer emotion of listening and playing. That's what I want to hold on to as I get back to practicing. And I now have a clearer idea of the ""schema"" to listen for in classic jazz (I sort of knew, but never had it explained before) and how to appreciate the clever transformation Mahler achieves in his Fifth, or what and how Joni Mitchell accomplishes with her alternative guitar tunings. So why four and not five stars? My very personal reaction: the first couple of chapters were too cute and anecdotal, an unnecessary (for me) warm-up for the truly informative, analytical stuff to come. But if you've never thought much about notes or scales or timbre, maybe you'll need that. "
208,0525949690,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5128053-drew-patrick-smith,4,"Review from the PFS Book Club...What I Liked: For a science book that had to deal with two horribly advanced sets of terminology (music terms and anatomy terms), this book was utterly readable. From what could have been a horrible mess of confusion, Levitin manages to create a straight-forward, well-planned book that covers a variety of topics that generally makes sense to the reader. And the bonus is that the book covers topics that your everyday person would find interesting, as his base of musical knowledge is so broad that he can explain the science without talking down to the reader.The breadth of topics broached in this book are also quite impressive, with the 9 chapters divided up into smaller sections. Levitin conveys a lot of information in a short space (the book isn't really that long for nonfiction) and does so with a down-to-earth tone that I think a lot of readers would enjoy. This isn't a professor talking to a student, but rather an expert teaching their friend about what they do.I also truly appreciated the way Levitin looks at both science and music. There's this awe in his tone that must come from the author naturally, because that's the way he feels - there's no guile or trickery-in-style here, just straight-forward love of what he does. And the way he can describe the music of the Beatles, Bach, or Bon Jovi in equal terms is refreshing. All music for Levitin is worthwhile, from prehuman drumming to the atonal madness of the 20th century. And it's that appreciation for his subject that brings this book to a higher level.What I Didn't Like: The book goes by too fast. There's so much in here, that Levitin sometimes does get lost in his topics - going on too long in some sections about music terminology that didn't even grab my attention as a musician or a long discussion on the anatomy of the brain, throwing out way too many words that the average reader won't take the time to understand. When he gets into these pigeon-holed segments, especially in comparison to the other parts of the book where he's so focused, the reader (like me) will start to skim and probably miss something important.Last Thought: If you love music and want to feel smart at a dinner party, this is a good place to go."
209,0525949690,http://goodreads.com/user/show/217489-naeem,2,"I was keen on this book in the beginning for two reasons. First, it give me the basics of music theory 101 in a concise manner. I really needed that. Second, and more important, he went to some length to separate the universal elements of music from the culturally relative aspects. For example, an octave, he argues is a quality of sound itself -- an aspect of the physical world. But how different societies treat octaves depends on their musical traditions. Levitin is very compelling and clear in his explanations. But at some point I grew tired, then annoyed, and then a touch angry. Tired because while Levitin says that he wants to talk NOT about the brain but instead about the mind, he spends most of his energy talking about the brain. For Levitin the mind is the entity that makes the different parts of the brain into a whole. For me, mind is a historical, cultural, and psychological entity. So while I appreciated learning about what brain scientists have done with music, that isn't really where my interests are. Annoyed because, as a former rock musician, engineer, and producer he constantly references artists who are mostly white and north american. He gives examples of music that I consider to be anti-music (a term coined by Mat Callahan in his  Trouble with Music). And finally angry, because, as much as he doesn't want to, and as much as he would be astounded at the my accusation, Levitin produces a book that ignores the fuller world of music. It would be like writing a book on trees that concentrated mostly on trees in north America. Maybe he doesn't know anything else. But I happen to think that a focus on so called hard sciences is actually a way to avoid world politics.Finally, for me, music is tied up with the divine and the sacred. And this too he ignores. "

In the process it incorporated how as humans we respond to different cultural situations while bring the information to a level that someone with little understanding could comprehend.  I loved how much my knowledge of music expanded through reading this. At first glance the title could turn people away for as it could seem dry, but the author, Daniel J.

While trying to explain concepts and placing numerous definitions in a novel it is difficult to keep audiences engaged, but Levitin avoided this problem virtually effortlessly.  Another aspect of the book I thoroughly enjoyed learning about was the human brain. While I was very engaged at the mention of big name musicians and bands the end connection always fell back to relation to the brain interaction. Even if the complicated terminology would at times go over my head, I still understood the overall message of the information. Levitin did a wonderful job of addressing the other notable people in his neurological field of study and either agreeing or disagreeing in a well argued manner. All and all his writing style left a pattern of the inability to avoid thinking about the concepts placed before you. The whole book expands your base knowledge but gives you an experience on how music has, is, and still will shape humanity."
213,0525949690,http://goodreads.com/user/show/25309260-allison-soulier,3,"""This is Your Brain on Music: The Science of a Human Obsession"" is written by Daniel J. Levitin. It was published by Dutton Penguin in 2006. It is a science text. I gave it a 3 out of 5 stars because the first few chapters were slow for me because I was bogged down with some many vocabulary terms I was unfamiliar with. However, it picked up towards the end and provided some interesting information. ""This Is Your Brain on Music"" describes the different components of music and makes connections to how the different parts of the brain processes these musical components. A huge focus of the text is on the cognitive processes of music and how they have evolved over time in accordance with musical evolution. The aim of ""This Is Your Brain on Music"" was to make recent findings in cognitive neuroscience of music accessible to the educated layperson. Characteristics and theoretical parameters of music are explained alongside scientific findings about how the brain interprets and processes these characteristics. The neuroanatomy of musical expectation, emotion, listening and performance is discussed. The text is meant for grades 9-12, but I would definitely would not teach it except in the 12th grade, probably an honors class. It almost is more aimed towards college-level reading, however. It's Lexile level is a 1360L and Guided Reading level is a Z. My only teaching idea would be to have students pick an instrument and do a research project based on the different criteria discussed in the book on reasons music connects to the brain (L.11-12.1-1. Demonstrate command of the conventions of standard English grammar and usage whenwriting or speaking.a. Apply the understanding that usage is a matter of convention, can change over time, andis sometimes contested.b. Resolve issues of complex or contested usage, consulting references (e.g., MerriamWebster’sDictionary of English Usage, Garner’s Modern American Usage) as needed.)"
214,0525949690,http://goodreads.com/user/show/8156215-ann,4,"This was an interesting book, even if it may be a bit out of date (2006 copyright): part narrative, part neuroscience part music. The author is able to communicate fairly complex neuroscience in an accessible, yet compelling way. He includes some scientific experiments as well as a diversity of musical and musician examples, adding many of his personal stories as well. There is a useful appendix on brain structures in case you are unfamiliar or rusty on these, and one on musical chords as well.I thought Levitin was a bit off when he claimed that the auditory processing that he does was nothing like what his dog does -- dogs and humans are a bit too close phylogenetically for that and he should know better. I was also surprised that he did not initially make the connection between music and the cerebellum in terms of communication/expression via dance/ritual. It seems to me that one reason we have music is as a fundamental means of communication and the cerebellum would be part of coordinating this through physical movement, etc. Levitin does touch on this later in the book but never actually seems to make this connection, rather he focuses on the possibility of music used in courtship, perhaps a more narrow form communication.At any rate, any one interested in music, brain function, and how the two come together will enjoy this book."
215,0525949690,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3954160-gonza,3,"As usual my super huge expectations didn't help me to appreciate the book as I should, as a little excuse I have to say that as a amateur musician who started to learn a new instrument at 40 I was a little bit pissed off and as a neuroscience aficionados, there were not so much stuff that I didn't know, plus the author rambles a lot. I think it would have been better when there were some sort of playlist on youtube, that we could have follow to switch immediately to audio mode while we were reading the book or more brain related pictures and not only on the appendix, but still it was a worthy reading. Come al solito le mie aspettative troppo alte non mi hanno aiutato ad appezzare il libro come avrei potuto, ma sicuramente da musicista per hobby che ha iniziato a suonare il clarinetto a 40 anni, é possibile che non avrei comunque gradito l'informazione che dopo i 20 anni non c'é trippa per gatti. Inoltre c'era poco contenuto per quanto riguarda la parte neuropsicologica e secondo me troppe chiacchiere dell'autore. Magari anche una piccola playlist su youtube da ascoltare in contemporanea con la lettura del libro avrebbe aiutato e anche qualche immagine migliore del cervello. A parte questo, valeva la pena leggerlo."
216,0525949690,http://goodreads.com/user/show/62352876-richard,5,"WOW - this is a very detailed, informative, and eye-opening examination of what music is and why we are so excited by it. The author, Daniel Levitin, has a wide and varied background - from performing in a high school rock band, to being a successful record producer, to a PhD in the field, to running the Laboratory for Musical Perception, Cognition, and Expertise at McGill University.As Levitin points out, our culture is willing to spend as much money on good concert tickets as would feed a family of four - it is THAT important to us. He then spends nearly three hundred pages explaining why we have evolved in this fashion.Levitin promises to keep the musical jargon down to a minimum so that non-musicians can enjoy and understand the book and he keeps to this pledge. He does spend many pages on the physiology and the inner workings of the human brain that requires quite a bit of concentration and brain power. Luckily, he relates all of this information directly to our understanding and appreciation of music.If you love music, play an instrument, or just want to understand why you can't help tapping your foot to a beat - read this book!"
217,0525949690,http://goodreads.com/user/show/25629613-peter-spung,5,"I loved this book. As a music lover, musician, science geek and one who is filled with wonder about the human condition and curiousity about how everything works, this book appealed to all of my preferences. Our brains are hard wired for music, deep in our old (eg cerebellum) and new (eg cerebral cortex) brains, which evolved over a long period. Music listening and especially learning and performing activate parts and connections all over brains, more than almost any other activity. It promotes or facilitates all kinds of emotions, physical movements, and social interactions. The author explains why, using his own experience as a musician, composer, producer, and now neuroscientist and researcher into the psychology of electronic communication in the Lab for Musical Perception, Cognition and Expertise at McGill University.If you have friends who are curious about the ""why"" of music, and its effects on our cognition and emotions, give them this book. You and they will not regret it.Warning: while reading this, the author Levitin often refers to songs among a wide variety of genres, and you'll want to listen to them as you go."
218,0525949690,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5893251-sally,2,"I learned some interesting facts, yes. But I found myself skimming through much of this without even feeling bad about it. Overall, it was disappointing and I won't be sharing it with my music-loving family, as originally planned.Also: An author's credentials belong on the dust jacket. And I don't need to know the curriculum vitae of every person you mention--If the dust jacket tells me you are an expert, I trust you to only include credible facts from credible individuals!! "
219,0525949690,http://goodreads.com/user/show/9460786-kaitlin,4,"I still don't really think of myself as a musical expert but I have a lot more knowledge than the layperson, so a lot of the descriptions of various concepts were very redundant for me, with both music and biology. However, he pulls together a really interesting set of research in a way that's really readable. One thing I will say is that I'd be interested to see how much has changed and how much more we've learned in the 13 years since this was published - I expect quite a lot."
220,0525949690,http://goodreads.com/user/show/75843534-jason-mccaffrey,5,"I loved this book! I learned as much about music theory as I did about neuroscience. Heavy concepts with lots of associated and necessary jargon somehow delivered in a really easy and accessible way. Levitin mentions early on that he's trying to keep it easy for the layman. And he nails that without ever seeming like he's patronizing. Another reviewer mentioned that this book would be better as a documentary, and I can't disagree with that. I would recommend at least reading with access to a music streaming service at close hand. There are a lot of references to songs by title and artist that are designed to help illustrate the points he's making."
221,0525949690,http://goodreads.com/user/show/18856924-melissa-symanczyk,3,"I went into this expecting it to be the kind of funny, anecdote-stuffed science that Mary Roach writes. Instead, this is clearly a book written by a scientist trying his damndest to walk the fine line between making complex ideas simple enough for a layperson to understand while retaining the actual science, and I think whether it works is going to be largely dependent on the reader. I think a good editor could've tightened it up a bit.The first couple of chapters on basic music theory and vocabulary could have been replaced with a beefy glossary, but once we get into things there are some really interesting revelations. I now have a greater appreciation of the many different ways that music is processed by the brain, and what a unique gift music actually is. Some interesting thoughts on the evolutionary purpose of music as well that I'd never really thought about."

A fascinating mix of music theory, cognitive psychology, and evolution theory. My only caveat (not the best word, perhaps) is that it was published in 2005 and a LOT of science has happened since then. Guess I'll have to go down that rabbit hole."
223,0525949690,http://goodreads.com/user/show/64922807-gemma-golley,3,"interesting content, but I really wanted to hear about how the brain is affected by music. that only happened in the last part of the book, which is disappointing. the rest was just talking about music theory, which sure, was interesting but it wasn't very engaging."
224,0525949690,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1024517-rachel,4,Fabulous book; even better to read and come across a study by future SIL!

229,0525949690,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5009036-melody,4,An excellent read on the neuroscience of music. How our brains react to music and how music effects our brains. I enjoyed it greatly and learned a lot.
230,0525949690,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7605433-stephen-palmer,3,"A couple of months ago I watched Stewart Copeland's three-part tv series 'Adventures In Music,' which aimed to get to the heart of what music is and why it means so much to us. The series was very enjoyable, and in one of the episodes there were interviews with Daniel Levitin, so I bought his book 'This Is Your Brain On Music.'I have to say, though it's not a bad book, it is rather dry, and I did struggle with it. The opening three chapters (as the author observes) can be skipped by anyone reasonably au fait with music, while the rest, which is mostly neurology and brain science, is interesting enough but not terribly engaging. I confess I skipped a few sections.It could be that a book simply isn't the right vehicle for this topic. There was nothing specifically wrong here, but I found the continuing descriptions of brain operation to be a case of diminishing returns. Perhaps the book should be televised.Interesting, then, but arid."
231,0525949690,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7864656-claire-b,2,I stopped halfway. It was so technical that I couldn't keep track of everything without listening very intently and I usually listen to audio books while walking or doing chores so I kept missing things and having to rewind. I grew bored quickly. But what I did hear was mildly interesting. I imagine if I had more of an attention span I would have enjoyed it.
232,0525949690,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7136086-stephanie,4,My audiobook version of this went a little wonky towards the end so I am not quite sure how the book ended but this was quite the informative piece on the science behind how we listen to and enjoy music. I learned quite a bit from this book. It was much more in depth than I was expecting. 
233,0525949690,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7116910-bernard-o-leary,5,"I've got an earworm right now. It's ""Sorry"" by Justin Bieber. Judge me if you like, but if you've know the song then you're probably humming it now too. This may not seem like a big deal, but think about the astonishing cognitive processes that made all of this possible: the ability to hear, to distinguish individual sounds, to detect musical patterns like rhythm, to interact with them on both an intellectual and emotional level, even to start dancing if the mood were to take me. I can ""record"" the song and play it back in my head, as I am doing now, and I could sing it out loud if I felt like it, possibly with a whole new arrangement. How is any of this even possible?Levitin starts his exploration of music by talking about what music actually is, taking us through the terminology of music and looking a little at the physics of music too. For example, I only had a vague understanding of timbre before reading this. I certainly didn't know that instruments resonate simultaneously on multiple frequencies, and that these frequencies are all multiples of each other (i.e. a tuba resonates on 200hz, and 400hz, 600hz, 800hz, and so on), and that the strength of each frequency can vary, and that this pattern is what gives each instrument its individual auditory flavour, or timbre. However, nobody's ever rushed out to buy a copy of Now That's What I Call A Mathematically Balanced Series Of Vibrations. Describing music as an external phenomenon is the easy bit; the rest of the book is about describing what happens in the brain when it encounters music, and this is a bit of a challenge because nobody really knows very much about how the brain does anything. Levitin is something of a dualist, taking care to separate out the neurological stuff from the discussions of higher-level cognitive functions, or the hardware from the software, as it were. The software side of things is especially fascinating, mainly because of the things we take for granted which are maddeningly complicated. For example, consider something that people do millions of times each day all over the world, which is to sing ""Happy Birthday"". The process is normally: somebody will pick a note at random, hold it for a second while everyone joins in, and then the entire group will create a new arrangement for the song based on that starting note. We all do this perfectly and without hesitation every time, yet most of us insist that we have no musical ability.Levitin mentions a conversation with a colleague who was studying a remote tribe, and confused everyone by telling them he couldn't sing. To them, singing was like walking and talking, it's just a basic element of normal human existence. The fact that our society has decided that music-making is a restricted activity, only appropriate for experts, is a cultural oddity. Every human has a extraordinary sophisticated understanding of music, as evidenced by a number of studies that Levitin walks us through. Even the ability to have an earworm, annoying as it might be, is a unique cognitive process unlike any other. Music is different from any other kind of stimulus, on a neurological level, because it seems to activate every part of the brain simultaneously. Left and right hemisphere, amygdala and frontal lobes, they all light up when you hear banging choons. Maybe that's why listening to music can be so overwhelming, and carry people out of themselves in a way that no other artform can.Levitin tries to explore the hardware side of things, but is hampered by the fact that nobody truly understands the brain. He attempts to use evolutionary psychology to build a theory about why music pleases us so much, and this is mainly based around how rhythm was an important part of assessing threats in auditory data when we were in the early mammalian stage, and that music gently subverts our expectations of rhythm in a way that tickles us. Is any of that true? I'm always a little suspicious of such explanations. The truth is that this book doesn't offer very many answers, but it asks some fascinating questions that make you realise how miraculous music is. Yes, even Justin Bieber."
234,0525949690,http://goodreads.com/user/show/109224631-brian-fox,3,"This is Your Brain on Music: The Science of a Human Obsession by Daniel J. Letvin delves into the science behind the human brain and its innate ability to pick up on patterns, recognize variations, and distinguish good versus bad music (a highly subjective topic nonetheless covered well). While the book is intriguing to the reader, Letvin perhaps spends too much time in the depths of musical minushia, at times making the book a rather dry read for those without the knowledge required to appreciate the detail in which he is describing. However, it is certainly captivating to the sort of person with even novice level prior knowledge of music theory. Another shortcoming of the book is the way Letvin seems to get sidetracked throughout the book, allowing himself to get caught up in minute, trivial details of his personal accounts and leaving the reader to make minimally book related inferences. The overall quality of the book is enhanced through its conversion to an audio book, as this is a book about music and reading notes on a page is an entirely different experience than listening to the music samples which coincide with the book content. Letvin does well to offer the reader context in the beginning of the book, by dedicating paragraph by paragraph to definitions of certain music related vocabulary some readers would have otherwise been lost on, such as timbre, contour, reverberation, meter, and pitch. While these words individually make sense to many readers, the lengthy definitions provide more specific detail and serve only to aid Letvin throughout the book. Overall, while the book may at times be a bit dry, anyone with an interest in music theory and how it affects the brain, anyone interested in neuroscience and human obsession, or anyone interested in how these two topics relate to one another will be pleased with this book."
235,0525949690,http://goodreads.com/user/show/33412063-minh,4,Took me years to finish this but I'll probably read it again.
236,0525949690,http://goodreads.com/user/show/31899243-kelli-thompson,1,"I did not finish this book because it's utter crap. As soon as he said that ""all life is sacred"" after a 50 page rant about how he went to Stanford and his half assed attempts and explaining music without actually showing to us, I cannot continue to hear his philosophical opinions about how music connects us to our inner selves. I wanted neuroscience dammit. I got psychology mixed with philosophy. This book feels like his tribute to himself and his own greatness, spending 90 pages to show us exactly one thing that I was interested in. I will seek my information elsewhere. I will likely be able to get twice as much information in a fourth of the space with none of the stupid preaching. "
237,0525949690,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3024716-geoffrey-fox,4,"Hard to believe, but this book is as good as its blurbs. Levitin is both a musician and a neuroscientist, who got into the science to understand better the music he was playing or engineering for rock bands. He knows far more music than I do, drawing on all genres to illustrate what it does, how it does it and why it matters. ""Musical activity involves nearly every region of the brain that we know about, and nearly every neural subsystem."" (pp. 85-86) And, he argues (against Pinker and other skeptics), it is not a superfluous byproduct of evolution, but has been essential to our survival and most probably, as Darwin himself believed, is even older than language.Just how do we remember songs, even when the pitch, rhythm and timbre are all altered? And just what are pitch, rhythm and timbre, and how do they affect our brains? And why do you like heavy metal (or whatever you like), while I … well, many other things? These are just some of the mysteries that scientists are beginning to solve.And what must occur in the brain for a musician to achieve full physical skill (of voice, strings, horn, whatever) and sensibility? It takes at least 10,000 hours of practice, says Levitin, for the brain to achieve complete mastery of anything (auto mechanics, fiction writing, musical composition or performance, or anything else). ""Although people differ in how long it takes them to consolidate information neurally, it remains true that increased practice leads to a greater number of neural traces, which can combine to create a stronger memory representation."" (p. 197) Talent — a genetic predisposition, that difference in learning time he mentions — is a big help, but it's not enough without practice. Levitin's style is lively, his examples well chosen (even though I didn't recognize all the music he expected me to know), and his openness to examining contrary hypotheses makes him a credible guide. I especially appreciated his comments on performance and how a musician learns new pieces, by ""chunking"" — that is, learning whole groups or sequences of chords, melodies, etc. rather than all the individual notes a beginning piano player struggles to memorize. And best of all, the sheer emotion of listening and playing. That's what I want to hold on to as I get back to practicing. And I now have a clearer idea of the ""schema"" to listen for in classic jazz (I sort of knew, but never had it explained before) and how to appreciate the clever transformation Mahler achieves in his Fifth, or what and how Joni Mitchell accomplishes with her alternative guitar tunings. So why four and not five stars? My very personal reaction: the first couple of chapters were too cute and anecdotal, an unnecessary (for me) warm-up for the truly informative, analytical stuff to come. But if you've never thought much about notes or scales or timbre, maybe you'll need that. "
238,0525949690,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5128053-drew-patrick-smith,4,"Review from the PFS Book Club...What I Liked: For a science book that had to deal with two horribly advanced sets of terminology (music terms and anatomy terms), this book was utterly readable. From what could have been a horrible mess of confusion, Levitin manages to create a straight-forward, well-planned book that covers a variety of topics that generally makes sense to the reader. And the bonus is that the book covers topics that your everyday person would find interesting, as his base of musical knowledge is so broad that he can explain the science without talking down to the reader.The breadth of topics broached in this book are also quite impressive, with the 9 chapters divided up into smaller sections. Levitin conveys a lot of information in a short space (the book isn't really that long for nonfiction) and does so with a down-to-earth tone that I think a lot of readers would enjoy. This isn't a professor talking to a student, but rather an expert teaching their friend about what they do.I also truly appreciated the way Levitin looks at both science and music. There's this awe in his tone that must come from the author naturally, because that's the way he feels - there's no guile or trickery-in-style here, just straight-forward love of what he does. And the way he can describe the music of the Beatles, Bach, or Bon Jovi in equal terms is refreshing. All music for Levitin is worthwhile, from prehuman drumming to the atonal madness of the 20th century. And it's that appreciation for his subject that brings this book to a higher level.What I Didn't Like: The book goes by too fast. There's so much in here, that Levitin sometimes does get lost in his topics - going on too long in some sections about music terminology that didn't even grab my attention as a musician or a long discussion on the anatomy of the brain, throwing out way too many words that the average reader won't take the time to understand. When he gets into these pigeon-holed segments, especially in comparison to the other parts of the book where he's so focused, the reader (like me) will start to skim and probably miss something important.Last Thought: If you love music and want to feel smart at a dinner party, this is a good place to go."
239,0525949690,http://goodreads.com/user/show/217489-naeem,2,"I was keen on this book in the beginning for two reasons. First, it give me the basics of music theory 101 in a concise manner. I really needed that. Second, and more important, he went to some length to separate the universal elements of music from the culturally relative aspects. For example, an octave, he argues is a quality of sound itself -- an aspect of the physical world. But how different societies treat octaves depends on their musical traditions. Levitin is very compelling and clear in his explanations. But at some point I grew tired, then annoyed, and then a touch angry. Tired because while Levitin says that he wants to talk NOT about the brain but instead about the mind, he spends most of his energy talking about the brain. For Levitin the mind is the entity that makes the different parts of the brain into a whole. For me, mind is a historical, cultural, and psychological entity. So while I appreciated learning about what brain scientists have done with music, that isn't really where my interests are. Annoyed because, as a former rock musician, engineer, and producer he constantly references artists who are mostly white and north american. He gives examples of music that I consider to be anti-music (a term coined by Mat Callahan in his  Trouble with Music). And finally angry, because, as much as he doesn't want to, and as much as he would be astounded at the my accusation, Levitin produces a book that ignores the fuller world of music. It would be like writing a book on trees that concentrated mostly on trees in north America. Maybe he doesn't know anything else. But I happen to think that a focus on so called hard sciences is actually a way to avoid world politics.Finally, for me, music is tied up with the divine and the sacred. And this too he ignores. "

242,0525949690,http://goodreads.com/user/show/57212992-brooke-bell,4," This nonfiction book was fantastic because it expanded on music broken down to its core and the brain in relation to it. My factual understand of music and the human brain prior to reading this was barely base level but that drastically changed. It fully dove into the concepts, definitions, and cultural aspects of music throughout history. In the process it incorporated how as humans we respond to different cultural situations while bring the information to a level that someone with little understanding could comprehend.  I loved how much my knowledge of music expanded through reading this. At first glance the title could turn people away for as it could seem dry, but the author, Daniel J. Levitin, did an outstanding job writing this novel. This was done by his well thought out placement of stories from his own life or cultural music references. While trying to explain concepts and placing numerous definitions in a novel it is difficult to keep audiences engaged, but Levitin avoided this problem virtually effortlessly.  Another aspect of the book I thoroughly enjoyed learning about was the human brain. While I was very engaged at the mention of big name musicians and bands the end connection always fell back to relation to the brain interaction. Even if the complicated terminology would at times go over my head, I still understood the overall message of the information. Levitin did a wonderful job of addressing the other notable people in his neurological field of study and either agreeing or disagreeing in a well argued manner. All and all his writing style left a pattern of the inability to avoid thinking about the concepts placed before you. The whole book expands your base knowledge but gives you an experience on how music has, is, and still will shape humanity."

It was published by Dutton Penguin in 2006. It is a science text. I gave it a 3 out of 5 stars because the first few chapters were slow for me because I was bogged down with some many vocabulary terms I was unfamiliar with. However, it picked up towards the end and provided some interesting information. ""This Is Your Brain on Music"" describes the different components of music and makes connections to how the different parts of the brain processes these musical components. A huge focus of the text is on the cognitive processes of music and how they have evolved over time in accordance with musical evolution. The aim of ""This Is Your Brain on Music"" was to make recent findings in cognitive neuroscience of music accessible to the educated layperson. Characteristics and theoretical parameters of music are explained alongside scientific findings about how the brain interprets and processes these characteristics. The neuroanatomy of musical expectation, emotion, listening and performance is discussed. The text is meant for grades 9-12, but I would definitely would not teach it except in the 12th grade, probably an honors class. It almost is more aimed towards college-level reading, however. It's Lexile level is a 1360L and Guided Reading level is a Z. My only teaching idea would be to have students pick an instrument and do a research project based on the different criteria discussed in the book on reasons music connects to the brain (L.11-12.1-1. Demonstrate command of the conventions of standard English grammar and usage whenwriting or speaking.a.

244,0525949690,http://goodreads.com/user/show/8156215-ann,4,"This was an interesting book, even if it may be a bit out of date (2006 copyright): part narrative, part neuroscience part music. The author is able to communicate fairly complex neuroscience in an accessible, yet compelling way. He includes some scientific experiments as well as a diversity of musical and musician examples, adding many of his personal stories as well. There is a useful appendix on brain structures in case you are unfamiliar or rusty on these, and one on musical chords as well.I thought Levitin was a bit off when he claimed that the auditory processing that he does was nothing like what his dog does -- dogs and humans are a bit too close phylogenetically for that and he should know better. I was also surprised that he did not initially make the connection between music and the cerebellum in terms of communication/expression via dance/ritual. It seems to me that one reason we have music is as a fundamental means of communication and the cerebellum would be part of coordinating this through physical movement, etc. Levitin does touch on this later in the book but never actually seems to make this connection, rather he focuses on the possibility of music used in courtship, perhaps a more narrow form communication.At any rate, any one interested in music, brain function, and how the two come together will enjoy this book."

I think it would have been better when there were some sort of playlist on youtube, that we could have follow to switch immediately to audio mode while we were reading the book or more brain related pictures and not only on the appendix, but still it was a worthy reading. Come al solito le mie aspettative troppo alte non mi hanno aiutato ad appezzare il libro come avrei potuto, ma sicuramente da musicista per hobby che ha iniziato a suonare il clarinetto a 40 anni, é possibile che non avrei comunque gradito l'informazione che dopo i 20 anni non c'é trippa per gatti. Inoltre c'era poco contenuto per quanto riguarda la parte neuropsicologica e secondo me troppe chiacchiere dell'autore. Magari anche una piccola playlist su youtube da ascoltare in contemporanea con la lettura del libro avrebbe aiutato e anche qualche immagine migliore del cervello. A parte questo, valeva la pena leggerlo."
246,0525949690,http://goodreads.com/user/show/62352876-richard,5,"WOW - this is a very detailed, informative, and eye-opening examination of what music is and why we are so excited by it. The author, Daniel Levitin, has a wide and varied background - from performing in a high school rock band, to being a successful record producer, to a PhD in the field, to running the Laboratory for Musical Perception, Cognition, and Expertise at McGill University.As Levitin points out, our culture is willing to spend as much money on good concert tickets as would feed a family of four - it is THAT important to us. He then spends nearly three hundred pages explaining why we have evolved in this fashion.Levitin promises to keep the musical jargon down to a minimum so that non-musicians can enjoy and understand the book and he keeps to this pledge. He does spend many pages on the physiology and the inner workings of the human brain that requires quite a bit of concentration and brain power. Luckily, he relates all of this information directly to our understanding and appreciation of music.If you love music, play an instrument, or just want to understand why you can't help tapping your foot to a beat - read this book!"
247,0525949690,http://goodreads.com/user/show/25629613-peter-spung,5,"I loved this book. As a music lover, musician, science geek and one who is filled with wonder about the human condition and curiousity about how everything works, this book appealed to all of my preferences. Our brains are hard wired for music, deep in our old (eg cerebellum) and new (eg cerebral cortex) brains, which evolved over a long period. Music listening and especially learning and performing activate parts and connections all over brains, more than almost any other activity. It promotes or facilitates all kinds of emotions, physical movements, and social interactions. The author explains why, using his own experience as a musician, composer, producer, and now neuroscientist and researcher into the psychology of electronic communication in the Lab for Musical Perception, Cognition and Expertise at McGill University.If you have friends who are curious about the ""why"" of music, and its effects on our cognition and emotions, give them this book. You and they will not regret it.Warning: while reading this, the author Levitin often refers to songs among a wide variety of genres, and you'll want to listen to them as you go."

Overall, it was disappointing and I won't be sharing it with my music-loving family, as originally planned.Also: An author's credentials belong on the dust jacket. And I don't need to know the curriculum vitae of every person you mention--If the dust jacket tells me you are an expert, I trust you to only include credible facts from credible individuals!! "

However, he pulls together a really interesting set of research in a way that's really readable. One thing I will say is that I'd be interested to see how much has changed and how much more we've learned in the 13 years since this was published - I expect quite a lot."

Heavy concepts with lots of associated and necessary jargon somehow delivered in a really easy and accessible way. Levitin mentions early on that he's trying to keep it easy for the layman. And he nails that without ever seeming like he's patronizing. Another reviewer mentioned that this book would be better as a documentary, and I can't disagree with that. I would recommend at least reading with access to a music streaming service at close hand. There are a lot of references to songs by title and artist that are designed to help illustrate the points he's making."

Instead, this is clearly a book written by a scientist trying his damndest to walk the fine line between making complex ideas simple enough for a layperson to understand while retaining the actual science, and I think whether it works is going to be largely dependent on the reader. I think a good editor could've tightened it up a bit.The first couple of chapters on basic music theory and vocabulary could have been replaced with a beefy glossary, but once we get into things there are some really interesting revelations. I now have a greater appreciation of the many different ways that music is processed by the brain, and what a unique gift music actually is. Some interesting thoughts on the evolutionary purpose of music as well that I'd never really thought about."

260,0525949690,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7605433-stephen-palmer,3,"A couple of months ago I watched Stewart Copeland's three-part tv series 'Adventures In Music,' which aimed to get to the heart of what music is and why it means so much to us. The series was very enjoyable, and in one of the episodes there were interviews with Daniel Levitin, so I bought his book 'This Is Your Brain On Music.'I have to say, though it's not a bad book, it is rather dry, and I did struggle with it. The opening three chapters (as the author observes) can be skipped by anyone reasonably au fait with music, while the rest, which is mostly neurology and brain science, is interesting enough but not terribly engaging. I confess I skipped a few sections.It could be that a book simply isn't the right vehicle for this topic. There was nothing specifically wrong here, but I found the continuing descriptions of brain operation to be a case of diminishing returns. Perhaps the book should be televised.Interesting, then, but arid."
261,0525949690,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7864656-claire-b,2,I stopped halfway. It was so technical that I couldn't keep track of everything without listening very intently and I usually listen to audio books while walking or doing chores so I kept missing things and having to rewind. I grew bored quickly. But what I did hear was mildly interesting. I imagine if I had more of an attention span I would have enjoyed it.
262,0525949690,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7136086-stephanie,4,My audiobook version of this went a little wonky towards the end so I am not quite sure how the book ended but this was quite the informative piece on the science behind how we listen to and enjoy music.

263,0525949690,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7116910-bernard-o-leary,5,"I've got an earworm right now. It's ""Sorry"" by Justin Bieber. Judge me if you like, but if you've know the song then you're probably humming it now too. This may not seem like a big deal, but think about the astonishing cognitive processes that made all of this possible: the ability to hear, to distinguish individual sounds, to detect musical patterns like rhythm, to interact with them on both an intellectual and emotional level, even to start dancing if the mood were to take me. I can ""record"" the song and play it back in my head, as I am doing now, and I could sing it out loud if I felt like it, possibly with a whole new arrangement. How is any of this even possible?Levitin starts his exploration of music by talking about what music actually is, taking us through the terminology of music and looking a little at the physics of music too. For example, I only had a vague understanding of timbre before reading this. I certainly didn't know that instruments resonate simultaneously on multiple frequencies, and that these frequencies are all multiples of each other (i.e. a tuba resonates on 200hz, and 400hz, 600hz, 800hz, and so on), and that the strength of each frequency can vary, and that this pattern is what gives each instrument its individual auditory flavour, or timbre. However, nobody's ever rushed out to buy a copy of Now That's What I Call A Mathematically Balanced Series Of Vibrations. Describing music as an external phenomenon is the easy bit; the rest of the book is about describing what happens in the brain when it encounters music, and this is a bit of a challenge because nobody really knows very much about how the brain does anything. Levitin is something of a dualist, taking care to separate out the neurological stuff from the discussions of higher-level cognitive functions, or the hardware from the software, as it were. The software side of things is especially fascinating, mainly because of the things we take for granted which are maddeningly complicated. For example, consider something that people do millions of times each day all over the world, which is to sing ""Happy Birthday"". The process is normally: somebody will pick a note at random, hold it for a second while everyone joins in, and then the entire group will create a new arrangement for the song based on that starting note. We all do this perfectly and without hesitation every time, yet most of us insist that we have no musical ability.Levitin mentions a conversation with a colleague who was studying a remote tribe, and confused everyone by telling them he couldn't sing. To them, singing was like walking and talking, it's just a basic element of normal human existence. The fact that our society has decided that music-making is a restricted activity, only appropriate for experts, is a cultural oddity. Every human has a extraordinary sophisticated understanding of music, as evidenced by a number of studies that Levitin walks us through. Even the ability to have an earworm, annoying as it might be, is a unique cognitive process unlike any other. Music is different from any other kind of stimulus, on a neurological level, because it seems to activate every part of the brain simultaneously. Left and right hemisphere, amygdala and frontal lobes, they all light up when you hear banging choons. Maybe that's why listening to music can be so overwhelming, and carry people out of themselves in a way that no other artform can.Levitin tries to explore the hardware side of things, but is hampered by the fact that nobody truly understands the brain. He attempts to use evolutionary psychology to build a theory about why music pleases us so much, and this is mainly based around how rhythm was an important part of assessing threats in auditory data when we were in the early mammalian stage, and that music gently subverts our expectations of rhythm in a way that tickles us. Is any of that true? I'm always a little suspicious of such explanations. The truth is that this book doesn't offer very many answers, but it asks some fascinating questions that make you realise how miraculous music is. Yes, even Justin Bieber."
264,0525949690,http://goodreads.com/user/show/109224631-brian-fox,3,"This is Your Brain on Music: The Science of a Human Obsession by Daniel J. Letvin delves into the science behind the human brain and its innate ability to pick up on patterns, recognize variations, and distinguish good versus bad music (a highly subjective topic nonetheless covered well). While the book is intriguing to the reader, Letvin perhaps spends too much time in the depths of musical minushia, at times making the book a rather dry read for those without the knowledge required to appreciate the detail in which he is describing. However, it is certainly captivating to the sort of person with even novice level prior knowledge of music theory. Another shortcoming of the book is the way Letvin seems to get sidetracked throughout the book, allowing himself to get caught up in minute, trivial details of his personal accounts and leaving the reader to make minimally book related inferences. The overall quality of the book is enhanced through its conversion to an audio book, as this is a book about music and reading notes on a page is an entirely different experience than listening to the music samples which coincide with the book content. Letvin does well to offer the reader context in the beginning of the book, by dedicating paragraph by paragraph to definitions of certain music related vocabulary some readers would have otherwise been lost on, such as timbre, contour, reverberation, meter, and pitch. While these words individually make sense to many readers, the lengthy definitions provide more specific detail and serve only to aid Letvin throughout the book. Overall, while the book may at times be a bit dry, anyone with an interest in music theory and how it affects the brain, anyone interested in neuroscience and human obsession, or anyone interested in how these two topics relate to one another will be pleased with this book."

266,0525949690,http://goodreads.com/user/show/31899243-kelli-thompson,1,"I did not finish this book because it's utter crap. As soon as he said that ""all life is sacred"" after a 50 page rant about how he went to Stanford and his half assed attempts and explaining music without actually showing to us, I cannot continue to hear his philosophical opinions about how music connects us to our inner selves. I wanted neuroscience dammit. I got psychology mixed with philosophy. This book feels like his tribute to himself and his own greatness, spending 90 pages to show us exactly one thing that I was interested in. I will seek my information elsewhere. I will likely be able to get twice as much information in a fourth of the space with none of the stupid preaching. "
267,0525949690,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3024716-geoffrey-fox,4,"Hard to believe, but this book is as good as its blurbs. Levitin is both a musician and a neuroscientist, who got into the science to understand better the music he was playing or engineering for rock bands. He knows far more music than I do, drawing on all genres to illustrate what it does, how it does it and why it matters. ""Musical activity involves nearly every region of the brain that we know about, and nearly every neural subsystem."" (pp. 85-86) And, he argues (against Pinker and other skeptics), it is not a superfluous byproduct of evolution, but has been essential to our survival and most probably, as Darwin himself believed, is even older than language.Just how do we remember songs, even when the pitch, rhythm and timbre are all altered? And just what are pitch, rhythm and timbre, and how do they affect our brains? And why do you like heavy metal (or whatever you like), while I … well, many other things? These are just some of the mysteries that scientists are beginning to solve.And what must occur in the brain for a musician to achieve full physical skill (of voice, strings, horn, whatever) and sensibility? It takes at least 10,000 hours of practice, says Levitin, for the brain to achieve complete mastery of anything (auto mechanics, fiction writing, musical composition or performance, or anything else). ""Although people differ in how long it takes them to consolidate information neurally, it remains true that increased practice leads to a greater number of neural traces, which can combine to create a stronger memory representation."" (p. 197) Talent — a genetic predisposition, that difference in learning time he mentions — is a big help, but it's not enough without practice. Levitin's style is lively, his examples well chosen (even though I didn't recognize all the music he expected me to know), and his openness to examining contrary hypotheses makes him a credible guide. I especially appreciated his comments on performance and how a musician learns new pieces, by ""chunking"" — that is, learning whole groups or sequences of chords, melodies, etc. rather than all the individual notes a beginning piano player struggles to memorize. And best of all, the sheer emotion of listening and playing. That's what I want to hold on to as I get back to practicing. And I now have a clearer idea of the ""schema"" to listen for in classic jazz (I sort of knew, but never had it explained before) and how to appreciate the clever transformation Mahler achieves in his Fifth, or what and how Joni Mitchell accomplishes with her alternative guitar tunings. So why four and not five stars? My very personal reaction: the first couple of chapters were too cute and anecdotal, an unnecessary (for me) warm-up for the truly informative, analytical stuff to come. But if you've never thought much about notes or scales or timbre, maybe you'll need that. "
268,0525949690,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5128053-drew-patrick-smith,4,"Review from the PFS Book Club...What I Liked: For a science book that had to deal with two horribly advanced sets of terminology (music terms and anatomy terms), this book was utterly readable. From what could have been a horrible mess of confusion, Levitin manages to create a straight-forward, well-planned book that covers a variety of topics that generally makes sense to the reader. And the bonus is that the book covers topics that your everyday person would find interesting, as his base of musical knowledge is so broad that he can explain the science without talking down to the reader.The breadth of topics broached in this book are also quite impressive, with the 9 chapters divided up into smaller sections. Levitin conveys a lot of information in a short space (the book isn't really that long for nonfiction) and does so with a down-to-earth tone that I think a lot of readers would enjoy. This isn't a professor talking to a student, but rather an expert teaching their friend about what they do.I also truly appreciated the way Levitin looks at both science and music. There's this awe in his tone that must come from the author naturally, because that's the way he feels - there's no guile or trickery-in-style here, just straight-forward love of what he does. And the way he can describe the music of the Beatles, Bach, or Bon Jovi in equal terms is refreshing. All music for Levitin is worthwhile, from prehuman drumming to the atonal madness of the 20th century. And it's that appreciation for his subject that brings this book to a higher level.What I Didn't Like: The book goes by too fast. There's so much in here, that Levitin sometimes does get lost in his topics - going on too long in some sections about music terminology that didn't even grab my attention as a musician or a long discussion on the anatomy of the brain, throwing out way too many words that the average reader won't take the time to understand. When he gets into these pigeon-holed segments, especially in comparison to the other parts of the book where he's so focused, the reader (like me) will start to skim and probably miss something important.Last Thought: If you love music and want to feel smart at a dinner party, this is a good place to go."
269,0525949690,http://goodreads.com/user/show/217489-naeem,2,"I was keen on this book in the beginning for two reasons. First, it give me the basics of music theory 101 in a concise manner. I really needed that. Second, and more important, he went to some length to separate the universal elements of music from the culturally relative aspects. For example, an octave, he argues is a quality of sound itself -- an aspect of the physical world. But how different societies treat octaves depends on their musical traditions. Levitin is very compelling and clear in his explanations. But at some point I grew tired, then annoyed, and then a touch angry. Tired because while Levitin says that he wants to talk NOT about the brain but instead about the mind, he spends most of his energy talking about the brain. For Levitin the mind is the entity that makes the different parts of the brain into a whole. For me, mind is a historical, cultural, and psychological entity. So while I appreciated learning about what brain scientists have done with music, that isn't really where my interests are. Annoyed because, as a former rock musician, engineer, and producer he constantly references artists who are mostly white and north american. He gives examples of music that I consider to be anti-music (a term coined by Mat Callahan in his  Trouble with Music). And finally angry, because, as much as he doesn't want to, and as much as he would be astounded at the my accusation, Levitin produces a book that ignores the fuller world of music. It would be like writing a book on trees that concentrated mostly on trees in north America. Maybe he doesn't know anything else. But I happen to think that a focus on so called hard sciences is actually a way to avoid world politics.Finally, for me, music is tied up with the divine and the sacred. And this too he ignores. "

272,0525949690,http://goodreads.com/user/show/57212992-brooke-bell,4," This nonfiction book was fantastic because it expanded on music broken down to its core and the brain in relation to it. My factual understand of music and the human brain prior to reading this was barely base level but that drastically changed. It fully dove into the concepts, definitions, and cultural aspects of music throughout history. In the process it incorporated how as humans we respond to different cultural situations while bring the information to a level that someone with little understanding could comprehend.  I loved how much my knowledge of music expanded through reading this. At first glance the title could turn people away for as it could seem dry, but the author, Daniel J. Levitin, did an outstanding job writing this novel. This was done by his well thought out placement of stories from his own life or cultural music references. While trying to explain concepts and placing numerous definitions in a novel it is difficult to keep audiences engaged, but Levitin avoided this problem virtually effortlessly.  Another aspect of the book I thoroughly enjoyed learning about was the human brain. While I was very engaged at the mention of big name musicians and bands the end connection always fell back to relation to the brain interaction. Even if the complicated terminology would at times go over my head, I still understood the overall message of the information. Levitin did a wonderful job of addressing the other notable people in his neurological field of study and either agreeing or disagreeing in a well argued manner. All and all his writing style left a pattern of the inability to avoid thinking about the concepts placed before you. The whole book expands your base knowledge but gives you an experience on how music has, is, and still will shape humanity."

It was published by Dutton Penguin in 2006. It is a science text. I gave it a 3 out of 5 stars because the first few chapters were slow for me because I was bogged down with some many vocabulary terms I was unfamiliar with. However, it picked up towards the end and provided some interesting information. ""This Is Your Brain on Music"" describes the different components of music and makes connections to how the different parts of the brain processes these musical components. A huge focus of the text is on the cognitive processes of music and how they have evolved over time in accordance with musical evolution. The aim of ""This Is Your Brain on Music"" was to make recent findings in cognitive neuroscience of music accessible to the educated layperson. Characteristics and theoretical parameters of music are explained alongside scientific findings about how the brain interprets and processes these characteristics. The neuroanatomy of musical expectation, emotion, listening and performance is discussed. The text is meant for grades 9-12, but I would definitely would not teach it except in the 12th grade, probably an honors class. It almost is more aimed towards college-level reading, however. It's Lexile level is a 1360L and Guided Reading level is a Z. My only teaching idea would be to have students pick an instrument and do a research project based on the different criteria discussed in the book on reasons music connects to the brain (L.11-12.1-1. Demonstrate command of the conventions of standard English grammar and usage whenwriting or speaking.a. Apply the understanding that usage is a matter of convention, can change over time, andis sometimes contested.b. Resolve issues of complex or contested usage, consulting references (e.g., MerriamWebster’sDictionary of English Usage, Garner’s Modern American Usage) as needed.)"

The author, Daniel Levitin, has a wide and varied background - from performing in a high school rock band, to being a successful record producer, to a PhD in the field, to running the Laboratory for Musical Perception, Cognition, and Expertise at McGill University.As Levitin points out, our culture is willing to spend as much money on good concert tickets as would feed a family of four - it is THAT important to us. He then spends nearly three hundred pages explaining why we have evolved in this fashion.Levitin promises to keep the musical jargon down to a minimum so that non-musicians can enjoy and understand the book and he keeps to this pledge. He does spend many pages on the physiology and the inner workings of the human brain that requires quite a bit of concentration and brain power. Luckily, he relates all of this information directly to our understanding and appreciation of music.If you love music, play an instrument, or just want to understand why you can't help tapping your foot to a beat - read this book!"
277,0525949690,http://goodreads.com/user/show/25629613-peter-spung,5,"I loved this book. As a music lover, musician, science geek and one who is filled with wonder about the human condition and curiousity about how everything works, this book appealed to all of my preferences. Our brains are hard wired for music, deep in our old (eg cerebellum) and new (eg cerebral cortex) brains, which evolved over a long period. Music listening and especially learning and performing activate parts and connections all over brains, more than almost any other activity. It promotes or facilitates all kinds of emotions, physical movements, and social interactions. The author explains why, using his own experience as a musician, composer, producer, and now neuroscientist and researcher into the psychology of electronic communication in the Lab for Musical Perception, Cognition and Expertise at McGill University.If you have friends who are curious about the ""why"" of music, and its effects on our cognition and emotions, give them this book. You and they will not regret it.Warning: while reading this, the author Levitin often refers to songs among a wide variety of genres, and you'll want to listen to them as you go."
278,0525949690,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5893251-sally,2,"I learned some interesting facts, yes. But I found myself skimming through much of this without even feeling bad about it. Overall, it was disappointing and I won't be sharing it with my music-loving family, as originally planned.Also: An author's credentials belong on the dust jacket. And I don't need to know the curriculum vitae of every person you mention--If the dust jacket tells me you are an expert, I trust you to only include credible facts from credible individuals!! "
279,0525949690,http://goodreads.com/user/show/9460786-kaitlin,4,"I still don't really think of myself as a musical expert but I have a lot more knowledge than the layperson, so a lot of the descriptions of various concepts were very redundant for me, with both music and biology. However, he pulls together a really interesting set of research in a way that's really readable. One thing I will say is that I'd be interested to see how much has changed and how much more we've learned in the 13 years since this was published - I expect quite a lot."
280,0525949690,http://goodreads.com/user/show/75843534-jason-mccaffrey,5,"I loved this book! I learned as much about music theory as I did about neuroscience. Heavy concepts with lots of associated and necessary jargon somehow delivered in a really easy and accessible way. Levitin mentions early on that he's trying to keep it easy for the layman. And he nails that without ever seeming like he's patronizing. Another reviewer mentioned that this book would be better as a documentary, and I can't disagree with that. I would recommend at least reading with access to a music streaming service at close hand. There are a lot of references to songs by title and artist that are designed to help illustrate the points he's making."
281,0525949690,http://goodreads.com/user/show/18856924-melissa-symanczyk,3,"I went into this expecting it to be the kind of funny, anecdote-stuffed science that Mary Roach writes. Instead, this is clearly a book written by a scientist trying his damndest to walk the fine line between making complex ideas simple enough for a layperson to understand while retaining the actual science, and I think whether it works is going to be largely dependent on the reader. I think a good editor could've tightened it up a bit.The first couple of chapters on basic music theory and vocabulary could have been replaced with a beefy glossary, but once we get into things there are some really interesting revelations. I now have a greater appreciation of the many different ways that music is processed by the brain, and what a unique gift music actually is. Some interesting thoughts on the evolutionary purpose of music as well that I'd never really thought about."
282,0525949690,http://goodreads.com/user/show/45791932-paul-edlund,4,"4.5 stars. This book is what would happen if Steven Pinker and Rick Beato had a baby. A fascinating mix of music theory, cognitive psychology, and evolution theory. My only caveat (not the best word, perhaps) is that it was published in 2005 and a LOT of science has happened since then. Guess I'll have to go down that rabbit hole."
283,0525949690,http://goodreads.com/user/show/64922807-gemma-golley,3,"interesting content, but I really wanted to hear about how the brain is affected by music. that only happened in the last part of the book, which is disappointing. the rest was just talking about music theory, which sure, was interesting but it wasn't very engaging."
284,0525949690,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1024517-rachel,4,Fabulous book; even better to read and come across a study by future SIL! Definitely recommend reading this in conjunction with the sound clips on the author's website; you think you know the pieces but it brings the theory alive if you listen as you read the relevant passages.

289,0525949690,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5009036-melody,4,An excellent read on the neuroscience of music. How our brains react to music and how music effects our brains. I enjoyed it greatly and learned a lot.
290,0525949690,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7605433-stephen-palmer,3,"A couple of months ago I watched Stewart Copeland's three-part tv series 'Adventures In Music,' which aimed to get to the heart of what music is and why it means so much to us. The series was very enjoyable, and in one of the episodes there were interviews with Daniel Levitin, so I bought his book 'This Is Your Brain On Music.'I have to say, though it's not a bad book, it is rather dry, and I did struggle with it. The opening three chapters (as the author observes) can be skipped by anyone reasonably au fait with music, while the rest, which is mostly neurology and brain science, is interesting enough but not terribly engaging. I confess I skipped a few sections.It could be that a book simply isn't the right vehicle for this topic. There was nothing specifically wrong here, but I found the continuing descriptions of brain operation to be a case of diminishing returns. Perhaps the book should be televised.Interesting, then, but arid."
291,0525949690,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7864656-claire-b,2,I stopped halfway. It was so technical that I couldn't keep track of everything without listening very intently and I usually listen to audio books while walking or doing chores so I kept missing things and having to rewind. I grew bored quickly. But what I did hear was mildly interesting. I imagine if I had more of an attention span I would have enjoyed it.
292,0525949690,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7136086-stephanie,4,My audiobook version of this went a little wonky towards the end so I am not quite sure how the book ended but this was quite the informative piece on the science behind how we listen to and enjoy music. I learned quite a bit from this book. It was much more in depth than I was expecting. 
293,0525949690,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7116910-bernard-o-leary,5,"I've got an earworm right now. It's ""Sorry"" by Justin Bieber. Judge me if you like, but if you've know the song then you're probably humming it now too. This may not seem like a big deal, but think about the astonishing cognitive processes that made all of this possible: the ability to hear, to distinguish individual sounds, to detect musical patterns like rhythm, to interact with them on both an intellectual and emotional level, even to start dancing if the mood were to take me. I can ""record"" the song and play it back in my head, as I am doing now, and I could sing it out loud if I felt like it, possibly with a whole new arrangement. How is any of this even possible?Levitin starts his exploration of music by talking about what music actually is, taking us through the terminology of music and looking a little at the physics of music too. For example, I only had a vague understanding of timbre before reading this. I certainly didn't know that instruments resonate simultaneously on multiple frequencies, and that these frequencies are all multiples of each other (i.e. a tuba resonates on 200hz, and 400hz, 600hz, 800hz, and so on), and that the strength of each frequency can vary, and that this pattern is what gives each instrument its individual auditory flavour, or timbre. However, nobody's ever rushed out to buy a copy of Now That's What I Call A Mathematically Balanced Series Of Vibrations. Describing music as an external phenomenon is the easy bit; the rest of the book is about describing what happens in the brain when it encounters music, and this is a bit of a challenge because nobody really knows very much about how the brain does anything. Levitin is something of a dualist, taking care to separate out the neurological stuff from the discussions of higher-level cognitive functions, or the hardware from the software, as it were. The software side of things is especially fascinating, mainly because of the things we take for granted which are maddeningly complicated. For example, consider something that people do millions of times each day all over the world, which is to sing ""Happy Birthday"". The process is normally: somebody will pick a note at random, hold it for a second while everyone joins in, and then the entire group will create a new arrangement for the song based on that starting note. We all do this perfectly and without hesitation every time, yet most of us insist that we have no musical ability.Levitin mentions a conversation with a colleague who was studying a remote tribe, and confused everyone by telling them he couldn't sing. To them, singing was like walking and talking, it's just a basic element of normal human existence. The fact that our society has decided that music-making is a restricted activity, only appropriate for experts, is a cultural oddity. Every human has a extraordinary sophisticated understanding of music, as evidenced by a number of studies that Levitin walks us through. Even the ability to have an earworm, annoying as it might be, is a unique cognitive process unlike any other. Music is different from any other kind of stimulus, on a neurological level, because it seems to activate every part of the brain simultaneously. Left and right hemisphere, amygdala and frontal lobes, they all light up when you hear banging choons. Maybe that's why listening to music can be so overwhelming, and carry people out of themselves in a way that no other artform can.Levitin tries to explore the hardware side of things, but is hampered by the fact that nobody truly understands the brain. He attempts to use evolutionary psychology to build a theory about why music pleases us so much, and this is mainly based around how rhythm was an important part of assessing threats in auditory data when we were in the early mammalian stage, and that music gently subverts our expectations of rhythm in a way that tickles us. Is any of that true? I'm always a little suspicious of such explanations. The truth is that this book doesn't offer very many answers, but it asks some fascinating questions that make you realise how miraculous music is. Yes, even Justin Bieber."
294,0525949690,http://goodreads.com/user/show/109224631-brian-fox,3,"This is Your Brain on Music: The Science of a Human Obsession by Daniel J. Letvin delves into the science behind the human brain and its innate ability to pick up on patterns, recognize variations, and distinguish good versus bad music (a highly subjective topic nonetheless covered well). While the book is intriguing to the reader, Letvin perhaps spends too much time in the depths of musical minushia, at times making the book a rather dry read for those without the knowledge required to appreciate the detail in which he is describing. However, it is certainly captivating to the sort of person with even novice level prior knowledge of music theory. Another shortcoming of the book is the way Letvin seems to get sidetracked throughout the book, allowing himself to get caught up in minute, trivial details of his personal accounts and leaving the reader to make minimally book related inferences. The overall quality of the book is enhanced through its conversion to an audio book, as this is a book about music and reading notes on a page is an entirely different experience than listening to the music samples which coincide with the book content. Letvin does well to offer the reader context in the beginning of the book, by dedicating paragraph by paragraph to definitions of certain music related vocabulary some readers would have otherwise been lost on, such as timbre, contour, reverberation, meter, and pitch. While these words individually make sense to many readers, the lengthy definitions provide more specific detail and serve only to aid Letvin throughout the book. Overall, while the book may at times be a bit dry, anyone with an interest in music theory and how it affects the brain, anyone interested in neuroscience and human obsession, or anyone interested in how these two topics relate to one another will be pleased with this book."
295,0525949690,http://goodreads.com/user/show/33412063-minh,4,Took me years to finish this but I'll probably read it again.
296,0525949690,http://goodreads.com/user/show/31899243-kelli-thompson,1,"I did not finish this book because it's utter crap. As soon as he said that ""all life is sacred"" after a 50 page rant about how he went to Stanford and his half assed attempts and explaining music without actually showing to us, I cannot continue to hear his philosophical opinions about how music connects us to our inner selves. I wanted neuroscience dammit. I got psychology mixed with philosophy. This book feels like his tribute to himself and his own greatness, spending 90 pages to show us exactly one thing that I was interested in. I will seek my information elsewhere. I will likely be able to get twice as much information in a fourth of the space with none of the stupid preaching. "
297,0525949690,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3024716-geoffrey-fox,4,"Hard to believe, but this book is as good as its blurbs. Levitin is both a musician and a neuroscientist, who got into the science to understand better the music he was playing or engineering for rock bands. He knows far more music than I do, drawing on all genres to illustrate what it does, how it does it and why it matters. ""Musical activity involves nearly every region of the brain that we know about, and nearly every neural subsystem."" (pp. 85-86) And, he argues (against Pinker and other skeptics), it is not a superfluous byproduct of evolution, but has been essential to our survival and most probably, as Darwin himself believed, is even older than language.Just how do we remember songs, even when the pitch, rhythm and timbre are all altered? And just what are pitch, rhythm and timbre, and how do they affect our brains? And why do you like heavy metal (or whatever you like), while I … well, many other things? These are just some of the mysteries that scientists are beginning to solve.And what must occur in the brain for a musician to achieve full physical skill (of voice, strings, horn, whatever) and sensibility? It takes at least 10,000 hours of practice, says Levitin, for the brain to achieve complete mastery of anything (auto mechanics, fiction writing, musical composition or performance, or anything else). ""Although people differ in how long it takes them to consolidate information neurally, it remains true that increased practice leads to a greater number of neural traces, which can combine to create a stronger memory representation."" (p. 197) Talent — a genetic predisposition, that difference in learning time he mentions — is a big help, but it's not enough without practice. Levitin's style is lively, his examples well chosen (even though I didn't recognize all the music he expected me to know), and his openness to examining contrary hypotheses makes him a credible guide. I especially appreciated his comments on performance and how a musician learns new pieces, by ""chunking"" — that is, learning whole groups or sequences of chords, melodies, etc. rather than all the individual notes a beginning piano player struggles to memorize. And best of all, the sheer emotion of listening and playing. That's what I want to hold on to as I get back to practicing. And I now have a clearer idea of the ""schema"" to listen for in classic jazz (I sort of knew, but never had it explained before) and how to appreciate the clever transformation Mahler achieves in his Fifth, or what and how Joni Mitchell accomplishes with her alternative guitar tunings. So why four and not five stars? My very personal reaction: the first couple of chapters were too cute and anecdotal, an unnecessary (for me) warm-up for the truly informative, analytical stuff to come. But if you've never thought much about notes or scales or timbre, maybe you'll need that. "
298,0525949690,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5128053-drew-patrick-smith,4,"Review from the PFS Book Club...What I Liked: For a science book that had to deal with two horribly advanced sets of terminology (music terms and anatomy terms), this book was utterly readable. From what could have been a horrible mess of confusion, Levitin manages to create a straight-forward, well-planned book that covers a variety of topics that generally makes sense to the reader. And the bonus is that the book covers topics that your everyday person would find interesting, as his base of musical knowledge is so broad that he can explain the science without talking down to the reader.The breadth of topics broached in this book are also quite impressive, with the 9 chapters divided up into smaller sections. Levitin conveys a lot of information in a short space (the book isn't really that long for nonfiction) and does so with a down-to-earth tone that I think a lot of readers would enjoy. This isn't a professor talking to a student, but rather an expert teaching their friend about what they do.I also truly appreciated the way Levitin looks at both science and music. There's this awe in his tone that must come from the author naturally, because that's the way he feels - there's no guile or trickery-in-style here, just straight-forward love of what he does. And the way he can describe the music of the Beatles, Bach, or Bon Jovi in equal terms is refreshing. All music for Levitin is worthwhile, from prehuman drumming to the atonal madness of the 20th century. And it's that appreciation for his subject that brings this book to a higher level.What I Didn't Like: The book goes by too fast. There's so much in here, that Levitin sometimes does get lost in his topics - going on too long in some sections about music terminology that didn't even grab my attention as a musician or a long discussion on the anatomy of the brain, throwing out way too many words that the average reader won't take the time to understand. When he gets into these pigeon-holed segments, especially in comparison to the other parts of the book where he's so focused, the reader (like me) will start to skim and probably miss something important.Last Thought: If you love music and want to feel smart at a dinner party, this is a good place to go."
299,0525949690,http://goodreads.com/user/show/217489-naeem,2,"I was keen on this book in the beginning for two reasons. First, it give me the basics of music theory 101 in a concise manner. I really needed that. Second, and more important, he went to some length to separate the universal elements of music from the culturally relative aspects. For example, an octave, he argues is a quality of sound itself -- an aspect of the physical world. But how different societies treat octaves depends on their musical traditions. Levitin is very compelling and clear in his explanations. But at some point I grew tired, then annoyed, and then a touch angry. Tired because while Levitin says that he wants to talk NOT about the brain but instead about the mind, he spends most of his energy talking about the brain. For Levitin the mind is the entity that makes the different parts of the brain into a whole. For me, mind is a historical, cultural, and psychological entity. So while I appreciated learning about what brain scientists have done with music, that isn't really where my interests are. Annoyed because, as a former rock musician, engineer, and producer he constantly references artists who are mostly white and north american. He gives examples of music that I consider to be anti-music (a term coined by Mat Callahan in his  Trouble with Music). And finally angry, because, as much as he doesn't want to, and as much as he would be astounded at the my accusation, Levitin produces a book that ignores the fuller world of music. It would be like writing a book on trees that concentrated mostly on trees in north America. Maybe he doesn't know anything else. But I happen to think that a focus on so called hard sciences is actually a way to avoid world politics.Finally, for me, music is tied up with the divine and the sacred. And this too he ignores. "
