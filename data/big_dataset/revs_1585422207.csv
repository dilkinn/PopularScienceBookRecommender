Molecules versus MalariaNow, I happened to (mostly) enjoy my time spent in the trenches of orgo, so I'm looking forward to reading this book. Post-reading: this is fantastic. There's often been too much separation between hard science and 'real life', as it were, and this book blends the two beautifully in illustrating chemistry's role in historical happenings. Chemistry is far more than just those reactions and diagrams we learned by rote and weren't applied to much except exams. This book breathes life into these molecules, integrates them into a bigger picture in a way I found extremely pleasing. My only wish is that there were more than seventeen molecules covered. Also, forget about the buttons. They're an introductory anecdote, and there's so much more to this book than that. "

I'd recommend it for teenagers who want to learn some chemistry before taking a class in high school. Here are a few interesting tidbits from the book: Is it possible that the buttons on Napolean's troops' jackets moving into Russia disintegrated in the cold? Maybe. But it was also a stupid military move. People hung nutmeg around the neck to ward off bubonic plague. It may have warded off fleas. Ships were manned above capacity to take into account the loss of sailors to scurvy. As many as 30 to 50 percent would die. The officers were more likely to eat fruits and vegetables, so avoided scurvy. The sailors wanted meat. Vitamin C got its name because it was the 3rd vitamin identified. Mistakes were made, so we have all the B vitamin numbers. High doses of vitamin C are not necessary. Better to have C at different times of day. Scott's men had scurvy trying to reach the South Pole. Thus they were weak at the end and surrendered to death. Amundsen ate foods that protected against scurvy. Brazilian slave ships had over 500 men in a room of nine hundred square feet and three feet high. The water used to manufacture gunpowder was often urine of the workers. A heavy wine drinker was believed to produce potent gunpowder. Same with a clergyman, even better was a bishop. Fritz Haber won the 1918 Nobel Prize for chemistry. It aroused protest because Haber played a significant role in Germany's poison gas program in WWI. He didn't see it as any different than any other way of dying in war. He did have the courage to refuse to fire Jews in his factory. Many elephants were killed for ivory to make billiard balls. Charles Goodyear made minimal money on his rubber efforts, but those he sold the rights to became wealthy. He actually spent much time in debtor's prison. Whole villages hid from the Belgians who wanted them to harvest rubber. Those who didn't do enough harvesting had their hands cut off. Not sure why the author fails to mention the Vietnam War when he discusses rubber plantations in Southeast Asia. Mythology credits the discovery of Tyrian purple to the dog of Hercules. Its mouth stained a deep purple after it crunched on some shellfish. The Phoenicians needed some 9,000 shellfish to produce one gram of Tyrian purple. The creature almost became extinct. Alexander the Great dyed his soldiers uniforms red to pretend to be injured. They could then surprise the Persian army. The largest saltpan in the world is in Salar de Uyuni in Bolivia where tourists can stay in a hotel made entirely of salt. Just be careful when you say, ""Pass the salt, please."""

Couteur/Burreson beautifully provided a look at how history was affected along with an examination of the actual molecules---and I do mean a microscopic look at the molecule! I'm a history geek so I adored that side and, it's saying something, when the authors can provide the science side well enough that I enjoyed it (since I really hate science!).The first part of each chapter begins with a look at how the chemical affected or could have affected history while the second part analyzes the molecule making up the chemical. Of course, each chapter may veer off, depending upon the story behind the chemical's evolution.Overall, the authors look at how the creation/discovery/need of each chemical affected the world: ""...tell[ing] the stories of the fascinating connections between chemical structures and historical episodes.""The effect of tin on Roman expansion and the defeat of Napoleon's soldiers. Consider the reasons why Columbus sailed the ocean blue in search of a faster route for spices; and, the authors provide a variety of reasons why nutmeg and pepper was so highly valued. Breaking it down to the isoeugenol and its benefits.Yes, the title mentions seventeen molecules, but each is simply a category heading for a great range of variations on that particular molecule. For example, Peppers, Nutmeg, and Cloves are classed under piperine and encompasses paprika, chili peppers, peppercorns, and ginger. Consider the rise of the Dutch and British East India Companies with their focus on spice and their forced colonization of so many nations. The truth of how Manhattan became an English colony. Malaria and how it forced a genetic evolution around the Mediterranean, Africa, and the Middle East which was a contributing factor that led to the slave trade. Consider the effect of gunpowder in both destruction and construction as well as how it affected travel! Then there's nitro compounds: explosives, sunscreen, Viagra and other medications, and Alfred Nobel and his Nobel Prize. The development of ammonia and its uses in man-made fertilizer...and the gases used in World War I.Just reading about the effects of scurvy and how different seafarers/countries dealt with it. How it almost ended the Age of Discovery begun by the search for spices. Think of the movie Master and Commander and the repartee over ""the lesser of the two weevils""! One of the reasons why Cook was so successful! And how different it could have been if the Dutch had discovered how to prevent scurvy before the British.If you're fascinated with how things work or how they're discovered, you'll be thrilled with this book. Sch√∂nbein certainly got a bang out of it when he discovered guncotton. A chemical that led to photography and the movie industry, rayon, and cellophane as well as the Industrial Revolution and the American Civil War. Consider the effects of the Industrial Revolution on rural depopulation, the rise of the factory and inventions along with social change. I also enjoyed how the authors slid from one chapter to the next. The subject of the previous chapter leading into the next. You'd never expect a connection between gunpowder and silk! Nor expect that silk was an important aspect of the Renaissance. I loved the molecular explanation of silk as it explained why silk is so highly valued.Readers interested in medicine will adore the history and evolution of the medical field. Most people are aware of Louis Pasteur and his contribution, Jenner and his vaccine, but there is also Lister's carbolic acid and the benefits of coal tar and how it led to the antiseptic operating room. The molecular analysis for these phenols lead to vanillin, capsaicin, zingerone, explosives, chocolate, perfume, marijuana, Bakelite, and so much more! Elephants certainly have reason to be grateful!LOL, I'm only halfway through my notes...! You'll just hafta read this one. It's worth it.There's the rise of the German pharmaceutical empire, how synthesizing a dye led to the creation of synthetic organic chemistry---where would Bayer be without Perkin!If you're curious about life at all, you want to read Napoleon's Buttons. I highly recommend it! It's a buy for me if only for its possibilities for conflicts for a book series I'm working on!The CoverThe cover is a blend of two areas of study: history with the cropped portrait of Napoleon in his 19th century study with the marble-like structure of atoms above representing the science.The title is more of an enticement than truth as the authors use the raw materials in Napoleon's Buttons to speculate and lure the reader in.

5,1585422207,http://goodreads.com/user/show/936038-lori,0,"I have a degree in chemistry and I love to read about chemistry and the history of chemistry. I was so excited when I heard about this book! Unfortunately, it was a huge disappointment for me.Let me start by saying that this book is NOT the story of how 17 molecules changed history. A simple look at the chapter titles will tell you that:1. Peppers, Nutmeg, and Cloves2. Ascorbic Acid3. Glucose4. Cellulose5. Nitro Compounds6. Silk and Nylon7. Phenol8. Isoprene9. Dyes10. Wonder Drugs11. The Pill12. Molecules of Witchcraft13. Morphine, Nicotine, and Caffeine14. Oleic Acid15. Salt16. Chlorocarbon Compounds17. Molecules Versus Malaria The authors admit, in their introduction, that most of the book is about groups of molecules rather than specific molecules. I figured maybe this wasn't such a big deal, so I decided to try reading it anyway.I read the first 5 chapters (about 100 pages) and was just bored with it. The story about Napoleon's Buttons was conveyed in the introduction, and none of the other stories were even close to interesting. The chapters focused primarily on the *development* of the molecules themselves and, while the authors were careful to make their point that the molecule(s) did in fact change history, the stories they told to support that claim were flat, underdeveloped, and uninteresting.Here is an example of what seemed to be a typical chapter, the chapter about glucose:First, one quickly discovers that even some of the chapters named for a single molecule turn into a discussion of related molecules. That is true for this chapter. Besides the fact that a large portion of the chapter is devoted to topics such as ""Sweet Chemistry"" (which necessarily involves molecules besides glucose,) it only took the authors two paragraphs to start discussing sucrose. They give precedence to glucose, however, because it is a component of sucrose... even though the two are technically different molecules. Among other things, they go on to discuss the slave-supported sugar industry (which would have been the sugar called sucrose) and how that industry changed the world. The idea, at the end of the chapter is this: we eat a lot of sugar, we have a lot of health problems because of sugar, it is a commodity that greatly affects economies around the world, it has (and does) relied on slave labor for its production: So, as you can clearly see, it has changed history. Really? How many things can we NOT make such general statements about?Very disappointing."
6,1585422207,http://goodreads.com/user/show/366133-rex,3,"This books takes a somewhat disjointed ride through how seventeen loosely defined classes of molecules changed world history.I was intrigued by the book's premise - not to describe the history of chemistry, but rather to reveal the chemistry of history. The book does an admirable job of assembling anecdotes of interesting molecules that have affected our world. Unfortunately, the structure of the book is a bit disjointed, the tone is uneven, and the numerous stories could use either some additional background or some helpful editing. While I am uncertain about the background of the authors, it did feel like the book could benefit from the help of a bona fide historian who could help place events more objectively into historical context. Also, I would have preferred footnotes on each page instead of only a bibliography at the end of the book. The chapters are as follows:1. Peppers, Nutmeg and Cloves (the spice trade, and world travel)2. Ascorbic Acid (preventing scurvy)3. Glucose (slavery and sugar cultivation, artificial sweeteners)4. Cellulose (cotton/industrial revolution, guncotton)5. Nitro Compounds (explosives, Roger Bacon/gunpowder, Alfred Nobel, Fritz Haber)6. Silk and Nylon (silkworm, Wallace Carothers)7. Phenol (antiseptic, THC, plastics, bakelite, lignin)8. Isoprene (rubber, Charles Goodyear, stretchiness, gum, synthetic rubber)9. Dyes (German dye companies)10. Wonder Drugs (aspirin, sulfa drugs, penicillins)11. The Pill (steroids, Russell Marker, Carl Djerassi)12. Molecules of Witchcraft (strychnine, hyoscine, LSD)13. Morphine, Nicotine, and Caffeine (Opium Wars)14. Oleic Acid (Olive oil, trans/cis, unsaturated/saturated, soap)15. Salt (purification, trade, structure, tax, physiology)16. Chlorocarbon Compounds (refrigeration, CFCs, pesticides, anesthesia)17. Molecules versus Malaria (synthesis of quinine)"

What I've had a problem with was when the book was getting all technical and shit. When they'd mention a bunch of scientific shit that I have no clue about and really get into it with it all the while I cannot follow, and I eventually have to turn to Google to tell me what's what and whatnot.Also, me being me, I was searching a bunch of historical moments mentioned and well, even though it would left me amazed if something happened because of something simple based on science back in the days (like Napoleon losing the war because of loose buttons on every soldier for example) well, yeah.. most of my searches were like proven wrong or false and that there was no way for something like that to happen. But hey, I think half of them were at least plausible to happen or to have happened.Overall it was too much for me and were kinda bored half the time, not too engaging, but I'm sure lots of people who are more into this shit would like it better. Oh well! +1 star because I'm nice like that. "
8,1585422207,http://goodreads.com/user/show/760700-ray,2,"""Napoleon's Buttons"" had the potential to be a most interesting book, covering discoveries of new materials, chemicals, and medicines over the past several hundred years. Examples of topics covered include:--- How European demand for the spice molecule piperine (the basic molecule of pepper) not only fueled early exploration, but also inspired the practice of buying and selling shares in the modern stock market. --- How a minor housecleaning mishap and an exploding cotton apron led to the development of modern explosive and contributed to the photography and movie industries. --- Why isoeugenol is the reason people who live in Manhattan can call themselves New Yorkers instead of New Amsterdamers.But as the book's subtitle indicates, the stories get down to real details of the molecules.  And unfortunately for me, since I listened to the book in audiobook format, the verbal descriptions of the chemical compounds, and detailing how the carbon, oxygen, hydrogen atoms are bonded to each other was hard to visualize, and my mind quickly drifted. For example, in one section on Polysaccharides, the author writes: Though we lack the enzyme that breaks down a beta linkage, we do have a digestive enzyme that splits an alpha linkage. The alpha configuration is found in the storage polysaccharides, starch and glycogen. One of our major dietary sources of glucose, starch is found in roots, tubers, and seeds of many plants. It consists of two slightly different polysaccharide molecules, both polymers of alpha-glucose units. Twenty to thirty percent of starch is made up of amylose, an unbranched chain of several thousand glucose units joined between carbon number 4 on one glucose and carbon number 1 on the next glucose. The only difference between and cellulose is that in amylose the linkages are alpha and in cellulose they are beta. But the roles played by cellulose and amylose polysaccharides are vastly different. Amylopectin forms the remaining 70 to 80 percent of starch. It also consists of long chains of alpha-glucose units joined between carbons number 1 and number 4, but amylopectin is a branched molecule with cross linkages, between the carbon number 1 of one glucose unit and carbon number 6 of another glucose unit, occurring every twenty to twenty-five glucose units. The presence of up to a million glucose units in interconnecting chains makes amylopectin one of the largest molecules found in nature. To be fair, diagrams of these long chained molecules are shown in the book, which can aid in understanding the text, but you're on your own when listening to the book without the visuals, it's hard to follow. So clearly, the format, audiobook vs. print, played a part in my loss of attention. However, on the positive side, I found that by listening to the book as I went to bed ended up being an excellent way to fall asleep. As the reader droned on, I rarely stayed awake for longer than 60 seconds. Therefore, unless you have a true passion for chemistry, I found this book, in audiobook format, would be welcomed by insomniacs, but few others."
9,1585422207,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6201603-mimi-wolske,5,"Napoleon's Buttons: 17 molecules that changed historyPenn7 Le Couteur & Jay Burresboncopyright: 2003pages: 376Ohhh, so that's why that happened! I had a lot of those moments as I read the little details that huge events turned on; yes, even when they were chemistry related. The book talked about the chemical history of silk and nylon, of certain spices, and the witch trials. AND, it flowed easily and managed to keep the technical jargon to a minimum. That made the information presented accessible and understandable for someone like me‚Äîa nonchemist. BUT, there was enough science for the info presented to be credible. If you need more, the authors provided pages of their ""selected bibliography"" at the back of the book.I found it an entertaining and thought-provoking look at chemical compounds and the roles they played in historical events; e.g., the O-ring failure on the NASA space shuttle and some other unintended consequences relating to the chemical properties of materials.Some might be put off because the title story is only about 2 pages of the intro and because it comes with the authors' admission that the theory of Napoleon's buttons being his army's downfall is of doubtful authenticity. BUT, those buttons are a metaphor for the power of chemical compounds to affect the fates of civilizations. After reading the book, most people will understand that.What drew me to the book, recommended to me by Max H. (Richard Wolfe), was one of the stories he put into a reader's digest version: Sooo, ""there are claims the first olive tree grew on top of Adam's grave."" Who knew? I didn't. Anyway, ""it subsequently became so important to the growth of civilizations in the Mediterranean that the authors confidently wrote that without oleic acid Western civilization and democracy might has followed a different path...a VERY different path.""this book is about more than science; there's history here, too. For example, the decline of the Roman Empire, the discovery of America, and the riots of the French Revolution; that's just a few of a host of historical events profoundly touched by one molecule or another. And there is also the fun ""could-be"" stories. I liked the one about the dinosaurs' inability to detect the bitter taste of alkaloid poisons in new flowering plants ... that may have helped lead to their extinction. This is one of those books you can read a story and then set it down and read something else before coming back and reading another fascinating story/account."
10,1585422207,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1012410-kelley,4,"The title of this book may put some readers off but for those that like looking at history as more than just a bunch of dates and dead people, it is a fascinating read.The title comes from speculation that the tin buttons used by the French army may have decomposed as result from exposure to bitter cold during the Invasion of Russia. When Napoleon's Buttons (or at least those of his army) crumbled, the soldiers could not keep their coats closed and thus were further exposed to the weather. By looking other similar events and developements, the author demonstrates and speculates on how some basic chemicals and chemisty have or may have altered history.It is not a chemistry book, but some knowledge of chemistry is helpful But even without that knowledge (and I am not a chemist other than chemistry that involves ethyl alcohol), the reader can understand why certain compounds, chemicals, and elements enfluenced events through time.I found it very interesting and even entertaining."
11,1585422207,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7027650-amanda,4,"It is a personal milestone for me to have finally read this book. One of my college professors was the one to recommend the book to me. And it reminded me of another professor of mine, who taught a course that was more technical, but he would stop and tell stories like this book of chemicals in the ‚Äúreal world‚Äù."
12,1585422207,http://goodreads.com/user/show/796216-tim,3,"On one level, fascinating. It is about scientific discovery of molecules, the search to synthesize, and the properties that make certain substances extremely valuable and useful.Thus, for example, the probing and understanding the value of absorbic acid (vitamin C) and how it works on the human body. Its discovery and value stemmed from the debilitating and deadly presence of scurvy - the nemesis of sailors - and its use removed one of the challenges of exploration. Napolean's army lost reliable winter wear during the march into Russia during 1812, because buttons for overcoats were made from tin. Tin degrades in cold weather ... etc. The list of molecules goes on. Nitrogen and its various molecular forms is the basis for gunpowder and viagra (for example.) Then there's cellulose, glucose, isoprene (the elasticity that allows tires, and seals), along with wonder drugs such as penicillin, and the molecular dynamics behind ""the pill."" As I said fascinating, and YET, it is a nerdy book. What the world looks like through the eyes of the chemist..."
13,1585422207,http://goodreads.com/user/show/14716368-colin,3,"Overall the strengths of this book lie in the explanation of the chemistry, and not in the account of history. I cannot disagree that the molecules chosen by the authors have greatly impacted history, but at times they appeared to stretch to make them seem more important. Two small things stood out from the historical perspective that occasionally made me put the book down and walk away for awhile: first, the authors regularly made unsupported hypotheses about how theoretical changes would have had a defined major, world-altering effect on history (a change may have occurred, but no one could specifically predict what); and second, there seems to be a critical misunderstanding of what the term ""life-expectancy"" means to a historian (it does NOT mean that the majority of the population were expected to die at a particular age, but is an average that can be highly skewed by childhood mortalities, war, etc.)."

Indeed: I was a slacker and I have never-ever taken a chemistry class. Which could be why I liked this so much; somehow it was presented in a way that was just right for me.I had assumed that I was going to sail through life interested but forever dumb in regards to chemistry. Basically, I would be restricted to reading biographies about chemists and what they did, never really grasping any of it. So this was the first time it felt like anything I have read about chemistry 'clicked.' Granted, it took me a loooong while of staring at super-simple diagrams to finally see what was being explained, but, hey: I finally saw what was being explained! YESSS"
15,1585422207,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7536258-jane,5,"This book is an unusual take on history. You don't have to be a scientist to enjoy it -- but it helps if you are a little bit interested in chemistry, too. The title is illustrative: We all know that thousands of Napoleon's men died on the long march back from a Russian defeat in winter. But did you know that the army's uniforms had buttons made of tin? Tin crumbles like an old cookie when the temperature falls below a certain point. So Napoleon's men could not keep their coats buttoned and froze to death faster. A molecule was instrumental in the death toll. "

17,1585422207,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2075717-robert-b,4,"This is a fascinating book about the ways in which the chemical structures of molecules have had an impact on western civilization. As the authors note, ‚ÄúA change as small as the position of a bond ‚Äì the link between atoms in a molecule ‚Äì can lead to enormous differences in properties of a substance and in turn influence the course of history.‚Äù (p. 6)The title of the book derives from a discredited theory that Napoleon‚Äôs disastrous Russian campaign was at least partially due to the disintegration of the tin buttons on the uniforms of his soldiers in the extremely low temperatures of the 1812 Russian winter. From this story, the authors go on to examine the importance of the chemistry of various molecules and compounds in human history.For example ‚Ä¶ - Cotton ‚Äúbreathes‚Äù because on the outside of the bundles of cellulose chains that form the cotton fibers are OH groups that attract water molecules and give cotton its high absorbency, which is what the ‚Äúbreathing‚Äù is all about.- Cotton manufacturing centered on Lancashire, England, partly because the damp climate there helped cotton fibers stick together, thereby making it less likely that threads would break during the spinning and weaving processes.- Rubber‚Äôs lack of resistance to the cold led to the failure of the O-rings that caused the explosion of the space shuttle Challenger.- The chemical structure of sulfanilamide is similar to that of p-aminobenzoic acid, an essential nutrient for many bacterial organisms, thus giving sulfanilamide its antimicrobial properties.- The instability of the ùõÉ-lactam ring of penicillin leads to the deactivation of enzymes that form the cell walls in bacteria, leading to penicillin‚Äôs effectiveness.- Penicillin-resistant bacteria strains have developed an enzyme that breaks open the ùõÉ-lactam ring of penicillin before it can deactivate the cell wall forming enzymes.- Soap cleans because one end of the molecule has a charge and dissolves in water while the other end is not soluble in water but does dissolve in grease, oil, and fat.- The solubility of sodium chloride makes salt a good preservative because it attracts water molecules and removes water from the meat and fish being preserved, thereby making it difficult for the bacteria that cause decay to survive.There are also little tidbits scattered throughout the text. For instance, belladonna derives its name from the Italian for ‚Äúbeautiful lady,‚Äù because women in Italy used drops from the juice of the berries of deadly nightshade to dilate their pupils, thus enhancing their beauty. Chocolate contains a compound, anandamide, which binds to the same brain receptor as THC, the active ingredient in marijuana. Oliver Cromwell‚Äôs death from malaria in 1658 may have been caused by his refusal to take ‚ÄúJesuit‚Äôs powder,‚Äù a remedy based on the bark of the quina tree in Peru. The British habit of taking quinine to protect against malaria in the colonies evolved into the drink, gin and tonic. Resistance to malaria, related to sickle cell anemia, led to the rapid growth of the African slave trade in the 17th century.No book is perfect, though, and the potential reader should be aware of the following:- While enjoyable, the book is not always an easy read. There are a good number of chemical terms and drawings of complex molecules that may be difficult for many non-technical readers to understand.- In some cases, the authors don‚Äôt explain the chemical mechanisms enough. For example, they note that digitalis and other cardiac-related molecules have a similar structure, but they fail to discuss why those structures affect the heart. Likewise, they note that benzocaine, novocaine, and lidocaine block transmission of nerve impulses but don‚Äôt relate this effect to the chemical structure of those molecules. Again, they point out that caffeine blocks the effect of the neuromodulator adenosine in the brain, but they fail to explain just how this happens chemically.- While there is a selected bibliography, there are no footnotes or endnotes. Consequently, the reader cannot easily find sources that go into more detail about matters raised in the text.As might be expected, some chapters are more interesting than others. The chapters on nitro compounds (gunpowder, nitroglycerin, TNT, etc.), silk and nylon, phenol, the ‚Äúmolecules of witchcraft,‚Äù addictive substances (morphine, nicotine, and caffeine), and malaria were the best."

19,1585422207,http://goodreads.com/user/show/33640337-jake,4,"The book connects the micro (chemistry) to the macro (history). Most of the connections are fascinating, if at times a bit of a stretch.

Some aspects of life were much worse in the past. The book‚Äôs other chapters discussed the historical relevance of nutmeg, sugar, cotton, nitro compounds, silk, nylon, plastics, rubber, dyes, morphine, olive oil, salt, and CFCs.‚ÄúHistorical events almost always have more than one cause, so it would be far too simplistic to attribute the events mentioned in this book solely to chemical structures. But neither is it an exaggeration to say that chemical structures have played an essential and often unrecognized role in the development of civilization. When a chemist determines the structure of a different natural product or synthesizes a new compound, the effect of a small chemical change‚Äìa double bond moves here, an oxygen atom substituted there, an alteration to a side group‚Äìoften seems of little consequence. It is only with hindsight that we recognize the momentous effect that very small chemical changes can have.‚Äù"

This book pressed all my buttons and I read it like a gripping novel. What a treat."
21,1585422207,http://goodreads.com/user/show/21918756-gina-johnson,4,AmblesideOnline year 8 book. I read this over several months with some other moms. The stories in it are very interesting and the chemistry is quite thorough for something that isn‚Äôt a chemistry book. I‚Äôm glad that I‚Äôve read it once and I will probably still pre-read in another year when Kessa gets to it. It could be a ‚Äúlight‚Äù read if you skim all the chemistry talk and just read the stories but if you really read it all and try to understand it it took a decent amount of brain power (at least for me. I had one chemistry class in high school and one in college).

This perspective was a bit overblown, but the connections that they highlighted between molecules were interesting, the historical perspectives were sometimes surprising, and there were plenty of facts that I would love to make a trivia quiz around. I was very happy to see chemical structures but was a little disappointed by how a decent number were a bit warped."

I am now printing out that sentence so I can eat it. This was one of the most original spins on world history that I have ever read.Drs. Le Couteur and Burreson do indeed fill a hefty number of pages with diagrams of chemical structures and formulae but none of them are essential to the understanding of this book. It is absolutely a book on history, not chemistry and all their geeky stuff simply breaks down the thesis that a tiny difference in the bond between two molecules could have massive impact on the entire planet. Had tin, which made up the buttons of Napoleon‚Äôs fearsome army, not crumbled to dust at low temperatures, soldiers may not have frozen to death during the Russian winter and France may have come to dominate the universe instead of England. I know I‚Äôm praying to the gods of tin now."

Honestly never took time to think of how items like silk, a basic and simple protein, shaped the world. A very cool read for the science-minded. The book constantly dives into the chemical structures of compounds and how this helps their success in our world. It also explains many interesting phenomena (ex. The sugar molecules glucose, fructose, and galactose each ""fit"" to a chemical receptor in our sweet taste buds. However, ethylene glycol, which is found in anti-freeze, contains a similar structure and would also make it taste sweet)."

I picked up this book thinking it would talk a lot more of organic chemistry and going deeper than what was usually written for us the casual reader. I would like to learn more without I'm having to go back to college for it. At glanced it was very promising but in the end it just fell short. Three stars on this aspect.

32,1585422207,http://goodreads.com/user/show/98176236-sayoni,3,"Penny Le Couteur and Jay Burreson‚Äôs Napoleon‚Äôs Buttons provides readers with a view of both science and history that is often neglected. Le Couteur and Burreson weave unique details about history into the novel while simultaneously expressing the significance of the seventeen molecule groups attributed to in the title. In many cases, those molecules crucially changed the course of history. For example, the fall of the Roman Empire can be blamed on lead poisoning. Lead acetate was used to sweeten their wine. Lead containers were used to store these drinks, and water often reached homes through lead pipes. All of the above mentioned systems were mostly available to wealthy aristocrats, and eventually, symptoms of lead poisoning became prominent in leaders such as Emperor Nero, leading to the empire‚Äôs collapse. Additionally, Napoleon‚Äôs soldiers‚Äô weakness was partially due to inefficient tin buttons on their coats. The extremely frigid temperatures led the buttons to crumble, making the soldiers unable to properly contain heat. This detail is just one of the many interesting points included in the book. The importance of precision and accuracy were also explored in Napoleon‚Äôs Buttons. One chapter of the book discussed the accident involving the space shuttle, Challenger. This section explained that a mere temperature difference affected rubber seals such that its pliability was crucially altered, leading to the tragic explosion. Unusual, intriguing facts are presented in Napoleon‚Äôs Buttons, and the connections made between history and the seventeen molecules is eye-opening. The above examples are only samples from book with a vast collection of enlightening information. From tin buttons to the cause of the Salem Witch trials to hotels made of salt, the information amounts to a broader understanding of the application of not only chemistry, but science as a whole and history as well. Napoleon‚Äôs Buttons allows readers not only to learn, but more importantly, to enjoy learning.I would give this book 3 out of 5 stars, because although it included many fascinating details, at times, I was reminded of reading a textbook. The format of the book sometimes mirrors the format of a textbook, and this caused my mind to drift at times. There was so much information presented in each section of the novel that it could become difficult to digest. Also, some of the points seemed disconnected and did not always flow smoothly. For example, an inventor would be briefly mentioned, and the following sentence would not further discuss his/her accomplishments. The next page would jump to the name of a company or another scientist‚Äôs name. These details seemed to be plopped into the book and did not quite have a purpose. If the goal was to credit those individuals, then that could have been accomplished another way. I found myself distracted by those names because they did not contribute to my understanding of the information presented. When the images of the molecular structures were shown, it was difficult to connect that back to the passage, as the relation between the structure and its significance was not always made explicit. Personally, the structures did not consistently aid my understanding of the book. I expected them to be supplementary, but did not feel that was the case while reading. An abundance of facts and knowledge became slightly overwhelming. However, the book was still an enjoyable read. Having a basic understanding of chemistry helped me to appreciate it more. Napoleon‚Äôs Buttons allowed me to marvel at the possibilities of science that I had previously been oblivious to. Overall, this book led me to the realization that science truly is ubiquitous."
33,1585422207,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5396658-paulo-limp,4,"	Napoleon‚Äôs Buttons is a great example of a 'trivia book'. This is a book where you learn lots of interesting facts, but just tidbits of information. So, great to impress friends and relatives at a dinner table‚Ä¶ and that‚Äôs it.	This books mixes History and Chemistry (mostly Organic Chemistry), picking up substances precious to mankind, describing both the historical relevance associated with the ‚Äústuff‚Äù, and its chemical structure. It is advisable to have at least some basic knowledge in both disciplines to fully enjoy the book (no need for a degree, though). Its title relates to the fact that La Grand Arme√© wore uniforms with Tin buttons ‚Äì however Tin becomes breakable under very low temperatures ‚Äì Russian-style low temperatures. This could have led to the soldiers losing their coats and capes just when they needed them the most ‚Äì perhaps even being decisive to the result of the war, and the fate of Europe.	No worries ‚Äì Penny Le Couteur knows this is speculative, and should not be taken too seriously. It works to illustrate the point. The molecules described in the book were in fact, more important than tin buttons. There are both examples from old substances, like salt, olive oil, and sugar ‚Äì to more recent discoveries, like plastics, antibiotics and analgesics.	There is some pattern, though, that the reader can observe through the book. The story usually goes this way: Some substance was very valuable to man, and was hard to get. Some people got rich extracting it. Then rich countries from Europe found a way to steal the stuff, and became even richer, until some scientist was able to synthesize the molecule (usually in the 19th century), and then it became cheap and available to everyone.	Or‚Ä¶ Some scientist (again, in the 19th century) accidentally discovered a new substance, when he was trying to do a different thing. Fortunately, he realized the value of what he had invented, and the world became a better place because of it.	Yet, I learned lots of ‚Äúcool stuff‚Äù in the book, as I‚Äôve mentioned. For instance, I was shocked to learn that up until recently, chemists considered part of the ‚Äúscientific method‚Äù to actually taste the new chemicals they created (!?), recording the sensations on the tongue. I hope not too many scientists died this way ‚Äì it was surely a way to dedicate one‚Äôs life to science.	I learned how penicillin kills bacteria. I learned why vegetal oils are mostly liquid at room temperature, while animal fat is mostly solid. I learned why a meal with vegetables is called a ‚Äúsalad‚Äù. I learned how refrigerators stay cold. And many more interesting facts.	There is no ‚Äúdeep knowledge‚Äù to be obtained from this book. On the other hand, for those ‚Äúnerdy‚Äù like me, there is plenty to keep you interested ‚Äì and also to make you look smart in your friend‚Äôs eyes."
34,1585422207,http://goodreads.com/user/show/35986416-stacy,4,"Right off the bat, I was so engaged and attached to this book! It opened my eyes and I became extremely fascinated with the idea of how these tiny (unseen to the naked eye) molecules have such big roles in changing the course of history. There is a quote that really spoke out to me as soon as I opened the book:‚ÄúThe idea that momentous events may depend on something as small as a molecule---a group of two or more atoms held together in a definite arrangement---offers a novel approach to understanding the growth of human civilization. A change as small as the position of a bond---the link between atoms in a molecule---can lead to enormous differences in properties of a substance and in turn influence the course of history (pg.6).‚Äù Already, it grabbed my attention.To be honest, at first, I thought that this book was not going to be interesting because I am not a huge non-fiction fan, especially when it comes to science (science is the course that I often have difficult understanding in). However, I was proved wrong because this book is a smooth blend between history and chemistry, and it is filled with interesting factual stories to how each of these molecules were discovered and/or created. It also contained visuals and diagrams of each molecule's chemical structure when looked at microscopically (it gets down to the ""nitty-gritty"" of the structure and properties). These pictures aid my understanding in the significance of their structures and chemical elements and how it played with discussing the roles of the molecules. It discussed about the compound's bonds, protein chains, OH groups, benzene rings, and more! These differences in the visuals allowed me to pinpoint the tiny differences in the structures to see how it would change the roles of these molecules. I also enjoyed how some of the scientific terms that I unheard of were defined along in the paragraphs, which guided my understanding even more. However, I wish that some of the visuals would be pictures other than their structures or would be displayed in a different format as it can often get monotonous viewing them over and over again.This book allowed me to ponder and analyze the value of these molecules and question ""what ifs"" these molecules did not come into existence. Would our world and lifestyles be where it is right now? Or would it be in a different state? These questions were the reason why I became so intrigued and engaged by this book; it places you in a state of thinking and makes you itch to find out more about these molecules.Overall, it was a great book to read and I enjoyed my experience. I would definitely suggest this book to other readers!"
35,1585422207,http://goodreads.com/user/show/68463765-jack-sundquist,3,"In 1812, 600,000 French troops of Napoleon‚Äôs Grande Arm√©e marched towards Moscow in the hope of conquering Russia. However, frigid temperatures, disease, and lack of supplies forced the Grande Arm√©e to retreat, and only 10,000 French troops returned. What could have caused the most powerful army an Earth to collapse? One theory has to do with the buttons of the soldiers. French troops wore tin buttons to hold up their uniforms. In cold temperatures, however, tin decomposes into a fine white powder. So, Napoleon‚Äôs troops would have certainly had their buttons disintegrate. Could the lack of buttons forced French soldiers to hold up their uniforms themselves, preventing them from being able to bring as much supplies as possible, contributing their food and clothing shortages?This and other historical events are given in Napoleon‚Äôs Buttons: 17 Molecules that Changed the World by Penny Le Couteur and Jay Burreson. This nonfiction book discusses 17 important molecules, and their impact on history. Each molecules has their own chapter, which mostly follows the following structure: the molecule is introduced through a story that explains the importance of the molecule. Then, the structure of the molecule is given and the properties of the molecule is explained through this structure. Finally, the chapter ends through further explanation of the impact of the molecules and a summary of the chapter. The most interesting chapter to me was phenol, a group of molecules that was found in early antiseptic, plastics, marijuana, cotton, photographic paper, electrical insulator, billiard balls, and many more. It was also responsible for limiting the killing of elephants, development of the inexpensive Kodak camera, and widespread use of electrical energy. The fact that a single molecule group could be used in such a large variety of items is fascinating to me.I give this book four out of five stars. It is a very interesting book that explains how many unappreciated aspects of our life came to be. It combines chemistry with history to provide the reader with a very informative experience. The reason I did not give it a five is because this is not the most entertaining book. There are some times in this book that I felt the book took too long about a specific event, but the majority of the book is still interesting. I would recommend this book to anyone because it will give them a different perspective on the causes and effects of historical events. You do not need to know about chemistry, but having a knowledge of chemistry will let you appreciate this book more. "
36,1585422207,http://goodreads.com/user/show/45859662-george-goodall,3,"I have a soft spot for social histories of technology -- books that demonstrate how a particular thing came about and, more importantly, the impact that that thing has had on us. ""Napoleon's Buttons"" is certainly part of that oeuvre. My first encounter with the book was years ago in an airport book store; I didn't buy it. It did, however, get a mention in what I was reading at the time, Foucault's ""Archaeology of Knowledge"" (I was in grad school). In a bit of marginalia I scrawled: ""Guns, Germs, and Steel [Diamond]? Salt [Kurlansky]? Napoleon's Buttons? SCOT?"" Foucault's passage deserves repeating here:""From the political mobility at the surface down to the slow movements of 'material civilization', ever more levels of knowledge have been established: each has its own peculiar discontinuities and patterns; and as one descends to the deepest levels, the rhythms become broader. Beneath the rapidly changing history of governments, wars, and famines, there emerge other, apparently unmoving histories: the history of sea routes, the history of corn or of gold-mining, the history of drought and of irrigation, the history of crop rotation, the history of balance achieved by the human species between hunger and abundance.""(Yeah, it's Foucault.)""Napoleon's Buttons"" is an ""unmoving history"" of organic chemistry... mostly. There is a chapter on salt (see Kurlansky above) but it's mostly to set up a discussion on chlorine, CFCs, etc.For such a dry topic, it's actually quite a fascinating read. The history of organic chemistry is really the history of modern trade and science. The title comes from the great coats of Napoleon's army during its disastrous winter campaign in Russia. The buttons of these coats were made from a tin alloy that crumbled in cold temperatures. Without buttons, the soldiers froze, and Napoleon lost. Chemistry has its consequences.Each chapter is the story of a new substance:- Peppers, nutmeg, and cloves- Ascorbic acid- Glucose- Cellulose- Nitro compounds- Silk and Nylon- Phenol- Isoprene- Dyes- Wonder drugs- The pill- Molecules of witchcraft- Morphine, nicotine, and caffeine- Oleic acid- Salt- Chlorocarbon compounds- Molecules versus MalariaOverall, an interesting read but it is perhaps better as a reference volume for esoteric trivia questions."
37,1585422207,http://goodreads.com/user/show/66814782-dawn,4,"Overall, this book takes a chemical look at 17 molecule families and not only their uses and discoveries, but how they changed the way things were done even if people hadn't come to the place where chemical composition was detected. The writing is detailed but interesting. The writers show diagrams of the molecules they discuss, so their introduction gives a brief description of how chemical compounds are diagrammed. The title is explained right away in that the buttons which were sewn on Napoleon's army men were not made of metal (they were made of tin) which was able to retain its shape in the cold the men experienced during the Russian winter of 1812-1813. So, not only were the men attempting to fight and move resources for battle, but they were also holding their coats together because the tin had disintegrated. The authors wonder if history might have been changed if the clothing were instead accessorized with metal better able to withstand the frigid temperatures. At the back of the book, there is an index and a selected bibliography."
38,1585422207,http://goodreads.com/user/show/114641769-tayah-turocy,4,"Napoleon's Buttons was not what I expected in the best of ways. I thoroughly enjoyed reading and learning through each incredibly unique chapter. This book had the absolute best mix of history and chemistry. As a chemistry PhD student, I felt very comfortable about the way the chemistry was presented, but I still learned a lot of new information and interesting facts. I am not a big history buff; however, the topics discussed were well explained, relatable, and understandable. I have never read a book that so clearly described so many things in a single story. Although the transitions where a bit far-fetched between chapters, I did appreciate the attempt to link diverse subjects together. Further, I loved how the description of chemistry grew in complexity from chapter to chapter. If you are looking for a fun book club novel, this book would be great. The number of chapters and topics seemed overwhelming at times, but it successfully kept the readers' interests peaked with consistent switching between both chemistry and historical ideas. "
39,1585422207,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7690422-dina,5,"Awesome book. Grammatical errors don't really bother me that much when the content is as engrossing as this! I'm not an English buff either so the only reason I noticed so many errors is because the person before me apparently had a field day correcting the authors' mistakes with pencil. Anyhow this book is really cool -- anyone who loves chemistry or history or both will appreciate it. And even if you want to learn just a bit of trivia, you'll learn a lot of it from the perspective these authors bring. The title is kind of an attention-grabber because the story of Napoleon's buttons is touched on in the intro and there are other molecules that take up way more anecdotal space than that one. Some of the stories you'll recognize like the importance of spices and sugar on The Age of Discovery in Western Europe and worldwide. However, though the stories are recognizable, the focus on molecules and the scientific advances that came about are refreshing and put a new spin on these tales. "

Especially with the story of Napoleon's buttons--which is used in the books introduction (which is also part of title), the thing is though none of the chapters is that grabbing.The authors do note in the intro that the history presented would be disjointed and that they will talk a out groups of molecules, I believe the help of anctual historian would have been helpful. It got bogged down by too much science talk that when history did come in I was bored, on the otherhand the opposite happened too. Most of what I learned was about molecules, the history I knew most of (because it really just seemed like general statements) with learning some new small bits. Which okay it's about science, but the reason I kept stopping and what ultimately made me stop reading was how often it seemed too nonchalant on certain subjects."

Though they tried to make allowances for that by explaining, it wasn't the same. That said, I really enjoyed this book. History, especially history of chemistry, is one of my favorite things, and it was such a treat to see a survey of world history through the lens of chemistry. It's amazing how many things were brought into being or alongside each other throughout time because of capitalism (aka greed). There were many amazing discoveries, but many lives were lost and peoples were subjugated because of it. It was very sobering and sad. "

All in all, it's pretty diverse and interesting. I've been on a sciencey book binge lately and there were things that I already knew since they were covered in other books like The Disappearing Spoon or Drug Hunters, but that's not the author's fault. Even though there was substantial overlap in their coverage of the common molecules, it was only a minor part of the book itself. I'm definitely satisfied with Napoleon's Buttons overall."

54,1585422207,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1272349-neven,3,"A perfectly informative science book, though not a standout in terms of style or interesting content. It proposes an idea that‚Äôs, when you think about it, maybe too obvious to spell out: that certain molecules (e.g. salt, hemoglobin, polymers) have played major roles in history. Given that everything is made of molecules, that‚Äôs sort of a given. But the book then undercuts its point by clarifying, at every turn, that history is complicated and more than any one factor or molecule has decided Napoleon‚Äôs defeat in Russia or the American independence. This is true, but it wouldn‚Äôt be UNtrue to charm the reader into a molecular perspective on those stories with a little more confidence. "

Each chapter followed the same formula: What the molecule is, it's chemical structure, and how it shaped the world. I would recommend this to anyone and everyone, especially those who are interested on the HOW things work in the world around them. I wish I had read this before I taught high school chemistry. There were lots of cool anecdotes that would have been fun to share. "

The 17 molecules that changed history are each detailed on how the chemical bonds work as well as the influence the compound had on history. From salt to phenols, from ascorbic acid to rubber, there were some compounds that made all the difference in wealth, power, and personal health. A fun romp through the chemical side of history - an aspect of history that many do not consider."

The language is simplified and, although the book introduces chemistry terms and properties well, it‚Äôs not really interesting if you have ever taken an organic chemistry class. One thing that really bugged me was the condescending tone the author takes as they are teaching and imploring the reader to appreciate chemistry, chemists, and science. Yet, I enjoyed the history and kept reading to soak up all the info. This might be interesting for a high school student that appreciates chemistry."

62,1585422207,http://goodreads.com/user/show/98176236-sayoni,3,"Penny Le Couteur and Jay Burreson‚Äôs Napoleon‚Äôs Buttons provides readers with a view of both science and history that is often neglected. Le Couteur and Burreson weave unique details about history into the novel while simultaneously expressing the significance of the seventeen molecule groups attributed to in the title. In many cases, those molecules crucially changed the course of history. For example, the fall of the Roman Empire can be blamed on lead poisoning. Lead acetate was used to sweeten their wine. Lead containers were used to store these drinks, and water often reached homes through lead pipes. All of the above mentioned systems were mostly available to wealthy aristocrats, and eventually, symptoms of lead poisoning became prominent in leaders such as Emperor Nero, leading to the empire‚Äôs collapse. Additionally, Napoleon‚Äôs soldiers‚Äô weakness was partially due to inefficient tin buttons on their coats. The extremely frigid temperatures led the buttons to crumble, making the soldiers unable to properly contain heat. This detail is just one of the many interesting points included in the book. The importance of precision and accuracy were also explored in Napoleon‚Äôs Buttons. One chapter of the book discussed the accident involving the space shuttle, Challenger. This section explained that a mere temperature difference affected rubber seals such that its pliability was crucially altered, leading to the tragic explosion. Unusual, intriguing facts are presented in Napoleon‚Äôs Buttons, and the connections made between history and the seventeen molecules is eye-opening. The above examples are only samples from book with a vast collection of enlightening information. From tin buttons to the cause of the Salem Witch trials to hotels made of salt, the information amounts to a broader understanding of the application of not only chemistry, but science as a whole and history as well. Napoleon‚Äôs Buttons allows readers not only to learn, but more importantly, to enjoy learning.I would give this book 3 out of 5 stars, because although it included many fascinating details, at times, I was reminded of reading a textbook. The format of the book sometimes mirrors the format of a textbook, and this caused my mind to drift at times. There was so much information presented in each section of the novel that it could become difficult to digest. Also, some of the points seemed disconnected and did not always flow smoothly. For example, an inventor would be briefly mentioned, and the following sentence would not further discuss his/her accomplishments. The next page would jump to the name of a company or another scientist‚Äôs name. These details seemed to be plopped into the book and did not quite have a purpose. If the goal was to credit those individuals, then that could have been accomplished another way. I found myself distracted by those names because they did not contribute to my understanding of the information presented. When the images of the molecular structures were shown, it was difficult to connect that back to the passage, as the relation between the structure and its significance was not always made explicit. Personally, the structures did not consistently aid my understanding of the book. I expected them to be supplementary, but did not feel that was the case while reading. An abundance of facts and knowledge became slightly overwhelming. However, the book was still an enjoyable read. Having a basic understanding of chemistry helped me to appreciate it more. Napoleon‚Äôs Buttons allowed me to marvel at the possibilities of science that I had previously been oblivious to. Overall, this book led me to the realization that science truly is ubiquitous."
63,1585422207,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5396658-paulo-limp,4,"	Napoleon‚Äôs Buttons is a great example of a 'trivia book'. This is a book where you learn lots of interesting facts, but just tidbits of information. So, great to impress friends and relatives at a dinner table‚Ä¶ and that‚Äôs it.	This books mixes History and Chemistry (mostly Organic Chemistry), picking up substances precious to mankind, describing both the historical relevance associated with the ‚Äústuff‚Äù, and its chemical structure. It is advisable to have at least some basic knowledge in both disciplines to fully enjoy the book (no need for a degree, though). Its title relates to the fact that La Grand Arme√© wore uniforms with Tin buttons ‚Äì however Tin becomes breakable under very low temperatures ‚Äì Russian-style low temperatures. This could have led to the soldiers losing their coats and capes just when they needed them the most ‚Äì perhaps even being decisive to the result of the war, and the fate of Europe.	No worries ‚Äì Penny Le Couteur knows this is speculative, and should not be taken too seriously. It works to illustrate the point. The molecules described in the book were in fact, more important than tin buttons. There are both examples from old substances, like salt, olive oil, and sugar ‚Äì to more recent discoveries, like plastics, antibiotics and analgesics.	There is some pattern, though, that the reader can observe through the book. The story usually goes this way: Some substance was very valuable to man, and was hard to get. Some people got rich extracting it. Then rich countries from Europe found a way to steal the stuff, and became even richer, until some scientist was able to synthesize the molecule (usually in the 19th century), and then it became cheap and available to everyone.	Or‚Ä¶ Some scientist (again, in the 19th century) accidentally discovered a new substance, when he was trying to do a different thing. Fortunately, he realized the value of what he had invented, and the world became a better place because of it.	Yet, I learned lots of ‚Äúcool stuff‚Äù in the book, as I‚Äôve mentioned. For instance, I was shocked to learn that up until recently, chemists considered part of the ‚Äúscientific method‚Äù to actually taste the new chemicals they created (!?), recording the sensations on the tongue. I hope not too many scientists died this way ‚Äì it was surely a way to dedicate one‚Äôs life to science.	I learned how penicillin kills bacteria. I learned why vegetal oils are mostly liquid at room temperature, while animal fat is mostly solid. I learned why a meal with vegetables is called a ‚Äúsalad‚Äù. I learned how refrigerators stay cold. And many more interesting facts.	There is no ‚Äúdeep knowledge‚Äù to be obtained from this book. On the other hand, for those ‚Äúnerdy‚Äù like me, there is plenty to keep you interested ‚Äì and also to make you look smart in your friend‚Äôs eyes."
64,1585422207,http://goodreads.com/user/show/35986416-stacy,4,"Right off the bat, I was so engaged and attached to this book! It opened my eyes and I became extremely fascinated with the idea of how these tiny (unseen to the naked eye) molecules have such big roles in changing the course of history. There is a quote that really spoke out to me as soon as I opened the book:‚ÄúThe idea that momentous events may depend on something as small as a molecule---a group of two or more atoms held together in a definite arrangement---offers a novel approach to understanding the growth of human civilization. A change as small as the position of a bond---the link between atoms in a molecule---can lead to enormous differences in properties of a substance and in turn influence the course of history (pg.6).‚Äù Already, it grabbed my attention.To be honest, at first, I thought that this book was not going to be interesting because I am not a huge non-fiction fan, especially when it comes to science (science is the course that I often have difficult understanding in). However, I was proved wrong because this book is a smooth blend between history and chemistry, and it is filled with interesting factual stories to how each of these molecules were discovered and/or created. It also contained visuals and diagrams of each molecule's chemical structure when looked at microscopically (it gets down to the ""nitty-gritty"" of the structure and properties). These pictures aid my understanding in the significance of their structures and chemical elements and how it played with discussing the roles of the molecules. It discussed about the compound's bonds, protein chains, OH groups, benzene rings, and more! These differences in the visuals allowed me to pinpoint the tiny differences in the structures to see how it would change the roles of these molecules. I also enjoyed how some of the scientific terms that I unheard of were defined along in the paragraphs, which guided my understanding even more. However, I wish that some of the visuals would be pictures other than their structures or would be displayed in a different format as it can often get monotonous viewing them over and over again.This book allowed me to ponder and analyze the value of these molecules and question ""what ifs"" these molecules did not come into existence. Would our world and lifestyles be where it is right now? Or would it be in a different state? These questions were the reason why I became so intrigued and engaged by this book; it places you in a state of thinking and makes you itch to find out more about these molecules.Overall, it was a great book to read and I enjoyed my experience. I would definitely suggest this book to other readers!"
65,1585422207,http://goodreads.com/user/show/68463765-jack-sundquist,3,"In 1812, 600,000 French troops of Napoleon‚Äôs Grande Arm√©e marched towards Moscow in the hope of conquering Russia. However, frigid temperatures, disease, and lack of supplies forced the Grande Arm√©e to retreat, and only 10,000 French troops returned. What could have caused the most powerful army an Earth to collapse? One theory has to do with the buttons of the soldiers. French troops wore tin buttons to hold up their uniforms. In cold temperatures, however, tin decomposes into a fine white powder. So, Napoleon‚Äôs troops would have certainly had their buttons disintegrate. Could the lack of buttons forced French soldiers to hold up their uniforms themselves, preventing them from being able to bring as much supplies as possible, contributing their food and clothing shortages?This and other historical events are given in Napoleon‚Äôs Buttons: 17 Molecules that Changed the World by Penny Le Couteur and Jay Burreson. This nonfiction book discusses 17 important molecules, and their impact on history. Each molecules has their own chapter, which mostly follows the following structure: the molecule is introduced through a story that explains the importance of the molecule. Then, the structure of the molecule is given and the properties of the molecule is explained through this structure. Finally, the chapter ends through further explanation of the impact of the molecules and a summary of the chapter. The most interesting chapter to me was phenol, a group of molecules that was found in early antiseptic, plastics, marijuana, cotton, photographic paper, electrical insulator, billiard balls, and many more. It was also responsible for limiting the killing of elephants, development of the inexpensive Kodak camera, and widespread use of electrical energy. The fact that a single molecule group could be used in such a large variety of items is fascinating to me.I give this book four out of five stars. It is a very interesting book that explains how many unappreciated aspects of our life came to be. It combines chemistry with history to provide the reader with a very informative experience. The reason I did not give it a five is because this is not the most entertaining book. There are some times in this book that I felt the book took too long about a specific event, but the majority of the book is still interesting. I would recommend this book to anyone because it will give them a different perspective on the causes and effects of historical events. You do not need to know about chemistry, but having a knowledge of chemistry will let you appreciate this book more. "
66,1585422207,http://goodreads.com/user/show/45859662-george-goodall,3,"I have a soft spot for social histories of technology -- books that demonstrate how a particular thing came about and, more importantly, the impact that that thing has had on us. ""Napoleon's Buttons"" is certainly part of that oeuvre. My first encounter with the book was years ago in an airport book store; I didn't buy it. It did, however, get a mention in what I was reading at the time, Foucault's ""Archaeology of Knowledge"" (I was in grad school). In a bit of marginalia I scrawled: ""Guns, Germs, and Steel [Diamond]? Salt [Kurlansky]? Napoleon's Buttons? SCOT?"" Foucault's passage deserves repeating here:""From the political mobility at the surface down to the slow movements of 'material civilization', ever more levels of knowledge have been established: each has its own peculiar discontinuities and patterns; and as one descends to the deepest levels, the rhythms become broader. Beneath the rapidly changing history of governments, wars, and famines, there emerge other, apparently unmoving histories: the history of sea routes, the history of corn or of gold-mining, the history of drought and of irrigation, the history of crop rotation, the history of balance achieved by the human species between hunger and abundance.""(Yeah, it's Foucault.)""Napoleon's Buttons"" is an ""unmoving history"" of organic chemistry... mostly. There is a chapter on salt (see Kurlansky above) but it's mostly to set up a discussion on chlorine, CFCs, etc.For such a dry topic, it's actually quite a fascinating read. The history of organic chemistry is really the history of modern trade and science. The title comes from the great coats of Napoleon's army during its disastrous winter campaign in Russia. The buttons of these coats were made from a tin alloy that crumbled in cold temperatures. Without buttons, the soldiers froze, and Napoleon lost. Chemistry has its consequences.Each chapter is the story of a new substance:- Peppers, nutmeg, and cloves- Ascorbic acid- Glucose- Cellulose- Nitro compounds- Silk and Nylon- Phenol- Isoprene- Dyes- Wonder drugs- The pill- Molecules of witchcraft- Morphine, nicotine, and caffeine- Oleic acid- Salt- Chlorocarbon compounds- Molecules versus MalariaOverall, an interesting read but it is perhaps better as a reference volume for esoteric trivia questions."
67,1585422207,http://goodreads.com/user/show/66814782-dawn,4,"Overall, this book takes a chemical look at 17 molecule families and not only their uses and discoveries, but how they changed the way things were done even if people hadn't come to the place where chemical composition was detected. The writing is detailed but interesting. The writers show diagrams of the molecules they discuss, so their introduction gives a brief description of how chemical compounds are diagrammed. The title is explained right away in that the buttons which were sewn on Napoleon's army men were not made of metal (they were made of tin) which was able to retain its shape in the cold the men experienced during the Russian winter of 1812-1813. So, not only were the men attempting to fight and move resources for battle, but they were also holding their coats together because the tin had disintegrated. The authors wonder if history might have been changed if the clothing were instead accessorized with metal better able to withstand the frigid temperatures. At the back of the book, there is an index and a selected bibliography."
68,1585422207,http://goodreads.com/user/show/114641769-tayah-turocy,4,"Napoleon's Buttons was not what I expected in the best of ways. I thoroughly enjoyed reading and learning through each incredibly unique chapter. This book had the absolute best mix of history and chemistry. As a chemistry PhD student, I felt very comfortable about the way the chemistry was presented, but I still learned a lot of new information and interesting facts. I am not a big history buff; however, the topics discussed were well explained, relatable, and understandable. I have never read a book that so clearly described so many things in a single story. Although the transitions where a bit far-fetched between chapters, I did appreciate the attempt to link diverse subjects together. Further, I loved how the description of chemistry grew in complexity from chapter to chapter. If you are looking for a fun book club novel, this book would be great. The number of chapters and topics seemed overwhelming at times, but it successfully kept the readers' interests peaked with consistent switching between both chemistry and historical ideas. "
69,1585422207,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7690422-dina,5,"Awesome book. Grammatical errors don't really bother me that much when the content is as engrossing as this! I'm not an English buff either so the only reason I noticed so many errors is because the person before me apparently had a field day correcting the authors' mistakes with pencil. Anyhow this book is really cool -- anyone who loves chemistry or history or both will appreciate it. And even if you want to learn just a bit of trivia, you'll learn a lot of it from the perspective these authors bring. The title is kind of an attention-grabber because the story of Napoleon's buttons is touched on in the intro and there are other molecules that take up way more anecdotal space than that one. Some of the stories you'll recognize like the importance of spices and sugar on The Age of Discovery in Western Europe and worldwide. However, though the stories are recognizable, the focus on molecules and the scientific advances that came about are refreshing and put a new spin on these tales. "

The text is divided into 17 chapters, with each chapter allotted to individual molecules or similar groups of molecules. Not only do Le Couteur and Burreson confer natural molecules, but synthetic as well, making sure to encompass the majority of human activity. They explain how peppers, nutmegs, cloves, and more launched a wave of global explorations, beginning with the Middle Ages and ending with the European colonies. The authors reveal a multitude of tall tales from all over the world and weave them into their novel to dramatically illustrate the scientific structure of modern society.

Especially with the story of Napoleon's buttons--which is used in the books introduction (which is also part of title), the thing is though none of the chapters is that grabbing.The authors do note in the intro that the history presented would be disjointed and that they will talk a out groups of molecules, I believe the help of anctual historian would have been helpful. It got bogged down by too much science talk that when history did come in I was bored, on the otherhand the opposite happened too. Most of what I learned was about molecules, the history I knew most of (because it really just seemed like general statements) with learning some new small bits. Which okay it's about science, but the reason I kept stopping and what ultimately made me stop reading was how often it seemed too nonchalant on certain subjects."

Though they tried to make allowances for that by explaining, it wasn't the same. That said, I really enjoyed this book. History, especially history of chemistry, is one of my favorite things, and it was such a treat to see a survey of world history through the lens of chemistry. It's amazing how many things were brought into being or alongside each other throughout time because of capitalism (aka greed). There were many amazing discoveries, but many lives were lost and peoples were subjugated because of it. It was very sobering and sad. "

All in all, it's pretty diverse and interesting. I've been on a sciencey book binge lately and there were things that I already knew since they were covered in other books like The Disappearing Spoon or Drug Hunters, but that's not the author's fault. Even though there was substantial overlap in their coverage of the common molecules, it was only a minor part of the book itself. I'm definitely satisfied with Napoleon's Buttons overall."

There is enough of a introduction to the basics that one can read the book without being overwhelmed by technical details, but can still appreciate the tiny molecular differences that make some of the stories so fascinating.

Each chapter followed the same formula: What the molecule is, it's chemical structure, and how it shaped the world. I would recommend this to anyone and everyone, especially those who are interested on the HOW things work in the world around them. I wish I had read this before I taught high school chemistry. There were lots of cool anecdotes that would have been fun to share. "

The 17 molecules that changed history are each detailed on how the chemical bonds work as well as the influence the compound had on history. From salt to phenols, from ascorbic acid to rubber, there were some compounds that made all the difference in wealth, power, and personal health. A fun romp through the chemical side of history - an aspect of history that many do not consider."

The language is simplified and, although the book introduces chemistry terms and properties well, it‚Äôs not really interesting if you have ever taken an organic chemistry class. One thing that really bugged me was the condescending tone the author takes as they are teaching and imploring the reader to appreciate chemistry, chemists, and science. Yet, I enjoyed the history and kept reading to soak up all the info. This might be interesting for a high school student that appreciates chemistry."

The book does a great job of bringing the invisible world of chemistry and bringing it to life in historical, real life examples.

92,1585422207,http://goodreads.com/user/show/98176236-sayoni,3,"Penny Le Couteur and Jay Burreson‚Äôs Napoleon‚Äôs Buttons provides readers with a view of both science and history that is often neglected. Le Couteur and Burreson weave unique details about history into the novel while simultaneously expressing the significance of the seventeen molecule groups attributed to in the title. In many cases, those molecules crucially changed the course of history. For example, the fall of the Roman Empire can be blamed on lead poisoning. Lead acetate was used to sweeten their wine. Lead containers were used to store these drinks, and water often reached homes through lead pipes. All of the above mentioned systems were mostly available to wealthy aristocrats, and eventually, symptoms of lead poisoning became prominent in leaders such as Emperor Nero, leading to the empire‚Äôs collapse. Additionally, Napoleon‚Äôs soldiers‚Äô weakness was partially due to inefficient tin buttons on their coats. The extremely frigid temperatures led the buttons to crumble, making the soldiers unable to properly contain heat. This detail is just one of the many interesting points included in the book. The importance of precision and accuracy were also explored in Napoleon‚Äôs Buttons. One chapter of the book discussed the accident involving the space shuttle, Challenger. This section explained that a mere temperature difference affected rubber seals such that its pliability was crucially altered, leading to the tragic explosion. Unusual, intriguing facts are presented in Napoleon‚Äôs Buttons, and the connections made between history and the seventeen molecules is eye-opening. The above examples are only samples from book with a vast collection of enlightening information. From tin buttons to the cause of the Salem Witch trials to hotels made of salt, the information amounts to a broader understanding of the application of not only chemistry, but science as a whole and history as well. Napoleon‚Äôs Buttons allows readers not only to learn, but more importantly, to enjoy learning.I would give this book 3 out of 5 stars, because although it included many fascinating details, at times, I was reminded of reading a textbook. The format of the book sometimes mirrors the format of a textbook, and this caused my mind to drift at times. There was so much information presented in each section of the novel that it could become difficult to digest. Also, some of the points seemed disconnected and did not always flow smoothly. For example, an inventor would be briefly mentioned, and the following sentence would not further discuss his/her accomplishments. The next page would jump to the name of a company or another scientist‚Äôs name. These details seemed to be plopped into the book and did not quite have a purpose. If the goal was to credit those individuals, then that could have been accomplished another way. I found myself distracted by those names because they did not contribute to my understanding of the information presented. When the images of the molecular structures were shown, it was difficult to connect that back to the passage, as the relation between the structure and its significance was not always made explicit. Personally, the structures did not consistently aid my understanding of the book. I expected them to be supplementary, but did not feel that was the case while reading. An abundance of facts and knowledge became slightly overwhelming. However, the book was still an enjoyable read. Having a basic understanding of chemistry helped me to appreciate it more. Napoleon‚Äôs Buttons allowed me to marvel at the possibilities of science that I had previously been oblivious to. Overall, this book led me to the realization that science truly is ubiquitous."
93,1585422207,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5396658-paulo-limp,4,"	Napoleon‚Äôs Buttons is a great example of a 'trivia book'. This is a book where you learn lots of interesting facts, but just tidbits of information. So, great to impress friends and relatives at a dinner table‚Ä¶ and that‚Äôs it.	This books mixes History and Chemistry (mostly Organic Chemistry), picking up substances precious to mankind, describing both the historical relevance associated with the ‚Äústuff‚Äù, and its chemical structure. It is advisable to have at least some basic knowledge in both disciplines to fully enjoy the book (no need for a degree, though). Its title relates to the fact that La Grand Arme√© wore uniforms with Tin buttons ‚Äì however Tin becomes breakable under very low temperatures ‚Äì Russian-style low temperatures. This could have led to the soldiers losing their coats and capes just when they needed them the most ‚Äì perhaps even being decisive to the result of the war, and the fate of Europe.	No worries ‚Äì Penny Le Couteur knows this is speculative, and should not be taken too seriously. It works to illustrate the point. The molecules described in the book were in fact, more important than tin buttons. There are both examples from old substances, like salt, olive oil, and sugar ‚Äì to more recent discoveries, like plastics, antibiotics and analgesics.	There is some pattern, though, that the reader can observe through the book. The story usually goes this way: Some substance was very valuable to man, and was hard to get. Some people got rich extracting it. Then rich countries from Europe found a way to steal the stuff, and became even richer, until some scientist was able to synthesize the molecule (usually in the 19th century), and then it became cheap and available to everyone.	Or‚Ä¶ Some scientist (again, in the 19th century) accidentally discovered a new substance, when he was trying to do a different thing. Fortunately, he realized the value of what he had invented, and the world became a better place because of it.	Yet, I learned lots of ‚Äúcool stuff‚Äù in the book, as I‚Äôve mentioned. For instance, I was shocked to learn that up until recently, chemists considered part of the ‚Äúscientific method‚Äù to actually taste the new chemicals they created (!?), recording the sensations on the tongue. I hope not too many scientists died this way ‚Äì it was surely a way to dedicate one‚Äôs life to science.	I learned how penicillin kills bacteria. I learned why vegetal oils are mostly liquid at room temperature, while animal fat is mostly solid. I learned why a meal with vegetables is called a ‚Äúsalad‚Äù. I learned how refrigerators stay cold. And many more interesting facts.	There is no ‚Äúdeep knowledge‚Äù to be obtained from this book. On the other hand, for those ‚Äúnerdy‚Äù like me, there is plenty to keep you interested ‚Äì and also to make you look smart in your friend‚Äôs eyes."
94,1585422207,http://goodreads.com/user/show/35986416-stacy,4,"Right off the bat, I was so engaged and attached to this book! It opened my eyes and I became extremely fascinated with the idea of how these tiny (unseen to the naked eye) molecules have such big roles in changing the course of history. There is a quote that really spoke out to me as soon as I opened the book:‚ÄúThe idea that momentous events may depend on something as small as a molecule---a group of two or more atoms held together in a definite arrangement---offers a novel approach to understanding the growth of human civilization. A change as small as the position of a bond---the link between atoms in a molecule---can lead to enormous differences in properties of a substance and in turn influence the course of history (pg.6).‚Äù Already, it grabbed my attention.To be honest, at first, I thought that this book was not going to be interesting because I am not a huge non-fiction fan, especially when it comes to science (science is the course that I often have difficult understanding in). However, I was proved wrong because this book is a smooth blend between history and chemistry, and it is filled with interesting factual stories to how each of these molecules were discovered and/or created. It also contained visuals and diagrams of each molecule's chemical structure when looked at microscopically (it gets down to the ""nitty-gritty"" of the structure and properties). These pictures aid my understanding in the significance of their structures and chemical elements and how it played with discussing the roles of the molecules. It discussed about the compound's bonds, protein chains, OH groups, benzene rings, and more! These differences in the visuals allowed me to pinpoint the tiny differences in the structures to see how it would change the roles of these molecules. I also enjoyed how some of the scientific terms that I unheard of were defined along in the paragraphs, which guided my understanding even more. However, I wish that some of the visuals would be pictures other than their structures or would be displayed in a different format as it can often get monotonous viewing them over and over again.This book allowed me to ponder and analyze the value of these molecules and question ""what ifs"" these molecules did not come into existence. Would our world and lifestyles be where it is right now? Or would it be in a different state? These questions were the reason why I became so intrigued and engaged by this book; it places you in a state of thinking and makes you itch to find out more about these molecules.Overall, it was a great book to read and I enjoyed my experience. I would definitely suggest this book to other readers!"
95,1585422207,http://goodreads.com/user/show/68463765-jack-sundquist,3,"In 1812, 600,000 French troops of Napoleon‚Äôs Grande Arm√©e marched towards Moscow in the hope of conquering Russia. However, frigid temperatures, disease, and lack of supplies forced the Grande Arm√©e to retreat, and only 10,000 French troops returned. What could have caused the most powerful army an Earth to collapse? One theory has to do with the buttons of the soldiers. French troops wore tin buttons to hold up their uniforms. In cold temperatures, however, tin decomposes into a fine white powder. So, Napoleon‚Äôs troops would have certainly had their buttons disintegrate. Could the lack of buttons forced French soldiers to hold up their uniforms themselves, preventing them from being able to bring as much supplies as possible, contributing their food and clothing shortages?This and other historical events are given in Napoleon‚Äôs Buttons: 17 Molecules that Changed the World by Penny Le Couteur and Jay Burreson. This nonfiction book discusses 17 important molecules, and their impact on history. Each molecules has their own chapter, which mostly follows the following structure: the molecule is introduced through a story that explains the importance of the molecule. Then, the structure of the molecule is given and the properties of the molecule is explained through this structure. Finally, the chapter ends through further explanation of the impact of the molecules and a summary of the chapter. The most interesting chapter to me was phenol, a group of molecules that was found in early antiseptic, plastics, marijuana, cotton, photographic paper, electrical insulator, billiard balls, and many more. It was also responsible for limiting the killing of elephants, development of the inexpensive Kodak camera, and widespread use of electrical energy. The fact that a single molecule group could be used in such a large variety of items is fascinating to me.I give this book four out of five stars. It is a very interesting book that explains how many unappreciated aspects of our life came to be. It combines chemistry with history to provide the reader with a very informative experience. The reason I did not give it a five is because this is not the most entertaining book. There are some times in this book that I felt the book took too long about a specific event, but the majority of the book is still interesting. I would recommend this book to anyone because it will give them a different perspective on the causes and effects of historical events. You do not need to know about chemistry, but having a knowledge of chemistry will let you appreciate this book more. "
96,1585422207,http://goodreads.com/user/show/45859662-george-goodall,3,"I have a soft spot for social histories of technology -- books that demonstrate how a particular thing came about and, more importantly, the impact that that thing has had on us. ""Napoleon's Buttons"" is certainly part of that oeuvre. My first encounter with the book was years ago in an airport book store; I didn't buy it. It did, however, get a mention in what I was reading at the time, Foucault's ""Archaeology of Knowledge"" (I was in grad school). In a bit of marginalia I scrawled: ""Guns, Germs, and Steel [Diamond]? Salt [Kurlansky]? Napoleon's Buttons? SCOT?"" Foucault's passage deserves repeating here:""From the political mobility at the surface down to the slow movements of 'material civilization', ever more levels of knowledge have been established: each has its own peculiar discontinuities and patterns; and as one descends to the deepest levels, the rhythms become broader. Beneath the rapidly changing history of governments, wars, and famines, there emerge other, apparently unmoving histories: the history of sea routes, the history of corn or of gold-mining, the history of drought and of irrigation, the history of crop rotation, the history of balance achieved by the human species between hunger and abundance.""(Yeah, it's Foucault.)""Napoleon's Buttons"" is an ""unmoving history"" of organic chemistry... mostly. There is a chapter on salt (see Kurlansky above) but it's mostly to set up a discussion on chlorine, CFCs, etc.For such a dry topic, it's actually quite a fascinating read. The history of organic chemistry is really the history of modern trade and science. The title comes from the great coats of Napoleon's army during its disastrous winter campaign in Russia. The buttons of these coats were made from a tin alloy that crumbled in cold temperatures. Without buttons, the soldiers froze, and Napoleon lost. Chemistry has its consequences.Each chapter is the story of a new substance:- Peppers, nutmeg, and cloves- Ascorbic acid- Glucose- Cellulose- Nitro compounds- Silk and Nylon- Phenol- Isoprene- Dyes- Wonder drugs- The pill- Molecules of witchcraft- Morphine, nicotine, and caffeine- Oleic acid- Salt- Chlorocarbon compounds- Molecules versus MalariaOverall, an interesting read but it is perhaps better as a reference volume for esoteric trivia questions."
97,1585422207,http://goodreads.com/user/show/66814782-dawn,4,"Overall, this book takes a chemical look at 17 molecule families and not only their uses and discoveries, but how they changed the way things were done even if people hadn't come to the place where chemical composition was detected. The writing is detailed but interesting. The writers show diagrams of the molecules they discuss, so their introduction gives a brief description of how chemical compounds are diagrammed. The title is explained right away in that the buttons which were sewn on Napoleon's army men were not made of metal (they were made of tin) which was able to retain its shape in the cold the men experienced during the Russian winter of 1812-1813. So, not only were the men attempting to fight and move resources for battle, but they were also holding their coats together because the tin had disintegrated. The authors wonder if history might have been changed if the clothing were instead accessorized with metal better able to withstand the frigid temperatures. At the back of the book, there is an index and a selected bibliography."
98,1585422207,http://goodreads.com/user/show/114641769-tayah-turocy,4,"Napoleon's Buttons was not what I expected in the best of ways. I thoroughly enjoyed reading and learning through each incredibly unique chapter. This book had the absolute best mix of history and chemistry. As a chemistry PhD student, I felt very comfortable about the way the chemistry was presented, but I still learned a lot of new information and interesting facts. I am not a big history buff; however, the topics discussed were well explained, relatable, and understandable. I have never read a book that so clearly described so many things in a single story. Although the transitions where a bit far-fetched between chapters, I did appreciate the attempt to link diverse subjects together. Further, I loved how the description of chemistry grew in complexity from chapter to chapter. If you are looking for a fun book club novel, this book would be great. The number of chapters and topics seemed overwhelming at times, but it successfully kept the readers' interests peaked with consistent switching between both chemistry and historical ideas. "
99,1585422207,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7690422-dina,5,"Awesome book. Grammatical errors don't really bother me that much when the content is as engrossing as this! I'm not an English buff either so the only reason I noticed so many errors is because the person before me apparently had a field day correcting the authors' mistakes with pencil. Anyhow this book is really cool -- anyone who loves chemistry or history or both will appreciate it. And even if you want to learn just a bit of trivia, you'll learn a lot of it from the perspective these authors bring. The title is kind of an attention-grabber because the story of Napoleon's buttons is touched on in the intro and there are other molecules that take up way more anecdotal space than that one. Some of the stories you'll recognize like the importance of spices and sugar on The Age of Discovery in Western Europe and worldwide. However, though the stories are recognizable, the focus on molecules and the scientific advances that came about are refreshing and put a new spin on these tales. "

The text is divided into 17 chapters, with each chapter allotted to individual molecules or similar groups of molecules. Not only do Le Couteur and Burreson confer natural molecules, but synthetic as well, making sure to encompass the majority of human activity. They explain how peppers, nutmegs, cloves, and more launched a wave of global explorations, beginning with the Middle Ages and ending with the European colonies. The authors reveal a multitude of tall tales from all over the world and weave them into their novel to dramatically illustrate the scientific structure of modern society. Napoleon's Buttons: How 17 Molecules Changed History is Contemplative, astounding, and effortlessly written. "

Especially with the story of Napoleon's buttons--which is used in the books introduction (which is also part of title), the thing is though none of the chapters is that grabbing.The authors do note in the intro that the history presented would be disjointed and that they will talk a out groups of molecules, I believe the help of anctual historian would have been helpful. It got bogged down by too much science talk that when history did come in I was bored, on the otherhand the opposite happened too. Most of what I learned was about molecules, the history I knew most of (because it really just seemed like general statements) with learning some new small bits. Which okay it's about science, but the reason I kept stopping and what ultimately made me stop reading was how often it seemed too nonchalant on certain subjects."

Though they tried to make allowances for that by explaining, it wasn't the same. That said, I really enjoyed this book. History, especially history of chemistry, is one of my favorite things, and it was such a treat to see a survey of world history through the lens of chemistry. It's amazing how many things were brought into being or alongside each other throughout time because of capitalism (aka greed). There were many amazing discoveries, but many lives were lost and peoples were subjugated because of it. It was very sobering and sad. "

All in all, it's pretty diverse and interesting. I've been on a sciencey book binge lately and there were things that I already knew since they were covered in other books like The Disappearing Spoon or Drug Hunters, but that's not the author's fault. Even though there was substantial overlap in their coverage of the common molecules, it was only a minor part of the book itself. I'm definitely satisfied with Napoleon's Buttons overall."

Overall, it's ,ore of a history of chemistry than a book about the chemistry of history- much more science than expected, and quite a lot of it is Greek if you're not at all a sciencey person.

The sections on each of the 17 minute molecules stand alone so you can read that section and when you get done if you don‚Äôt pick it up for a while that‚Äôs perfectly fine.

Some molecules, like sodium, caused wars, toppled kingdoms, and encouraged ""international trade.""

Each chapter followed the same formula: What the molecule is, it's chemical structure, and how it shaped the world. I would recommend this to anyone and everyone, especially those who are interested on the HOW things work in the world around them. I wish I had read this before I taught high school chemistry. There were lots of cool anecdotes that would have been fun to share. "

The 17 molecules that changed history are each detailed on how the chemical bonds work as well as the influence the compound had on history. From salt to phenols, from ascorbic acid to rubber, there were some compounds that made all the difference in wealth, power, and personal health. A fun romp through the chemical side of history - an aspect of history that many do not consider."
117,1585422207,http://goodreads.com/user/show/16487082-jessica-davis,3,"I should have read this book when it was gifted to me before college. The language is simplified and, although the book introduces chemistry terms and properties well, it‚Äôs not really interesting if you have ever taken an organic chemistry class. One thing that really bugged me was the condescending tone the author takes as they are teaching and imploring the reader to appreciate chemistry, chemists, and science. Yet, I enjoyed the history and kept reading to soak up all the info. This might be interesting for a high school student that appreciates chemistry."
118,1585422207,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5125829-ana,4,"My high school chemistry teacher recommended this book to me, and now I have read it for a course in the chemistry of art in my final year of university.This book is not so much a journey as a sashay through time, equipped with the chemist's eye. History is viewed through the lenses of seventeen different influential iterations of chemistry--and it is undeniably an illuminating view, for all its ease of reading."
119,1585422207,http://goodreads.com/user/show/10064010-adrian-mendoza,4,"Utterly fascinating. The book does a great job of bringing the invisible world of chemistry and bringing it to life in historical, real life examples. Makes you come to appreciate the influence of chemistry in the world around you. A proper read for any looking for an intriguing glimpse into the historical, economic and cultural development of the modern world and no, you do not have to be a chemist or vaguely familiar with chemistry to enjoy this book."
120,1585422207,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3488439-daphne,4,Pretty interesting book. All chapters had something new and interesting in them. Even if some of the molecules/history is something I already knew about. Very well written overall.

122,1585422207,http://goodreads.com/user/show/98176236-sayoni,3,"Penny Le Couteur and Jay Burreson‚Äôs Napoleon‚Äôs Buttons provides readers with a view of both science and history that is often neglected. Le Couteur and Burreson weave unique details about history into the novel while simultaneously expressing the significance of the seventeen molecule groups attributed to in the title. In many cases, those molecules crucially changed the course of history. For example, the fall of the Roman Empire can be blamed on lead poisoning. Lead acetate was used to sweeten their wine. Lead containers were used to store these drinks, and water often reached homes through lead pipes. All of the above mentioned systems were mostly available to wealthy aristocrats, and eventually, symptoms of lead poisoning became prominent in leaders such as Emperor Nero, leading to the empire‚Äôs collapse. Additionally, Napoleon‚Äôs soldiers‚Äô weakness was partially due to inefficient tin buttons on their coats. The extremely frigid temperatures led the buttons to crumble, making the soldiers unable to properly contain heat. This detail is just one of the many interesting points included in the book. The importance of precision and accuracy were also explored in Napoleon‚Äôs Buttons. One chapter of the book discussed the accident involving the space shuttle, Challenger. This section explained that a mere temperature difference affected rubber seals such that its pliability was crucially altered, leading to the tragic explosion. Unusual, intriguing facts are presented in Napoleon‚Äôs Buttons, and the connections made between history and the seventeen molecules is eye-opening. The above examples are only samples from book with a vast collection of enlightening information. From tin buttons to the cause of the Salem Witch trials to hotels made of salt, the information amounts to a broader understanding of the application of not only chemistry, but science as a whole and history as well. Napoleon‚Äôs Buttons allows readers not only to learn, but more importantly, to enjoy learning.I would give this book 3 out of 5 stars, because although it included many fascinating details, at times, I was reminded of reading a textbook. The format of the book sometimes mirrors the format of a textbook, and this caused my mind to drift at times. There was so much information presented in each section of the novel that it could become difficult to digest. Also, some of the points seemed disconnected and did not always flow smoothly. For example, an inventor would be briefly mentioned, and the following sentence would not further discuss his/her accomplishments. The next page would jump to the name of a company or another scientist‚Äôs name. These details seemed to be plopped into the book and did not quite have a purpose. If the goal was to credit those individuals, then that could have been accomplished another way. I found myself distracted by those names because they did not contribute to my understanding of the information presented. When the images of the molecular structures were shown, it was difficult to connect that back to the passage, as the relation between the structure and its significance was not always made explicit. Personally, the structures did not consistently aid my understanding of the book. I expected them to be supplementary, but did not feel that was the case while reading. An abundance of facts and knowledge became slightly overwhelming. However, the book was still an enjoyable read. Having a basic understanding of chemistry helped me to appreciate it more. Napoleon‚Äôs Buttons allowed me to marvel at the possibilities of science that I had previously been oblivious to. Overall, this book led me to the realization that science truly is ubiquitous."
123,1585422207,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5396658-paulo-limp,4,"	Napoleon‚Äôs Buttons is a great example of a 'trivia book'. This is a book where you learn lots of interesting facts, but just tidbits of information. So, great to impress friends and relatives at a dinner table‚Ä¶ and that‚Äôs it.	This books mixes History and Chemistry (mostly Organic Chemistry), picking up substances precious to mankind, describing both the historical relevance associated with the ‚Äústuff‚Äù, and its chemical structure. It is advisable to have at least some basic knowledge in both disciplines to fully enjoy the book (no need for a degree, though). Its title relates to the fact that La Grand Arme√© wore uniforms with Tin buttons ‚Äì however Tin becomes breakable under very low temperatures ‚Äì Russian-style low temperatures. This could have led to the soldiers losing their coats and capes just when they needed them the most ‚Äì perhaps even being decisive to the result of the war, and the fate of Europe.	No worries ‚Äì Penny Le Couteur knows this is speculative, and should not be taken too seriously. It works to illustrate the point. The molecules described in the book were in fact, more important than tin buttons. There are both examples from old substances, like salt, olive oil, and sugar ‚Äì to more recent discoveries, like plastics, antibiotics and analgesics.	There is some pattern, though, that the reader can observe through the book. The story usually goes this way: Some substance was very valuable to man, and was hard to get. Some people got rich extracting it. Then rich countries from Europe found a way to steal the stuff, and became even richer, until some scientist was able to synthesize the molecule (usually in the 19th century), and then it became cheap and available to everyone.	Or‚Ä¶ Some scientist (again, in the 19th century) accidentally discovered a new substance, when he was trying to do a different thing. Fortunately, he realized the value of what he had invented, and the world became a better place because of it.	Yet, I learned lots of ‚Äúcool stuff‚Äù in the book, as I‚Äôve mentioned. For instance, I was shocked to learn that up until recently, chemists considered part of the ‚Äúscientific method‚Äù to actually taste the new chemicals they created (!?), recording the sensations on the tongue. I hope not too many scientists died this way ‚Äì it was surely a way to dedicate one‚Äôs life to science.	I learned how penicillin kills bacteria. I learned why vegetal oils are mostly liquid at room temperature, while animal fat is mostly solid. I learned why a meal with vegetables is called a ‚Äúsalad‚Äù. I learned how refrigerators stay cold. And many more interesting facts.	There is no ‚Äúdeep knowledge‚Äù to be obtained from this book. On the other hand, for those ‚Äúnerdy‚Äù like me, there is plenty to keep you interested ‚Äì and also to make you look smart in your friend‚Äôs eyes."
124,1585422207,http://goodreads.com/user/show/35986416-stacy,4,"Right off the bat, I was so engaged and attached to this book! It opened my eyes and I became extremely fascinated with the idea of how these tiny (unseen to the naked eye) molecules have such big roles in changing the course of history. There is a quote that really spoke out to me as soon as I opened the book:‚ÄúThe idea that momentous events may depend on something as small as a molecule---a group of two or more atoms held together in a definite arrangement---offers a novel approach to understanding the growth of human civilization. A change as small as the position of a bond---the link between atoms in a molecule---can lead to enormous differences in properties of a substance and in turn influence the course of history (pg.6).‚Äù Already, it grabbed my attention.To be honest, at first, I thought that this book was not going to be interesting because I am not a huge non-fiction fan, especially when it comes to science (science is the course that I often have difficult understanding in). However, I was proved wrong because this book is a smooth blend between history and chemistry, and it is filled with interesting factual stories to how each of these molecules were discovered and/or created. It also contained visuals and diagrams of each molecule's chemical structure when looked at microscopically (it gets down to the ""nitty-gritty"" of the structure and properties). These pictures aid my understanding in the significance of their structures and chemical elements and how it played with discussing the roles of the molecules. It discussed about the compound's bonds, protein chains, OH groups, benzene rings, and more! These differences in the visuals allowed me to pinpoint the tiny differences in the structures to see how it would change the roles of these molecules. I also enjoyed how some of the scientific terms that I unheard of were defined along in the paragraphs, which guided my understanding even more. However, I wish that some of the visuals would be pictures other than their structures or would be displayed in a different format as it can often get monotonous viewing them over and over again.This book allowed me to ponder and analyze the value of these molecules and question ""what ifs"" these molecules did not come into existence. Would our world and lifestyles be where it is right now? Or would it be in a different state? These questions were the reason why I became so intrigued and engaged by this book; it places you in a state of thinking and makes you itch to find out more about these molecules.Overall, it was a great book to read and I enjoyed my experience. I would definitely suggest this book to other readers!"
125,1585422207,http://goodreads.com/user/show/68463765-jack-sundquist,3,"In 1812, 600,000 French troops of Napoleon‚Äôs Grande Arm√©e marched towards Moscow in the hope of conquering Russia. However, frigid temperatures, disease, and lack of supplies forced the Grande Arm√©e to retreat, and only 10,000 French troops returned. What could have caused the most powerful army an Earth to collapse? One theory has to do with the buttons of the soldiers. French troops wore tin buttons to hold up their uniforms. In cold temperatures, however, tin decomposes into a fine white powder. So, Napoleon‚Äôs troops would have certainly had their buttons disintegrate. Could the lack of buttons forced French soldiers to hold up their uniforms themselves, preventing them from being able to bring as much supplies as possible, contributing their food and clothing shortages?This and other historical events are given in Napoleon‚Äôs Buttons: 17 Molecules that Changed the World by Penny Le Couteur and Jay Burreson. This nonfiction book discusses 17 important molecules, and their impact on history. Each molecules has their own chapter, which mostly follows the following structure: the molecule is introduced through a story that explains the importance of the molecule. Then, the structure of the molecule is given and the properties of the molecule is explained through this structure. Finally, the chapter ends through further explanation of the impact of the molecules and a summary of the chapter. The most interesting chapter to me was phenol, a group of molecules that was found in early antiseptic, plastics, marijuana, cotton, photographic paper, electrical insulator, billiard balls, and many more. It was also responsible for limiting the killing of elephants, development of the inexpensive Kodak camera, and widespread use of electrical energy. The fact that a single molecule group could be used in such a large variety of items is fascinating to me.I give this book four out of five stars. It is a very interesting book that explains how many unappreciated aspects of our life came to be. It combines chemistry with history to provide the reader with a very informative experience. The reason I did not give it a five is because this is not the most entertaining book. There are some times in this book that I felt the book took too long about a specific event, but the majority of the book is still interesting. I would recommend this book to anyone because it will give them a different perspective on the causes and effects of historical events. You do not need to know about chemistry, but having a knowledge of chemistry will let you appreciate this book more. "
126,1585422207,http://goodreads.com/user/show/45859662-george-goodall,3,"I have a soft spot for social histories of technology -- books that demonstrate how a particular thing came about and, more importantly, the impact that that thing has had on us. ""Napoleon's Buttons"" is certainly part of that oeuvre. My first encounter with the book was years ago in an airport book store; I didn't buy it. It did, however, get a mention in what I was reading at the time, Foucault's ""Archaeology of Knowledge"" (I was in grad school). In a bit of marginalia I scrawled: ""Guns, Germs, and Steel [Diamond]? Salt [Kurlansky]? Napoleon's Buttons? SCOT?"" Foucault's passage deserves repeating here:""From the political mobility at the surface down to the slow movements of 'material civilization', ever more levels of knowledge have been established: each has its own peculiar discontinuities and patterns; and as one descends to the deepest levels, the rhythms become broader. Beneath the rapidly changing history of governments, wars, and famines, there emerge other, apparently unmoving histories: the history of sea routes, the history of corn or of gold-mining, the history of drought and of irrigation, the history of crop rotation, the history of balance achieved by the human species between hunger and abundance.""(Yeah, it's Foucault.)""Napoleon's Buttons"" is an ""unmoving history"" of organic chemistry... mostly. There is a chapter on salt (see Kurlansky above) but it's mostly to set up a discussion on chlorine, CFCs, etc.For such a dry topic, it's actually quite a fascinating read. The history of organic chemistry is really the history of modern trade and science. The title comes from the great coats of Napoleon's army during its disastrous winter campaign in Russia. The buttons of these coats were made from a tin alloy that crumbled in cold temperatures. Without buttons, the soldiers froze, and Napoleon lost. Chemistry has its consequences.Each chapter is the story of a new substance:- Peppers, nutmeg, and cloves- Ascorbic acid- Glucose- Cellulose- Nitro compounds- Silk and Nylon- Phenol- Isoprene- Dyes- Wonder drugs- The pill- Molecules of witchcraft- Morphine, nicotine, and caffeine- Oleic acid- Salt- Chlorocarbon compounds- Molecules versus MalariaOverall, an interesting read but it is perhaps better as a reference volume for esoteric trivia questions."
127,1585422207,http://goodreads.com/user/show/66814782-dawn,4,"Overall, this book takes a chemical look at 17 molecule families and not only their uses and discoveries, but how they changed the way things were done even if people hadn't come to the place where chemical composition was detected. The writing is detailed but interesting. The writers show diagrams of the molecules they discuss, so their introduction gives a brief description of how chemical compounds are diagrammed. The title is explained right away in that the buttons which were sewn on Napoleon's army men were not made of metal (they were made of tin) which was able to retain its shape in the cold the men experienced during the Russian winter of 1812-1813. So, not only were the men attempting to fight and move resources for battle, but they were also holding their coats together because the tin had disintegrated. The authors wonder if history might have been changed if the clothing were instead accessorized with metal better able to withstand the frigid temperatures. At the back of the book, there is an index and a selected bibliography."
128,1585422207,http://goodreads.com/user/show/114641769-tayah-turocy,4,"Napoleon's Buttons was not what I expected in the best of ways. I thoroughly enjoyed reading and learning through each incredibly unique chapter. This book had the absolute best mix of history and chemistry. As a chemistry PhD student, I felt very comfortable about the way the chemistry was presented, but I still learned a lot of new information and interesting facts. I am not a big history buff; however, the topics discussed were well explained, relatable, and understandable. I have never read a book that so clearly described so many things in a single story. Although the transitions where a bit far-fetched between chapters, I did appreciate the attempt to link diverse subjects together. Further, I loved how the description of chemistry grew in complexity from chapter to chapter. If you are looking for a fun book club novel, this book would be great. The number of chapters and topics seemed overwhelming at times, but it successfully kept the readers' interests peaked with consistent switching between both chemistry and historical ideas. "
129,1585422207,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7690422-dina,5,"Awesome book. Grammatical errors don't really bother me that much when the content is as engrossing as this! I'm not an English buff either so the only reason I noticed so many errors is because the person before me apparently had a field day correcting the authors' mistakes with pencil. Anyhow this book is really cool -- anyone who loves chemistry or history or both will appreciate it. And even if you want to learn just a bit of trivia, you'll learn a lot of it from the perspective these authors bring. The title is kind of an attention-grabber because the story of Napoleon's buttons is touched on in the intro and there are other molecules that take up way more anecdotal space than that one. Some of the stories you'll recognize like the importance of spices and sugar on The Age of Discovery in Western Europe and worldwide. However, though the stories are recognizable, the focus on molecules and the scientific advances that came about are refreshing and put a new spin on these tales. "

The text is divided into 17 chapters, with each chapter allotted to individual molecules or similar groups of molecules. Not only do Le Couteur and Burreson confer natural molecules, but synthetic as well, making sure to encompass the majority of human activity. They explain how peppers, nutmegs, cloves, and more launched a wave of global explorations, beginning with the Middle Ages and ending with the European colonies. The authors reveal a multitude of tall tales from all over the world and weave them into their novel to dramatically illustrate the scientific structure of modern society. Napoleon's Buttons: How 17 Molecules Changed History is Contemplative, astounding, and effortlessly written. "

Especially with the story of Napoleon's buttons--which is used in the books introduction (which is also part of title), the thing is though none of the chapters is that grabbing.The authors do note in the intro that the history presented would be disjointed and that they will talk a out groups of molecules, I believe the help of anctual historian would have been helpful. It got bogged down by too much science talk that when history did come in I was bored, on the otherhand the opposite happened too. Most of what I learned was about molecules, the history I knew most of (because it really just seemed like general statements) with learning some new small bits. Which okay it's about science, but the reason I kept stopping and what ultimately made me stop reading was how often it seemed too nonchalant on certain subjects."

Though they tried to make allowances for that by explaining, it wasn't the same. That said, I really enjoyed this book. History, especially history of chemistry, is one of my favorite things, and it was such a treat to see a survey of world history through the lens of chemistry. It's amazing how many things were brought into being or alongside each other throughout time because of capitalism (aka greed). There were many amazing discoveries, but many lives were lost and peoples were subjugated because of it. It was very sobering and sad. "

All in all, it's pretty diverse and interesting. I've been on a sciencey book binge lately and there were things that I already knew since they were covered in other books like The Disappearing Spoon or Drug Hunters, but that's not the author's fault. Even though there was substantial overlap in their coverage of the common molecules, it was only a minor part of the book itself. I'm definitely satisfied with Napoleon's Buttons overall."

This is a great book because it shows how the smallest things in life can make the biggest differences. People don‚Äôt really think about how a tiny molecule could alter the course of history, and the seventeen molecules explained in the book are not the only examples.

In practice, the combination is a bit hit-and-miss. It leans towards more of the latter, but it makes a good effort. Overall, it's ,ore of a history of chemistry than a book about the chemistry of history- much more science than expected, and quite a lot of it is Greek if you're not at all a sciencey person.

The sections on each of the 17 minute molecules stand alone so you can read that section and when you get done if you don‚Äôt pick it up for a while that‚Äôs perfectly fine.

Some molecules, like sodium, caused wars, toppled kingdoms, and encouraged ""international trade.""

The 17 molecules that changed history are each detailed on how the chemical bonds work as well as the influence the compound had on history. From salt to phenols, from ascorbic acid to rubber, there were some compounds that made all the difference in wealth, power, and personal health. A fun romp through the chemical side of history - an aspect of history that many do not consider."

The language is simplified and, although the book introduces chemistry terms and properties well, it‚Äôs not really interesting if you have ever taken an organic chemistry class. One thing that really bugged me was the condescending tone the author takes as they are teaching and imploring the reader to appreciate chemistry, chemists, and science. Yet, I enjoyed the history and kept reading to soak up all the info. This might be interesting for a high school student that appreciates chemistry."

History is viewed through the lenses of seventeen different influential iterations of chemistry--and it is undeniably an illuminating view, for all its ease of reading."

The book does a great job of bringing the invisible world of chemistry and bringing it to life in historical, real life examples. Makes you come to appreciate the influence of chemistry in the world around you. A proper read for any looking for an intriguing glimpse into the historical, economic and cultural development of the modern world and no, you do not have to be a chemist or vaguely familiar with chemistry to enjoy this book."
150,1585422207,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3488439-daphne,4,Pretty interesting book. All chapters had something new and interesting in them. Even if some of the molecules/history is something I already knew about. Very well written overall.

152,1585422207,http://goodreads.com/user/show/98176236-sayoni,3,"Penny Le Couteur and Jay Burreson‚Äôs Napoleon‚Äôs Buttons provides readers with a view of both science and history that is often neglected. Le Couteur and Burreson weave unique details about history into the novel while simultaneously expressing the significance of the seventeen molecule groups attributed to in the title. In many cases, those molecules crucially changed the course of history. For example, the fall of the Roman Empire can be blamed on lead poisoning. Lead acetate was used to sweeten their wine. Lead containers were used to store these drinks, and water often reached homes through lead pipes. All of the above mentioned systems were mostly available to wealthy aristocrats, and eventually, symptoms of lead poisoning became prominent in leaders such as Emperor Nero, leading to the empire‚Äôs collapse. Additionally, Napoleon‚Äôs soldiers‚Äô weakness was partially due to inefficient tin buttons on their coats. The extremely frigid temperatures led the buttons to crumble, making the soldiers unable to properly contain heat. This detail is just one of the many interesting points included in the book. The importance of precision and accuracy were also explored in Napoleon‚Äôs Buttons. One chapter of the book discussed the accident involving the space shuttle, Challenger. This section explained that a mere temperature difference affected rubber seals such that its pliability was crucially altered, leading to the tragic explosion. Unusual, intriguing facts are presented in Napoleon‚Äôs Buttons, and the connections made between history and the seventeen molecules is eye-opening. The above examples are only samples from book with a vast collection of enlightening information. From tin buttons to the cause of the Salem Witch trials to hotels made of salt, the information amounts to a broader understanding of the application of not only chemistry, but science as a whole and history as well. Napoleon‚Äôs Buttons allows readers not only to learn, but more importantly, to enjoy learning.I would give this book 3 out of 5 stars, because although it included many fascinating details, at times, I was reminded of reading a textbook. The format of the book sometimes mirrors the format of a textbook, and this caused my mind to drift at times. There was so much information presented in each section of the novel that it could become difficult to digest. Also, some of the points seemed disconnected and did not always flow smoothly. For example, an inventor would be briefly mentioned, and the following sentence would not further discuss his/her accomplishments. The next page would jump to the name of a company or another scientist‚Äôs name. These details seemed to be plopped into the book and did not quite have a purpose. If the goal was to credit those individuals, then that could have been accomplished another way. I found myself distracted by those names because they did not contribute to my understanding of the information presented. When the images of the molecular structures were shown, it was difficult to connect that back to the passage, as the relation between the structure and its significance was not always made explicit. Personally, the structures did not consistently aid my understanding of the book. I expected them to be supplementary, but did not feel that was the case while reading. An abundance of facts and knowledge became slightly overwhelming. However, the book was still an enjoyable read. Having a basic understanding of chemistry helped me to appreciate it more. Napoleon‚Äôs Buttons allowed me to marvel at the possibilities of science that I had previously been oblivious to. Overall, this book led me to the realization that science truly is ubiquitous."
153,1585422207,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5396658-paulo-limp,4,"	Napoleon‚Äôs Buttons is a great example of a 'trivia book'. This is a book where you learn lots of interesting facts, but just tidbits of information. So, great to impress friends and relatives at a dinner table‚Ä¶ and that‚Äôs it.	This books mixes History and Chemistry (mostly Organic Chemistry), picking up substances precious to mankind, describing both the historical relevance associated with the ‚Äústuff‚Äù, and its chemical structure. It is advisable to have at least some basic knowledge in both disciplines to fully enjoy the book (no need for a degree, though). Its title relates to the fact that La Grand Arme√© wore uniforms with Tin buttons ‚Äì however Tin becomes breakable under very low temperatures ‚Äì Russian-style low temperatures. This could have led to the soldiers losing their coats and capes just when they needed them the most ‚Äì perhaps even being decisive to the result of the war, and the fate of Europe.	No worries ‚Äì Penny Le Couteur knows this is speculative, and should not be taken too seriously. It works to illustrate the point. The molecules described in the book were in fact, more important than tin buttons. There are both examples from old substances, like salt, olive oil, and sugar ‚Äì to more recent discoveries, like plastics, antibiotics and analgesics.	There is some pattern, though, that the reader can observe through the book. The story usually goes this way: Some substance was very valuable to man, and was hard to get. Some people got rich extracting it. Then rich countries from Europe found a way to steal the stuff, and became even richer, until some scientist was able to synthesize the molecule (usually in the 19th century), and then it became cheap and available to everyone.	Or‚Ä¶ Some scientist (again, in the 19th century) accidentally discovered a new substance, when he was trying to do a different thing. Fortunately, he realized the value of what he had invented, and the world became a better place because of it.	Yet, I learned lots of ‚Äúcool stuff‚Äù in the book, as I‚Äôve mentioned. For instance, I was shocked to learn that up until recently, chemists considered part of the ‚Äúscientific method‚Äù to actually taste the new chemicals they created (!?), recording the sensations on the tongue. I hope not too many scientists died this way ‚Äì it was surely a way to dedicate one‚Äôs life to science.	I learned how penicillin kills bacteria. I learned why vegetal oils are mostly liquid at room temperature, while animal fat is mostly solid. I learned why a meal with vegetables is called a ‚Äúsalad‚Äù. I learned how refrigerators stay cold. And many more interesting facts.	There is no ‚Äúdeep knowledge‚Äù to be obtained from this book. On the other hand, for those ‚Äúnerdy‚Äù like me, there is plenty to keep you interested ‚Äì and also to make you look smart in your friend‚Äôs eyes."
154,1585422207,http://goodreads.com/user/show/35986416-stacy,4,"Right off the bat, I was so engaged and attached to this book! It opened my eyes and I became extremely fascinated with the idea of how these tiny (unseen to the naked eye) molecules have such big roles in changing the course of history. There is a quote that really spoke out to me as soon as I opened the book:‚ÄúThe idea that momentous events may depend on something as small as a molecule---a group of two or more atoms held together in a definite arrangement---offers a novel approach to understanding the growth of human civilization. A change as small as the position of a bond---the link between atoms in a molecule---can lead to enormous differences in properties of a substance and in turn influence the course of history (pg.6).‚Äù Already, it grabbed my attention.To be honest, at first, I thought that this book was not going to be interesting because I am not a huge non-fiction fan, especially when it comes to science (science is the course that I often have difficult understanding in). However, I was proved wrong because this book is a smooth blend between history and chemistry, and it is filled with interesting factual stories to how each of these molecules were discovered and/or created. It also contained visuals and diagrams of each molecule's chemical structure when looked at microscopically (it gets down to the ""nitty-gritty"" of the structure and properties). These pictures aid my understanding in the significance of their structures and chemical elements and how it played with discussing the roles of the molecules. It discussed about the compound's bonds, protein chains, OH groups, benzene rings, and more! These differences in the visuals allowed me to pinpoint the tiny differences in the structures to see how it would change the roles of these molecules. I also enjoyed how some of the scientific terms that I unheard of were defined along in the paragraphs, which guided my understanding even more. However, I wish that some of the visuals would be pictures other than their structures or would be displayed in a different format as it can often get monotonous viewing them over and over again.This book allowed me to ponder and analyze the value of these molecules and question ""what ifs"" these molecules did not come into existence. Would our world and lifestyles be where it is right now? Or would it be in a different state? These questions were the reason why I became so intrigued and engaged by this book; it places you in a state of thinking and makes you itch to find out more about these molecules.Overall, it was a great book to read and I enjoyed my experience. I would definitely suggest this book to other readers!"
155,1585422207,http://goodreads.com/user/show/68463765-jack-sundquist,3,"In 1812, 600,000 French troops of Napoleon‚Äôs Grande Arm√©e marched towards Moscow in the hope of conquering Russia. However, frigid temperatures, disease, and lack of supplies forced the Grande Arm√©e to retreat, and only 10,000 French troops returned. What could have caused the most powerful army an Earth to collapse? One theory has to do with the buttons of the soldiers. French troops wore tin buttons to hold up their uniforms. In cold temperatures, however, tin decomposes into a fine white powder. So, Napoleon‚Äôs troops would have certainly had their buttons disintegrate. Could the lack of buttons forced French soldiers to hold up their uniforms themselves, preventing them from being able to bring as much supplies as possible, contributing their food and clothing shortages?This and other historical events are given in Napoleon‚Äôs Buttons: 17 Molecules that Changed the World by Penny Le Couteur and Jay Burreson. This nonfiction book discusses 17 important molecules, and their impact on history. Each molecules has their own chapter, which mostly follows the following structure: the molecule is introduced through a story that explains the importance of the molecule. Then, the structure of the molecule is given and the properties of the molecule is explained through this structure. Finally, the chapter ends through further explanation of the impact of the molecules and a summary of the chapter. The most interesting chapter to me was phenol, a group of molecules that was found in early antiseptic, plastics, marijuana, cotton, photographic paper, electrical insulator, billiard balls, and many more. It was also responsible for limiting the killing of elephants, development of the inexpensive Kodak camera, and widespread use of electrical energy. The fact that a single molecule group could be used in such a large variety of items is fascinating to me.I give this book four out of five stars. It is a very interesting book that explains how many unappreciated aspects of our life came to be. It combines chemistry with history to provide the reader with a very informative experience. The reason I did not give it a five is because this is not the most entertaining book. There are some times in this book that I felt the book took too long about a specific event, but the majority of the book is still interesting. I would recommend this book to anyone because it will give them a different perspective on the causes and effects of historical events. You do not need to know about chemistry, but having a knowledge of chemistry will let you appreciate this book more. "
156,1585422207,http://goodreads.com/user/show/45859662-george-goodall,3,"I have a soft spot for social histories of technology -- books that demonstrate how a particular thing came about and, more importantly, the impact that that thing has had on us. ""Napoleon's Buttons"" is certainly part of that oeuvre. My first encounter with the book was years ago in an airport book store; I didn't buy it. It did, however, get a mention in what I was reading at the time, Foucault's ""Archaeology of Knowledge"" (I was in grad school). In a bit of marginalia I scrawled: ""Guns, Germs, and Steel [Diamond]? Salt [Kurlansky]? Napoleon's Buttons? SCOT?"" Foucault's passage deserves repeating here:""From the political mobility at the surface down to the slow movements of 'material civilization', ever more levels of knowledge have been established: each has its own peculiar discontinuities and patterns; and as one descends to the deepest levels, the rhythms become broader. Beneath the rapidly changing history of governments, wars, and famines, there emerge other, apparently unmoving histories: the history of sea routes, the history of corn or of gold-mining, the history of drought and of irrigation, the history of crop rotation, the history of balance achieved by the human species between hunger and abundance.""(Yeah, it's Foucault.)""Napoleon's Buttons"" is an ""unmoving history"" of organic chemistry... mostly. There is a chapter on salt (see Kurlansky above) but it's mostly to set up a discussion on chlorine, CFCs, etc.For such a dry topic, it's actually quite a fascinating read. The history of organic chemistry is really the history of modern trade and science. The title comes from the great coats of Napoleon's army during its disastrous winter campaign in Russia. The buttons of these coats were made from a tin alloy that crumbled in cold temperatures. Without buttons, the soldiers froze, and Napoleon lost. Chemistry has its consequences.Each chapter is the story of a new substance:- Peppers, nutmeg, and cloves- Ascorbic acid- Glucose- Cellulose- Nitro compounds- Silk and Nylon- Phenol- Isoprene- Dyes- Wonder drugs- The pill- Molecules of witchcraft- Morphine, nicotine, and caffeine- Oleic acid- Salt- Chlorocarbon compounds- Molecules versus MalariaOverall, an interesting read but it is perhaps better as a reference volume for esoteric trivia questions."
157,1585422207,http://goodreads.com/user/show/66814782-dawn,4,"Overall, this book takes a chemical look at 17 molecule families and not only their uses and discoveries, but how they changed the way things were done even if people hadn't come to the place where chemical composition was detected. The writing is detailed but interesting. The writers show diagrams of the molecules they discuss, so their introduction gives a brief description of how chemical compounds are diagrammed. The title is explained right away in that the buttons which were sewn on Napoleon's army men were not made of metal (they were made of tin) which was able to retain its shape in the cold the men experienced during the Russian winter of 1812-1813. So, not only were the men attempting to fight and move resources for battle, but they were also holding their coats together because the tin had disintegrated. The authors wonder if history might have been changed if the clothing were instead accessorized with metal better able to withstand the frigid temperatures. At the back of the book, there is an index and a selected bibliography."
158,1585422207,http://goodreads.com/user/show/114641769-tayah-turocy,4,"Napoleon's Buttons was not what I expected in the best of ways. I thoroughly enjoyed reading and learning through each incredibly unique chapter. This book had the absolute best mix of history and chemistry. As a chemistry PhD student, I felt very comfortable about the way the chemistry was presented, but I still learned a lot of new information and interesting facts. I am not a big history buff; however, the topics discussed were well explained, relatable, and understandable. I have never read a book that so clearly described so many things in a single story. Although the transitions where a bit far-fetched between chapters, I did appreciate the attempt to link diverse subjects together. Further, I loved how the description of chemistry grew in complexity from chapter to chapter. If you are looking for a fun book club novel, this book would be great. The number of chapters and topics seemed overwhelming at times, but it successfully kept the readers' interests peaked with consistent switching between both chemistry and historical ideas. "
159,1585422207,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7690422-dina,5,"Awesome book. Grammatical errors don't really bother me that much when the content is as engrossing as this! I'm not an English buff either so the only reason I noticed so many errors is because the person before me apparently had a field day correcting the authors' mistakes with pencil. Anyhow this book is really cool -- anyone who loves chemistry or history or both will appreciate it. And even if you want to learn just a bit of trivia, you'll learn a lot of it from the perspective these authors bring. The title is kind of an attention-grabber because the story of Napoleon's buttons is touched on in the intro and there are other molecules that take up way more anecdotal space than that one. Some of the stories you'll recognize like the importance of spices and sugar on The Age of Discovery in Western Europe and worldwide. However, though the stories are recognizable, the focus on molecules and the scientific advances that came about are refreshing and put a new spin on these tales. "

The text is divided into 17 chapters, with each chapter allotted to individual molecules or similar groups of molecules. Not only do Le Couteur and Burreson confer natural molecules, but synthetic as well, making sure to encompass the majority of human activity. They explain how peppers, nutmegs, cloves, and more launched a wave of global explorations, beginning with the Middle Ages and ending with the European colonies. The authors reveal a multitude of tall tales from all over the world and weave them into their novel to dramatically illustrate the scientific structure of modern society. Napoleon's Buttons: How 17 Molecules Changed History is Contemplative, astounding, and effortlessly written. "

Especially with the story of Napoleon's buttons--which is used in the books introduction (which is also part of title), the thing is though none of the chapters is that grabbing.The authors do note in the intro that the history presented would be disjointed and that they will talk a out groups of molecules, I believe the help of anctual historian would have been helpful. It got bogged down by too much science talk that when history did come in I was bored, on the otherhand the opposite happened too. Most of what I learned was about molecules, the history I knew most of (because it really just seemed like general statements) with learning some new small bits. Which okay it's about science, but the reason I kept stopping and what ultimately made me stop reading was how often it seemed too nonchalant on certain subjects."

Though they tried to make allowances for that by explaining, it wasn't the same. That said, I really enjoyed this book. History, especially history of chemistry, is one of my favorite things, and it was such a treat to see a survey of world history through the lens of chemistry. It's amazing how many things were brought into being or alongside each other throughout time because of capitalism (aka greed). There were many amazing discoveries, but many lives were lost and peoples were subjugated because of it. It was very sobering and sad. "

All in all, it's pretty diverse and interesting. I've been on a sciencey book binge lately and there were things that I already knew since they were covered in other books like The Disappearing Spoon or Drug Hunters, but that's not the author's fault. Even though there was substantial overlap in their coverage of the common molecules, it was only a minor part of the book itself. I'm definitely satisfied with Napoleon's Buttons overall."

The book‚Äôs intro includes information about chemical structures so people who are not experienced with chemistry are still able to get intro he book. This is a great book because it shows how the smallest things in life can make the biggest differences. People don‚Äôt really think about how a tiny molecule could alter the course of history, and the seventeen molecules explained in the book are not the only examples. Every molecule in the natural world has a major role in preserving it and this book really sparked my interest for learning more about bio chemistry.

In practice, the combination is a bit hit-and-miss. It leans towards more of the latter, but it makes a good effort. Overall, it's ,ore of a history of chemistry than a book about the chemistry of history- much more science than expected, and quite a lot of it is Greek if you're not at all a sciencey person.

The sections on each of the 17 minute molecules stand alone so you can read that section and when you get done if you don‚Äôt pick it up for a while that‚Äôs perfectly fine.

Some molecules, like sodium, caused wars, toppled kingdoms, and encouraged ""international trade.""

Given that everything is made of molecules, that‚Äôs sort of a given. But the book then undercuts its point by clarifying, at every turn, that history is complicated and more than any one factor or molecule has decided Napoleon‚Äôs defeat in Russia or the American independence.

The language is simplified and, although the book introduces chemistry terms and properties well, it‚Äôs not really interesting if you have ever taken an organic chemistry class. One thing that really bugged me was the condescending tone the author takes as they are teaching and imploring the reader to appreciate chemistry, chemists, and science. Yet, I enjoyed the history and kept reading to soak up all the info. This might be interesting for a high school student that appreciates chemistry."
178,1585422207,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5125829-ana,4,"My high school chemistry teacher recommended this book to me, and now I have read it for a course in the chemistry of art in my final year of university.This book is not so much a journey as a sashay through time, equipped with the chemist's eye. History is viewed through the lenses of seventeen different influential iterations of chemistry--and it is undeniably an illuminating view, for all its ease of reading."
179,1585422207,http://goodreads.com/user/show/10064010-adrian-mendoza,4,"Utterly fascinating. The book does a great job of bringing the invisible world of chemistry and bringing it to life in historical, real life examples. Makes you come to appreciate the influence of chemistry in the world around you. A proper read for any looking for an intriguing glimpse into the historical, economic and cultural development of the modern world and no, you do not have to be a chemist or vaguely familiar with chemistry to enjoy this book."
180,1585422207,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3488439-daphne,4,Pretty interesting book. All chapters had something new and interesting in them. Even if some of the molecules/history is something I already knew about. Very well written overall. 
181,1585422207,http://goodreads.com/user/show/11281158-kathy,4,"Fascinating, fabulous read. Be prepared for the challenge of chemistry blended with history of molecules that will stretch your mind and engage you in a way that is entirely unique!"
182,1585422207,http://goodreads.com/user/show/98176236-sayoni,3,"Penny Le Couteur and Jay Burreson‚Äôs Napoleon‚Äôs Buttons provides readers with a view of both science and history that is often neglected. Le Couteur and Burreson weave unique details about history into the novel while simultaneously expressing the significance of the seventeen molecule groups attributed to in the title. In many cases, those molecules crucially changed the course of history. For example, the fall of the Roman Empire can be blamed on lead poisoning. Lead acetate was used to sweeten their wine. Lead containers were used to store these drinks, and water often reached homes through lead pipes. All of the above mentioned systems were mostly available to wealthy aristocrats, and eventually, symptoms of lead poisoning became prominent in leaders such as Emperor Nero, leading to the empire‚Äôs collapse. Additionally, Napoleon‚Äôs soldiers‚Äô weakness was partially due to inefficient tin buttons on their coats. The extremely frigid temperatures led the buttons to crumble, making the soldiers unable to properly contain heat. This detail is just one of the many interesting points included in the book. The importance of precision and accuracy were also explored in Napoleon‚Äôs Buttons. One chapter of the book discussed the accident involving the space shuttle, Challenger. This section explained that a mere temperature difference affected rubber seals such that its pliability was crucially altered, leading to the tragic explosion. Unusual, intriguing facts are presented in Napoleon‚Äôs Buttons, and the connections made between history and the seventeen molecules is eye-opening. The above examples are only samples from book with a vast collection of enlightening information. From tin buttons to the cause of the Salem Witch trials to hotels made of salt, the information amounts to a broader understanding of the application of not only chemistry, but science as a whole and history as well. Napoleon‚Äôs Buttons allows readers not only to learn, but more importantly, to enjoy learning.I would give this book 3 out of 5 stars, because although it included many fascinating details, at times, I was reminded of reading a textbook. The format of the book sometimes mirrors the format of a textbook, and this caused my mind to drift at times. There was so much information presented in each section of the novel that it could become difficult to digest. Also, some of the points seemed disconnected and did not always flow smoothly. For example, an inventor would be briefly mentioned, and the following sentence would not further discuss his/her accomplishments. The next page would jump to the name of a company or another scientist‚Äôs name. These details seemed to be plopped into the book and did not quite have a purpose. If the goal was to credit those individuals, then that could have been accomplished another way. I found myself distracted by those names because they did not contribute to my understanding of the information presented. When the images of the molecular structures were shown, it was difficult to connect that back to the passage, as the relation between the structure and its significance was not always made explicit. Personally, the structures did not consistently aid my understanding of the book. I expected them to be supplementary, but did not feel that was the case while reading. An abundance of facts and knowledge became slightly overwhelming. However, the book was still an enjoyable read. Having a basic understanding of chemistry helped me to appreciate it more. Napoleon‚Äôs Buttons allowed me to marvel at the possibilities of science that I had previously been oblivious to. Overall, this book led me to the realization that science truly is ubiquitous."
183,1585422207,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5396658-paulo-limp,4,"	Napoleon‚Äôs Buttons is a great example of a 'trivia book'. This is a book where you learn lots of interesting facts, but just tidbits of information. So, great to impress friends and relatives at a dinner table‚Ä¶ and that‚Äôs it.	This books mixes History and Chemistry (mostly Organic Chemistry), picking up substances precious to mankind, describing both the historical relevance associated with the ‚Äústuff‚Äù, and its chemical structure. It is advisable to have at least some basic knowledge in both disciplines to fully enjoy the book (no need for a degree, though). Its title relates to the fact that La Grand Arme√© wore uniforms with Tin buttons ‚Äì however Tin becomes breakable under very low temperatures ‚Äì Russian-style low temperatures. This could have led to the soldiers losing their coats and capes just when they needed them the most ‚Äì perhaps even being decisive to the result of the war, and the fate of Europe.	No worries ‚Äì Penny Le Couteur knows this is speculative, and should not be taken too seriously. It works to illustrate the point. The molecules described in the book were in fact, more important than tin buttons. There are both examples from old substances, like salt, olive oil, and sugar ‚Äì to more recent discoveries, like plastics, antibiotics and analgesics.	There is some pattern, though, that the reader can observe through the book. The story usually goes this way: Some substance was very valuable to man, and was hard to get. Some people got rich extracting it. Then rich countries from Europe found a way to steal the stuff, and became even richer, until some scientist was able to synthesize the molecule (usually in the 19th century), and then it became cheap and available to everyone.	Or‚Ä¶ Some scientist (again, in the 19th century) accidentally discovered a new substance, when he was trying to do a different thing. Fortunately, he realized the value of what he had invented, and the world became a better place because of it.	Yet, I learned lots of ‚Äúcool stuff‚Äù in the book, as I‚Äôve mentioned. For instance, I was shocked to learn that up until recently, chemists considered part of the ‚Äúscientific method‚Äù to actually taste the new chemicals they created (!?), recording the sensations on the tongue. I hope not too many scientists died this way ‚Äì it was surely a way to dedicate one‚Äôs life to science.	I learned how penicillin kills bacteria. I learned why vegetal oils are mostly liquid at room temperature, while animal fat is mostly solid. I learned why a meal with vegetables is called a ‚Äúsalad‚Äù. I learned how refrigerators stay cold. And many more interesting facts.	There is no ‚Äúdeep knowledge‚Äù to be obtained from this book. On the other hand, for those ‚Äúnerdy‚Äù like me, there is plenty to keep you interested ‚Äì and also to make you look smart in your friend‚Äôs eyes."
184,1585422207,http://goodreads.com/user/show/35986416-stacy,4,"Right off the bat, I was so engaged and attached to this book! It opened my eyes and I became extremely fascinated with the idea of how these tiny (unseen to the naked eye) molecules have such big roles in changing the course of history. There is a quote that really spoke out to me as soon as I opened the book:‚ÄúThe idea that momentous events may depend on something as small as a molecule---a group of two or more atoms held together in a definite arrangement---offers a novel approach to understanding the growth of human civilization. A change as small as the position of a bond---the link between atoms in a molecule---can lead to enormous differences in properties of a substance and in turn influence the course of history (pg.6).‚Äù Already, it grabbed my attention.To be honest, at first, I thought that this book was not going to be interesting because I am not a huge non-fiction fan, especially when it comes to science (science is the course that I often have difficult understanding in). However, I was proved wrong because this book is a smooth blend between history and chemistry, and it is filled with interesting factual stories to how each of these molecules were discovered and/or created. It also contained visuals and diagrams of each molecule's chemical structure when looked at microscopically (it gets down to the ""nitty-gritty"" of the structure and properties). These pictures aid my understanding in the significance of their structures and chemical elements and how it played with discussing the roles of the molecules. It discussed about the compound's bonds, protein chains, OH groups, benzene rings, and more! These differences in the visuals allowed me to pinpoint the tiny differences in the structures to see how it would change the roles of these molecules. I also enjoyed how some of the scientific terms that I unheard of were defined along in the paragraphs, which guided my understanding even more. However, I wish that some of the visuals would be pictures other than their structures or would be displayed in a different format as it can often get monotonous viewing them over and over again.This book allowed me to ponder and analyze the value of these molecules and question ""what ifs"" these molecules did not come into existence. Would our world and lifestyles be where it is right now? Or would it be in a different state? These questions were the reason why I became so intrigued and engaged by this book; it places you in a state of thinking and makes you itch to find out more about these molecules.Overall, it was a great book to read and I enjoyed my experience. I would definitely suggest this book to other readers!"
185,1585422207,http://goodreads.com/user/show/68463765-jack-sundquist,3,"In 1812, 600,000 French troops of Napoleon‚Äôs Grande Arm√©e marched towards Moscow in the hope of conquering Russia. However, frigid temperatures, disease, and lack of supplies forced the Grande Arm√©e to retreat, and only 10,000 French troops returned. What could have caused the most powerful army an Earth to collapse? One theory has to do with the buttons of the soldiers. French troops wore tin buttons to hold up their uniforms. In cold temperatures, however, tin decomposes into a fine white powder. So, Napoleon‚Äôs troops would have certainly had their buttons disintegrate. Could the lack of buttons forced French soldiers to hold up their uniforms themselves, preventing them from being able to bring as much supplies as possible, contributing their food and clothing shortages?This and other historical events are given in Napoleon‚Äôs Buttons: 17 Molecules that Changed the World by Penny Le Couteur and Jay Burreson. This nonfiction book discusses 17 important molecules, and their impact on history. Each molecules has their own chapter, which mostly follows the following structure: the molecule is introduced through a story that explains the importance of the molecule. Then, the structure of the molecule is given and the properties of the molecule is explained through this structure. Finally, the chapter ends through further explanation of the impact of the molecules and a summary of the chapter. The most interesting chapter to me was phenol, a group of molecules that was found in early antiseptic, plastics, marijuana, cotton, photographic paper, electrical insulator, billiard balls, and many more. It was also responsible for limiting the killing of elephants, development of the inexpensive Kodak camera, and widespread use of electrical energy. The fact that a single molecule group could be used in such a large variety of items is fascinating to me.I give this book four out of five stars. It is a very interesting book that explains how many unappreciated aspects of our life came to be. It combines chemistry with history to provide the reader with a very informative experience. The reason I did not give it a five is because this is not the most entertaining book. There are some times in this book that I felt the book took too long about a specific event, but the majority of the book is still interesting. I would recommend this book to anyone because it will give them a different perspective on the causes and effects of historical events. You do not need to know about chemistry, but having a knowledge of chemistry will let you appreciate this book more. "
186,1585422207,http://goodreads.com/user/show/45859662-george-goodall,3,"I have a soft spot for social histories of technology -- books that demonstrate how a particular thing came about and, more importantly, the impact that that thing has had on us. ""Napoleon's Buttons"" is certainly part of that oeuvre. My first encounter with the book was years ago in an airport book store; I didn't buy it. It did, however, get a mention in what I was reading at the time, Foucault's ""Archaeology of Knowledge"" (I was in grad school). In a bit of marginalia I scrawled: ""Guns, Germs, and Steel [Diamond]? Salt [Kurlansky]? Napoleon's Buttons? SCOT?"" Foucault's passage deserves repeating here:""From the political mobility at the surface down to the slow movements of 'material civilization', ever more levels of knowledge have been established: each has its own peculiar discontinuities and patterns; and as one descends to the deepest levels, the rhythms become broader. Beneath the rapidly changing history of governments, wars, and famines, there emerge other, apparently unmoving histories: the history of sea routes, the history of corn or of gold-mining, the history of drought and of irrigation, the history of crop rotation, the history of balance achieved by the human species between hunger and abundance.""(Yeah, it's Foucault.)""Napoleon's Buttons"" is an ""unmoving history"" of organic chemistry... mostly. There is a chapter on salt (see Kurlansky above) but it's mostly to set up a discussion on chlorine, CFCs, etc.For such a dry topic, it's actually quite a fascinating read. The history of organic chemistry is really the history of modern trade and science. The title comes from the great coats of Napoleon's army during its disastrous winter campaign in Russia. The buttons of these coats were made from a tin alloy that crumbled in cold temperatures. Without buttons, the soldiers froze, and Napoleon lost. Chemistry has its consequences.Each chapter is the story of a new substance:- Peppers, nutmeg, and cloves- Ascorbic acid- Glucose- Cellulose- Nitro compounds- Silk and Nylon- Phenol- Isoprene- Dyes- Wonder drugs- The pill- Molecules of witchcraft- Morphine, nicotine, and caffeine- Oleic acid- Salt- Chlorocarbon compounds- Molecules versus MalariaOverall, an interesting read but it is perhaps better as a reference volume for esoteric trivia questions."
187,1585422207,http://goodreads.com/user/show/66814782-dawn,4,"Overall, this book takes a chemical look at 17 molecule families and not only their uses and discoveries, but how they changed the way things were done even if people hadn't come to the place where chemical composition was detected. The writing is detailed but interesting. The writers show diagrams of the molecules they discuss, so their introduction gives a brief description of how chemical compounds are diagrammed. The title is explained right away in that the buttons which were sewn on Napoleon's army men were not made of metal (they were made of tin) which was able to retain its shape in the cold the men experienced during the Russian winter of 1812-1813. So, not only were the men attempting to fight and move resources for battle, but they were also holding their coats together because the tin had disintegrated. The authors wonder if history might have been changed if the clothing were instead accessorized with metal better able to withstand the frigid temperatures. At the back of the book, there is an index and a selected bibliography."
188,1585422207,http://goodreads.com/user/show/114641769-tayah-turocy,4,"Napoleon's Buttons was not what I expected in the best of ways. I thoroughly enjoyed reading and learning through each incredibly unique chapter. This book had the absolute best mix of history and chemistry. As a chemistry PhD student, I felt very comfortable about the way the chemistry was presented, but I still learned a lot of new information and interesting facts. I am not a big history buff; however, the topics discussed were well explained, relatable, and understandable. I have never read a book that so clearly described so many things in a single story. Although the transitions where a bit far-fetched between chapters, I did appreciate the attempt to link diverse subjects together. Further, I loved how the description of chemistry grew in complexity from chapter to chapter. If you are looking for a fun book club novel, this book would be great. The number of chapters and topics seemed overwhelming at times, but it successfully kept the readers' interests peaked with consistent switching between both chemistry and historical ideas. "
189,1585422207,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7690422-dina,5,"Awesome book. Grammatical errors don't really bother me that much when the content is as engrossing as this! I'm not an English buff either so the only reason I noticed so many errors is because the person before me apparently had a field day correcting the authors' mistakes with pencil. Anyhow this book is really cool -- anyone who loves chemistry or history or both will appreciate it. And even if you want to learn just a bit of trivia, you'll learn a lot of it from the perspective these authors bring. The title is kind of an attention-grabber because the story of Napoleon's buttons is touched on in the intro and there are other molecules that take up way more anecdotal space than that one. Some of the stories you'll recognize like the importance of spices and sugar on The Age of Discovery in Western Europe and worldwide. However, though the stories are recognizable, the focus on molecules and the scientific advances that came about are refreshing and put a new spin on these tales. "
190,1585422207,http://goodreads.com/user/show/106519798-bella,4,"Combining history with science, Le Couteur and industrial chemist Burreson lay out the basis of molecular structures, accentuating the difference a microscopic molecular alteration can make. The text is divided into 17 chapters, with each chapter allotted to individual molecules or similar groups of molecules. Not only do Le Couteur and Burreson confer natural molecules, but synthetic as well, making sure to encompass the majority of human activity. They explain how peppers, nutmegs, cloves, and more launched a wave of global explorations, beginning with the Middle Ages and ending with the European colonies. The authors reveal a multitude of tall tales from all over the world and weave them into their novel to dramatically illustrate the scientific structure of modern society. Napoleon's Buttons: How 17 Molecules Changed History is Contemplative, astounding, and effortlessly written. "
191,1585422207,http://goodreads.com/user/show/108304936-izzy,1,"Dfn pg 200. (Skimmed to 222)I was interested in the concept of this book. Especially with the story of Napoleon's buttons--which is used in the books introduction (which is also part of title), the thing is though none of the chapters is that grabbing.The authors do note in the intro that the history presented would be disjointed and that they will talk a out groups of molecules, I believe the help of anctual historian would have been helpful. It got bogged down by too much science talk that when history did come in I was bored, on the otherhand the opposite happened too. Most of what I learned was about molecules, the history I knew most of (because it really just seemed like general statements) with learning some new small bits. Which okay it's about science, but the reason I kept stopping and what ultimately made me stop reading was how often it seemed too nonchalant on certain subjects."
192,1585422207,http://goodreads.com/user/show/15429459-leah,4,"Audiobook.For the first time I ever, I felt something was lost by listening rather than reading, and that only because I wasn't able to see the Lewis structures diagrammed in the book. Though they tried to make allowances for that by explaining, it wasn't the same. That said, I really enjoyed this book. History, especially history of chemistry, is one of my favorite things, and it was such a treat to see a survey of world history through the lens of chemistry. It's amazing how many things were brought into being or alongside each other throughout time because of capitalism (aka greed). There were many amazing discoveries, but many lives were lost and peoples were subjugated because of it. It was very sobering and sad. "

All in all, it's pretty diverse and interesting. I've been on a sciencey book binge lately and there were things that I already knew since they were covered in other books like The Disappearing Spoon or Drug Hunters, but that's not the author's fault. Even though there was substantial overlap in their coverage of the common molecules, it was only a minor part of the book itself. I'm definitely satisfied with Napoleon's Buttons overall."

The book‚Äôs intro includes information about chemical structures so people who are not experienced with chemistry are still able to get intro he book. This is a great book because it shows how the smallest things in life can make the biggest differences. People don‚Äôt really think about how a tiny molecule could alter the course of history, and the seventeen molecules explained in the book are not the only examples. Every molecule in the natural world has a major role in preserving it and this book really sparked my interest for learning more about bio chemistry.

I learned so much from this book, for example, the piperine molecule gives pepper its ‚Äúspicy‚Äù taste because of the shape of the molecule stimulates the nerve receptors to register pain. And that the British obtained New Amsterdam from the Dutch by going to war over nutmeg, which was thought to ward of the black plague! Fascinating information.

In practice, the combination is a bit hit-and-miss. It leans towards more of the latter, but it makes a good effort. Overall, it's ,ore of a history of chemistry than a book about the chemistry of history- much more science than expected, and quite a lot of it is Greek if you're not at all a sciencey person.

I just kept wanting to get to the more interesting history tidbits, so I ended up skipping chunks of the book to find stuff that appealed to me. To me, this was a three star read at best.

There is enough of a introduction to the basics that one can read the book without being overwhelmed by technical details, but can still appreciate the tiny molecular differences that make some of the stories so fascinating. The book gave my world view a nice kick in the teeth. There is so much that we take for granted, not realizing the hardship and battles that had to happen just for us to have what we do.

There is a little bit of chemistry in it but not so much is to drive you nuts- particularly if you are chemistry adverse. This is not the kind of book that you stay up late reading or you have to get to the end but it‚Äôs a great in your car book if that makes sense. The sections on each of the 17 minute molecules stand alone so you can read that section and when you get done if you don‚Äôt pick it up for a while that‚Äôs perfectly fine.

A book that talks about an area, in this case chemistry, in a way that is understandable and fascinating. The author devotes a chapter to each of 17 molecules and discusses their discovery and the cascading impact of the molecules as scientists in the past tried to determine their usefulness. Some molecules, like sodium, caused wars, toppled kingdoms, and encouraged ""international trade."" I found each chapter interesting and plan to read this book again because there were too many interesting facts to process in a single reading--at least for my aging brain.

Napoleon's buttons is a very similar kind of book, combining chemistry and history. This book also includes the basics of organic chemistry for non scientists, so that the reader can appreciate how similar some molecules from different plants really are. The 17 molecules discussed in the book our eyes are natural, like piperine from pepper or isoeugenol from nutmeg, or completely manmade like the birth control pill or CFCs from early refrigerators.

Given that everything is made of molecules, that‚Äôs sort of a given. But the book then undercuts its point by clarifying, at every turn, that history is complicated and more than any one factor or molecule has decided Napoleon‚Äôs defeat in Russia or the American independence. This is true, but it wouldn‚Äôt be UNtrue to charm the reader into a molecular perspective on those stories with a little more confidence. "

The book does a great job of bringing the invisible world of chemistry and bringing it to life in historical, real life examples. Makes you come to appreciate the influence of chemistry in the world around you. A proper read for any looking for an intriguing glimpse into the historical, economic and cultural development of the modern world and no, you do not have to be a chemist or vaguely familiar with chemistry to enjoy this book."
210,1585422207,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3488439-daphne,4,Pretty interesting book. All chapters had something new and interesting in them. Even if some of the molecules/history is something I already knew about. Very well written overall.

212,1585422207,http://goodreads.com/user/show/98176236-sayoni,3,"Penny Le Couteur and Jay Burreson‚Äôs Napoleon‚Äôs Buttons provides readers with a view of both science and history that is often neglected. Le Couteur and Burreson weave unique details about history into the novel while simultaneously expressing the significance of the seventeen molecule groups attributed to in the title. In many cases, those molecules crucially changed the course of history. For example, the fall of the Roman Empire can be blamed on lead poisoning. Lead acetate was used to sweeten their wine. Lead containers were used to store these drinks, and water often reached homes through lead pipes. All of the above mentioned systems were mostly available to wealthy aristocrats, and eventually, symptoms of lead poisoning became prominent in leaders such as Emperor Nero, leading to the empire‚Äôs collapse. Additionally, Napoleon‚Äôs soldiers‚Äô weakness was partially due to inefficient tin buttons on their coats. The extremely frigid temperatures led the buttons to crumble, making the soldiers unable to properly contain heat. This detail is just one of the many interesting points included in the book. The importance of precision and accuracy were also explored in Napoleon‚Äôs Buttons. One chapter of the book discussed the accident involving the space shuttle, Challenger. This section explained that a mere temperature difference affected rubber seals such that its pliability was crucially altered, leading to the tragic explosion. Unusual, intriguing facts are presented in Napoleon‚Äôs Buttons, and the connections made between history and the seventeen molecules is eye-opening. The above examples are only samples from book with a vast collection of enlightening information. From tin buttons to the cause of the Salem Witch trials to hotels made of salt, the information amounts to a broader understanding of the application of not only chemistry, but science as a whole and history as well. Napoleon‚Äôs Buttons allows readers not only to learn, but more importantly, to enjoy learning.I would give this book 3 out of 5 stars, because although it included many fascinating details, at times, I was reminded of reading a textbook. The format of the book sometimes mirrors the format of a textbook, and this caused my mind to drift at times. There was so much information presented in each section of the novel that it could become difficult to digest. Also, some of the points seemed disconnected and did not always flow smoothly. For example, an inventor would be briefly mentioned, and the following sentence would not further discuss his/her accomplishments. The next page would jump to the name of a company or another scientist‚Äôs name. These details seemed to be plopped into the book and did not quite have a purpose. If the goal was to credit those individuals, then that could have been accomplished another way. I found myself distracted by those names because they did not contribute to my understanding of the information presented. When the images of the molecular structures were shown, it was difficult to connect that back to the passage, as the relation between the structure and its significance was not always made explicit. Personally, the structures did not consistently aid my understanding of the book. I expected them to be supplementary, but did not feel that was the case while reading. An abundance of facts and knowledge became slightly overwhelming. However, the book was still an enjoyable read. Having a basic understanding of chemistry helped me to appreciate it more. Napoleon‚Äôs Buttons allowed me to marvel at the possibilities of science that I had previously been oblivious to. Overall, this book led me to the realization that science truly is ubiquitous."
213,1585422207,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5396658-paulo-limp,4,"	Napoleon‚Äôs Buttons is a great example of a 'trivia book'. This is a book where you learn lots of interesting facts, but just tidbits of information. So, great to impress friends and relatives at a dinner table‚Ä¶ and that‚Äôs it.	This books mixes History and Chemistry (mostly Organic Chemistry), picking up substances precious to mankind, describing both the historical relevance associated with the ‚Äústuff‚Äù, and its chemical structure. It is advisable to have at least some basic knowledge in both disciplines to fully enjoy the book (no need for a degree, though). Its title relates to the fact that La Grand Arme√© wore uniforms with Tin buttons ‚Äì however Tin becomes breakable under very low temperatures ‚Äì Russian-style low temperatures. This could have led to the soldiers losing their coats and capes just when they needed them the most ‚Äì perhaps even being decisive to the result of the war, and the fate of Europe.	No worries ‚Äì Penny Le Couteur knows this is speculative, and should not be taken too seriously. It works to illustrate the point. The molecules described in the book were in fact, more important than tin buttons. There are both examples from old substances, like salt, olive oil, and sugar ‚Äì to more recent discoveries, like plastics, antibiotics and analgesics.	There is some pattern, though, that the reader can observe through the book. The story usually goes this way: Some substance was very valuable to man, and was hard to get. Some people got rich extracting it. Then rich countries from Europe found a way to steal the stuff, and became even richer, until some scientist was able to synthesize the molecule (usually in the 19th century), and then it became cheap and available to everyone.	Or‚Ä¶ Some scientist (again, in the 19th century) accidentally discovered a new substance, when he was trying to do a different thing. Fortunately, he realized the value of what he had invented, and the world became a better place because of it.	Yet, I learned lots of ‚Äúcool stuff‚Äù in the book, as I‚Äôve mentioned. For instance, I was shocked to learn that up until recently, chemists considered part of the ‚Äúscientific method‚Äù to actually taste the new chemicals they created (!?), recording the sensations on the tongue. I hope not too many scientists died this way ‚Äì it was surely a way to dedicate one‚Äôs life to science.	I learned how penicillin kills bacteria. I learned why vegetal oils are mostly liquid at room temperature, while animal fat is mostly solid. I learned why a meal with vegetables is called a ‚Äúsalad‚Äù. I learned how refrigerators stay cold. And many more interesting facts.	There is no ‚Äúdeep knowledge‚Äù to be obtained from this book. On the other hand, for those ‚Äúnerdy‚Äù like me, there is plenty to keep you interested ‚Äì and also to make you look smart in your friend‚Äôs eyes."
214,1585422207,http://goodreads.com/user/show/35986416-stacy,4,"Right off the bat, I was so engaged and attached to this book! It opened my eyes and I became extremely fascinated with the idea of how these tiny (unseen to the naked eye) molecules have such big roles in changing the course of history. There is a quote that really spoke out to me as soon as I opened the book:‚ÄúThe idea that momentous events may depend on something as small as a molecule---a group of two or more atoms held together in a definite arrangement---offers a novel approach to understanding the growth of human civilization. A change as small as the position of a bond---the link between atoms in a molecule---can lead to enormous differences in properties of a substance and in turn influence the course of history (pg.6).‚Äù Already, it grabbed my attention.To be honest, at first, I thought that this book was not going to be interesting because I am not a huge non-fiction fan, especially when it comes to science (science is the course that I often have difficult understanding in). However, I was proved wrong because this book is a smooth blend between history and chemistry, and it is filled with interesting factual stories to how each of these molecules were discovered and/or created. It also contained visuals and diagrams of each molecule's chemical structure when looked at microscopically (it gets down to the ""nitty-gritty"" of the structure and properties). These pictures aid my understanding in the significance of their structures and chemical elements and how it played with discussing the roles of the molecules. It discussed about the compound's bonds, protein chains, OH groups, benzene rings, and more! These differences in the visuals allowed me to pinpoint the tiny differences in the structures to see how it would change the roles of these molecules. I also enjoyed how some of the scientific terms that I unheard of were defined along in the paragraphs, which guided my understanding even more. However, I wish that some of the visuals would be pictures other than their structures or would be displayed in a different format as it can often get monotonous viewing them over and over again.This book allowed me to ponder and analyze the value of these molecules and question ""what ifs"" these molecules did not come into existence. Would our world and lifestyles be where it is right now? Or would it be in a different state? These questions were the reason why I became so intrigued and engaged by this book; it places you in a state of thinking and makes you itch to find out more about these molecules.Overall, it was a great book to read and I enjoyed my experience. I would definitely suggest this book to other readers!"
215,1585422207,http://goodreads.com/user/show/68463765-jack-sundquist,3,"In 1812, 600,000 French troops of Napoleon‚Äôs Grande Arm√©e marched towards Moscow in the hope of conquering Russia. However, frigid temperatures, disease, and lack of supplies forced the Grande Arm√©e to retreat, and only 10,000 French troops returned. What could have caused the most powerful army an Earth to collapse? One theory has to do with the buttons of the soldiers. French troops wore tin buttons to hold up their uniforms. In cold temperatures, however, tin decomposes into a fine white powder. So, Napoleon‚Äôs troops would have certainly had their buttons disintegrate. Could the lack of buttons forced French soldiers to hold up their uniforms themselves, preventing them from being able to bring as much supplies as possible, contributing their food and clothing shortages?This and other historical events are given in Napoleon‚Äôs Buttons: 17 Molecules that Changed the World by Penny Le Couteur and Jay Burreson. This nonfiction book discusses 17 important molecules, and their impact on history. Each molecules has their own chapter, which mostly follows the following structure: the molecule is introduced through a story that explains the importance of the molecule. Then, the structure of the molecule is given and the properties of the molecule is explained through this structure. Finally, the chapter ends through further explanation of the impact of the molecules and a summary of the chapter. The most interesting chapter to me was phenol, a group of molecules that was found in early antiseptic, plastics, marijuana, cotton, photographic paper, electrical insulator, billiard balls, and many more. It was also responsible for limiting the killing of elephants, development of the inexpensive Kodak camera, and widespread use of electrical energy. The fact that a single molecule group could be used in such a large variety of items is fascinating to me.I give this book four out of five stars. It is a very interesting book that explains how many unappreciated aspects of our life came to be. It combines chemistry with history to provide the reader with a very informative experience. The reason I did not give it a five is because this is not the most entertaining book. There are some times in this book that I felt the book took too long about a specific event, but the majority of the book is still interesting. I would recommend this book to anyone because it will give them a different perspective on the causes and effects of historical events. You do not need to know about chemistry, but having a knowledge of chemistry will let you appreciate this book more. "
216,1585422207,http://goodreads.com/user/show/45859662-george-goodall,3,"I have a soft spot for social histories of technology -- books that demonstrate how a particular thing came about and, more importantly, the impact that that thing has had on us. ""Napoleon's Buttons"" is certainly part of that oeuvre. My first encounter with the book was years ago in an airport book store; I didn't buy it. It did, however, get a mention in what I was reading at the time, Foucault's ""Archaeology of Knowledge"" (I was in grad school). In a bit of marginalia I scrawled: ""Guns, Germs, and Steel [Diamond]? Salt [Kurlansky]? Napoleon's Buttons? SCOT?"" Foucault's passage deserves repeating here:""From the political mobility at the surface down to the slow movements of 'material civilization', ever more levels of knowledge have been established: each has its own peculiar discontinuities and patterns; and as one descends to the deepest levels, the rhythms become broader. Beneath the rapidly changing history of governments, wars, and famines, there emerge other, apparently unmoving histories: the history of sea routes, the history of corn or of gold-mining, the history of drought and of irrigation, the history of crop rotation, the history of balance achieved by the human species between hunger and abundance.""(Yeah, it's Foucault.)""Napoleon's Buttons"" is an ""unmoving history"" of organic chemistry... mostly. There is a chapter on salt (see Kurlansky above) but it's mostly to set up a discussion on chlorine, CFCs, etc.For such a dry topic, it's actually quite a fascinating read. The history of organic chemistry is really the history of modern trade and science. The title comes from the great coats of Napoleon's army during its disastrous winter campaign in Russia. The buttons of these coats were made from a tin alloy that crumbled in cold temperatures. Without buttons, the soldiers froze, and Napoleon lost. Chemistry has its consequences.Each chapter is the story of a new substance:- Peppers, nutmeg, and cloves- Ascorbic acid- Glucose- Cellulose- Nitro compounds- Silk and Nylon- Phenol- Isoprene- Dyes- Wonder drugs- The pill- Molecules of witchcraft- Morphine, nicotine, and caffeine- Oleic acid- Salt- Chlorocarbon compounds- Molecules versus MalariaOverall, an interesting read but it is perhaps better as a reference volume for esoteric trivia questions."
217,1585422207,http://goodreads.com/user/show/66814782-dawn,4,"Overall, this book takes a chemical look at 17 molecule families and not only their uses and discoveries, but how they changed the way things were done even if people hadn't come to the place where chemical composition was detected. The writing is detailed but interesting. The writers show diagrams of the molecules they discuss, so their introduction gives a brief description of how chemical compounds are diagrammed. The title is explained right away in that the buttons which were sewn on Napoleon's army men were not made of metal (they were made of tin) which was able to retain its shape in the cold the men experienced during the Russian winter of 1812-1813. So, not only were the men attempting to fight and move resources for battle, but they were also holding their coats together because the tin had disintegrated. The authors wonder if history might have been changed if the clothing were instead accessorized with metal better able to withstand the frigid temperatures. At the back of the book, there is an index and a selected bibliography."
218,1585422207,http://goodreads.com/user/show/114641769-tayah-turocy,4,"Napoleon's Buttons was not what I expected in the best of ways. I thoroughly enjoyed reading and learning through each incredibly unique chapter. This book had the absolute best mix of history and chemistry. As a chemistry PhD student, I felt very comfortable about the way the chemistry was presented, but I still learned a lot of new information and interesting facts. I am not a big history buff; however, the topics discussed were well explained, relatable, and understandable. I have never read a book that so clearly described so many things in a single story. Although the transitions where a bit far-fetched between chapters, I did appreciate the attempt to link diverse subjects together. Further, I loved how the description of chemistry grew in complexity from chapter to chapter. If you are looking for a fun book club novel, this book would be great. The number of chapters and topics seemed overwhelming at times, but it successfully kept the readers' interests peaked with consistent switching between both chemistry and historical ideas. "
219,1585422207,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7690422-dina,5,"Awesome book. Grammatical errors don't really bother me that much when the content is as engrossing as this! I'm not an English buff either so the only reason I noticed so many errors is because the person before me apparently had a field day correcting the authors' mistakes with pencil. Anyhow this book is really cool -- anyone who loves chemistry or history or both will appreciate it. And even if you want to learn just a bit of trivia, you'll learn a lot of it from the perspective these authors bring. The title is kind of an attention-grabber because the story of Napoleon's buttons is touched on in the intro and there are other molecules that take up way more anecdotal space than that one. Some of the stories you'll recognize like the importance of spices and sugar on The Age of Discovery in Western Europe and worldwide. However, though the stories are recognizable, the focus on molecules and the scientific advances that came about are refreshing and put a new spin on these tales. "

The text is divided into 17 chapters, with each chapter allotted to individual molecules or similar groups of molecules. Not only do Le Couteur and Burreson confer natural molecules, but synthetic as well, making sure to encompass the majority of human activity. They explain how peppers, nutmegs, cloves, and more launched a wave of global explorations, beginning with the Middle Ages and ending with the European colonies. The authors reveal a multitude of tall tales from all over the world and weave them into their novel to dramatically illustrate the scientific structure of modern society. Napoleon's Buttons: How 17 Molecules Changed History is Contemplative, astounding, and effortlessly written. "

Especially with the story of Napoleon's buttons--which is used in the books introduction (which is also part of title), the thing is though none of the chapters is that grabbing.The authors do note in the intro that the history presented would be disjointed and that they will talk a out groups of molecules, I believe the help of anctual historian would have been helpful. It got bogged down by too much science talk that when history did come in I was bored, on the otherhand the opposite happened too. Most of what I learned was about molecules, the history I knew most of (because it really just seemed like general statements) with learning some new small bits. Which okay it's about science, but the reason I kept stopping and what ultimately made me stop reading was how often it seemed too nonchalant on certain subjects."

Though they tried to make allowances for that by explaining, it wasn't the same. That said, I really enjoyed this book. History, especially history of chemistry, is one of my favorite things, and it was such a treat to see a survey of world history through the lens of chemistry. It's amazing how many things were brought into being or alongside each other throughout time because of capitalism (aka greed). There were many amazing discoveries, but many lives were lost and peoples were subjugated because of it. It was very sobering and sad. "

All in all, it's pretty diverse and interesting. I've been on a sciencey book binge lately and there were things that I already knew since they were covered in other books like The Disappearing Spoon or Drug Hunters, but that's not the author's fault. Even though there was substantial overlap in their coverage of the common molecules, it was only a minor part of the book itself. I'm definitely satisfied with Napoleon's Buttons overall."

The book‚Äôs intro includes information about chemical structures so people who are not experienced with chemistry are still able to get intro he book. This is a great book because it shows how the smallest things in life can make the biggest differences. People don‚Äôt really think about how a tiny molecule could alter the course of history, and the seventeen molecules explained in the book are not the only examples. Every molecule in the natural world has a major role in preserving it and this book really sparked my interest for learning more about bio chemistry.

Overall, it's ,ore of a history of chemistry than a book about the chemistry of history- much more science than expected, and quite a lot of it is Greek if you're not at all a sciencey person.

The sections on each of the 17 minute molecules stand alone so you can read that section and when you get done if you don‚Äôt pick it up for a while that‚Äôs perfectly fine.

Some molecules, like sodium, caused wars, toppled kingdoms, and encouraged ""international trade.""

Given that everything is made of molecules, that‚Äôs sort of a given. But the book then undercuts its point by clarifying, at every turn, that history is complicated and more than any one factor or molecule has decided Napoleon‚Äôs defeat in Russia or the American independence.

242,1585422207,http://goodreads.com/user/show/98176236-sayoni,3,"Penny Le Couteur and Jay Burreson‚Äôs Napoleon‚Äôs Buttons provides readers with a view of both science and history that is often neglected. Le Couteur and Burreson weave unique details about history into the novel while simultaneously expressing the significance of the seventeen molecule groups attributed to in the title. In many cases, those molecules crucially changed the course of history. For example, the fall of the Roman Empire can be blamed on lead poisoning. Lead acetate was used to sweeten their wine. Lead containers were used to store these drinks, and water often reached homes through lead pipes. All of the above mentioned systems were mostly available to wealthy aristocrats, and eventually, symptoms of lead poisoning became prominent in leaders such as Emperor Nero, leading to the empire‚Äôs collapse. Additionally, Napoleon‚Äôs soldiers‚Äô weakness was partially due to inefficient tin buttons on their coats. The extremely frigid temperatures led the buttons to crumble, making the soldiers unable to properly contain heat. This detail is just one of the many interesting points included in the book. The importance of precision and accuracy were also explored in Napoleon‚Äôs Buttons. One chapter of the book discussed the accident involving the space shuttle, Challenger. This section explained that a mere temperature difference affected rubber seals such that its pliability was crucially altered, leading to the tragic explosion. Unusual, intriguing facts are presented in Napoleon‚Äôs Buttons, and the connections made between history and the seventeen molecules is eye-opening. The above examples are only samples from book with a vast collection of enlightening information. From tin buttons to the cause of the Salem Witch trials to hotels made of salt, the information amounts to a broader understanding of the application of not only chemistry, but science as a whole and history as well. Napoleon‚Äôs Buttons allows readers not only to learn, but more importantly, to enjoy learning.I would give this book 3 out of 5 stars, because although it included many fascinating details, at times, I was reminded of reading a textbook. The format of the book sometimes mirrors the format of a textbook, and this caused my mind to drift at times. There was so much information presented in each section of the novel that it could become difficult to digest. Also, some of the points seemed disconnected and did not always flow smoothly. For example, an inventor would be briefly mentioned, and the following sentence would not further discuss his/her accomplishments. The next page would jump to the name of a company or another scientist‚Äôs name. These details seemed to be plopped into the book and did not quite have a purpose. If the goal was to credit those individuals, then that could have been accomplished another way. I found myself distracted by those names because they did not contribute to my understanding of the information presented. When the images of the molecular structures were shown, it was difficult to connect that back to the passage, as the relation between the structure and its significance was not always made explicit. Personally, the structures did not consistently aid my understanding of the book. I expected them to be supplementary, but did not feel that was the case while reading. An abundance of facts and knowledge became slightly overwhelming. However, the book was still an enjoyable read. Having a basic understanding of chemistry helped me to appreciate it more. Napoleon‚Äôs Buttons allowed me to marvel at the possibilities of science that I had previously been oblivious to. Overall, this book led me to the realization that science truly is ubiquitous."
243,1585422207,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5396658-paulo-limp,4,"	Napoleon‚Äôs Buttons is a great example of a 'trivia book'. This is a book where you learn lots of interesting facts, but just tidbits of information. So, great to impress friends and relatives at a dinner table‚Ä¶ and that‚Äôs it.	This books mixes History and Chemistry (mostly Organic Chemistry), picking up substances precious to mankind, describing both the historical relevance associated with the ‚Äústuff‚Äù, and its chemical structure. It is advisable to have at least some basic knowledge in both disciplines to fully enjoy the book (no need for a degree, though). Its title relates to the fact that La Grand Arme√© wore uniforms with Tin buttons ‚Äì however Tin becomes breakable under very low temperatures ‚Äì Russian-style low temperatures. This could have led to the soldiers losing their coats and capes just when they needed them the most ‚Äì perhaps even being decisive to the result of the war, and the fate of Europe.	No worries ‚Äì Penny Le Couteur knows this is speculative, and should not be taken too seriously. It works to illustrate the point. The molecules described in the book were in fact, more important than tin buttons. There are both examples from old substances, like salt, olive oil, and sugar ‚Äì to more recent discoveries, like plastics, antibiotics and analgesics.	There is some pattern, though, that the reader can observe through the book. The story usually goes this way: Some substance was very valuable to man, and was hard to get. Some people got rich extracting it. Then rich countries from Europe found a way to steal the stuff, and became even richer, until some scientist was able to synthesize the molecule (usually in the 19th century), and then it became cheap and available to everyone.	Or‚Ä¶ Some scientist (again, in the 19th century) accidentally discovered a new substance, when he was trying to do a different thing. Fortunately, he realized the value of what he had invented, and the world became a better place because of it.	Yet, I learned lots of ‚Äúcool stuff‚Äù in the book, as I‚Äôve mentioned. For instance, I was shocked to learn that up until recently, chemists considered part of the ‚Äúscientific method‚Äù to actually taste the new chemicals they created (!?), recording the sensations on the tongue. I hope not too many scientists died this way ‚Äì it was surely a way to dedicate one‚Äôs life to science.	I learned how penicillin kills bacteria. I learned why vegetal oils are mostly liquid at room temperature, while animal fat is mostly solid. I learned why a meal with vegetables is called a ‚Äúsalad‚Äù. I learned how refrigerators stay cold. And many more interesting facts.	There is no ‚Äúdeep knowledge‚Äù to be obtained from this book. On the other hand, for those ‚Äúnerdy‚Äù like me, there is plenty to keep you interested ‚Äì and also to make you look smart in your friend‚Äôs eyes."
244,1585422207,http://goodreads.com/user/show/35986416-stacy,4,"Right off the bat, I was so engaged and attached to this book! It opened my eyes and I became extremely fascinated with the idea of how these tiny (unseen to the naked eye) molecules have such big roles in changing the course of history. There is a quote that really spoke out to me as soon as I opened the book:‚ÄúThe idea that momentous events may depend on something as small as a molecule---a group of two or more atoms held together in a definite arrangement---offers a novel approach to understanding the growth of human civilization. A change as small as the position of a bond---the link between atoms in a molecule---can lead to enormous differences in properties of a substance and in turn influence the course of history (pg.6).‚Äù Already, it grabbed my attention.To be honest, at first, I thought that this book was not going to be interesting because I am not a huge non-fiction fan, especially when it comes to science (science is the course that I often have difficult understanding in). However, I was proved wrong because this book is a smooth blend between history and chemistry, and it is filled with interesting factual stories to how each of these molecules were discovered and/or created. It also contained visuals and diagrams of each molecule's chemical structure when looked at microscopically (it gets down to the ""nitty-gritty"" of the structure and properties). These pictures aid my understanding in the significance of their structures and chemical elements and how it played with discussing the roles of the molecules. It discussed about the compound's bonds, protein chains, OH groups, benzene rings, and more! These differences in the visuals allowed me to pinpoint the tiny differences in the structures to see how it would change the roles of these molecules. I also enjoyed how some of the scientific terms that I unheard of were defined along in the paragraphs, which guided my understanding even more. However, I wish that some of the visuals would be pictures other than their structures or would be displayed in a different format as it can often get monotonous viewing them over and over again.This book allowed me to ponder and analyze the value of these molecules and question ""what ifs"" these molecules did not come into existence. Would our world and lifestyles be where it is right now? Or would it be in a different state? These questions were the reason why I became so intrigued and engaged by this book; it places you in a state of thinking and makes you itch to find out more about these molecules.Overall, it was a great book to read and I enjoyed my experience. I would definitely suggest this book to other readers!"
245,1585422207,http://goodreads.com/user/show/68463765-jack-sundquist,3,"In 1812, 600,000 French troops of Napoleon‚Äôs Grande Arm√©e marched towards Moscow in the hope of conquering Russia. However, frigid temperatures, disease, and lack of supplies forced the Grande Arm√©e to retreat, and only 10,000 French troops returned. What could have caused the most powerful army an Earth to collapse? One theory has to do with the buttons of the soldiers. French troops wore tin buttons to hold up their uniforms. In cold temperatures, however, tin decomposes into a fine white powder. So, Napoleon‚Äôs troops would have certainly had their buttons disintegrate. Could the lack of buttons forced French soldiers to hold up their uniforms themselves, preventing them from being able to bring as much supplies as possible, contributing their food and clothing shortages?This and other historical events are given in Napoleon‚Äôs Buttons: 17 Molecules that Changed the World by Penny Le Couteur and Jay Burreson. This nonfiction book discusses 17 important molecules, and their impact on history. Each molecules has their own chapter, which mostly follows the following structure: the molecule is introduced through a story that explains the importance of the molecule. Then, the structure of the molecule is given and the properties of the molecule is explained through this structure. Finally, the chapter ends through further explanation of the impact of the molecules and a summary of the chapter. The most interesting chapter to me was phenol, a group of molecules that was found in early antiseptic, plastics, marijuana, cotton, photographic paper, electrical insulator, billiard balls, and many more. It was also responsible for limiting the killing of elephants, development of the inexpensive Kodak camera, and widespread use of electrical energy. The fact that a single molecule group could be used in such a large variety of items is fascinating to me.I give this book four out of five stars. It is a very interesting book that explains how many unappreciated aspects of our life came to be. It combines chemistry with history to provide the reader with a very informative experience. The reason I did not give it a five is because this is not the most entertaining book. There are some times in this book that I felt the book took too long about a specific event, but the majority of the book is still interesting. I would recommend this book to anyone because it will give them a different perspective on the causes and effects of historical events. You do not need to know about chemistry, but having a knowledge of chemistry will let you appreciate this book more. "
246,1585422207,http://goodreads.com/user/show/45859662-george-goodall,3,"I have a soft spot for social histories of technology -- books that demonstrate how a particular thing came about and, more importantly, the impact that that thing has had on us. ""Napoleon's Buttons"" is certainly part of that oeuvre. My first encounter with the book was years ago in an airport book store; I didn't buy it. It did, however, get a mention in what I was reading at the time, Foucault's ""Archaeology of Knowledge"" (I was in grad school). In a bit of marginalia I scrawled: ""Guns, Germs, and Steel [Diamond]? Salt [Kurlansky]? Napoleon's Buttons? SCOT?"" Foucault's passage deserves repeating here:""From the political mobility at the surface down to the slow movements of 'material civilization', ever more levels of knowledge have been established: each has its own peculiar discontinuities and patterns; and as one descends to the deepest levels, the rhythms become broader. Beneath the rapidly changing history of governments, wars, and famines, there emerge other, apparently unmoving histories: the history of sea routes, the history of corn or of gold-mining, the history of drought and of irrigation, the history of crop rotation, the history of balance achieved by the human species between hunger and abundance.""(Yeah, it's Foucault.)""Napoleon's Buttons"" is an ""unmoving history"" of organic chemistry... mostly. There is a chapter on salt (see Kurlansky above) but it's mostly to set up a discussion on chlorine, CFCs, etc.For such a dry topic, it's actually quite a fascinating read. The history of organic chemistry is really the history of modern trade and science. The title comes from the great coats of Napoleon's army during its disastrous winter campaign in Russia. The buttons of these coats were made from a tin alloy that crumbled in cold temperatures. Without buttons, the soldiers froze, and Napoleon lost. Chemistry has its consequences.Each chapter is the story of a new substance:- Peppers, nutmeg, and cloves- Ascorbic acid- Glucose- Cellulose- Nitro compounds- Silk and Nylon- Phenol- Isoprene- Dyes- Wonder drugs- The pill- Molecules of witchcraft- Morphine, nicotine, and caffeine- Oleic acid- Salt- Chlorocarbon compounds- Molecules versus MalariaOverall, an interesting read but it is perhaps better as a reference volume for esoteric trivia questions."
247,1585422207,http://goodreads.com/user/show/66814782-dawn,4,"Overall, this book takes a chemical look at 17 molecule families and not only their uses and discoveries, but how they changed the way things were done even if people hadn't come to the place where chemical composition was detected. The writing is detailed but interesting. The writers show diagrams of the molecules they discuss, so their introduction gives a brief description of how chemical compounds are diagrammed. The title is explained right away in that the buttons which were sewn on Napoleon's army men were not made of metal (they were made of tin) which was able to retain its shape in the cold the men experienced during the Russian winter of 1812-1813. So, not only were the men attempting to fight and move resources for battle, but they were also holding their coats together because the tin had disintegrated. The authors wonder if history might have been changed if the clothing were instead accessorized with metal better able to withstand the frigid temperatures. At the back of the book, there is an index and a selected bibliography."
248,1585422207,http://goodreads.com/user/show/114641769-tayah-turocy,4,"Napoleon's Buttons was not what I expected in the best of ways. I thoroughly enjoyed reading and learning through each incredibly unique chapter. This book had the absolute best mix of history and chemistry. As a chemistry PhD student, I felt very comfortable about the way the chemistry was presented, but I still learned a lot of new information and interesting facts. I am not a big history buff; however, the topics discussed were well explained, relatable, and understandable. I have never read a book that so clearly described so many things in a single story. Although the transitions where a bit far-fetched between chapters, I did appreciate the attempt to link diverse subjects together. Further, I loved how the description of chemistry grew in complexity from chapter to chapter. If you are looking for a fun book club novel, this book would be great. The number of chapters and topics seemed overwhelming at times, but it successfully kept the readers' interests peaked with consistent switching between both chemistry and historical ideas. "
249,1585422207,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7690422-dina,5,"Awesome book. Grammatical errors don't really bother me that much when the content is as engrossing as this! I'm not an English buff either so the only reason I noticed so many errors is because the person before me apparently had a field day correcting the authors' mistakes with pencil. Anyhow this book is really cool -- anyone who loves chemistry or history or both will appreciate it. And even if you want to learn just a bit of trivia, you'll learn a lot of it from the perspective these authors bring. The title is kind of an attention-grabber because the story of Napoleon's buttons is touched on in the intro and there are other molecules that take up way more anecdotal space than that one. Some of the stories you'll recognize like the importance of spices and sugar on The Age of Discovery in Western Europe and worldwide. However, though the stories are recognizable, the focus on molecules and the scientific advances that came about are refreshing and put a new spin on these tales. "

The text is divided into 17 chapters, with each chapter allotted to individual molecules or similar groups of molecules. Not only do Le Couteur and Burreson confer natural molecules, but synthetic as well, making sure to encompass the majority of human activity. They explain how peppers, nutmegs, cloves, and more launched a wave of global explorations, beginning with the Middle Ages and ending with the European colonies. The authors reveal a multitude of tall tales from all over the world and weave them into their novel to dramatically illustrate the scientific structure of modern society. Napoleon's Buttons: How 17 Molecules Changed History is Contemplative, astounding, and effortlessly written. "

Especially with the story of Napoleon's buttons--which is used in the books introduction (which is also part of title), the thing is though none of the chapters is that grabbing.The authors do note in the intro that the history presented would be disjointed and that they will talk a out groups of molecules, I believe the help of anctual historian would have been helpful. It got bogged down by too much science talk that when history did come in I was bored, on the otherhand the opposite happened too. Most of what I learned was about molecules, the history I knew most of (because it really just seemed like general statements) with learning some new small bits. Which okay it's about science, but the reason I kept stopping and what ultimately made me stop reading was how often it seemed too nonchalant on certain subjects."

Though they tried to make allowances for that by explaining, it wasn't the same. That said, I really enjoyed this book. History, especially history of chemistry, is one of my favorite things, and it was such a treat to see a survey of world history through the lens of chemistry. It's amazing how many things were brought into being or alongside each other throughout time because of capitalism (aka greed). There were many amazing discoveries, but many lives were lost and peoples were subjugated because of it. It was very sobering and sad. "

All in all, it's pretty diverse and interesting. I've been on a sciencey book binge lately and there were things that I already knew since they were covered in other books like The Disappearing Spoon or Drug Hunters, but that's not the author's fault. Even though there was substantial overlap in their coverage of the common molecules, it was only a minor part of the book itself. I'm definitely satisfied with Napoleon's Buttons overall."

Overall, it's ,ore of a history of chemistry than a book about the chemistry of history- much more science than expected, and quite a lot of it is Greek if you're not at all a sciencey person.

The sections on each of the 17 minute molecules stand alone so you can read that section and when you get done if you don‚Äôt pick it up for a while that‚Äôs perfectly fine.

Some molecules, like sodium, caused wars, toppled kingdoms, and encouraged ""international trade.""

Given that everything is made of molecules, that‚Äôs sort of a given. But the book then undercuts its point by clarifying, at every turn, that history is complicated and more than any one factor or molecule has decided Napoleon‚Äôs defeat in Russia or the American independence.

271,1585422207,http://goodreads.com/user/show/11281158-kathy,4,"Fascinating, fabulous read. Be prepared for the challenge of chemistry blended with history of molecules that will stretch your mind and engage you in a way that is entirely unique!"
272,1585422207,http://goodreads.com/user/show/98176236-sayoni,3,"Penny Le Couteur and Jay Burreson‚Äôs Napoleon‚Äôs Buttons provides readers with a view of both science and history that is often neglected. Le Couteur and Burreson weave unique details about history into the novel while simultaneously expressing the significance of the seventeen molecule groups attributed to in the title. In many cases, those molecules crucially changed the course of history. For example, the fall of the Roman Empire can be blamed on lead poisoning. Lead acetate was used to sweeten their wine. Lead containers were used to store these drinks, and water often reached homes through lead pipes. All of the above mentioned systems were mostly available to wealthy aristocrats, and eventually, symptoms of lead poisoning became prominent in leaders such as Emperor Nero, leading to the empire‚Äôs collapse. Additionally, Napoleon‚Äôs soldiers‚Äô weakness was partially due to inefficient tin buttons on their coats. The extremely frigid temperatures led the buttons to crumble, making the soldiers unable to properly contain heat. This detail is just one of the many interesting points included in the book. The importance of precision and accuracy were also explored in Napoleon‚Äôs Buttons. One chapter of the book discussed the accident involving the space shuttle, Challenger. This section explained that a mere temperature difference affected rubber seals such that its pliability was crucially altered, leading to the tragic explosion. Unusual, intriguing facts are presented in Napoleon‚Äôs Buttons, and the connections made between history and the seventeen molecules is eye-opening. The above examples are only samples from book with a vast collection of enlightening information. From tin buttons to the cause of the Salem Witch trials to hotels made of salt, the information amounts to a broader understanding of the application of not only chemistry, but science as a whole and history as well. Napoleon‚Äôs Buttons allows readers not only to learn, but more importantly, to enjoy learning.I would give this book 3 out of 5 stars, because although it included many fascinating details, at times, I was reminded of reading a textbook. The format of the book sometimes mirrors the format of a textbook, and this caused my mind to drift at times. There was so much information presented in each section of the novel that it could become difficult to digest. Also, some of the points seemed disconnected and did not always flow smoothly. For example, an inventor would be briefly mentioned, and the following sentence would not further discuss his/her accomplishments. The next page would jump to the name of a company or another scientist‚Äôs name. These details seemed to be plopped into the book and did not quite have a purpose. If the goal was to credit those individuals, then that could have been accomplished another way. I found myself distracted by those names because they did not contribute to my understanding of the information presented. When the images of the molecular structures were shown, it was difficult to connect that back to the passage, as the relation between the structure and its significance was not always made explicit. Personally, the structures did not consistently aid my understanding of the book. I expected them to be supplementary, but did not feel that was the case while reading. An abundance of facts and knowledge became slightly overwhelming. However, the book was still an enjoyable read. Having a basic understanding of chemistry helped me to appreciate it more. Napoleon‚Äôs Buttons allowed me to marvel at the possibilities of science that I had previously been oblivious to. Overall, this book led me to the realization that science truly is ubiquitous."
273,1585422207,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5396658-paulo-limp,4,"	Napoleon‚Äôs Buttons is a great example of a 'trivia book'. This is a book where you learn lots of interesting facts, but just tidbits of information. So, great to impress friends and relatives at a dinner table‚Ä¶ and that‚Äôs it.	This books mixes History and Chemistry (mostly Organic Chemistry), picking up substances precious to mankind, describing both the historical relevance associated with the ‚Äústuff‚Äù, and its chemical structure. It is advisable to have at least some basic knowledge in both disciplines to fully enjoy the book (no need for a degree, though). Its title relates to the fact that La Grand Arme√© wore uniforms with Tin buttons ‚Äì however Tin becomes breakable under very low temperatures ‚Äì Russian-style low temperatures. This could have led to the soldiers losing their coats and capes just when they needed them the most ‚Äì perhaps even being decisive to the result of the war, and the fate of Europe.	No worries ‚Äì Penny Le Couteur knows this is speculative, and should not be taken too seriously. It works to illustrate the point. The molecules described in the book were in fact, more important than tin buttons. There are both examples from old substances, like salt, olive oil, and sugar ‚Äì to more recent discoveries, like plastics, antibiotics and analgesics.	There is some pattern, though, that the reader can observe through the book. The story usually goes this way: Some substance was very valuable to man, and was hard to get. Some people got rich extracting it. Then rich countries from Europe found a way to steal the stuff, and became even richer, until some scientist was able to synthesize the molecule (usually in the 19th century), and then it became cheap and available to everyone.	Or‚Ä¶ Some scientist (again, in the 19th century) accidentally discovered a new substance, when he was trying to do a different thing. Fortunately, he realized the value of what he had invented, and the world became a better place because of it.	Yet, I learned lots of ‚Äúcool stuff‚Äù in the book, as I‚Äôve mentioned. For instance, I was shocked to learn that up until recently, chemists considered part of the ‚Äúscientific method‚Äù to actually taste the new chemicals they created (!?), recording the sensations on the tongue. I hope not too many scientists died this way ‚Äì it was surely a way to dedicate one‚Äôs life to science.	I learned how penicillin kills bacteria. I learned why vegetal oils are mostly liquid at room temperature, while animal fat is mostly solid. I learned why a meal with vegetables is called a ‚Äúsalad‚Äù. I learned how refrigerators stay cold. And many more interesting facts.	There is no ‚Äúdeep knowledge‚Äù to be obtained from this book. On the other hand, for those ‚Äúnerdy‚Äù like me, there is plenty to keep you interested ‚Äì and also to make you look smart in your friend‚Äôs eyes."
274,1585422207,http://goodreads.com/user/show/35986416-stacy,4,"Right off the bat, I was so engaged and attached to this book! It opened my eyes and I became extremely fascinated with the idea of how these tiny (unseen to the naked eye) molecules have such big roles in changing the course of history. There is a quote that really spoke out to me as soon as I opened the book:‚ÄúThe idea that momentous events may depend on something as small as a molecule---a group of two or more atoms held together in a definite arrangement---offers a novel approach to understanding the growth of human civilization. A change as small as the position of a bond---the link between atoms in a molecule---can lead to enormous differences in properties of a substance and in turn influence the course of history (pg.6).‚Äù Already, it grabbed my attention.To be honest, at first, I thought that this book was not going to be interesting because I am not a huge non-fiction fan, especially when it comes to science (science is the course that I often have difficult understanding in). However, I was proved wrong because this book is a smooth blend between history and chemistry, and it is filled with interesting factual stories to how each of these molecules were discovered and/or created. It also contained visuals and diagrams of each molecule's chemical structure when looked at microscopically (it gets down to the ""nitty-gritty"" of the structure and properties). These pictures aid my understanding in the significance of their structures and chemical elements and how it played with discussing the roles of the molecules. It discussed about the compound's bonds, protein chains, OH groups, benzene rings, and more! These differences in the visuals allowed me to pinpoint the tiny differences in the structures to see how it would change the roles of these molecules. I also enjoyed how some of the scientific terms that I unheard of were defined along in the paragraphs, which guided my understanding even more. However, I wish that some of the visuals would be pictures other than their structures or would be displayed in a different format as it can often get monotonous viewing them over and over again.This book allowed me to ponder and analyze the value of these molecules and question ""what ifs"" these molecules did not come into existence. Would our world and lifestyles be where it is right now? Or would it be in a different state? These questions were the reason why I became so intrigued and engaged by this book; it places you in a state of thinking and makes you itch to find out more about these molecules.Overall, it was a great book to read and I enjoyed my experience. I would definitely suggest this book to other readers!"
275,1585422207,http://goodreads.com/user/show/68463765-jack-sundquist,3,"In 1812, 600,000 French troops of Napoleon‚Äôs Grande Arm√©e marched towards Moscow in the hope of conquering Russia. However, frigid temperatures, disease, and lack of supplies forced the Grande Arm√©e to retreat, and only 10,000 French troops returned. What could have caused the most powerful army an Earth to collapse? One theory has to do with the buttons of the soldiers. French troops wore tin buttons to hold up their uniforms. In cold temperatures, however, tin decomposes into a fine white powder. So, Napoleon‚Äôs troops would have certainly had their buttons disintegrate. Could the lack of buttons forced French soldiers to hold up their uniforms themselves, preventing them from being able to bring as much supplies as possible, contributing their food and clothing shortages?This and other historical events are given in Napoleon‚Äôs Buttons: 17 Molecules that Changed the World by Penny Le Couteur and Jay Burreson. This nonfiction book discusses 17 important molecules, and their impact on history. Each molecules has their own chapter, which mostly follows the following structure: the molecule is introduced through a story that explains the importance of the molecule. Then, the structure of the molecule is given and the properties of the molecule is explained through this structure. Finally, the chapter ends through further explanation of the impact of the molecules and a summary of the chapter. The most interesting chapter to me was phenol, a group of molecules that was found in early antiseptic, plastics, marijuana, cotton, photographic paper, electrical insulator, billiard balls, and many more. It was also responsible for limiting the killing of elephants, development of the inexpensive Kodak camera, and widespread use of electrical energy. The fact that a single molecule group could be used in such a large variety of items is fascinating to me.I give this book four out of five stars. It is a very interesting book that explains how many unappreciated aspects of our life came to be. It combines chemistry with history to provide the reader with a very informative experience. The reason I did not give it a five is because this is not the most entertaining book. There are some times in this book that I felt the book took too long about a specific event, but the majority of the book is still interesting. I would recommend this book to anyone because it will give them a different perspective on the causes and effects of historical events. You do not need to know about chemistry, but having a knowledge of chemistry will let you appreciate this book more. "
276,1585422207,http://goodreads.com/user/show/45859662-george-goodall,3,"I have a soft spot for social histories of technology -- books that demonstrate how a particular thing came about and, more importantly, the impact that that thing has had on us. ""Napoleon's Buttons"" is certainly part of that oeuvre. My first encounter with the book was years ago in an airport book store; I didn't buy it. It did, however, get a mention in what I was reading at the time, Foucault's ""Archaeology of Knowledge"" (I was in grad school). In a bit of marginalia I scrawled: ""Guns, Germs, and Steel [Diamond]? Salt [Kurlansky]? Napoleon's Buttons? SCOT?"" Foucault's passage deserves repeating here:""From the political mobility at the surface down to the slow movements of 'material civilization', ever more levels of knowledge have been established: each has its own peculiar discontinuities and patterns; and as one descends to the deepest levels, the rhythms become broader. Beneath the rapidly changing history of governments, wars, and famines, there emerge other, apparently unmoving histories: the history of sea routes, the history of corn or of gold-mining, the history of drought and of irrigation, the history of crop rotation, the history of balance achieved by the human species between hunger and abundance.""(Yeah, it's Foucault.)""Napoleon's Buttons"" is an ""unmoving history"" of organic chemistry... mostly. There is a chapter on salt (see Kurlansky above) but it's mostly to set up a discussion on chlorine, CFCs, etc.For such a dry topic, it's actually quite a fascinating read. The history of organic chemistry is really the history of modern trade and science. The title comes from the great coats of Napoleon's army during its disastrous winter campaign in Russia. The buttons of these coats were made from a tin alloy that crumbled in cold temperatures. Without buttons, the soldiers froze, and Napoleon lost. Chemistry has its consequences.Each chapter is the story of a new substance:- Peppers, nutmeg, and cloves- Ascorbic acid- Glucose- Cellulose- Nitro compounds- Silk and Nylon- Phenol- Isoprene- Dyes- Wonder drugs- The pill- Molecules of witchcraft- Morphine, nicotine, and caffeine- Oleic acid- Salt- Chlorocarbon compounds- Molecules versus MalariaOverall, an interesting read but it is perhaps better as a reference volume for esoteric trivia questions."
277,1585422207,http://goodreads.com/user/show/66814782-dawn,4,"Overall, this book takes a chemical look at 17 molecule families and not only their uses and discoveries, but how they changed the way things were done even if people hadn't come to the place where chemical composition was detected. The writing is detailed but interesting. The writers show diagrams of the molecules they discuss, so their introduction gives a brief description of how chemical compounds are diagrammed. The title is explained right away in that the buttons which were sewn on Napoleon's army men were not made of metal (they were made of tin) which was able to retain its shape in the cold the men experienced during the Russian winter of 1812-1813. So, not only were the men attempting to fight and move resources for battle, but they were also holding their coats together because the tin had disintegrated. The authors wonder if history might have been changed if the clothing were instead accessorized with metal better able to withstand the frigid temperatures. At the back of the book, there is an index and a selected bibliography."
278,1585422207,http://goodreads.com/user/show/114641769-tayah-turocy,4,"Napoleon's Buttons was not what I expected in the best of ways. I thoroughly enjoyed reading and learning through each incredibly unique chapter. This book had the absolute best mix of history and chemistry. As a chemistry PhD student, I felt very comfortable about the way the chemistry was presented, but I still learned a lot of new information and interesting facts. I am not a big history buff; however, the topics discussed were well explained, relatable, and understandable. I have never read a book that so clearly described so many things in a single story. Although the transitions where a bit far-fetched between chapters, I did appreciate the attempt to link diverse subjects together. Further, I loved how the description of chemistry grew in complexity from chapter to chapter. If you are looking for a fun book club novel, this book would be great. The number of chapters and topics seemed overwhelming at times, but it successfully kept the readers' interests peaked with consistent switching between both chemistry and historical ideas. "
279,1585422207,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7690422-dina,5,"Awesome book. Grammatical errors don't really bother me that much when the content is as engrossing as this! I'm not an English buff either so the only reason I noticed so many errors is because the person before me apparently had a field day correcting the authors' mistakes with pencil. Anyhow this book is really cool -- anyone who loves chemistry or history or both will appreciate it. And even if you want to learn just a bit of trivia, you'll learn a lot of it from the perspective these authors bring. The title is kind of an attention-grabber because the story of Napoleon's buttons is touched on in the intro and there are other molecules that take up way more anecdotal space than that one. Some of the stories you'll recognize like the importance of spices and sugar on The Age of Discovery in Western Europe and worldwide. However, though the stories are recognizable, the focus on molecules and the scientific advances that came about are refreshing and put a new spin on these tales. "

The text is divided into 17 chapters, with each chapter allotted to individual molecules or similar groups of molecules. Not only do Le Couteur and Burreson confer natural molecules, but synthetic as well, making sure to encompass the majority of human activity. They explain how peppers, nutmegs, cloves, and more launched a wave of global explorations, beginning with the Middle Ages and ending with the European colonies. The authors reveal a multitude of tall tales from all over the world and weave them into their novel to dramatically illustrate the scientific structure of modern society. Napoleon's Buttons: How 17 Molecules Changed History is Contemplative, astounding, and effortlessly written. "

Especially with the story of Napoleon's buttons--which is used in the books introduction (which is also part of title), the thing is though none of the chapters is that grabbing.The authors do note in the intro that the history presented would be disjointed and that they will talk a out groups of molecules, I believe the help of anctual historian would have been helpful. It got bogged down by too much science talk that when history did come in I was bored, on the otherhand the opposite happened too. Most of what I learned was about molecules, the history I knew most of (because it really just seemed like general statements) with learning some new small bits. Which okay it's about science, but the reason I kept stopping and what ultimately made me stop reading was how often it seemed too nonchalant on certain subjects."

Though they tried to make allowances for that by explaining, it wasn't the same. That said, I really enjoyed this book. History, especially history of chemistry, is one of my favorite things, and it was such a treat to see a survey of world history through the lens of chemistry. It's amazing how many things were brought into being or alongside each other throughout time because of capitalism (aka greed). There were many amazing discoveries, but many lives were lost and peoples were subjugated because of it. It was very sobering and sad. "

All in all, it's pretty diverse and interesting. I've been on a sciencey book binge lately and there were things that I already knew since they were covered in other books like The Disappearing Spoon or Drug Hunters, but that's not the author's fault. Even though there was substantial overlap in their coverage of the common molecules, it was only a minor part of the book itself. I'm definitely satisfied with Napoleon's Buttons overall."

The book‚Äôs intro includes information about chemical structures so people who are not experienced with chemistry are still able to get intro he book. This is a great book because it shows how the smallest things in life can make the biggest differences. People don‚Äôt really think about how a tiny molecule could alter the course of history, and the seventeen molecules explained in the book are not the only examples. Every molecule in the natural world has a major role in preserving it and this book really sparked my interest for learning more about bio chemistry.

I learned so much from this book, for example, the piperine molecule gives pepper its ‚Äúspicy‚Äù taste because of the shape of the molecule stimulates the nerve receptors to register pain. And that the British obtained New Amsterdam from the Dutch by going to war over nutmeg, which was thought to ward of the black plague! Fascinating information.

In practice, the combination is a bit hit-and-miss. It leans towards more of the latter, but it makes a good effort. Overall, it's ,ore of a history of chemistry than a book about the chemistry of history- much more science than expected, and quite a lot of it is Greek if you're not at all a sciencey person.

I just kept wanting to get to the more interesting history tidbits, so I ended up skipping chunks of the book to find stuff that appealed to me. To me, this was a three star read at best.

There is enough of a introduction to the basics that one can read the book without being overwhelmed by technical details, but can still appreciate the tiny molecular differences that make some of the stories so fascinating. The book gave my world view a nice kick in the teeth. There is so much that we take for granted, not realizing the hardship and battles that had to happen just for us to have what we do.

This is not the kind of book that you stay up late reading or you have to get to the end but it‚Äôs a great in your car book if that makes sense. The sections on each of the 17 minute molecules stand alone so you can read that section and when you get done if you don‚Äôt pick it up for a while that‚Äôs perfectly fine.

A book that talks about an area, in this case chemistry, in a way that is understandable and fascinating. The author devotes a chapter to each of 17 molecules and discusses their discovery and the cascading impact of the molecules as scientists in the past tried to determine their usefulness. Some molecules, like sodium, caused wars, toppled kingdoms, and encouraged ""international trade."" I found each chapter interesting and plan to read this book again because there were too many interesting facts to process in a single reading--at least for my aging brain.

Given that everything is made of molecules, that‚Äôs sort of a given. But the book then undercuts its point by clarifying, at every turn, that history is complicated and more than any one factor or molecule has decided Napoleon‚Äôs defeat in Russia or the American independence.
