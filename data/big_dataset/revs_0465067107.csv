It amazed me that we, because of perfect product design, intuitively know how to use products and how quickly we learn when extra functions are added due to the evolution of tech. I hardly say that something changed my view of the world, but just as after enlightenment to mindful product praising, I tend to look at any design under this aspect now.That usability and a more subtle way of manipulation by combining body and soul, hand and eye, joy and practicability, have long been ignored in just advertising and marketing products with quite simple jingles and without fusing the message, meaning and the look to ultimate seductiveness is stunning. To perfect how first our allegedly free, conscious minds can be mesmerized to buy a product that is so perfect, handy and good looking at the same time. Why can´t they start designing humans like that?Reverse engineering why something seems so appealing is interesting for self-reflection, to find out what aspect of one's personality made one so vulnerable for exactly this product and how they could get so deep inside one's mind.It will be interesting to see what Big Data and AI will make out of the field, I could easily imagine an individualization down to one single customer and her/his special wishes. Too far fetched? Until now, just simple market research, psychology, ergonomics, etc., made a pretty astonishing shopping experience possible and the key element was to know the wishes of all groups of customers. Now, with the collection of soon billions of profiles given in the fictional hands of an AI with 3D printing, nanotech, etc., everyone will be able to lose her/himself in the ultimate, senseless consumerism. But at least a unique one.A wiki walk can be as refreshing to the mind as a walk through nature in this completely overrated real life outside books: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Industr...https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Usabili...https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Market_...https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cogniti..."
1,0465067107,http://goodreads.com/user/show/894092-david,5,"After reading this you will never look at any man-made object the same. You will question everything from doors to tea kettles to the most sophisticated computer program. The next time you fumble with an answering machine, web page, or light switch you will think back to the lessons from this book. It is almost liberating once you can see beyond the design of everyday things.I highly recommend this book for anyone. You absolutely must read it if you will ever be in a position to create something (i.e. software, a chair, a cardboard box). If you don't, I will curse your name every time I am forced to use your product!"
2,0465067107,http://goodreads.com/user/show/12949493-philip-mcallister,2,"For a book that a lot of people rave about as being a 'bible of usability', I have to say it was one of the worst written and designed books I have ever been unfortunate enough to read."
3,0465067107,http://goodreads.com/user/show/37677140-jessica,1,"Too general to be valuable. Too many sentences like this: ""Each discipline has a different perspective of the relative importance of the many factors that make up a product."""
4,0465067107,http://goodreads.com/user/show/695116-jim,5,"This took me FOREVER to read - but it isn't the book's fault. It was me just picking it up at odd moments & it giving me a lot to think about each time. I don't design every day things, so had absolutely no need to read this book, but found it extremely interesting.  If you have any part in designing anything, you MUST read this book. Norman points out the obvious - things I took for granted - & made me think about them in an entirely new light. He breaks down the simplest devices into their basic functions & features, then rebuilds them in a way that is both obvious & yet entirely new. He then points out places where the design elements are good & bad. He gets into the basic aspects of design that I never thought about such as aligning the number of controls with the number of functions. Best of all, he lays all of this out in an interesting manner with common examples as he delves deeper into the problems & solutions.When you walk up to a door, how do you know how to deal with it? I never thought about it, just used it. Norman points out the clues I use, such as where the handles & hinges are located, as well as the conventions, such as pushing to go out of a commercial door, that I just KNOW & intuitively use. But what happens when designers fiddle around to make look pretty? Can anyone screw up something as mundane & venerable as a door? Unfortunately, yes indeedy!He relates a funny story about getting stuck briefly in the foyer of a commercial building because of the 'modern' design of the doors. Hidden hinges, lots of glass, & handles that stretched across the entire center of the door gave no clue as to which way they opened. Couple that with one set of doors opening in the opposite direction from the others & a simple task - walking into a building without much thought (actually while thinking of other things, like the upcoming meeting) - became an irritating puzzle. Not a big deal? Actually, it is.Norman pulls out some truly horrific numbers to make a great point on how important intuitive design is. The average person has something like 30,000 different instruction sets to remember on a regular basis. If each one of these took just a minute to remember, you'd spend several months learning them, assuming a 40 hour week devoted to the task! That we've absorbed these instructions & conventions over decades & are facing an increasing number of them on a daily basis makes it particularly irritating when they get redesigned into a problem. Note: This book was published in the late 80's. While there are some desktop computing examples given, this book is pre-Internet. Think of how much additional information is required in the wake of that. (Think browsers, email, scams, viruses, ....) While some of the examples are a bit dated, such as VCR's, they're not terrible. The multifunctional switches, confusing menus, & seemingly random options packed into those machines have carried over into their descendents in spades. Other examples, such as phone systems & stoves, are still so on target that it's absolutely infuriating. OK, phone systems are complicated, extremely proprietary & full of more options than ever, but do they HAVE to be so hard to use? I don't think so. I know damn well that designers could do a much better job of laying out the controls for something as simple as a stove. They've had over a century & it's still a complete PITA to figure out which knob operates which burner. I can't walk up to any stove & put my hand on the correct knob. I have to read, sometimes even puzzle out symbols to figure out which is which. Even on my own simple stove, which we've had 5 years, I wind up reading to figure out the controls. OK, Marg usually cooks, but that's just STUPID design - one more minor irritation in a world filled with them, but one that could so easily be rectified with just a bit of thought!!! It's just infuriating. While I was reading this book, a couple of examples of its relevance slapped me in the face. - Steve Jobs died. Why was he so successful? Many people say that he was an inventor. WRONG. He rarely came up with anything truly new. His forte was in timing & design. Microsoft had a tablet for years before the iPad but their offering never made it. Why? Because the hardware couldn't support the overall expected functionality properly AND the user interface wasn't nearly as well designed as the iPad. Microsoft tried too early, designed it poorly, & FAILED themselves right out of the market.- Amazon took the ebook market by storm. The Kindle wasn't the first ereader & it isn't really all that great hardware-wise, but it has a great interface that leverages a wonderful support system - all good design. It does one thing & does it really well.Long review, but design is one of the most misunderstood & important concepts of our lives. I was completely shocked by my own ignorance about it. I still don't claim to be any expert, but it sure made me see the world in a different way.Update 13May2019 Here's a new article by Norman. ""I wrote the book on user-friendly design. What I see today horrifies me"" with a subtitle: The world is designed against the elderly, writes Don Norman, 83-year-old author of the industry bible Design of Everyday Things and a former Apple VP. https://www.fastcompany.com/90338379/...It's a fact. I'm now in my 60s & he's right. We're a large segment of the population that isn't cool, but we have the money & time. Design for us!Update 14May2020 I listened to the audio version of a slightly later edition. Fantastic & I found it much easier. Was that because it was my second read or the media? I think a combination. If you've ever had trouble because it was too dense, maybe try the audio. That gives me the entire concept & I can come back to puzzle out any details in text. Anyway, I gave the audio version a 5 star review here:https://www.goodreads.com/review/show..."
5,0465067107,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1499157-rod-hilton,4,"Whenever programmers ask other programmers for book suggestions, there's always some smartass that says something like ""The Art of War"" because of blah blah blah about corporate politics. Hoo boy you're clever, you suggested a non-programming book, way to not play by the rules. You really march to the beat of your own drum there, slick.Similarly, I constantly see ""The Design of Everyday Things"" suggested in these kinds of conversations. I think it's supposed to give engineers great insights into design and how humans interact with objects around them. This is supposed to change our outlook for the software we build for people.Well, I don't think it did that at all. Really, the only thing to take away in that regard is ""think about how people use your software"". In other words, I think a great many UX-centered books are vastly superior in this regard.That's not to say this book is bad. In fact, I imagine there are people reading my review right now thinking ""who gives a shit that this guy is a software engineer?"" Indeed, this book is great. Very enjoyable, and very informative. It made me think about every day objects I've never even given a second thought to. There's an entire section on sink faucets that blew my mind. But ultimately, the book is really about exactly what the title says it is, the design of everyday things and objects. There's some hinting at a greater, broader meaning than this, but it never comes to much.Definitely a great read, worth it for sure, but don't buy into the ""everyone who makes software should read this book"" hype."
6,0465067107,http://goodreads.com/user/show/225325-jessica,0,"Couldn't get in to it. Maybe I'll try again at a different time. On a side note, I found it odd that a book about user-centered design had line-broken right-justified headings and baffling use of italics."
7,0465067107,http://goodreads.com/user/show/166376-david,5,"Have you ever stood in front of a door, or a microwave, absolutely flummoxed, because the damned thing gave you no clue whatsoever how to open it. If so (even, I venture to think, if not), you will enjoy this book. In clear, coruscating prose he exposes the miserable flaws in the design of everyday objects which conspire to make our lives less convenient, more miserable, and sometimes more dangerous.The book is not just an exposé of the appalling laziness and hostility to consumers that is commonplace among designers(not just in the software industry, which is a story unto itself - see ""The Lunatics are Running the Asylum"") - it is also a clarion call to action. We need not live in a world where it appears that appliances conspire to make us feel like idiots. And when they do - when you can't figure out which button to push, or whether a door opens inward or outward - remember that you are not the one at fault. It is the lazy incompetent designer of the thing which is making you miserable who is deserving of scorn and ridicule. Far too often, in a design world which favors form over function and usability, crimes against the user get rewarded with prizes and the acclaim of the design cognoscenti. People who presumably never have to struggle with the consequences of their own reckless disregard for the usability of the objects they design. This book is an outraged and eloquent call for change."
8,0465067107,http://goodreads.com/user/show/655723-nick-black,2,"Jeff Garzik gave me a copy of this back when he was building the Linux network stack in Home Park; I'd seen it praised by a few other people by that time as well (via the GT newsgroups, most likely). I was underwhelmed -- there were a few good case analyses (the oven UI I recall being particularly effective), but very little usable, general principles came out of the read. I went back in 2006, thinking I'd perhaps missed something, but didn't find much more. then again, i'm probably not the target audience. this book seems to receive much play in computer science programs, but it's really much more of an industrial design text; its prevalence in CS programs evidences IMHO the sad state of HCI textbooks.I'm still eagerly waiting for a single textbook which unifies theory and practice of effective, attractive UI design. Instead, we seem to have the ""GUI metrics"" crowd, fetishists assuming the existence of some spiritus mundi, just waiting for the right Gaussian to be fitted (thus giving rise to twin abominations, MacOSX and GNOME3); meanwhile the ""design"" crown speaks in riddles, playing a game where men throw ducks at baloons, and nothing is as it seems...but this is why, I suppose, I only write backends and libraries."
9,0465067107,http://goodreads.com/user/show/20465079-tam,3,"This book is more for knowledge than for enjoyment. The writing is rather dry and textbook-like with many abstract/theoretical concepts and ideas. I feel like taking a short course in design, which is still quite helpful. Nevertheless, I was expecting more of ""smart"" designs, more fun and strange and inspiring stories, but Norman isn't there to entertain but to educate and so there are examples mostly to illustrate concepts and processes. Naturally I was a bit disappointed, but still in general a book is a good read."
10,0465067107,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3145526-traveller,5,"Excellent piece of non-fiction. This book is a prescribed textbook for a course on computer interface design that I'm doing. Once I really started reading it, I almost couldn't put it down - it was so interesting that it almost read like fiction - none of the dry dust usually found in conventional textbooks. Very well and humorously presented, and a must for engineers, designers, manufacturers and inventors everywhere!"
11,0465067107,http://goodreads.com/user/show/20434984-david-bjelland,4,"BLUF: A good-to-great primer on human-centered design, albeit one that's lighter on examples and political introspection than I'd hoped for. Longer take:I'll admit: since first hearing about ""Norman doors"" in college and then seeing the hilarious ""second degree burn kettle"" on the cover, I'd built up the idea in my head of this book being some sort of righteous crusade against poorly-designed objects. I looked forward to hours of chuckling along as he gave instances of abominably unusable products, starting from the accidental and working his way towards the truly negligent or coercive, skewering each for our edification; by explaining the shortcomings of each example and walking through the process of improving it (if possible), the reader would come to a bottom-up understanding of the principles of HCD. Fortunately, there are plenty of click-baity listicles to get my design schadenfreude fix, because this is definitely not that book.First of all, Norman is only incidentally concerned with ""objects"" per se - the first chapter or two uses a fair number of them to ground the ideas of mappings and physical constraints, but the book as a whole is mostly concerned with the more intangible disciplines of user interface and process design. This actual makes for a more mind-expanding book, as the reader discovers the underlying analogy between the building blocks of physical and non-physical forms of design. Secondly, contrary to the polemic I was expecting, Norman's voice is actually pretty neutral and empathetic throughout. Rather than casting blame, he investigates failures of design as a whole the same way he's investigated actual accidents: by seeking root causes in broken feedback loops and failures to account for human nature. Despite a writing style that I'd call bland and curt (I think in the interest of sound neutral and accessible?), I blew through the first five chapters - solid material with exciting implications! However, DOET started to drag for me in the last two chapters (""Design Thinking"" and ""Design in the World of Business""), which felt less like popular non-fiction and more like a corporate self-help manual. Maybe it's just a problem of audience? The practical workplace material is probably interesting for current-or-aspiring designers themselves, but IMHO, it has far less to offer the casual reader. Worse, it brought to the foreground some ethical issues that the book had until then steered clear of, but without providing any satisfactory answers for. As far as I can tell, DOET would like its readers to think that its central principles are apolitical: the reader is encouraged to pursue designs that are usable for a wide variety of users based on their size, ability level, and culture, but this is still viewed through the functional lens of creating the most effective products. What does ""effective"" mean though? I don't want to assume the worst in the author, but the text itself does little to contradict the idea that ""effectiveness"" is no more and no less than a means towards profitability. Case in point: it wasn't until Norman briefly touched on (and conspicuously failed to condemn) the strategy of planned obsolescence that it occurred to me just how limited in scope his idea of ""human""-centered design really is.Wouldn't a design philosophy that holistically factored in human needs and psychology favor durable, recyclable products with replaceable components rather than products we're forced to discard every year or two, polluting our environment for generations? Wouldn't a human-centered design philosophy content itself with products that served actual human needs, rather than preying on our insecurities to create new ones?It's interesting to me that Norman used to be an executive at Apple, a company infamous for perfecting the art of planned obsolescence - does he fail to condemn the practice here because he doesn't want to burn any bridges, or because he and Apple are actually in alignment and he sees nothing wrong with it? I'd guess it's not too hard to find out where he stands if you really wanted to know, but within the scope of this book, his failure to take a stance on any political question related to design presents the reader with an unsavory question:Are ""humans"" supposed to be the ultimate beneficiaries of Norman's ""human-centered design"", or are we just a demographic to be focus-grouped as a means of maximizing market penetration?The Design of Everyday Things leaves it to other books to answer that question, apparently."
12,0465067107,http://goodreads.com/user/show/9777942-joe,3,"The Design of Everyday Things (DOET) is the story of doors, faucets and keyboards; it's the tale of rangetops and refrigerators. Donald Norman beckons the reader to look at the common objects they deal with every day in new and methodical ways. And he offers this central question; what makes an object well-designed as opposed to poorly-designed? But on the question of design DOET, itself an everyday object, rates poorly. Norman's discussion of individual items proves inconsistent and rarely systematic; sometimes he includes examples of both good and bad design (such as when he analyzes doors), but oftentimes he only mentions the bad (such as when he talks about office phone systems.) He rarely offers suggestions for superior designs and organizes everything by psychological concepts that often prove vague or arcane; section headings include 'Memory is Knowledge in the Head' and 'Using Sound for Visibility.'  Even more fundamentally, explanatory pictures rarely occupy the same page as the text that references them, forcing the reader to page back and forth. That the typesetting for his book is so awkward feels especially glaring as that's the sort of basic design flaw DOET seeks to expose. To Norman's credit, he shows passion for the subject and writes engagingly when he isn't listing psychological vocabulary words. And the subject of design is fascinating; relevant to everyone, applicable to all areas of life and endlessly detailed. And Norman routinely finds interesting digressions; applying design principles to Legos or charting every plausible game of Tic-Tac-Toe. And I found myself agreeing with Norman's core philosophy. He argues that function should supersede features and usability is more important than aesthetics. He also takes the stance that if you can't figure out a gadget, it probably isn't your fault and he goes into detail about how common this sort of confusion is.  Norman takes a decidedly pro-humanity outlook in a book all about objects; just one more irony. After all, DOET is a poorly-designed study of design regarding a mundane subject that fascinates.Edited 2/19/2019"
13,0465067107,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1363537-yevgeniy-brikman,4,"This book has several very important ideas:* Even if you aren't professional designer, you still use design everywhere in your life, including how you design your house, your resume, a report, some code, etc.* Design is all about focusing on people's needs and abilities. You may think you know what those are by the virtue of being a human, but you don't, as most human actions are unconscious. Therefore, to be a good designer, you need to learn some psychology.* Good design is all about finding the root cause (not just the stated problem) and using an iterative process (there are no failures, just experiments).* Many of the things we attribute to human error are actually caused by poor design. This is because humans make mistakes _all the time_ and a good design _must_ take this into account.For these alone, it's worth reading. That said, the book feels a little unfocused and scatter brained. It frequently goes off on tangents, most of which are interesting, but not always relevant to the main points. The book is also repetitive, repeating the same message about bad design, constraints, and culture over and over again. Some good quotes:Good design is actually a lot harder to notice than poor design, in part because good designs fit our needs so well that the design is invisible, serving us without drawing attention to itself. Bad design, on the other hand, screams out its inadequacies, making itself very noticeable.We are all designers in the sense that all of us deliberately design our lives, our rooms, and the way we do things. We can also design workarounds, ways of overcoming the flaws of existing devices.Two of the most important characteristics of good design are discoverability and understanding. Discoverability: Is it possible to even figure out what actions are possible and where and how to perform them? Understanding: What does it all mean? How is the product supposed to be used? What do all the different controls and settings mean?All artificial things are designed. Whether it is the layout of furniture in a room, the paths through a garden or forest, or the intricacies of an electronic device, some person or group of people had to decide upon the layout, operation, and mechanisms. Not all designed things involve physical structures. Services, lectures, rules and procedures, and the organizational structures of businesses and governments do not have physical mechanisms, but their rules of operation have to be designed, sometimes informally, sometimes precisely recorded and specified.Human-centered design is a design philosophy. It means starting with a good understanding of people and the needs that the design is intended to meet. This understanding comes about primarily through observation, for people themselves are often unaware of their true needs, even unaware of the difficulties they are encountering. Getting the specification of the thing to be defined is one of the most difficult parts of the design, so much so that the HCD principle is to avoid specifying the problem as long as possible but instead to iterate upon repeated approximations. This is done through rapid tests of ideas, and after each test modifying the approach and the problem definition. The results can be products that truly meet the needs of people.A conceptual model is an explanation, usually highly simplified, of how something works. It doesn’t have to be complete or even accurate as long as it is useful.When people use something, they face two gulfs: the Gulf of Execution, where they try to figure out how it operates, and the Gulf of Evaluation, where they try to figure out what happened [...] The role of the designer is to help people bridge the two gulfs.We bridge the Gulf of Execution through the use of signifiers, constraints, mappings, and a conceptual model. We bridge the Gulf of Evaluation through the use of feedback and a conceptual model.Most of us start by believing we already understand both human behavior and the human mind. After all, we are all human: we have all lived with ourselves all of our lives, and we like to think we understand ourselves. But the truth is, we don’t. Most of human behavior is a result of subconscious processes. We are unaware of them.When we speak, we often do not know what we are about to say until our conscious mind (the reflective part of the mind) hears ourselves uttering the words.When we perform a well-learned action, all we have to do is think of the goal and the behavioral level handles all the details: the conscious mind has little or no awareness beyond creating the desire to act. We need to remove the word failure from our vocabulary, replacing it instead with learning experience. To fail is to learn: we learn more from our failures than from our successes. With success, sure, we are pleased, but we often have no idea why we succeeded. With failure, it is often possible to figure out why, to ensure that it will never happen again.Scientists know this. Scientists do experiments to learn how the world works. Sometimes their experiments work as expected, but often they don’t. Are these failures? No, they are learning experiences. Many of the most important scientific discoveries have come from these so-called failures.Eliminate all error messages from electronic or computer systems. Instead, provide help and guidance.Humans err continually; it is an intrinsic part of our nature. System design should take this into account. Eliminate the term human error. Instead, talk about communication and interaction: what we call an error is usually bad communication or interaction. When people collaborate with one another, the word error is never used to characterize another person’s utterance. That’s because each person is trying to understand and respond to the other, and when something is not understood or seems inappropriate, it is questioned, clarified, and the collaboration continues. Why can’t the interaction between a person and a machine be thought of as collaboration?Our strengths are in our flexibility and creativity, in coming up with solutions to novel problems. We are creative and imaginative, not mechanical and precise. Machines require precision and accuracy; people don’t. And we are particularly bad at providing precise and accurate inputs. So why are we always required to do so? Why do we put the requirements of machines above those of people?Seven fundamental principles of design:1. Discoverability. It is possible to determine what actions are possible and the current state of the device.2. Feedback.There is full and continuous information about the results of actions and the current state of the product or service. After an action has been executed, it is easy to determine the new state.3. Conceptual model. The design projects all the information needed to create a good conceptual model of the system, leading to understanding and a feeling of control. The conceptual model enhances both discoverability and evaluation of results.4. Affordances. The proper affordances exist to make the desired actions possible.5. Signifiers.Effective use of signifiers ensures discoverability and that the feedback is well communicated and intelligible.6. Mappings. The relationship between controls and their actions follows the principles of good mapping, enhanced as much as possible through spatial layout and temporal contiguity.7. Constraints. Providing physical, logical, semantic, and cultural constraints guides actions and eases interpretation.Never criticize unless you have a better alternative.When people err, change the system so that type of error will be reduced or eliminated. When complete elimination is not possible, redesign to reduce the impact.When many people all have the same problem, shouldn’t another cause be found? If the system lets you make the error, it is badly designed. And if the system induces you to make the error, then it is really badly designed. When I turn on the wrong stove burner, it is not due to my lack of knowledge: it is due to poor mapping between controls and burners. Teaching me the relationship will not stop the error from recurring: redesigning the stove will.Why do people err? Because the designs focus upon the requirements of the system and the machines, and not upon the requirements of people. Most machines require precise commands and guidance, forcing people to enter numerical information perfectly. But people aren’t very good at great precision. We frequently make errors when asked to type or write sequences of numbers or letters. This is well known: so why are machines still being designed that require such great precision, where pressing the wrong key can lead to horrendous results?In many industries, the rules are written more with a goal toward legal compliance than with an understanding of the work requirements. As a result, if workers followed the rules, they couldn’t get their jobs done.Good designers never start by trying to solve the problem given to them: they start by trying to understand what the real issues are.Don Norman's Law of Product Development: The day a product development process starts, it is behind schedule and above budget.Good designers are quick learners, for today they might be asked to design a camera; tomorrow, to design a transportation system or a company’s organizational structure. How can one person work across so many different domains? Because the fundamental principles of designing for people are the same across all domains. People are the same, and so the design principles are the same.Every modern innovation, especially the ones that significantly change lives, takes multiple decades to move from concept to company success A rule of thumb is twenty years from first demonstrations in research laboratories to commercial product, and then a decade or two from first commercial release to widespread adoption. Except that actually, most innovations fail completely and never reach the public."
14,0465067107,http://goodreads.com/user/show/398928-laura,1,This was written in a decade before authors learned how to write stimulating non-fiction. 
15,0465067107,http://goodreads.com/user/show/611031-kater-cheek,2,"I got this as an audiobook, based on the fact that it falls within my usual taste for non fiction and because it's been referred to by many other books. In many ways, this is a classic book that inspired many people to think more seriously about design. At least, that's my impression, garnered from the unreasonably long introduction in which the author talks about how great and important his book is.Confession time: I didn't finish the book. I got down to about the last hour and ten minutes and finally had enough. This book is boring. I spent most of my time listening to it trying to figure out why it was so boring. I like design. I like sociology. I like pop science. I like non-fiction. Why did this book make me drift off and not know what he'd said for ten to twenty minute chunks? I'm not exactly sure, but I've got some ideas.First of all, the book references illustrations. Yes. In an audiobook. I went to my audible account to delete it, and saw that the pdf of the illustrations had thoughtfully been included in the download. So I looked at the illustrations, but they still weren't that great. They clarified some things that I didn't understand, but they didn't add a tremendous amount to the understanding of the text. If the book had been littered with illustrations, with ""here's good"" next to ""here's bad"", it might have helped, but then it wouldn't have been a good audiobook.Secondly, the book had too much abstract descriptions and made-up words.Remember when you were in elementary school and they'd have a textbook that talked about, say, the natural resources of a country, and they'd have vocabulary words in bold that you had to remember for the test? But they were artificial, like ""grasslands"" meant something different from ""savanna"" which was different from ""prairie"" This book kinda did that, at least in the first chapters, like he was structuring this as a textbook to teach you principles of good design. His principles sort of made sense, but they had too few examples to elucidate them, and what anecdotes and examples he included often were completely off-topic.The middle to second half of the book got especially off-topic, degenerating at times into a rant about how hard VCRs are to program and DOS computers are to use. Which brings me to my third point: this book is really dated. In some ways it's cool; he describes a smart phone decades before one existed. In other ways, it's not really relevant. He talks about frustrating faucets, for example, he derides motion-detecting faucets as difficult to use because they aren't obvious. Most people these days use motion-detecting faucets just fine. He talks about how awful computers are, but he's talking about a computer that anyone under the age of 25 has never seen. Even if it weren't for the overly-abstract, poorly described principles he wants people to learn from, the age of his observations makes this book not relevant.I don't recommend this book. It's an interesting topic, but this book is poorly written and too dated to be useful."
16,0465067107,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1928100-stringy,4,"A classic for a reason. The examples are dated, but if you still remember rotary dial telephones (maybe over 30 years of age?) you'll be fine with them. Since Norman more or less predicts iPhones and iPads in this book, I'd love to read an update chapter from him in the next edition. The principles are still accurate and useful, and Norman makes a solid case for why my inability to get through doorways safely is actually the fault of the manufacturers. People using products are busy, they have their mind on other things, and they can't read the mind of the designer. Therefore, if you're in any way responsible for making a product for other people to use, it's worth your while to take a look at how to embed the knowledge of how to use it within the object itself. Norman covers some of the techniques for this, but you can get that in many other user-experience and design books with more up-to-date examples. What I found most valuable was his way of taking a fresh look at everyday objects, really observing what happens when we use them and wanting to find a way to smooth that path. In future I'll be trying to do the same. "
17,0465067107,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1272349-neven,4,"DoeT isn't the world's best written book—Norman's style is too often kvetchy-casual, sounding more like a modern-day ranty blog post than a classic of academic design writing. But that is only one way in which this book is ahead of its time. The observations and recommendations regarding usable design here hold to extremely well 25 years later; even though Norman's examples concern ancient phone systems and slide projectors, it all translates perfectly well to virtual touchscreen UIs of today. And when he makes predictions about the future, he's eerily prescient. Watch him describe smartphones, the World Wide Web, Nest thermostats, and Siri… in 1988. Not only does he correctly predict future technology, he's better aware of its problems than today's designers. That alone excuses the book's stylistic shortcomings and proves its undeniable worth."
18,0465067107,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6415645-brian-rosenblat,5,"(5.0)Can't believe I hadn't read this before. There's a lot of wisdom in this book. I'd highly recommend for anyone pursuing a career in design, product, marketing, or tech, or anyone who just wants to build great products. Internalize these ideas and put them into practice and you will create better products that will impact people's lives. "
19,0465067107,http://goodreads.com/user/show/34270033-katie,5,"I think there is really only one gif to sum this book up properly:This book, although the examples are dated (as listed in nearly every review), is quite fabulous. The original title was actually ""The Psychology of Everyday Things"" which was less friendly to the average person, but quite accurate. Like I said in a previous update, I feel like this book should be required reading for any type of designer, but somehow I had missed it until now. Great detail about design methodologies, constraints, and psychology - but not too much to be overwhelming (in my opinion). The examples, while dated, were still quite excellent (assuming you were born pre-2000s but hey you can google things). Since I listened to the audiobook (on Hoopla) I missed out on the diagrams which is disappointing, so I think I recommend reading the actual book. (However, I quite enjoyed the narrator, Peter Berkrot.)I think that the younger generations (like myself or maybe this is just applicable no matter the period in history) assume that older people or even people their own age who don't understand technology are dumb. I know I've felt that. While working in a game dev company, we often expressed how stupid our users were, because things seemed obvious to us. It was great to hear his thoughts on how it's not your fault you can't figure something out, it's the designer's. I think anyone who has ever made something needs to hear that. You made it, you have a mental model of how it works, of course it seems intuitive to you. He also goes into the difficulties designers face in getting to a good design and the struggle to keep a good design from being changed along the way.I do think there were a few times he oversimplified things as far as challenges designers face, but overall he seemed to take a fair stance. It was especially fascinating to hear his ""theories"" on what computers would become (this was written in '88) and compare them to what HAS happened so far. He's often quite spot on, though I'm not sure how many of those things he helped MAKE happen. ;)BLAH BLAH BLAH, IT'S GOOD. If you're a designer, a must read. If you aren't, it may be a little dense but still worth it if you're interested. Definitely will at least help you figure out how to look out for good design in the products you buy."
20,0465067107,http://goodreads.com/user/show/679134-bryan-alexander,5,"A splendid book that I finally got around to reading, The Design of Everyday Things walks us through exactly what the title promises. Norman explores phones, doors, car keys, VCRs, water faucets, and signage, looking for principles that show how these work well or poorly.Despite the author being a psychologist, the books is beautifully bereft of jargon. It reads like Asimov's nonfiction: accessible, brisk, pedagogically attuned, and often witty.One nice assumption: that the user (you) is usually right. When we run into problems with things, it's often because of poor design.As someone who grows more obsessed with bad signage every year, I found this a very pleasant read.Recommended for anyone working with design, with technology, with spaces. And fans of Edward Tufte."

That's not a problem through most of it. there are timeless principles here that will make any designer of consumer goods better at his job. These principles will also help the rest of us to be smarter consumers or just smarter people. I'm a man before I'm a consumer. A...man...I tell you!It's little dry in places and there were points when it occurred to me that this book would really benefit from an update but if you take it for what it is, it's worth your time."

23,0465067107,http://goodreads.com/user/show/15283898-jacob-mclaws,4,"This a required read for anyone who wants to design things for humans to use, but it was more like a textbook than I hoped when I picked it up. Lots of design vocabulary and lots of fairly common-sense principles. Don Norman is definitely one of the early design thinkers and this is where he talks about it all. Big takeaways: Signifiers and feedback are key in designing something. The user needs to be able to quickly understand what it can do (affordances) and get immediate and appropriate feedback when they do something.Human Centered Design Process: all about observing to understand the problem, ideating solutions, rapid prototyping and testing. You should test with small groups at first so that you have lots of opportunity to refine and iterate. I especially liked the part about using the Wizard of Oz technique: manually handling the backend yourself and letting the user think you are automating it. I think that's often the best way to test whether something will gain traction. Doesn't work for everything, but sometimes it's very useful. When there's something wrong, humans aren't using things wrong, designers are designing poorly. "
24,0465067107,http://goodreads.com/user/show/695116-jim,5,"If you can't figure out how to use a simple device, it's poorly designed. Fancy designs that take away usage cues suck. His prime example are 'Norman doors' (Yes, named for him & his example by others over the years.) those without visibly hinged sides or handles. It can take several seconds to figure out how to operate them. Not a big deal? We deal with thousands devices regularly & poor design means a lot of frustration & wasted time. It can also mean accidents, even fatalities.Norman started off as a psychologist. I don't know if I noticed his explanations on how we make mental maps, narratives, & our various brain bugs more or if they were new, but they were great. Explains a lot about the difficulties we can have with 'simple' things. He makes this clear in a very readable & often funny way. One example was car versus house heaters. Both have thermostats that power the heat fully on, but they work differently. Turning a house system up high won't make the house heat faster, but it will in the car. Refrigerators & their freezers? Forget about it! When there are fewer controls than functions, problems can arise unless there are cues to guide us, but in this case, he had a terrible problem understanding the system. His has 2 knobs, one for each compartment, but only one thermostat & feedback requires waiting 24 hours. The knobs actually control air flow. Practically impossible to figure out - very poor design.This was written before the smart phone & the Internet hadn't really taken off, so his views of issues of the future at the end of the book were quite instructive. Often they were right, but I can see how the technology has matured to mitigate some. For instance, he thought writing a text with hypertext would require a team of people, while we do it all the time. He really nailed feature creep, though. The number of functions that are in word processing programs today are staggering & yet we mostly only use relatively few each. Just too much & only needed in special circumstances. He doesn't mention it, but when the manufacturer doesn't fix basic, underlying issues that have afflicted us for generations & still aren't fixed because development is focused on adding new gimmicks or changing interfaces, it's downright frustrating. (Microsoft Office!) He glories in some good designs & shows how they matured. He takes us through the car & phone's evolution of form. He really likes his pen, too. It's just a cheap marker, but he discusses all the things the designer had to think of to get it just right. It's sharp enough to write well, the handle makes you want to hold it in just the right place, & it can also be used for sticking into the holes of electronics for resets. All that in a cheap pen! He ends by saying we should boycott poor design. I wish I could, but our choices are incredibly limited for all the products available. For instance, I'd like an inexpensive car that I could pick the instrumentation on. If I have an automatic transmission, I don't need a tachometer, but they all have one. Why? I can hear the engine rev & have no need to shift. I'd really like temperature & oil gauge rather than a single idiot light that only alerts me when one of hundreds of items are wrong. I can't shut my idiot light up because my gas gauge sending unit is busted & I won't spend $600+ to fix it (drop gas tank & replace fuel pump which has the sending unit built in) since I just use the trip meter to know when to fill up, but it means the warning light is worthless. I had to buy an OBDII scanner to check occasionally. Ridiculous!!!Anyway, great book & I highly recommend it. Audio probably isn't the best format, although this was very well narrated, since he does have pictures & such. I didn't have too much trouble visualizing most & I did read a paper copy years ago. It would also be nice to look back over some sections. He can say a lot that's worth mulling over. Table of Contents:The psychopathology of everyday thingsThe psychology of everyday actionsKnowledge in the head and in the worldKnowing what to do : constraints, discoverability and feedbackHuman error? no, bad designDesign thinkingDesign in the world of business.I reviewed an earlier (1990), paper edition  here. I think that is the same as The Psychology of Everyday Things (1988) which was the original title of the book. Norman changed the title to get it out of the Psych section of book stores, but it does accurately describe the thrust of the book. This is not the latest edition of the book. The latest is a much revised & updated edition in 2013 according to the Wikipedia article."
25,0465067107,http://goodreads.com/user/show/841949-tracey,3,"The main question in my mind after listening to this audiobook is easily enough answered: How old IS this book, anyhow? In the introduction the author talks about how the book isn't dated. Well, it was originally published in 1988. One of the pieces of technology most discussed is the videocassette recorder. The VCR. The computers being discussed are about a step beyond the ones that were capable of adding three numbers together using a bank of systems that would fill a room. Some of the book is relevant no matter what, as the prologue or forward or introduction or whatever it was points out. But not all of it is. Much of the point of this book is: ""When people have trouble with something, it's not their fault. It's the fault of the design."" And I don't buy it. Maybe it's because I have less faith in humanity than the author does, but – well, I've seen it (including, to be honest, in myself). I did not like the book Wizard's First Rule, but something I love and use all the time is its explication of Wizard's First Rule: ""People Are Idiots"". Yes, it should be obvious whether a door needs to be pushed or pulled to get the thing open – but in most if not all of the cases I've seen it's not actively hidden. In my experience, people just don't pay attention. People don't read. Example: I can't tell you how many emails I've sent, only to have to reiterate some or all of it almost immediately. I used to run an international online-based Secret Santa, and every year after the emails went out I braced myself for the slew of responses asking questions that were answered in the initial email. Because people don't read. I've learned that when I ask two questions or provide two pieces of information in an email, the second one is going to go completely unnoticed. More than two? Forget it. Now, I've long ago learned that my tendency to wordiness won't fly in business emails – I've learned to pare it down. Still, people don't read. Recent example: in reply to a question from one of my bosses, I wrote ""I’ve attached [three pieces of documentation for a delivery]; it looks like there was no delivery ticket created."" That was the first line of my email. One of them replied with ""Do we have delivery ticket?"" I sat and stared at it for a couple of minutes, thinking of and discarding possible responses, and then just wrote back ""There was no delivery ticket, as far as I can see"". I just don't understand.Example: I can't tell you how many people go up to the fax machine in the office and ask whether paperwork has to be face-up or face-down. (The owner of the company asks every time.) (Every. Time.) How do you work in offices as long as these people have without learning that there is a little graphic on the machine to answer just that important question. (I also can't tell you how many blank faxes I've received over the years, because people a) didn't read and b) didn't ask, and just faxed away. Upside down.) The design is just fine: the question is answered. I'm not sure how else it could be addressed; bright colors or flashing lights? Or big letters? Nah. It's fine. People are idiots. So your car radio is difficult to use while driving? Here's a thought: Don't use it while driving. You might want to watch the road instead. The author talks about an expensive hoity toity Italian washing machine that was so badly designed the owners were afraid to touch it. ""Why did they buy it?"" the author asks. Well, because it's an expensive hoity toity Italian machine – and they're stupid. They wanted conspicuous consumption, or got snowed by a salesman who perceived their weakness. Plus they probably hire someone to do their laundry anyway, or at any rate seem to be able to afford to. And the author complains about the problems inherent in lowering a projection screen in a lecture hall – but it sounds like the hall long predates slide projectors. The projector had to be installed in the place long after the fact, and in such a way (I would assume) so as not to do any mischief to the structure or artistry of the room. So – yeah, it's not perfect. It doesn't exist in perfect conditions. Work with it. Or hold your lectures somewhere else. And the author complains about senseless instructions for those VCR's, and all I could think was, well, they're often translated, badly, from Japanese. The author talks about a design feature – or not – in an Audi which allowed the sunroof to be closed without the ignition key in place, but only if an odd sequence of steps were taken. Why, he asks, was it such a peculiar combination of steps? Well, a) because it was accidental, and/or b) because a non-peculiar combination might result in an accidental opening of the sunroof when you really didn't want it open. (I say ""you"" because I'll never so much as sit in an Audi.) Now, I do agree with the basic premise of the book. Of course an object should be designed so that it's not difficult to use. But … well, see, over the sink in my apartment there are three switches. When I had a tour of the place I was told that the one on the left controlled the light, the one in the middle controlled the garbage disposal, and the last one was for the dishwasher. When I moved in a little while later it took about five minutes' trial and error to work it out again. Now I don't have to think about it. I don't need a huge sign on the wall. Figure it out yourself: you'll probably remember it longer. ""Control/alt/delete"" isn't an intuitive command for the computer – but the reason for that is pretty sensible: it's not something that can be done using one or two close-set keys … because it's not something you want to do accidentally. And once it's learned, it's easy enough to remember. Okay, go back to the whole door thing. The author admits that he has problems with doors. And I get it – if there's no label on a door it can be hard to know whether you're supposed to push or pull or whatever. But – at least nowadays – I think every door I see in a public venue has a little sign. Or - know what? If you're meant to pull, there's probably a handle, and if you're meant to push there's probably a bar. And … I'm sorry, I can't muster up a whole lot of sympathy for the person who pulls on a door that says ""push"", or vice versa – including me. Honestly, I have little patience with anyone (including me) who doesn't read the damn directions. I also don't have a lot of patience for someone, like the man in this book, who goes out and buys a massively expensive Italian washing machine without making sure he understands how to use it. Yes, that can be blamed on the design; it can also be blamed on the salesman seeing dollar signs, and on the fact that any instruction manual is probably translated from the Italian – and on a level of carelessness and lack of preparedness by the buyer. I'm sorry – if you don't put in a certain level of research into a big purchase, you deserve what you end up with. If I need, for example, to make a spreadsheet do something I don't know how to do, I don't write a letter to MicroSoft complaining about the poor design of Excel. I figure it out, or I look it up. If I don't know what a word means, I look it up. You know the adage that God helps those who help themselves? I like it. I work with people who don't bother to try to solve any problem for themselves. If they don't know how to do something, they sit in their seats and yell like children for help – literally. It sounds like the author is in favor of this attitude – everything should be obvious, and if it's not you're entitled to squawk. It's learned helplessness. My feeling on this is basically that if I can figure it out, or look it up, anyone can – and damn well should. And read my damned email, jackass. So, no – technology of any sort should not be intentionally or incidentally obscure. But also, and equally, people should be able to learn and follow the instructions that are present and hone their deductive instincts. It's an ability that will only ever make life easier."
26,0465067107,http://goodreads.com/user/show/145381-brian,4,"(4.0) Some good stuff in here, though it's certainly datedI'll be looking up some of his other books to see if he's as good at predicting and suggesting product improvements as he was back then.I think he makes concrete some really common sense ways to approach and analyze designs of products that humans use. It's certainly entertaining to point out ridiculous products, interfaces etc., but that's kind of 'negative design': what not to do. That doesn't actually help you do it right. Fortunately, he does spend a fair amount of time on how to do it right. So some good stuff to summarize:* Make the controls/interactive elements visible: they won't used if they're not noticed* Use cultural, intuitive clues to suggest the function of elements...e.g. choose materials, shapes, colors appropriately* Try to make the interactive elements map to the functions they perform, particularly easy if there is some spatial component to what is controlled, arrange the elements in the same arrangement as their actions* Think of the steps that will occur when a user interacts with a product: -- user forms a goal -- user translates the goal into smaller, more concrete 'intentions' -- user enacts the intention as best he can -- the system responds -- the user tries to interpret the response -- 'bugs' can occur anywhere in this chain, identifying the source can help identify the solution* Make sure there's feedback when user does something. If the product's state has changed, make sure user can tell. Readable displays can be helpful here* Users will make mistakes. Expect them and make them reversible, low impact* If you need instructions for new user to operate, you're probably doing it wrong* Try to use constraints to limit the wrong actions user can take -- e.g. 3.5"" floppy disks can only be inserted one way into drive (though they look square and top not much different from bottom) -- cultural constraints can be used as well as physical constraints* as last resort, turn to arbitrary standards (so even if something not intuitive, user only has to learn once and can apply to all similar devices) -- e.g. QWERTY keyboard* how to use technology best to improve products/processes: -- simplify tasks, but leave them largely the same (don't automate away key steps that users will forget occur and can't troubleshoot when something's wrong) -- make things visible that weren't visible before so state is easier to track -- design for error, don't blame ""human error"" when unintuitive/broken interface leads to disaster (e.g. three mile island)So I think a few of these can be explicit steps to take when evaluating a design:* are the relevant features visible? is feedback visible?* is it clear what the mapping is from interface to resulting actions?* when user interacts with each control, is there appropriate feedback?* can user identify when he's made an error? can he undo the error? are the 'human errors' ever catastrophic?* are there constraints you can apply to reduce possibility of error?He also made some cool predictions/product requests, which makes me want to read some of his more recent stuff:* the windows/macintosh user interface would take off* calendar/reminder book would be electronic and fit in your pocket (but didn't think they'd BE the phone...talked about connecting the calendar to the phone...but well on his way to asking for the smartphone)* how big hypertext would get, mostly in the context of books/media...not sure he really thought of the Web as the logical extension though* it also seems that his line of thinking was adopted into the types of user testing that i'm familiar with...let naive users play with the product with no guidance and see what sense they make of it. what mistakes do they make? when were they surprised by how the product behaved? why?Only negative bits were that there was some material in the middle about theory of mind, memory, psychology of errors etc. that I didn't think was all that relevant. Interesting, perhaps, but a little out of place."

You'll never look at another door or faucet in the sameway.If you take anything from this book, it is these 7 principles of making a difficult design task an easy one.1. Use both knowledge in the world and knowledge in the head.2. Simplify the structure of tasks.3. Make things visible: bridge the gulfs of Execution and Evaluation.4. Get the mappings right.5. Exploit the power of constraints, both natural and artificial.6. Design for error.7. When all else fails, standardize.Altough, the reason for the 4 star reviews, is that the book is a bit outdated.

I picked it up because I was told it was a classic of the field and would be useful to have in my reading repertoire. And truthfully, the only reason I gave it two stars instead of one is because of the impact this book has clearly had on the design field. I'm sure at the time of its original release, this book was light years ahead of others in the way that it thought about design. I can definitely see how its concepts have become a main part of every design education. But ultimately, I thought this book was too wordy. It said in hundreds of pages what, in my opinion, could probably have been said in less. A lot of it is very common sense, in that most people don't even really think about the concepts. Altogether, probably still good that I read it. But I'd be lying if I said that I didn't skim a majority of it for the important bits. "
29,0465067107,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1040333-jon,5,"The book introduces basic psychological concepts from areas such as cognitive psychology and ties them into usability and design.Even though the book feels a bit outdated (they talk about rotary phones and old sewing machines), all the principles covered in the book still apply today.Even though the book was written with things in mind that most of us won't necessarily use anymore (such as the problem of threading a projector), the principles are still useful to know when designing modern-day things from cell phones to websites.I would definitely suggest this book to designers, computer scientists, engineers and anyone who might create something for others to use."

36,0465067107,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2135825-trike,3,"I’m sure when this came out in 1988 it was something of a breakthrough, where readers went, “Yes! This is exactly what I mean about my VCR!” Time has marched past the specific technological examples Norman gives (including the 2002 update), but the general principles are still solid.Sadly, designers still don’t follow them, even now, 30 years (!!) later.From my own personal experience, when I bought my Volvo 6 years ago, during the test drive I drove under a bridge that was dripping water from melting snow. Without thinking, I operated the windshield wipers effortlessly. This was three minutes into the drive and I knew right then I was going to buy the car. I have not regretted that decision at all. All the controls are intuitive and easy to use. Fast forward to last summer and I bought another vehicle, ending up with an SUV. (Not my choice, but that’s another story.) I actually had to go back to the dealer to have the nice lady at the service department show me how to use the wipers. All the controls are the same: unclear and unintuitive, violating many of the rules laid out in this book. I have to constantly look away from the road to adjust *everything*. It’s dangerous and exhausting. Climbing back into my trusty C70 is, by contrast, relaxing and pleasant.Speaking of VCRs, when they first came out there were endless jokes about how they constantly blink “12:00” forever. Even Johnny Carson did many of them on The Tonight Show. I always thought people were overexaggerating because I owned an early JVC VCR because I needed it for school. ($700 in 1984, or $1700 today; holy crap 😮.) It didn’t have on-screen programming or even a remote, but it was easy to comprehend. Then I was gifted a used VCR that was clearly designed by an idiot giant. To set the clock required pressing three separate buttons, each of which were on opposite corners of the box. Two on either end of the front, and one, bizarrely, on the back. I’m 6 feet tall, but my hands weren’t big enough to reach any two buttons at the same time. I needed a second person just to set the clock. Everything else was similarly designed. It was the stupidest thing I’d ever seen. Pretty sure Norman had one of these.As for the book itself, I found it too repetitive. It could have easily been half as long. Still, the design principles are sound. If you design anything, this should be a book you read."
37,0465067107,http://goodreads.com/user/show/16954393-kipriadi-prawira,0,"A big part of what makes The Design of Everyday Things so enjoyable are the descriptions of flawed designs that Norman peppers throughout the book. These case studies serve to illustrate both how difficult it is to design something well, n how essential good design is to our lives. Norman draws on his own (often humorous) experiences with poorly designed objects, as well as anecdotes from colleagues n friends, n paints an all-too-familiar picture of design gone awry. If you’ve ever struggled to program a VCR, pulled a door handle when you were supposed to push, or been mystified by the taps in a public restroom, then you’ll be sure to relate to these encounters with bad design. Norman uses the book’s examples of substandard design as a springboard for examining the factors that frequently derail the design process, n he proposes that matters can be improved when designers adopt a user-centered design philosophy n focus on the needs of the user.While The Design of Everyday Things deals mostly with the design of physical objects, its principles are equally applicable to the design of websites n other interactive systems.good!"
38,0465067107,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2876353-john-p,3,"This work did not meet my expectations. I had the idea that it would highlight, perhaps, the interesting history of the design of commonly encountered objects and, indeed, there are a couple examples in the book. But a better title would be something like ""The Norman Philosophy of Design"" or ""Suggested Approaches for the Would-Be Designer"".Norman seems to me to be quite full of himself and offers several of what I would consider to be unsupported (and unsupportable) statements in the manner of Hoffer and Nietzsche. This is not to say that Norman is wrong in his general approach and philosophy of design; on the contrary, I would say that he is for the most part correct.In the end though, I had to force myself through to the end of this dry work. It is not a read for the casual reader looking for light but informative entertainment."

Concepts discussed by the author which I liked a lot:1. Affordances & Signifiers2. Constraints & Mappings3. Feedforward & Feedback4. Conscious & Subconscious thoughts5. Knowledge in the Head & Knowledge in the World6. Classification of Errors7. Resilience and Fault Tolerance8. Incorporating Design into other areas of business like Marketing, Strategy, Business, Competition...The book also has immense amount of generic advice which could help the reader at their work and general life too :)"

The book really hits around Chapter 6 where it covers the product development process – describing it in an ideal world and in the real world.The book could be significantly shorter without losing much; the author describes in excruciating detail the design flaws in doors, light switches, and stoves he's encountered over the years. When I want to hear those stories, I go to my grandparents' house."

So many principles on which predictions were based - some of them coming true now after more than two decades of the book being written - this got me awe-struck.I am hopefully going to carry more than a few concepts and will refer to them time and again. I will always think about things like no. of controls, and no. of actions in context of my products at least, and the product I use."

Most important things to know could be listed in few bullets; lots of examples with detailed analysis but examples should not be used just for the sakes of examples. Of course readers can get useful insights throughout this structural failure, with much efforts; but let's just say this book is a product, with very poor design."

The perspective you gain from this read is applicable widely - from doors to computer systems, taps to aircraft controls. A must read for a designer/engineer.Still found it repetitive at times and too general (might be because of the ubiquitous theme of design author intended to convey). Could be made a shorter and a denser book. The book is full of interesting examples and anecdotes. And they surely give you an insight into the ""Design of Everyday Things""."
46,0465067107,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5605419-rob,3,"This book was originally published as The Psychology, rather than Design, of Everyday Things. It's pretty heavy on the psychology side, and I was hoping for more on the design side.Where the author does talk about design principles, it does a good job of abstracting the details into principles, and it does a good job of stripping away the things that don't matter. It's just not really the book I thought and hoped it would be."
47,0465067107,http://goodreads.com/user/show/105608919-a-g,4,"While I found the first chapter tedious to get through, it proved to be an insightful and worthwhile read. This first section establishes the basis of Design with a slightly academic tone which might discourage a reader not interested in the subject proper, but it quickly takes a more pragmatic turn and presents its arguments in a way that can be applied to nearly all industries and professions. The ideas explored and explained here - discoverability, signifiers and affordances, conceptual models, resilience, feedback and feedforward- can be practiced by anyone who's everyday work involves communication of ideas. After reading, the concepts presented seem obvious and almost too basic for a title with such a reputation - but maybe instead that is the intent. A good design is one that makes complexity appear simple. "

53,0465067107,http://goodreads.com/user/show/21478808-sam,4,"Donald A. Norman writes a series of essays about how the design affects the usability of commonly used items, to introduce readers to the field of usability design. The author includes essays about the distinctions between psychology of everyday objects and everyday actions, knowledge in one's head and knowledge in the world, knowing what to do, human error, the challenge which defines design, and a description of user-centered design. This book is written for an audience seeking an introduction to user-centered design, and they will find a collection of memorable examples with explanations. However, practitioners (and other already familiar with design) may criticize the book for its lack of depth; but, this book was not necessarily written for them."

56,0465067107,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2882612-norain,5,"Here was one of those few books that not only made me go ""Whoa!"" but also made me go away, many times throughout reading it, to do some pondering.The book starts with some scenarios about faulty designs that embarrass the users. Remember the time when you went to a toilet and broke into cold sweat because you could not find the flush button? Or the time when you struggled to open the door by pulling it only to be told that you should push it? Or the time when you simply could not switch on that fancy hi-tech TV or microwave? Users usually blame themselves for these kind of 'mistakes', even downgrading themselves as stupid because they are unable to do things that others can. While it is true that sometimes it is the users' fault a machine does not work, most of the time the fault lies more in the design of the product.Designers often put aesthetic value over practicality. Thus we have products with almost invisible buttons or as few of them as there can be, each of which controlling multitude of functions. This only confuses new users and may even cause competent ones to make mistakes if they have to use these products in times of emergency.Don Norman proposes a lot of ways to improve a design. He is not opposed to a design being beautiful but suggests that designers find balance between the aesthetic quality of their creations and their ability to function well. And in this book, design is not the only subject of discussion but also the psychology of humans and the way our minds work. For example Don argues that the more tasks a man handle at once, the more likely he makes a mistake. Not to mention the Short Term Memory is well, short term. So when designing a product, a designer must consider the possibility of mistakes and do something to prevent it from happening.Don also puts a lot of stress on mapping the functionality of a product. And it is important that users can straightaway see the result of his action, such as when he pushes a button he can see the light turns on or hears a beep. Oftentimes a designer's mapping does not match that of the users'. Human brains work with the logic that B happens when A is triggered so A must have caused B even if the fact is totally wrong (B may have been caused by C but because A is accidentally triggered, user reaches the wrong conclusion) and it is designers' job to accommodate this.The edition I read was from 2002 but this book was originally published in 1988. All of the examples given and the pictures are outdated technology-wise but amazingly, Don wrote it so clearly that even if you have never seen one of those old bulky telephones, you can understand his point easily. I believe this book will always remain relevant to designers. After all it is not just about design but also about human psychology. The only complain I have is because the book was originally titled The Psychology of Everyday Things, it was referred in the book as POET so that was a tad confusing.At the house I am currently renting, we have this toilet which, apparently, is from an excellent brand. From the outside it does look excellent. But it has a big problem. Every time you flush it, you need to press the button for more than five seconds or water will not stop flowing. It took us some times to figure this out and when we did, some of us often forgot the 'rule'. Not to mention that our guests do not know about it (which is annoying to the ones whose room is the nearest to the toilet since they have to keep re-flushing it) so we have to put a notice telling people to hold down the button for at least five seconds. I can count on one hand how many bother to read that notice and yes, we have repeat offenders. So here is just one example of how a faulty design can make life a nuisance, if not totally miserable. I might not think about it that way if I did not read this book, but Don Norman made me go around evaluating the designs of things around me. And goodness, the many beautiful but stupid designs there are!"
57,0465067107,http://goodreads.com/user/show/28304476-catherine-muller,3,This made me feel better about my constant struggle with doors and validated that the light switches in our kitchen are nonsensically placed. 
58,0465067107,http://goodreads.com/user/show/8325737-philipp,4,"One goal is to turn readers into great observers of the absurd, of the poor design that gives rise to so many of the problems of modern life, especially of modern technology. It will also turn them into observers of the good, of the ways in which thoughtful designers have worked to make our lives easier and smoother.This book is 50% what it says in the title, and 50% a 'design for undergrads 101' book. The first half can be mind-blowing, as others here write - why do emergency doors look the way they do? Why are hotel sinks so weird (I could write novels on how weird hotel bathroom designs are, by now I just assume that hotel bathroom designers are robots who never use the bathroom). What is good design of 'everyday things'? What makes a bad design?From there it becomes a 101 intro book, lots of concepts and definitions are introduced (affordances, anti-affordances, a simplified psychology that reminded me strongly of a simpler version of Thinking, Fast and Slow, many models with graphs on how humans interact with tools, different kinds of errors a human makes [mistakes vs. slips] etc. pp.), that part is less fun to read but is important if you're involved in design in any form (and that means software interfaces too!). After that it becomes a bit bigger in outlook: how do you design a company, a company's workflows etc. to make good design possible? How does the author run his consulting (stuff like 'include stupid questions since they can question what's obvious')? It falls apart towards the end where it becomes a partial manifesto and gets a bit more heated, since the focus is lost, essentially a bunch of mini-essays that repeat some points.Anyway, this isn't a standard recommendation to software engineers for nothing, it definitely makes you look at things in a different way, hopefully your things will become better, too.P.S.: great point: if something doesn't do what you want it to do it's not your fault, it's the designer's fault. I wish more software engineers would stop sneering at their users, it's just childish (common acronym in IT: PEBCAK, Problem Exists Between Chair And Keyboard)"
59,0465067107,http://goodreads.com/user/show/19849650-pratyusha,3,"It gives a great design perspective to everyday things! The many occasions design failed us and the innumerous problems/failures we thought was our problem! I will now look at every object/product from a UX perspective, knowing best what as a user myself any user will love.The more I read the book, the more I felt ""yes, I wish they added this little feature or option! That would have made my life so easier"" I surely believe given the chance(considering time, schedule, budget etc features the book mentions), it is important to make an effort to make the design as human-centric as possible. Leave no room for error or confusion! After all, we are all users ourselves, making life better is not a luxury but a necessity.The book talks about competition-driven design, featuritis, design-thinking, constraints, product acceptance, legacy problem, affordances, signifiers, mapping, feedback, discoverability among other things.Loved this line from the book, it is often very true in various other industries and jobs as well: ""The day a product development process starts, it is behind schedule and above budget""""The long-held view that even as technology changes, people remain the same may no longer hold"" is thought-provokingAlso interesting to know that just as we now debate if dependant on technology is diminishing our memory and knowledge to perform certain functions, Socrates complained about the impact of books. The point was that reliance on the written material would diminish memory, need to think, to debate and to learn through discussion. This is very true, I often remember thinking to myself sometimes why to be a part of this discussion if I can read a book and gain the knowledge."
