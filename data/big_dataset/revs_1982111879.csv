0,1982111879,http://goodreads.com/user/show/31506695-david-wineberg,5,"My problem with books on mathematics is never remembering the formulas, even from one chapter to the next. OK, and being bored with them is a factor too. Kit Yates solved these problems by not using any formulas, or even much math in his delightful (when not frightening) The Math of Life and Death. His secret is really simple: he tells stories. The result is always engaging, often infuriating and sometimes horrifying. We defy the math at our peril.Using examples from the news, such as epidemics or murder investigations, Yates shows what underlies the events – the basic numbers that anyone can see do or do not add up.The whole strength of The Math of Life and Death is the power of true events. Yates recognizes their value, and provides the background facts that fit with numbers that prove a point. In the hot new service of gene sequencing, he shows clearly how our assumption about identifying people by DNA samples can go wrong – badly – enough to incarcerate the wrong person. In his own case, 23andMe gave him a death sentence through a wrong interpretation of his genes. He proved it (to his great relief) with other such services and went back to show just how the numbers can lead analysis astray. Sloppy math is hard to prove, but can ruin lives.He shows that something as unmathematical as algae needs an understanding of math. An algal bloom doubles in size every day, until it covers a lake - in 30 days. If you see the lake is half covered, how long do you think it will take for it to be covered completely? Most would calculate numerous days, based on when the algae first appeared and had reached the halfway point, but the correct answer is one more day. Mistakes like this lead planes to crash, which Yates also shows in painful detail.Doctors are forever misinterpreting test results, giving patients false death sentences or false reassurances. Yates gives the example of breast cancer tests, by which doctors seem to predict nine out of every two cases of breast cancer in women. The numbers are pretty stark. With false positives from tests, 981 women out of a random 10,000 will be told that they have breast cancer. But of those, only 90 will actually have it. Ninety out of ten thousand (ie. nine per thousand) is not the pandemic plague that should cause panicked fear in women, but that’s how doctors present it when they are surveyed. Given multiple choice questions, doctors fare far worse than if they had chosen random answers. They are prejudiced in the false direction. They have the facts and the numbers wrong. The result is needless surgery, needless chemotherapy, and much pointless suffering.There is a horrifying chapter on legal ignorance as well. So-called expert witnesses bamboozle judges, juries and opposing lawyers with mumbo-jumbo that no one challenges, because they don’t understand what was said. They just pick out a major conclusion from what they heard, and accept it as true and significant. The result is wrongful convictions. In the major case cited, a young mother went to prison for murdering her first two children, because an expert incorrectly claimed the chances of two children from the same family dying from Sudden Infant Death Syndrome (SIDS) was one in 73 million. (He made up the number himself.) That’s all the jury needed to know. It didn’t matter that the expert was wrong about the odds, or even that the children didn’t really die of SIDS. The number was so overwhelming, the decision was easy to make: she had to be guilty as charged. In upholding the conviction, the appeals court said no one would be fooled by such a wild claim.This is the same principle that guides media claims, and why so few trust the media any more. Shopping for statistics and angles, reporters hone in on some startling number, and taking it out of context, draw conclusions that it doesn’t merit, or maybe worse, just leaving it there to fester in the imagination of people with no other facts to weigh. Absent those facts, the population divides into believers and non-believers, ever more extreme in their positions. It is no wonder that a Boris Johnson can lie about the massive amounts of cash sent to the European Union, and even when the lie is pointed out, it continues to be the foundation for leaving the union. The result has been utter chaos in a farcical government. So while it’s critical to have the numbers behind the claims, few do. Worse, fewer can master them, and a select group will manipulate them to their own advantage.Yates also tackles algorithms, epidemics, and antivaxxers. The antivaxxers rely on a single, tiny, invalid and misinterpreted study by a (since) defrocked doctor, where he claimed to show that vaccinations cause autism. They don’t, as Yates relates clearly and concisely. Nonetheless, the news traveled from Britain the USA, where it has become gospel to millions who have no need of the facts. They accept the headline as all they need to know. The result is a resurgence of diseases long thought banished, with thousands suffering needlessly. Perversely, parents even mail licked lollipops to each other, so more children can be infected. They believe the false headline, and are ignorant of the death and disfiguration rates from these so-called rites of passage diseases. It is craziness squared, because the numbers were cooked and won out over the facts.The Math of Life and Death is an endlessly diverting, pleasing, engaging and horrifying look at how lives are affected by the math. It is math in very human terms, and Yates excels at making it plain. And you don’t even have to do the math to see it.David Wineberg"

Trigonometry, algebra, Euclidian geometry & others are all useful & should be used in general life e.g. when building something. Additionally, as mentioned in the article, being able to understand & calculate compound interest is useful for just about everyone. Another example - calculating if discount percentages are genuine or not. "
2,1982111879,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4070035-kartik-narayanan,5,This is a fantastic book on Mathematics but is a little bit more advanced for novices. It covers a lot of topics all of which amaze one when the maths behind them is revealed. Of particular interest is the last chapter which deals with the modeling of pandemics (this book was written before covid-19 became a thing). Highly recommended by me FWIW. 
3,1982111879,http://goodreads.com/user/show/10951313-yunke-xiang,5,"I was never very good at math growing up in China where I never fully understood why I needed to do the proof of equations in math classes. Now as a professional, I am doing a job which forces me to work in math a lot. Slowly seeing the magic of math everywhere from pharmaceutical to industrial production, from sales to oil and gas, and see the value math brings, I started to appreciate it a lot. This will be a book I want to send as a gift to my kids and my nephews to get them see the power of math in everyday life from when they are little. I want them to understand that math is a powerful tool when you use it wisely, it produces society with great impact. If you didn’t use it right, it could blind people and lead to huge loses and unfairness or cost lives.-----------------below are just some notes I made for myself---------------There are seven chapters in the book:1.	Thinking ExponentiallyUncover the connection between exponential behavior with everyday phenomena: eating snacks, bacteria growth, deposit in bank, credit card late payment, Pyramid scheme , nuclear reaction, ice bucket challenge ,and population explosion. This has made the point very clear that the rule of exponential growth can be seen everywhere in life2.	How math makes medicine manageableLots of the medical tests are imprecise (e.g.23andMe and the BMI, breast cancer test), sometimes the high false positive will make people question the cost-benefit balance of the test/screening programs. Knowing these shake the unquestioning attitude towards the accuracy of health test for us, even extremely accurate test can be hugely imprecise. This chapter really reminded me of the broad-brushed percentile record the doctors gave to me and my husband when we were doing ultra sound test during pregnancy (ecological fallacy) and reminded me the time when I have my baby did x ray suggested by a dentist, which now I think might have done her more harm than discovering any true problem. 3.	Mathematics in the lawThis is probably the saddest chapter in the book with Sally Clark’s story told through the chapter. The author discussed several problem with the case ‘guilty until innocent’, the wrongly calculated ’73 million to one’ probability, the ‘independence mistake’ and the ‘ecological fallacy’, ‘the prosecutor’s fallacy, ‘blinded by math’. 4.	Debunking media statisticsThis is the chapter that I relates to the most. The author has describes cases where media manipulate data. One example is Lancôme’ad for its anti-aging line pseudoscience. There are also cases where the media fudging the headline to make their story stands out (or create fake news). The author suggests that “ultimately, the degree to which we believe the stats we come across should depend on how complete a picture the artist paints for us. If it is a richly detailed realist landscape with context a trusted source clear expositions and chains of reasoning then we should be confident in the veracity of the numbers. If however it is a dubiously inferred claim supported by a minimalist single statistic on an otherwise empty canvas we should think hard about whether we believe this truth.”As a practitioner, I also know how easy it is to manipulate result or present it to bias people’s’ view. It always benefit one party or another to put a spin on a particular finding to suggest correlation, to promote argument or advance someone’s agenda. We need to be really careful o being too readily to be convinced. Let’s be skeptical and ask for more explanation before start to draw any conclusion.Not only media, consulting service sometimes also have slants on stories when it comes to interpreting numbers or reporting facts. They may even call it the art for science. So again knowing that “Statistics can be cherry picked to present a particular angle on a story”. The author has done a great job ‘help to demystify the tricks traps and expose mathematical manipulations employed. Rather than perceiving them as indisputable facts. There are also some practical tricks we can use to get free drinks/food from bets. Like how many people do you need in a group to find one pair who share the same birthday, which I find very interesting. 5.	Number system6.	Optimization algorithmIn this chapter, the author described one of the 7 millennium prize problem: N vs NP hard. ‘It is often easier to verify a correct solution to a problem than it is to produce the solution in the first place. The P vs NP challenge asks whether every problem they can be checked efficiently by a computer can also be solved efficiently. For example once a jigsaw is complete it is easy to check that it has been done correctly. More rigorous definition of what efficiency means are expressed mathematically in terms of how quickly the algorithm works as the problem gets more complicated -when more pieces are added to the puzzle. The set of problems that can be solved quickly is called P(polynomial time). A bigger group of problems that can be checked quickly but not necessarily solved quickly is known as NP(Nondeterministic Polynomial time)One of the NP question is ‘Travel salesman problem and vehicle routing’. •	‘The yes-no decision version of the traveling salesman problem is known as NP- complete. A powerful theorem tells us that if we ever come up with a practical algorithm that solves one NP complete problem, then we would be able to transmute this algorithm to solve any other NO problem, proving that P equals NP. Since almost all internet cryptography relies on the difficulty of solving certain NP, proving P equals NP could be distorts for our online security.’•	‘Ironically, some of the most astounding scientific discoveries have relied enormously on the creative thinking of highly trained and dedicated individuals. If P equals to NP, then computers would be able to find formal proofs of any mathematical theorem that is provable. Many of the greatest intellectual achievements of humankind might be reproduced and superseded by the work of a robot. At its heat P versus NP is the battle to discover whether human creativity can be automated.’Other problems described here are:•	Dijkstra’s algorithm— finds the shortest path in polynomial time. •	Optimal stopping (Hiring problem the 37 percent rule (only works 37 % of the time but better than 10 %) •	I like the argument the author made on how the algorithm can be biased and we need to be aware: ‘Even the genuinely pragmatic algorithm have hard coded biases they influence the direction in which the spotlight is shone on the global stage.We place trust in supposedly impartial algorithms because we are wary of obvious human inconsistencies and inclinations. But although computers may implant algorithm in an objective manner following a predefined set of rules, the rules themselves are written by humans. These programmed might hard code their bias consciences or unconscious directly into the algorithm itself, obfuscating their prejudice by translating them into computer code.’ Several examples are provided here include Amazon automated pricing strategy, and Navinder Sarao algorithm to spoof the market in 2010. 7.	Mathematical epidemiology This chapter is about how math is used in controlling and understanding epidemics. There are also some interesting points that ‘the SIR model illustrates the importance of not coming in to work when unwell. If everyone with an infectious disease followed this practice, we would all benefit. This is the author’s argument for the harm of presentism and he used Chipotle’s case where their stuff who felt under the weather but still kept coming which ended up infect hundreds of people as example.Other story in this chapter also includes offering HPV vaccination to homosexuals to be cost effective."

There are no actual formulas in this book, instead what it shows you is how math is a part of every aspect of our lives from medicine to law to sales. This book is full of real-life stories, many you might know from hearing about them in the news and many others that are just as powerful. It breaks down the math behind the stories and shows the examples of how mathematics is an integral part of our lives even if it's not always obvious.The powerful part of this book is when it highlights all the ways in which mathematics has been used/interpreted incorrectly and caused people's lives to be ruined or altered forever. When a monitor in the ICU is muted because it beeps too much and then it can't beep when in fact it needs to, it can (and does) kill people. When data is interpreted incorrectly (as it often is) it can (and does) cause innocent people to go to jail. These are real-life consequences of mathematical errors that cause people to behave in ways that (inadvertently) harm other people.This book is full of powerful examples that make you feel both cringe with horror and delighted (I was so excited to find out that the ice bucket challenge had such a positive outcome.) But more often than not, it's a sobering look at the role math plays in our lives and the harm we can do when we misuse it.I loved reading this book and if numbers are your thing at all, I can't recommend it enough.thank you to Scribner and netgalley for an early copy in exchange for an honest review."
5,1982111879,http://goodreads.com/user/show/18107306-jeff,5,"No Formulas. Just Numb3rs. In this book about how math shapes our lives, British math professor Yates doesn't take us into the algebra, geometry, and even trigonometry that we all use daily - whether we realize it or not. Instead, he takes an approach similar to the now decade old US television show Numb3rs, starring David Krumholtz and Rob Morrow, wherein he shows applications of higher level mathematics in fields such as epidemiology, medicine, law, journalism, elections, and several others. Yates cites real world examples including unjust convictions and Ebola outbreaks and many others to show how math was used incorrectly and what the math actually showed in that situation, to help the reader begin to get an overall sense of math without getting bogged down in the technical calculations. Truly an excellent book for even the more arithmophobic among us, as it shows the numbers all around us and explains how we can have a better sense of them.Disclaimers: 1) I LOVED Numb3rs back in the day and would still be watching it if it were still on the air. 2) I have a computer science degree and very nearly got secondary mathematics education and mathematics bachelors degrees at the same time as my CS one - so obviously I'm a bit more attuned to math than others.

7,1982111879,http://goodreads.com/user/show/10757200-stacy,3,"As a math nerd, I am always looking for books that provide insight into the use of mathematics in our lives. I skimmed through this book and found some interesting tidbits on disease, exponents, and statistics. The examples and stories include a lot of visuals which helps but there is a lot of detail here (more than I personally needed, since I was reading this book for fun)."
8,1982111879,http://goodreads.com/user/show/43944855-laura,4,"The Maths of Life and Death, written by Kit Yates, who is a senior lecturer in the Department of Mathematical Sciences and co-director of the Centre for Mathematical Biology at the University of Bath, aims to show that ‘maths is for everyone’ and that mathematics is ‘first and foremost, a practical tool to make sense of our complex world.‘ This is a mission that I’m definitely on board with. I’m convinced that maths is the worst taught of all school subjects in England (due to the failure of central government policies to attract and reward good teachers), leaving a lot of people with the idea that maths isn’t for them. It’s frustrating to see people who are otherwise really smart refusing to even engage with an argument if it contains numbers or anything else ‘sciency’. Yates’s book, on the whole, definitely does a good job of explaining some basic mathematical concepts simply and clearly, and showing how they are relevant in the ‘real world’. The book is almost entirely focused on statistics, and the one chapter that strays into the realm of pure mathematics – on algorithms – will probably be less accessible for the average reader. However, having a solid understanding of some basic concepts in statistics is both vital and possible for everyone, and so I think this focus works well.I have to say that most of the examples used in The Maths of Life and Death were already familiar to me, which is probably the result of my amateur enthusiasm for statistics rather than any undue repetition on Yates’s part, although there is a certain amount of crossover with Ben Goldacre’s Bad Science. Because I’m interested in medicine, I was already familiar with the material on medical statistics covered in chapter two, and with much of the epidemiological information in chapter seven (this, of course, is not Yates’s fault, but because this chapter focuses on controlling global pandemics, it makes for a rather chilling read in the wake of Covid-19). Chapter three, on the law, retells the story of the infamous Sally Clark case, where statistics were used to ‘prove’ that the chances of experiencing two stillbirths in the same family were 1 in 73 million, and so Clark must have murdered her two children; as Yates shows, this figure could only have been arrived at through multiple statistical errors. And I already knew about the ‘birthday problem’ in chapter four, which shows that in any school class it’s more likely than not that two children share the same birthday, although I loved hearing the story of how Yates used this fact to pitch his literary agent, Chris Wellbelove, while they were having drinks in a pub:I bet him the next round of drinks that I would be able to find two people, in the relatively quiet pub, who shared a birthday. After a quick scan of the room, he readily took me on and indeed offered to buy the next two rounds if I could find such a pair, so unlikely did he think the prospect of a match. Twenty minutes and a lot of baffled looks and superficial explanations later… I had found my pair of birthday-sharers and the drinks were on Chris.Yates’s prose is clear and straightforward, which is absolutely necessary for a book of this type. Occasionally, when he is trying to write about the bigger implications of statistics, it becomes a bit banal, but this isn’t the case most of the time. I also liked that he explained his calculations both in the text and through the use of diagrams – I found the text easier to follow, but others would probably prefer the diagrams, so this works for everyone. All in all, I’d recommend this book as an accessible and important introduction to understanding the use and abuse of statistics. 3.5 stars.I would like to thank Quercus for sending me a free copy of this book to review."
9,1982111879,http://goodreads.com/user/show/47698611-karaleigh,5,"I received an ARC of this book in exchange for an honest review…albeit a bit late.This book was amazing! Yes, I may fit a stereotypical audience (math teacher), but this book really is for everyone. It was easy to read and engaging, funny and informative. “The Math of Life and Death” is one of those books that you just can’t help sharing with others. I constantly found myself asking my husband, “did you know…?” in regards to what I had just read. A couple of ideas that really stood out to me:1. Medically, “Two tests are better than one.” The amount of false positives are far more than false negatives (at least percentage-wise) and it’s far better to get a second test before completely freaking out over a diagnosis. 2. Make sure your lawyer knows math (and can use logic well).Perhaps most importantly is how timely this book is with what we are experiencing in the U.S. for two reasons:1. #blacklivesmatter—right people all over the US are protesting police brutality especially as it pertains to black people. I’ve seen all over Facebook and twitter those trying to squash the movement because the police kill more white people than black people or there are more black-on-black killings and shouldn’t we be more worried about that. Here is what Yates shows (though you should definitely read pages 124-129 of the book for full details):￼￼

image hosting""It seems that a black person walking down the street should be more alarmed to see a police officer approaching than another black person.”“That police officers have twice as high a per capita rate of killing white people than black people is because the country has more white people. That the rate is only twice as high, given that the United States has almost six times as many white people as black people is perhaps unsettling.”2. COVID-19—The last chapter of Yates book is focused on epidemics. More specifically “How to stop an epidemic.” It was jarring to read this in the midst of a pandemic (particularly one in which there has been little to no national leadership). It was clearly shown that to mitigate the effects of illness we need to self-isolate, wash our hands, contact trace. Remember this was published BEFORE COVID affected our lives. Also—“vaccination is a no-brainer.”“I genuinely believe that math is for everyone and that we can all appreciate the beautiful mathematics at the heart of the complicated phenomena we experience daily.”"

Everyone should have a head full of useless indifferent facts and figures, that amaze and bore those around them! I love to shoot down faulty statistics, ""Jackson Hole WY had a 300% increase in female juvenile bank robbery"" in blaa blaa year. When really, it means that 3 little girls ATTEMPTED to rob a bank.. well, that perhaps is sort of serious and noteworthy... but a 300% increase is certainly misleading if you don't understand numbers. Kit Yates is my hero... well maybe not hero, but I certainly appreciate his nerdiness!

Showed it to my friend Andrea on Wednesday when it arrived and she said she didn't like math. Lots of people THINK they do not like math, yet they love the math they use every day and never think about.The author began by sharing how his 3 year old loves to gather snail in ths garden and how he asked one day how many snails were in the garden. Instead of just saying ;I dont know', the author made it a mathematical game . Took a sharpie and made an X on the shells of the 23 snails his child had gathered and then put them back in the garden. Then a week later they gathered snails and out of 18 only three had the X on the shell. His calculations as a mathematical biologist showed roughly 138 snails lived in that area of the garden.It's a method used in various scientific calculations be it how many fish are in a lake, how much snow pack their is here in the Sierras to calculate how much water reservoirs, lakes, rivers will provide for a given year. Needless to say we have been using his math game approach daily, and trust me if you think you do not like math, this book may well change your mind!"

16,1982111879,http://goodreads.com/user/show/36612450-john-mcdonald,4,"Whether by coincidence or otherwise, this book was published and I purchased it just days before Governor Jay Inslee of Washington, acting to curtail the spread of COVID 19, ordered nonessential businesses, schools, and public gatherings to close and for people to engage in social distancing. By chance or otherwise, the author devoted the final chapter of the book to the mathematical models and formulae used to identify, treat, and project the spread and containment of infectious disease. When I bought the book, I had no idea that COVID-19 would have the profound effect on life in this country and abroad, that travel would cease and the economy largely cease to function, and that, much like the vaccine deniers, calls to end the restrictions would be heard from those who, for the most part simply did not understand or accept the math of infectious diseases. For its part, the book did not mention COVID-19 mostly because it hadn't been identified or named when the book was at the time it was published.Even if it was an accident, I couldn't have picked a better book to buy or a more timely chapter to have been written. The final chapter on mathematical modeling of infectious disease was clear, concise, comprehensive, and relevant. Not only did I better comprehend the disparate arguments and opinions, I mostly was impressed by the success these models had in predicting the diseases and managing the spread of the diseases.The book is worth reading or buying even if the COVID 19 offers no interest. The chapters on exponentiality and other problems we encounter along the way with subtle mathematical implications help us understand what we are reading or hearing, but also how to frame questions we should be asking. The book is both timely and fascinating, and in so many ways helpful."
17,1982111879,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7331624-madhukara,5,"One of the best mathematical books I have ever read. Teaching the real effect of mathematics ( mostly statistics and probability theory) with real-world stories made it fun to read. How a simple idea like dependent probability which we learn using dice examples in our school, can have a huge impact on the conviction in a murder case was eye-opening.The book primarily talks about mathematical ideas like exponential growth, conditional probabilities, median vs mean, etc in a real-world context. As application of mathematics is exploding using data science and Machine learning, understanding these nuances of their application is very important. Chapter 4 which talks about media misuse of statistics is highly relevant to today's fake news era.The last chapter about mathematical epidemiology which concerns mathematical modeling of epidemics is one of the real needs of today's COVID-19 pandemic. It clearly shows why quarantine and lockdowns are important and gives a cautionary tale if it's not followed how fast an epidemic can spread. The books leave us with single an important message ""Never take mathematical results as absolute truth. Always question the source of data, assumptions behind the model, and their biases."". Taking this attitude towards the mathematics as yet another tool to model the complex real-world makes it more potent rather than blind usage."
18,1982111879,http://goodreads.com/user/show/62042590-trang,5,"Thanks to Scribner for this ARC in exchange for an honest, though overdue, book review. I think this book is fabulous! It’s informative, fun, and most importantly—interesting! Yates is more than a mathematician but also a story-gatherer who uses real-life applications to make math interesting.I like doing math. Formulas? Check. Graphing? Meh. But I hate reading about it because math can be dull (surprise!) and extremely difficult. That’s why the readability of this book was so refreshing and enjoyable. No long and complicated formulas, only stats to prove a point.Yates does such a great job at throwing out examples upon examples and stories of all kinds in order to paint a picture of vague mathematical concepts. He’s a compelling writer and writes math into the everyday function of the world. I was able to grasp the undercurrents of math in epidemiology, law, and EVERYTHING! This is truly a great book for middle-school to high school kids and beyond to truly get them to see the patterns and numbers beneath our everyday lives. It’s made me passionate and I hope that the next person that reads this will too."
19,1982111879,http://goodreads.com/user/show/29679747-bronte-page,4,"The Maths of Life and Death provides a broad overview of some of the different areas in life that Maths plays a fundamental roll in. Covering topics from exponential growth to how Maths impacts the Law to number systems and optimisation, Yates provides interesting examples and explains maths concepts without having to rely on formulas. This makes The Maths of Life and Death accessible to readers of all mathematical abilities. I thought this was a solid addition to the realm of popular maths books. I found the first half of the book to be a little slow but that may have been to do with the fact a lot of the topics covered are also covered by a lot of other similar maths books. I thought this book really took off around the chapter about Law and Mathematics, with the chapters about number systems, optimisation and infectious diseases being my favourite ( and the infectious diseases section being particularly relevant in a COVID 19 world). I thought overall the mathematical concepts were well explained but there were occasional times where the explanations could have been better. However explaining mathematical concepts without relying on formulas and for a general audience without a maths background is a tricky task that Yates did a good job of overall. I would recommend this book to anyone who is interested in the way maths intersects with our everyday life. "
20,1982111879,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5737216-bob-colwick,4,"Kit Yates' first solo book is a gem; he siphons an innate love of mathematics with an unquenchable curiosity to closely examine phenomena that most of us don't inherently and/or completely understand (the Chernobyl disaster, pandemic growth and decline, population trends, etc). Yates shows us how to view life looking through the lens of math to gain deeper understandings...while the concepts are deep and the connections can be intricate at times, rest assured that this isn't a dusty old tome full of formulas...instead, it is a vibrant book of ideas that exposes the joy of finding connections between's life events and the predictable blocks that build those events. For those who are drawn towards taking things apart (whether they are physical or metaphysical), I believe that this book will be a welcome addition to your collection."
21,1982111879,http://goodreads.com/user/show/37095334-jw-ng,4,"The author explores the use of mathematics and the common fallacies present in everyday life. He explores a few topics of mathematics in biology such as in modeling a pandemic, using Bayesian statistics to interpret test results and the interpreting health-related tools such as DNA test and BMI. He also touches on the use of mathematics and probabilities in the courtrooms and how people are misled by the probabilities to wrongfully convict the accused. The part on number systems was intriguing as it led me to think outside of what we have been used to for the longest time, that numbers should be in multiples of 10s (decimal system). There was also a part on algorithms and how there are inherent biases in them that could go wrong. Overall a good and informative read, delivered with interesting examples. "
22,1982111879,http://goodreads.com/user/show/79173553-wade-sisler,4,"I added this audiobook to my Libby hold list on a whim, and Kit would appreciate this, on recommendation from the Goodreads + Libby algorithms. And even 30 minutes in, I wasn't sure I wanted to listen - a lot of revving the engines but minimal movement. By the time we got to statistics and probability, I was hooked and was drawn in by the many finger-on-the-pulse real world examples. The sections on the math behind unequal treatment of black people by police and on viral transmission are prescient. Also enjoyed stories on biases in algorithms. Kit's read and the audiobook was a little fast and breathless, and I wished he's slow down just a bit to let the impact of his stories sink in. I have a feeling this is one of the books that will stay with me and seep into my thoughts as I go through our ever changing world."
23,1982111879,http://goodreads.com/user/show/34496834-dk-simoneau,4,"Do you remember when in school and you used to ask what will we ever use this for? This book is the answer. And the answers are BIG answers. So much of how this current pandemic could be slowed is explained. Maybe we all need a lesson on how to read statistics and studies. I was actually seething angry to learn that the entire anti vaccine movement is likely traced to one report based on a single study of TWELVE children. Talk about uneducated people running with bad data. There are really great examples of how being more aware of how numbers are being used in the news, in criminal cases and more should be paid attention to. My favorite- I call it the 37% rule. I can’t wait to try it out the next time I’m shopping for something like a restaurant to eat at, or something else that I’m being indecisive about. Really great book! And you don’t have to be a math head to really benefit. "

I truly enjoy books that talk about how the concepts I 'studied' in school/college are actually used in real life. This is definitely one such book.I found one of the simplest explanation of Bayes' Theorem in this book. Other concepts discussed include Mark and recapture, regressing to mean and logistic growth are just as easy to understand.Improper usage of statistics was an eye-opener and I could relate it to many other advertisements I see in media. Kudos to the author.One great book about Mathematics without any formula (not that I mind them!)."

The virology/epidemiology sections were eerily prescient in the midst of the n-CoV outbreak! Some graphic illustrations are visually weak. Repetitive on certain viewpoints especially regarding the utility of math, misuse of mathematical calculations. Enjoyed the story telling aspect which kept the read engaging."
26,1982111879,http://goodreads.com/user/show/47247994-chris-waraksa,3,"This book came out in 2019 and was not written in response to the COVID 19, but it sure is timely. Chapters discuss exponential growth and how this relates to pandemics, and herd immunity, and even why diseases come in waves. The discussion of measles and the measles, mumps, and rubella (MMR)vaccine is one that I think really addresses a risk we face now in the current pandemic. The routine use of the MMR had led to a high rate of vaccination that meant countries like the UK were very close to reaching herd immunity and the eventual eradication of measles, the most infectious disease yet known, with a spread rate of 12 to 18, which means that each infectious person on average infects 12 to 18 others in a population with zero herd immunity. Anyway, the cautionary tale is that in 1998 a Dr. Wakefield came out with a very small scale study suggesting a link between MMR and autism. Wakefield's conclusion that the MMR is the cause of autism has been completely discredited now, but at the time the media gave sensationalist coverage to the story and as a result many credulous parents stopped vaccinating. As a result the near eradication of measles is no longer near. One point I take from this story is that the current clarion call to follow medical expert advise is only partly right, it needs a qualification, it needs to be said that we need to inform ourselves and not just find an expert to trust or a political leader to trust. In the current moment, some countries like Sweden are attempting to let herd immunity protect their population from being devastated by COVID19 while others like the US and Korea are going for a total lock down to keep the population away from contact with COVID19. These approaches are both based on expert opinions, but which is most correct? We are currently all part of a big experiment to find out. The book has plenty of interest, especially given its timely appearance with the novel corona virus. Some chapters were more interesting than others and I often felt that the author was cobbling together his materials rather than synthesizing them into a whole. He has found a number of topics that highlight how our thinking goes astray due to our insufficient grounding in math and statistics. He shows us enough math to bring home the point that we are susceptible to error due to our credulity and ignorance about math. At times it is frustrating because his discussion did not completely clear away the haze for me as when he tries to explain N and NP or even in the initial chapter about sampling snails in the garden. But I recommend the book for its timeliness and the many interesting tidbits within."
27,1982111879,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7891521-anna-marie,4,"This is mathematical theory for the average person, there're no formulas or even much Maths (since he's British). It looks at how statistics can be shaped to lie or confuse even if unintended but especially if intended. How experts can come up with some theory that really sounds good and no one understands but doesn't hold water. How unconscious biases can have far reaching consequences. Very interesting book about the math that constrains your life and death."

44,1982111879,http://goodreads.com/user/show/38013430-ellen-smith,5,"Particularly when I was in school, I thought of myself as someone who “hated math”...mostly because I wasn’t very good at it. But when you take away the pressure of keeping up with the syllabus and passing the next test, I really enjoy math. I especially liked studying statistics in college because I could see the overlap between numerical data and public perception. I was fascinated by the way presenting the same data in slightly different ways could cause wildly different reactions. (And yes I was a psychology major, if you hadn’t guessed 😄)That’s exactly the side of mathematics that Kit Yates shares in his new book. Each chapter is devoted to a mathematical principle, like exponential growth or probability, and shows exactly how those concepts play out in real life. His storytelling is compelling. There are stories of wrongful convictions based on math mistakes. The far-reaching effects of the Chernobyl disaster. Debunking statistics used in the news. Ironically, I read the last chapter—the mathematics behind preventing and stopping epidemics—as news coverage of COVID-19 is ramping up in the U.S. This book was a slow read for me because, as I’ve said, I’m not very skilled at math. I had to take my time with each example. However, I’m already sure this will be one of my favorite reads of 2020. I highly recommend this book, especially if, like me, you don’t think of yourself as a “math person.”"

49,1982111879,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4358570-kayla-mckinney,0,"With thanks to the publisher and Net Galley for this ARC.Ask most people and they'll tell you that they are either strong or weak at math - and they probably made this determination in grade school and stuck with it. In ""The Math of Life and Death,"" Kit Yates examines the mathematical principles we were all exposed to during our school days and demonstrates their connection to real world scenarios. When examining exponential growth, for instance, the book touches on pyramid schemes, short term growth in utero, nuclear power, viral marketing, and measuring population. Exponential decay is explained through using radio isotopes for dating alcohol and artwork. Probability is applied to the type of genetic testing undertaken by popular companies like 23andme. Other interesting topics of discussion - complete with formulas and illustrations to help those of us who don't have the best head for numbers are: BMI, false positives and negatives in lab work for mammograms and Downs Syndrome, false convictions in court, claims made in advertising, the statistical connections between race and homicide, search engine algorithms, and the spread of diseases. Interspersed with these examples are brief histories of mathematical developments like the decimal system, standardized time keeping, the debate over dozenal vs decimal numbering, metric vs imperial, and the dangers of interpretation. Above all, ""The Math of Life and Death"" calls all of us - even the less numerically savvy - to take responsibility for thinking about the numbers (often based on computer generated algorithms) we encounter in our lives. Are we being asked to pay a fair price at an online vendor? Is the sample size in a news article enough for us to apply the results to our lives? Is the GPS sending us on a route that makes sense? Yates writes, ""We must remember, however, that mathematics is only as benign as the person or people who wield it... a little mathematical knowledge in our increasingly quantitative society can help us to harness the power of numbers for ourselves. [where] simple rules allow us to make the best choices and avoid the worst mistakes."" By reading this book, you'll have a better grasp of those simple rules and better view of the math all around you."
50,1982111879,http://goodreads.com/user/show/14744553-natalie-waddell-rutter,4,"Each of the seven chapters covers a mathematical principle. Yates introduces the mathematical principle first. Then, Yates goes on to describe how it can be useful in everyday life and how it can be misused. Chapter one is about exponential growth and decay, applied specifically to money and radioactive decay. Chapter two discusses sensitivity and specificity when interpreting medical research. Chapter three discusses the use of math during criminal trial. Chapter four covers probability and statistics, particularly focusing on their usage in the media. Chapter five was about our number systems and how translating between units can lead to mistakes. Chapter six was about algorithms, their advantages and inherent problems. Chapter seven was about modeling epidemics and using the modeling to drive treatment.I found this book to have a weak start but a strong finish. That was mostly because I already knew much of the information presented in the first four chapters. Between my science background and the fact that I live with a statistician, I have a higher than average knowledge of math and its use. The last three chapters I did find fascinating, though, particularly the one on epidemiology. I had to read bits of that chapter to whoever was standing nearby. It's particularly timely, considering the Covid-19 outbreak that is currently occurring.I do think Yates does an excellent job explaining math to people who don't have a math background. The examples Yates provides emphasize the importance and prevalence of math in our everyday lives. Yates uses a variety of example, from finance to medicine to law, so you're bound to find something interesting."

The chapters of exponential growth, the sensitivity, specificity and second opinion and the S-I-R model all contribute a very good explanation of a epidemic. The author also tackles different sides of manipulation of math. We can use math to make our life much more easier or the other way around - The miscalculation of a dosage due to wrong decimal points could lead us to a fatal situation. I learned a lot from this book which also has helped to see through the numbers themselves and understand the message needs to be delivered behind the numbers. "
