We use such terms as if we knew what they mean; but they are largely without any definite content. Their primary function is one of propaganda, sometimes professional, often religious, always tendentious. Taking such terms seriously - except to dismiss them - is usually bad for human beings and other living things.This aptly-titled biography of the prominent 20th century British scientist, Paul Dirac, is an illustration of the point. Dirac was a bona fide eccentric, a nerd, a geek, probably autistic, someone who just didn’t fit wherever he found himself. He was also a genius who was the first to formulate the relativistic mathematics of quantum mechanics. How he did this was hardly methodical and can only be called scientific in retrospect.Dirac was initially trained in what today would be termed a trade school in Bristol. There he learned, among other things, engineering drawing, and that he was hopeless with any task involving manual dexterity. He was, in a sense, the antithesis of the mythical British empiricist. He went on haphazardly to advance his studies in applied mathematics and fitfully to pursue an interest in the then nascent field of relativity physics at Cambridge.Only by accident did he notice that the results being produced in another area of contemporary physics, quantum mechanics, by the rather more famous scientist, Werner Heisenberg, had a formal mathematical structure similar to that one of his teachers had been interested in several years before.* This lead Dirac to formulate a suggestion for the behaviour of sub-atomic particles in roughly this form: position symbol × momentum symbol – momentum symbol × position symbol = h ×(square root of –1)/(2×π).**This suggestion was rejected by most quantum physicists at the time as being patently unscientific, a mathematician’s fancy. Part of the reason for the disdain shown toward the idea is that the terms on the left side of his equation - the symbols for position and momentum - are entirely abstract. That is to say, they are dimensionless entities, like a mathematical point, that have no real existence outside of the mathematician’s head. By definition, they can’t be measured (or what amounts to the same thing, they could be measured in any of an infinite number of ways); so they can’t be real things. The formula, therefore, must be meaningless.Helass for the sceptics, the eccentric formula turned out to be exactly the key required to unlock the mysteries of quantum behaviour (and in the way of science, to produce quite a few more - like the possibility of anti-matter). Either what Dirac had done was surreptitiously ‘good science’ behind its hapless façade; or what constituted good science was in need of redefinition. Subsequent results pointed clearly to the latter. Whatever Dirac had done defined proper scientific method, although no one would have admitted it beforehand.But even Dirac didn’t know how he had arrived at his idea and therefore what his method might have been. Coincidence and history simply appeared to combine to produce a thought, which prompted him to find a certain mid-nineteenth century tome in the University Library. Hardly, therefore, a series of events to be written up in the annals of the philosophy of science. Nothing about the process could be called scientific except that it was conducted by a person who was (barely) considered a scientist.It would seem that in surveying the history of science the vast majority of ‘breakthroughs’ both big and small occur in just this way. Whatever ‘method’ produces them only becomes visible after they are produced; and then such method typically appears to be un-replicable as a procedure or clearly inappropriate for universal application. This is, on the face of it, a highly unscientific state of affairs. If we can’t specify the process by which reliable knowledge is generated, how can we distinguish between authentic science and bogus fakery, between reason and revelation, between astronomy and astrology?The answer is that we can’t. Not by specifying an acceptable or mandatory procedure in any case. The only way to verify the results of scientific, or any other sort of, thought is to promote widespread and unrestricted argument about it. Through such argument it might be established that there are procedural flaws in one’s thought or experiments. Equally it might be established that the existing ‘rules’ for thinking or experimenting are inadequate. But it’s not even possible to state the criteria in advance by which the choice should be made among these alternatives. The criteria are only discovered in the argument, and then continuously re-discovered through subsequent argument. Reason itself emerges from the debate; it cannot be imposed upon the debate. If scientific method means anything at all, it means keeping this argument going with as many participants as possible. The only way to judge the quality of that argument is how completely it ‘sweeps in’ extremes of opinion. This, I think, is the abiding political as well as personal import of Dirac’s very eccentric, and unmethodical, professional life. *This,is the mathematics of quaternions in which multiplication of elements is non-commutative; that is, where A x B ≠ (is not equal to) B x A.**Where h is Planck’s constant and π is the ratio of the circumference to the diameter of every circle (its value is about 3.142). This ‘matures’ by 1928 to something highly technical and irrelevant to the commentary here."
1,0465018270,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1713956-manny,3,"Dirac was one of the most extraordinary thinkers of the 20th century - indeed, of all time - and this book makes a valiant attempt to tell you about his life. The problem is that the interesting things happened inside Dirac's head, and no one knows what was going on there. Dirac didn't like to talk unless he had something to say that he thought would be worth listening to, which was the case most of the time. When he'd come up with an idea that passed his test, he'd usually just write it down from start to finish, no corrections, no crossings out. As one of his colleagues said, it was as though a chunk of marble had fallen from Olympus. During a period of about ten years in the 20s and early 30s, he was phenomenally productive and played a major role in establishing the new field of quantum mechanics.His greatest triumph was hypothesizing the existence of antimatter, now a word everyone knows. He didn't look at any experimental data: he just messed around with the equations for the electron and found a way to manipulate them into a form which seemed to show that there was another thing that was like an electron, but in some sense opposite in nature. People, including Dirac, were uncertain about what that actually meant, but the derivation was so elegant that he was sure it meant something. Less than five years later, experimentalists studying cosmic rays found tracks which could only be explained as being caused by a particle that behaved like a positively charged electron. When electrons and ""positrons"" met, they mutually annihilated. It turned out that antimatter existed; Dirac was awarded the Nobel Prize at the age of 31.Dirac himself didn't really know how he'd done it. He started talking about the importance of beauty and mathematical elegance in physical theories. The Dirac equation is indeed very beautiful and elegant, everyone agreed on that. But there was another, pragmatic side to Dirac, coming from his early training as an engineer. Sometimes the engineer seemed to take over, and he'd do apparently unsound things that would annoy the mathematical purists. The most famous example was the Dirac delta-function, which didn't become mathematically respectable for decades; Dirac just knew it was the right way, and cited analogies in engineering when he had to defend it. Later in life, he moved entirely towards elegant, mathematical modes of thinking, criticising the new mainstream of quantum field theory as being ugly and unsound, and after a while the miraculous discoveries stopped. Perhaps he needed to keep on thinking pragmatically from time to time; or perhaps he'd just got too old, or marriage somehow made him lose his focus.Dirac was clearly autistic, and like many autistic people he was often unaware of social conventions. There are a thousand amusing stories about him. (George Gamow said that amusing stories about famous scientists are generally not true, except in the case of Dirac, when they are always true). But the stories aren't the important thing, it's his way of thinking. As with Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart and Bobby Fischer, so many people have tried to figure out how to imitate the tantalisingly pure, simple style, but there's only ever going to be one of them."
2,0465018270,http://goodreads.com/user/show/9968594-maria,5,"What a fantastic book I have just finished!I always find biographies very interesting and stimulating, specially those regarding the lives of scientists. In this case, it was a biography not only of the life of the brilliant mind of Paul Dirac but also a complete story of the rise and golden age of quantum mechanics along with Heisenberg, Jordan, Pauli, Schrodinger and Born.Dirac, the youngest theoretician ever to win the Nobel for his legacy to this field was an eccentric man, famous for not understanding the feelings of others and lack of touch, always direct and honest, a loner, fully dedicated and obsessed on his work. He was a quiet man, who as a child preferred not to speak due a highly disciplined father who would only speak to him in French. Among all these peculiar characteristics of Dirac and many others of a personality that fits with those of a person with Asperger's syndrome, there is one that I truly admire in a person and this was the loyalty that Paul Dirac always demonstrated towards his family and his friends. It is worth mentioning that the only time they saw him crying was when he knew of Albert Einstein's death, not because he had lost a friend but because science had lost a invaluable scientist. I have to say that it was also a delight reading about his comments regarding politics and religion, his love for Disney classic movies and for Odyssey 2001... an extra star for that last one! Regarding what made him such a great scientists I'll just paraphrase the following: ""One reason why Dirac's approach was so puzzling was that he was an unusual hybrid-- part theoretical physicist, part pure mathematician, part engineer. He had the physicist's passion to know the underlying laws of nature, the mathematician's love of abstraction for its own sake and the engineer's insistence that theories give useful results"". Like Einstein, he was in the search of simpler and aesthetic laws that could explain all the principles of the universe in a unified way.Besides learning about his legacy in quantum mechanics and electrodynamics and the contributions of so many amazing scientists of this golden era, what really kept my motivation throughout this biography so vividly was reading about the personality of this genius. His life, from a precociously clever but emotionally withdrawn child, all his way up to becoming one of the greatest scientist ever in the field of physics. In summary, he was like Bohr once said about him: ""Dirac was the strangest man"". A superb work! Highly recommended for any person who finds excitement in biographies of scientists. "
3,0465018270,http://goodreads.com/user/show/8079403-max,5,"There are many stories in The Strangest Man. There is the story of scientific discovery and of the early quantum physics community that includes well-known names such as Einstein, Bohr, Rutherford, Oppenheimer, Schrodinger, Heisenberg, Pauli, Born and more. There is the story of an era and how science and politics interact through war, depression and deep ideological differences. Finally there is the story of a man, his scientific achievements, his distant personality, his upbringing in a dysfunctional family and his transition that allows him to establish a family of his own.Born to an English mother and French Swiss father in 1902 in Bristol, England, Paul Dirac would turn into one of the 20th century’s great scientists. His rigid taciturn personality caused Niels Bohr to describe him as “the strangest man.” Possibly autistic, from his early childhood throughout his life he kept to himself and talked as little as possible. His very strict father singled out the young Paul from his siblings for one-on-one suppers where they were allowed to speak only French. Paul Dirac deeply resented his father and blamed these excruciating evenings for his extreme reticence. As an adult he vowed never to speak French.At the University of Bristol Dirac studied engineering then switched to mathematics, his real love, and physics. He was accepted at Cambridge for graduate work where he achieved his first fame. In 1925 he wrote a paper that reworked Heisenberg’s matrix formulation of quantum mechanics. Heisenberg’s matrix was for an electron in a particular circumstance and time but Dirac’s more elegant mathematics was relativistic. It encompassed all quantum particles in all circumstances and times. Dirac refined his work in his highly praised doctorate thesis, the first at Cambridge on quantum mechanics. In 1926 Dirac wrote a quantum description of electron groups for which he is given credit along with Fermi. Actually Fermi published prior to Dirac. Both made the same predictions of energy levels but used different approaches. There was intense competition to be first to publish among theoretical physicists who were racing each other to solve the same problems. Those who published second usually received no credit. In his final paper as a student at Cambridge Dirac formulated a new quantum field theory explaining the creation and annihilation of photons in quantum terms. He would periodically return to work on this theory throughout his life.After graduation in 1926 Dirac moved on to Bohr’s Institute in Copenhagen. Here he worked on linking Schrodinger’s wave formulation of quantum mechanics with Heisenberg’s matrix approach. But success in explaining this relationship was met by the realization that Pascual Jordan had beat him to the punch. Interestingly Jordan had lost out to Fermi and Dirac on his prior paper about electron groups because his mentor Max Born forgot to read his paper before leaving for a US trip. In 1927 Dirac moved to Max Born’s Department of Theoretical Physics in Gottingen Germany where he began a lifelong friendship with PhD student Robert Oppenheimer. Dirac’s perspective on quantum mechanics did not include interpretation; something Bohr, Einstein and others were preoccupied with. Dirac thought in mathematical terms and believed quanta were impossible to describe any other way. He felt it was meaningless to try and visualize fundamental particles. Interestingly Dirac often thought visually in producing his equations. His engineering training included projective geometry and he learned to think in terms of shapes and translate those into algebraic formulas. Other theoretical physicists lacked this training which gave Dirac a unique approach.Returning to Cambridge, in 1927 Dirac wrote a paper establishing Quantum Field Theory (QFT) and introduced the term Quantum Electrodynamics (QED). This work led to what would be considered his greatest achievement, the Dirac Equation. In his quantum theory of the electron he predicted something unheard of at the time, an electron with negative energy, now known as a positron. The idea of electrons with negative energy was not readily accepted by his peers. They couldn’t be detected. Where were they? Dirac first posited they were protons but this was disproven. He then adjusted his theory to predict a new particle of the same mass as an electron. Today these antimatter analogs to the electron are observed in radioactive decay and produced artificially.In 1930 Dirac won accolades for his quantum mechanics textbook which became the standard for those capable of understanding it. Also in 1930 he became a Fellow of the Royal Society. In another episode of original thinking in a 1931 paper he theorized monopoles and implicitly the quantization of electric charge. Schrodinger subsequently called him “Monopolean”. In 1932 Dirac became the Lucasian Professor of Mathematics at Cambridge, a position once held by Isaac Newton. Dirac would stay for 37 years until his retirement in 1969. Ten years later in 1979 Stephen Hawking would assume the same Chair for thirty years.Dirac was a theorist, not an experimentalist. The practice of crafting theory then confirming by experiment rather than the reverse was beginning to take hold following Einstein and the quantum community’s lead. When in 1933 the positron was confirmed by experiment, the old school Ernest Rutherford said “I would have liked it better if the theory had arrived after the experimental facts had been established.” Attitudes have shifted. Modern day theoretical physicist Kurt Gottfried said in 2002 “Dirac’s prediction of anti-matter stands alone in being motivated solely by faith in pure theory, without any hint from data, and yet revealing a deep and universal property of nature.” Dirac was awarded the 1933 Nobel Prize for his theory identifying the positron. With Dirac’s most productive years behind him, his attention became more scattered. He would always return to his quantum field theory to try to eliminate the many infinities that plagued it. He could not accept the new theories of quantum electrodynamics because they assumed a “bare electron”, one without a field. This led him in the 1950’s to reformulate quantum electrodynamics in terms of his quantum field theory. Dirac never tried to figure out what fundamental particles were. Only their interactions mattered. His new theory held that the charge of an electron was not in a particle but in the lines of force of a field strung between two monopoles. He called these infinitesimally small lines “strings” that behaved in accordance with the laws of quantum mechanics. Not the string theory of today, but it does seem to foreshadow the idea. This is one more measure of Dirac’s creativity, even twenty years past his prime. Dirac married physicist Eugene Wigner’s sister, the Hungarian born Margit (Mancy) in 1937. Her two children from a prior marriage gave him an instant family. They added two daughters of their own. The outgoing combustible Mancy and withdrawn Dirac seemed a strange mix but despite domestic fireworks it worked. Mancy resented her treatment in Cambridge where she never felt accepted and believed her husband did not get the respect he deserved from the University. She was infuriated when Dirac turned down a knighthood in 1953. He didn’t want to be called by his first name. He preferred Mr. Dirac to Sir Paul. Twenty years later he would accept the even more prestigious Order of Merit from the Queen.Even though Dirac considered Cambridge home, Mancy got him to move to the US in 1969 upon his retirement. She always liked the US and their children had moved there. Since Dirac was well past his prime as a physicist, leading universities like Princeton where he had done sabbaticals were no longer interested in him. However, Florida State University hired Dirac’s son in law and got Dirac to move to Tallahassee where he finished out his days working on his theories. He died in 1984. FSU used Dirac’s presence to help build its physics department and treated Mancy with the respect Cambridge did not give her. She had Dirac’s archives moved to Tallahassee where they reside today along with his grave. For a man who always worked in the most sophisticated scientific hubs his adult life, Tallahassee seems a strange place to end up, but he was a strange man.Farmelo’s book is both a personal story and a science story. It holds appeal for readers focused on psychology and human interest as well as science fans. And as is typical in biographies of scientists, the personal story provides respite from sections of challenging science. I was particularly fascinated by the interaction among the scientists in the early days of quantum mechanics. The revolutionary discoveries in Bohr’s institute in Copenhagen and Born’s department in Gottingen are covered nicely here. We see how the personalities as well as scientific acumen mix and build on each other to formulate ground-breaking ideas in this exciting time. Equally fascinating is a theme that runs throughout the book: theory vs. experiment. Which is more important to lead the way in science? Today the argument continues with those smashing particles to build on the standard model on one side and the string theorists on the other. Dirac’s entire focus was on beauty and simplicity in mathematics. He would fit right in with the string theorists as they craft eloquent equations. We can only wonder what his brilliance would contribute today. "
4,0465018270,http://goodreads.com/user/show/405390-kemper,3,"Paul Dirac won a Nobel prize for physics. He was one of the pioneers of quantum mechanics and quantum electrodynamics. Among other things, he predicted the existence of antimatter, discovered the magnetic monopole solutions and his work was used as some of the basis for string theory.What does all that mean? Other than the fact that Dirac was one smart motherf----r, I couldn’t tell you. Because it’s my curse to be fascinated by theoretical physics despite being so math challenged that I could barely scrape out a passing grade in college algebra. Yet I’m intrigued by black holes, string theory, the big bang, the theory of relativity, etc. So when I read a book like this, even though the author does a pretty good job of trying to put Dirac’s work into layman’s terms, I can usually still feel the breeze in my hair as the ideas shoot right over my head.I can tell you that Albert Einstein once admitted to a colleague that he was having problems following some of Dirac’s equations, and that Stephen Hawking called him the greatest English physicist since Isaac Newton. A text book that Dirac wrote in 1930 on quantum mechanics is still in print and used today. So even a dunce like me can tell that Dirac must have been something special.He was also a grade-A nerdlinger. Even the other physicists considered him an odd duck. Aloof, quiet and extremely averse to seeking attention, his peers made a game out of trying to get more than one-word answers out of him and usually failed. His idea of a good time was taking a long walk. When a layman asked him what caused the big bang, Dirac replied that it was a meaningless question and refused to speak any further on the subject. He wasn’t exactly a social butterfly.The author believes that Dirac may have been somewhat autistic, and I guess it’s possible, but I’m a little leery of this new trend to classify every genius as autistic lately. But Dirac was such a private person that there was little personal insight for the author to draw on other than some interviews he did late in his life. So even after reading an entire book about him, I don’t feel like I know any more about him that I could have gotten from Wikipedia. If you’ve got a flair for theoretical physics or are a huge fan of stories about eccentric geniuses, then there’s a lot to like here, but it’s not a casual read."

6,0465018270,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2531665-charlene,3,"I really don't know how to rate this book. It deserves 5 stars for making Dirac its sole focus and for the portrayal of his personal life. However, there were two aspects of this book that really bothered me, which I will get to in a moment. The author gave an incredibly detailed account of Dirac's personal life. Sometimes when authors include that much detail, they are adding detail for detail's sake. Not so for this book. Every detail of his life was captivating to me. However, and this is the aspect of the book that bothered me most, whenever Farmelo, who himself has a PhD in physics, describe Dirac's work, he practically glossed over it. I have read other books, in which Dirac was not even a main focus, that did a much better job of highlighting his work. Every time Farmelo recounted an amazing achievement of Dirac's I felt as if I had been rushed through it. In fairness to Farmelo, the book was quite long as it was. That made me wonder if he had to choose between focusing on his work or personal life, and chose personal life. It left me wishing Walter Isaacson had written this biography because I was hoping for a book that was equally rich with personal life and scientific achievement, like Einstein's biography. It is hard to rate a book that is as rich in personal detail as it is empty in detail about method and science. Another aspect of the book that bothered me came in the afterword, when the author gave his personal opinion about Dirac and his possible autism. I am often fed up with author, and the general public really, labeling smart scientists as autistic. It happens far too often. That actually was *not* the case with this book. I felt that, up until the afterward, the author had made an extremely compelling case that Dirac was solidly on the spectrum. It was a rare case in which I felt the diagnosis was not being abused. However, Farmelo really should have let his prior words speak for themselves. In the afterward, he ranted about autism being caused by genes (there is so much more to it) and then pretty much diagnosed Charles Dirac (Paul's father) with it. Way to ruin what was a great narrative. The author also wondered whether Paul's brother had it as well. I thought that was fine. After all, it's merely speculation. Sadly, his opinions of Charles went well beyond speculation, and I found it annoying. In the end, I have to conclude that this book was something very special. Many people could write about the science. It's been done so often and so well. The recounting of his personal life, in this book, was far less known and for that reason, this book is a true treasure. His personal relationships were fascinating, and the author brought so many of the characters in Dirac's circle to life. "
7,0465018270,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1433865-robert,2,"The number of ""if""s, ""may""s, ""probably""s and ""likely""s in this book is alarming; the author speculates with a frequency that in the end (actually less than half way through, for me) undermines this detailed, comprehensive biography of one of the most influential and under-appreciated humans of all history. Biography is surely supposed to be factual. Forever filling in gaps with one's own guesses as to the subject's thoughts, actions and words is not helpful, it's misleading. This flaw really damages what could have been a definitive biography.Since Dirac is not at all famous outside the physics community, I will mention why I think this is a travesty and redress the problem to a tiny extent: Your life has been root-and-branch influenced by Dirac's work. Yes, he was a Professor of theoretical physics working in a notoriously abstract, abstruse and just plain difficult field (quantum mechanics) that you may feel has nothing to do with your daily life - but you would be wrong if you think that. I know this because you simply would not be reading this without humanity having grasped the theory of quantum mechanics. Quantum mechanics underpins all of solid-state electronics - everything that makes modern computers, phones and the world wide web function would not be possible without it. You would not be reading this without the understanding of the world Dirac made such enormous contributions to. Heard of anti-matter? Dirac predicted its existence. Dirac's work underlies all our fundamental theories of how matter behaves; ""particle physics"", ""the Standard Model"", ""Quantum Field Theory"", whatever labels you might have heard it given, it is extra-ordinary the extent to which our current approaches to it relies on the work of Dirac. Quantum Mechanics has had more effect on modern society than any physical theory since the classical electromagnetism of the 19th Century that allowed for the distribution of power and lighting by electricity. Dirac has had more practical influence than any other 20th Century scientist - in my view he beats Einstein by a distance in this regard, despite Einstein's own contributions to the quantum revolution and the ever increasing importance of General Relativity to our daily lives. (Your car satnav couldn't work without GR).Having mentioned Einstein leads me to why I'm reading about Dirac: if you've been paying attention to my reviews of late you will have noticed that I am retrospectively trying to determine whether Darwin, Einstein and Dirac were autistic, in preparation for a talk I am giving in July about the influence of autism on science and society. I concluded that both Darwin and Einstein had some form of autism. I have also concluded that Dirac was autistic. The evidence is overwhelming, even stronger than is the case for Einstein, which I found very compelling. The evidence in Darwin's case is weaker, but for me ultimately convincing. Now consider the impact those three people have had on the contemporary educated person's life, society and world-view. That's what autism has done.Farmelo devotes a chapter towards the end of this book to the theory that Dirac was autistic. I caution readers about this chapter. It is heavily influenced by the views of two people who have each contributed to hugely inaccurate public misconceptions of what autism is and how autistic people think: Simon Baron Cohen and Temple Grandin.Taking Baron Cohen first: he not only perpetuates the utterly false notion that autistic people lack empathy but whilst doing so re-enforces negative stereotypes about sex and gender using arguments and deceptions that don't so much break scientific ethics as atomise them. Temple Grandin, herself autistic, has repeatedly made the mistake of assuming that all autistic minds work in exactly the same way. Most famously, she assumed that, because she is a visual thinker, all autistic people must be visual thinkers and that this is a distinguishing feature, separating neurotypicals from autistic folk. When a tsunami of evidence that, to the contrary, not all autistic people think that way and a lot of neurotypical people do think visually crashed down upon her, she graciously accepted her error - but the misconception persists in the public mind and she's made similar errors about autistic thinking based on exactly the same false principle that if she's autistic and thinks in a particular way, all autistic people must do so.Farmelo's chapter also perpetuates the notion that autistic people are emotionless; nothing could be further from the truth. The consensus view is that a fundamental aspect of autism is the inability to regulate emotion. This explains, for example, the tendency for autistic people to have ""meltdowns"" which are clearly an expression of extreme emotion.Overall, then, this thoroughly researched biography is flawed by a lack of truly rigorous honesty, without actually outright falsifying anything, and a foray into psychological theory which is superficial and perpetuates numerous fallacious negative stereotypes about autism. This is a great shame because Dirac and the reading public deserve better."
8,0465018270,http://goodreads.com/user/show/53179837-george,5,"Paul Dirac, the man Oppenheimer described as a Theoreticians Theoretician, was one of the key figures in quantum physics. Considering just how reserved Dirac was it it impressive that the author managed to write 500+ page book about him. Of course because of this, his story is mostly told through his ground braking work on quantum mechanics and through his friends and colleagues, and their reactions to his cold exterior (a lot of amusing anecdotes here). He only spoke when he knew exactly what he was going to say and with such clarity that more than a few words were often unnecessary. His need for clarity and mathematical beauty is best shown with his colleagues reaction upon receiving his work: ""as if they were already finished marble statues that descended from the heavens."" Also his textbook on Quantum mechanics that he wrote in the 30s is admired and in print still to this day. Unfortunately his need for mathematical beauty has stifled him in his later life, that he ended up just like Einstein in that they both couldn't except new developments in physics, but were humored because of their stature. An finally, in the later chapters the author discussed in good taste the elephant in the room considering Diracs behavior and emotional coldness, meaning his very probable autism. He believed that beside his tragic childhood this also had to be mentioned in order to clearly understand this man, but he also clarified that we can never be absolutely sure of this. "
9,0465018270,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2899477-bryan-higgs,5,"I enjoyed this book even more than I had expected to. Some background: I studied Physics up to the Ph.D. level (experimental elementary particle physics), and then left the field to pursue a career in computing. However, I retained an interest in Physics which became reactivated when I retired. As a physics student, my hero was Richard Feynman (I highly recommend ""Genius"", James Gleick's biography of Feynman) who was a very colorful character indeed. However, being British, I was naturally inclined towards British physicists, and there was no more esteemed British theoretical physicist than Paul Dirac, who won the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1933 (together with Erwin Schroedinger), and at the time was the youngest person ever to have won that prize. I still have a copy of Dirac's classic ""Principles of Quantum Mechanics"" on my bookshelf.But I knew that Paul Dirac was a ""strange bird"", and that his father was a control freak who seriously damaged his son's mental state during his formative years. However, I didn't really know the details. This book furnishes those details.Not only does the book explain much of Dirac's history and mental and emotional makeup (as far as one can with a man who was as seriously laconic as Dirac was), but it also describes in some detail much of the historical activities that were on-going during his life -- the rise of Hitler, Stalin, the Soviet Union, McCarthyism and the Manhattan project in the US, and more. The historical perspective is particularly rich and detailed. While the science is mentioned, it is by no means necessary to have a scientific understanding of what Dirac (and others) did to become such major figures. I don't believe there is a single equation in the book.The author does an exceptional job of trying to capture what Dirac was all about -- a very difficult thing to accomplish given Dirac's lack of responsiveness. The author has obviously spent a lot of time researching the man, and has talked to seemingly all the major characters who were still alive during the time of his research. The size of the notes section, the size of the references section, and the size of the index show how much!Some have taken issue with the author's discussion of whether Dirac was autistic or not (as has been suggested of other major scientific figures such as Newton and Einstein). I felt that the chapter that discusses that possibility was presented in a very fair way: evidence was discussed, and alternative ideas were included. Any true scientist (the author is a trained physicist) would do it that way, and would clearly state what his/her beliefs were, as opposed to other hypotheses. That's really what science is all about.I only have some minor criticisms of the book, which are merely to do with its production and organization:1) The book has no real Table of Contents -- there is one, but it's basically useless. It would be much better if one could use the TOC to find a particular chapter by name.2) Each chapter has a 'name' (mostly related to a period of time), but the chapter title page does not specify a name, merely a chapter number. This makes things harder to find, especially given the lack of a true TOC.3) There are voluminous notes on every page, and I found myself keeping on finger in the Notes section (towards the end of the book), in order to read whether a note was interesting or otherwise. Unfortunately, most notes consisted of short references to sources: books, papers, people, some of which referred to the References section, while other notes were more interesting and added useful information to what was being discussed on the page. A much better organization would have been to place the notes relating merely to sources in the notes section at the end of the book, while placing the other notes containing additional, interesting and relevant information as footnotes on the same page. That way, I could have avoided keeping that extra finger in the notes section, and avoided wasting time looking at abstract source references I didn't care about.All in all, however, this is an extremely good book. I recommend it highly!"

11,0465018270,http://goodreads.com/user/show/140760-daniel,4,"Here is a grand, categorical statement for you: The quantum mechanics revolution of the early 20th century is the greatest achievement of the human mind to date. I will admit to some bias here, since I'm a physicist. But really, think about it. Over the span of something like 50 years, a group of very smart human beings figured out some fundamental, non-obvious truths about how the universe works. Energy quantization? The probabilistic behavior of subatomic particles? The Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle? Relativity? These sound like things a crazy person at a bus stop would tell you. Try and imagine how you would come up with any of these ideas on your own. And then try and imagine how you would go about proving them. Now, of course, you can't go a day without benefiting from these insane, impossibly correct ideas. For example: you're reading this review on a computer, which is made up of lots of tiny electronic components that simply wouldn't exist without a clear understanding of quantum mechanics. And the general theory of relativity is what makes your GPS so accurate. But beyond the practical applications, you could argue that furthering our understanding of the world around us is one of the best and noblest things a human being can do.Fine, so quantum mechanics is a monumental achievements of human understanding. Well, Paul Dirac was one of the most talented, successful theorists of the quantum mechanics revolution. He's what they call a ""theorist's theorist"". Dirac understood quantum mechanics so well that Einstein regularly used Dirac's textbook as a reference. Dirac understood quantum mechanics so well that he was able to predict the existence of antimatter. Dirac understood quantum mechanics so well that quantum mechanics would call Dirac on the weekends, asking for advice about its love life. If quantum mechanics is the greatest achievement of the human mind, and if Paul Dirac is one of the superstars of the quantum mechanics revolution, then you might as well read a book about Paul Dirac. To appreciate one of the best, most important things any human being has ever done? Yes?A question, then. Is Graham Farmelo's ""The Strangest Man"" that book? My answer is a resounding ""yeah, probably"".It's a biography, written for a general audience. As such, it deals a whole lot with Dirac The Man. Which is great. And interesting. And very well researched and written - Farmelo is a very good writer. But did you notice how I just spent 4+ paragraphs talking rhapsodically about the importance of the ideas involved in quantum mechanics? Since this is a popular biography and not a physics text, the overwhelming weight of this book is spent on talking about who Dirac was, what he was like, what his marriage was like, etc. If you're looking for an exhaustive treatment of Dirac's contribution to physics, this is not your book. Being a physicist, I was a little disappointed on that score. On the other hand, if you really want to understand that stuff, you might as well read his primary source material. And if you're not inclined in that direction, this book is the one you want.And listen, there's a lot of good stuff in here. In addition to being one of the smartest people ever, Dirac was a Grade A Weirdo. (I say this with a heart full of love.) Leaving aside your noble intentions to better understand a triumph of the human mind, you could read this book just to read about the life of a very unusual person. (Q.v. the title of this book.) Paul Dirac is the embodiment of the scientist stereotype - a frightfully smart person who is not great at normal, day-to-day interpersonal stuff. Here's an example from page 164:It is easy to imagine Dirac at one of these evening balls, sitting at a table and gazing quizzically at Heisenberg as he jived on the dance floor. Heisenberg long remembered being asked by Dirac, 'Why do you dance?' After Heisenberg replied, reasonably enough, 'When there are nice girls it is a pleasure to dance,' Dirac looked thoughtful. After about five minutes of silence, he said, 'Heisenberg, how do you know beforehand that the girls are nice?'In fact, there's quite a lot in this book that would make for a solid Hollywood-style biopic. There's the humor of Dirac's weirdness, the pathos of his upbringing by some not-great parents, his nonstandard but functional marriage, and the triumph and validation of his Nobel Prize. You'll laugh, you'll cry, you'll eat all your popcorn in the first ten minutes. Really and truly, the story of Dirac's life is a good story. Which brings me to my only really substantive criticism of this book. Towards the end, I started to feel like Farmelo focused a bit too much on the narrative arc of Dirac's life: difficult upbringing -> brilliant student -> iconoclastic physicist -> Nobel Laureate -> late-career productivity slump -> sad old guy whose friends are old. Without a better, deeper description of Dirac's work, you have no compass with which to navigate this narrative. You just have to follow Farmelo's lead. And since Farmelo is so focused on a (kind of simplistic) narrative arc, there's an inevitability to the end of the book. And in the end of the book, Dirac is old and sad and not very productive. I ended up feeling pretty melancholy during the last 50 pages or so. It's a great story, but it's missing an important dimension.Yes, absolutely, read this book. Read it to appreciate the people who laid the foundation of quantum mechanics. Read it to enjoy a good story about a thoroughly unique individual. Read it and just keep in mind that the most important dimension - his work - is something you'll have to read elsewhere. "
12,0465018270,http://goodreads.com/user/show/12541461-betseak,4,"This biography provides vivid insights not only into the life and personality of the Nobel-prize co-winner P.A.M. Dirac, an intriguing 'hybrid' of an electrical engineer, pure mathematician and physicist, but also into the historic background of the era and the competitive atmosphere of the academic centres of the times (Cambridge, Göttingen, Copenhagen, Princeton). After reading Quantum: Einstein, Bohr and the Great Debate About the Nature of Reality, I was interested to find out why Dirac seemed to be in shadows in the Einstein vs Bohr debate. Through a well-written, chronological story of Dirac's life, his familial and social environment and his personal and scientific development and decline, the author succeeded to shine a light on this brilliant and intriguing man who preferred thinking to speaking and was 'quite incapable of pretending to think anything that he did not really think'. Dirac's scientific achievements were incorporated into the story line in a very readable and engaging way that reads like a scientific mystery novel interspersed with 'Dirac' anecdotes. To my regret, the final chapters of this scientific mystery left me puzzled and a little disappointed because the assumption that Dirac suffered of Asperger's syndrome was based on unreliable sources (two Dirac's colleagues who refused to be quoted) and because the author's assumptions of Dirac's scientific approach and contributions were unconvincing, being partly inconsistent and partly insufficiently-well supported. Consequently, the book left me with a number of questions. For instance, I would like I have understood why the delta function and the prediction of positron are associated with Dirac's name though the first who had invented the delta function appears to have been the French mathematician Joseph Fourier in 1822 and it seems it was Einstein who had suggested the existence of a positive electron in 1925, some six years before Dirac’s prediction. I would also really like to have understood what Dirac implied by the 'beautiful' mathematics, apart from the fact that he did not like 'renormalisation' (whatever it is), what it is exactly that made the author assume Dirac would have liked the 'beautiful' mathematics of the modern string theory and, especially, why Feynman was so impressed with the Dirac's 'little paper' on QM in which Dirac “had cryptically remarked that a critical quantum quantity is ‘analogous’ to its classical counterpart, but Feynman believed that the correct phrase was ‘proportional to’ ” and wanted to know what Dirac meant. (view spoiler)[Feynman described his problem to Dirac and came to the crunch:FEYNMAN: Did you know that they were proportional? DIRAC: Are they? FEYNMAN: Yes they are. DIRAC: That’s interesting. Dirac then got up and walked away. Feynman subsequently became famous for his new version of quantum mechanics but thought the credit was undeserved. The more closely he looked at the ‘little paper’, the more he realised that he had done nothing new. He later said, repeatedly, ‘I don’t know what all the fuss is about – Dirac did it all before me.’ (hide spoiler)]Obviously, Feynman did get it. But, dear Mr. Farmelo, I’m too far from being Feynman!"
13,0465018270,http://goodreads.com/user/show/23100707-jean,5,"This is one of the best books in terms of detail and insight into the brilliant character of Paul Dirac 1902-1984. Graham Farmelo, a British Physicist, has obviously done in-depth research, and I understand he had access to many of Dirac’s personal papers. The book won the 2009 Costa book award. The book is less a scientific biography than other books on Dirac, it emphasizes more the development of Dirac’s personality and the story of his relationship with his relations and colleagues. I learned a lot about Dirac, including his work on the atomic bomb during World War II. Dirac is responsible for several of the great breakthrough in 20th century physics and mathematics. He found the fundamental insight into quantum mechanics and remains the basic understanding even today. His textbook on Quantum Mechanics remains a rigorously clear explanation of the fundamental idea of quantum theory. He also developed the Dirac equation which is the basis of particle physics. He is known for developing quantum field theory, quantum electrodynamics and the understanding the role of magnetic monopoles in electromagnetism. Dirac was the youngest theoretician to receive the Nobel Prize in Physics (1933). He also won the Max Planck Medal and the Copley Medal. He was the Lucasian Professor of mathematics at Cambridge University. The chair is now held by Stephen Hawking. Dirac’s work was so advanced we are only just beginning to prove and use his work. I read this as an audio download from Audible. B. J. Harrison did an excellent job narrating this long book."
14,0465018270,http://goodreads.com/user/show/68472943-jashan-singhal,4,"The book progressed just like Dirac's career. High and then a steady low. Farmelo has made a great attempt in making the readers aware of the life of one of the founding fathers of Quantum Mechanics, whose contributions I feel are over-looked when compared with Schrodinger or Heisenberg (although he shared the Nobel Prize with both of them). But as Dirac himself said, a theoretical physicist dies at the age of 40, same was the case with him more or less. The book got drab post Second World War, beyond which he hardly made any significant contributions to science. Nonetheless, the account of Dirac's formative years at Cambridge as a graduate student (also his most productive ones) when he laid the cornerstone of Quantum Mechanics along with Born, Schrodinger, Pascal, Heisenberg and Pauli was a motivating read specially for young grad students like me."
15,0465018270,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7372224-greg,3,"The Strangest Man: the hidden life of Paul Dirac, mystic of the atom Graham Farmelo -- a recent biography of one of the founding fathers of quantum mechanics, brilliant mathematical thinker and borderline-autistic recluse. He was there, and part of the conversation, at the time when Bohr and Einstein debated the philosophy of quantum mechanics and the math that underlies it - a case study in Davies book [Why Beliefs Matter]. Dirac was absolutely driven by belief. He had internalized a world view probably best characterized by John Stuart Mill, of a practical, evolutionary science, cumulative and refined by comparison with observation, subsuming prior accomplishments, but seeking ever wider applicability. He was foremost a mathematician, and ""discovered"" the relativistic generalization of quantum mechanics by geometric intuition, finding more joy in the beauty of his equations than in the subsequent validation when positrons were first observed and identified as the anti-matter particles predicted by his theory. A few choice bits from this book: after he had retired from Newton's chair of physics at Cambridge, and was being courted as a senior hire at Florida State University, in response to griping from faculty about spending scarce salary money on an old, pathologically quiet, and superannuated professor, his administrative defender asked in reply, ""if the English department had the opportunity to hire William Shakespeare, would you pass up the chance?"" Dirac's essentially Marxist views on religious beliefs were parodied by fellow physicist Pauli with the proclamation that ""There is no God, and Dirac is his prophet."" The technical content of this biography is gentle, and the personal insights and philosophical content generous. You might enjoy reading this."
16,0465018270,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4277032-d,4,"Excellent biography of one of the geniuses of quantum theory. It goes into great detail on his personal life and character as well as on his results and methods. A bit more scientific background on the results would have been most welcome tough. Like Einstein, Dirac believed that mathematical beauty trumps experimental results anytime. While that helped him in the first part of his career, it probably prevented him to achieve even more in his later years. Still, he would have been delighted by the current fad of string theory which is beautiful but has yet to predict anything that can be experimentally verified. "
17,0465018270,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5885099-angus-mcfarlane,4,"Paul Dirac was probably the most fruitful quantum physicist involved in the revolution of Born, Heisenberg, Schrodinger, Pauli etc., yet I barely recognised his name, let alone his achievements, before reading this. The title is certainly appropriate if unfortunate. Dirac was very peculiar in his deliberate withdrawn ness, becoming a little less so as he aged, and it seems that this was also related to his academic brilliance, whether through an underlying autism or extreme single minded ness. At times the personal interactions are humerous, especially the replies he gave to the woman who became his wife when she cola ones he didn't answer questions. Strangely, I felt that I could relate to this withdrawn nature, partly out of sympathetic reading perhaps, but also because there are times and circumstances where solitude and disengagement feels the more authentic response for me to take to the stress of 'people'. I suspect I'm not too unusual in this.This book is nicely balanced between the personal and technical aspects of Dirac's life, working through it chronologically as might be expected. The reduction in productivity typical,of many physicists after hitting 30 (apparently) is discussed. This was somewhat true for Dirac, but not enough to convince me it is not a perception that becomes reality, rather than something inevitable. Certainly, the effect can be quite severe, with some of Dirac's colleagues becoming depressed and ending their lives as a result.Overall, this book gives a personal insight into the nursery of quantum mechanics and arguably it's most significant contributor. Strange meets stranger. Not likely to be of wide interest beyond science book nerds and spouses seeking to learn about the strange ways of their scientist partners!"
18,0465018270,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3870575-sean,5,"This biography is a well constructed and complete narration of one of the greatest physicists to ever live. Paul Dirac is a perfect example of being just the right man for the job at just the right time in history. He was raised in an academic household by a hard taskmaster of a father who required nearly endless study for his children and stifled all social interactions. Though Dirac had said that the only person he ever truly ""loathed"" was his father, the tortuous upbringing caused him to be the introverted master of clear thought that he needed to be. Dirac was first entering college in the years of Einstein's ascendancy, a time of upheaval and intriguing insights into the true nature of the physical world. The general theory of relativity was the first topic which inspired Dirac to be a theoretical physicist. This timing then placed Dirac in a position to develop one of the most influential branches of physics ever: quantum theory. Having studied a bit of physics, I have heard of Dirac and seen many wonderfully elegant pieces of mathematical physics attributed to him. In contrast to the legend, by the time I was halfway through this book I was able to see Dirac as a human being whose work logically followed from what had been done before and was sometimes flawed. I always enjoy seeing the discoveries I have studied put into a context I can relate to. What really made Dirac head and shoulders above everyone else was his clarity of presentation and his dedication to mathematical beauty. While Feynman is one of the most interesting characters of physics, even he said, ""I'm no Dirac."""
19,0465018270,http://goodreads.com/user/show/83139-jennifer,5,"It wasn't until very near the end of this book that I finally identified the niggling something that had seemed strange throughout it. Most biographies are driven by emotional narrative. To put it in Myers-Briggs terms, they're F books. This book is clearly at T. But what could be more appropriate for the biography of a man so emotionally reserved that many who knew him later speculated that he might have been autistic?Unverified psychological speculation aside, The Strangest Man is the extremely well researched story of the life of Paul Dirac, one of the fathers of quantum mechanics, and arguably one of the most brilliant physicists of all time. His major contributions to science were made during a fascinating period in the world of physics, as well as in the world at large. Dirac's life is entwined with many of the legends of modern physics, all of whom were caught up to some degree in the rise of Hitler, WWII, and the Cold War. While the book seems to sag a little at the end, as Dirac approaches retirement and then moves with his wife to Florida, it is otherwise a fascinating glimpse into the birth of quantum mechanics, through the life of a man who was at once one of the pillars of the community and yet still an outsider. By all rights, the name Dirac should ring with equal weight to names like Einstein and Newton. This book illustrates both why that is and why it didn't happen.Recommended to those interested in modern physics and/or the lives of brilliant outsiders. "
20,0465018270,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1345046-todd-martin,4,"Paul Dirac was a Nobel Prize winning British physicist who made fundamental contributions to quantum mechanics and predicted the discovery of anti-matter. He was also a social misfit with the emotional depth of a carrot. His awkwardness and literal thought process drives many of the anecdotes strewn throughout “The Strangest Man” by Graham Farmelo. I won’t claim that the life of a physicist is terribly exciting, and Dirac’s was perhaps less interesting than most, but Farmelo expands his narrative to include both other physicists and the times in which they lived. The first half of the 20th century was a heady one for physics with Einstein’s theory of relativity and the development of quantum mechanics. It was also a time of world altering events featuring two world wars and the subsequent cold war that followed. Farmelo does a good job describing the times and despite the book's length it remains interesting throughout. With respect to Dirac’s bizarre behavior, Farmelo postulates that he suffered from a high functioning form of autism. This would certainly explain his introverted nature and inability to relate to people on an emotional level. Despite, or perhaps because of, this disability Dirac was able to approach quantum mechanics with a single minded focus relying on pure mathematics to thresh out the underlying physical reality of matter. Unfortunately, he was also the epitome of an ivory castle intellectual, caring more for the theory’s elegance than its correctness. "

In the book we learn about a boy who learned how to speak German (which he gave up speaking because of WWII), French (which he gave up speaking because of his upbringing) and Russian. He is also famous for lengthy and uncomfortable silences despite his fluency in multiple languages. We get to know how this boy went on to explain his insightful perspective on the universe with elegant mathematical equations and plain language.The periodic breakdown format of the book makes it less intimidating than it otherwise it would be. We are able to follow Dirac from his formatives years. We are allowed to speculate on his influences where it wasn’t explicitly stated. Farmelo does a fantastic job of glossing over many of his insights. In Dirac’s case this would be a deterrent for most lay people. He does this without cheapening the experience.This is a rich book that tells us how the science developed and brings out the excitement, anxiety, rivalry of scientific endeavor by looking at the life of one very strange but brilliant man."

Instead, it is a biography of Paul Dirac, a British born physicist, who didn’t seem overly strange to me. He may not have been socially normal as far as “normal” is depicted in society. Farmelo ties to define Dirac’s personality from childhood abuse when his father made him talk French during their dinner conversations. Farmelo, a physicist, is good in reporting on Dirac’s life, and about his contributions to atomic theory (which weren’t as sexy as Einstein’s, but important) and to the building of the atomic bomb, but is not convincing in his psychological analysis of Dirac. In one of the closing chapters he examines whether or not Dirac could have been autistic. I felt like he wasn’t well enough informed about autism to even be trying to make that judgment. Besides, autism seems to be a catch all for many symptoms of unsociable traits. I closed the book thinking, Dirac seemed to be a very intelligent man who didn’t like to talk."

27,0465018270,http://goodreads.com/user/show/73419547-doctor-moss,4,"The title of Farmelo’s book comes from Niels Bohr, who told a colleague that Paul Dirac was “the strangest man” to ever visit Bohr’s institute in Cophenhagen. Bohr’s comments related not only to Dirac’s unusually spare social interaction style but also to his iconoclastic style of thinking. In a field that is historically dense with collaborations and exchanges of findings and methods, Dirac was an extreme outlier, as someone who rarely talked at all, infamous for one word responses even in conversations with colleagues about scientific matters.Farmelo blends the story of Dirac’s odd personality and quirky behavior with the story of Dirac the physicist. After all, his “strangeness” is a dominant attribute of both his personal life and his scientific activity.He starts with Dirac’s relationship to his father, Charles Dirac. Charles Dirac was a strict, controlling father. He enforced a hard work ethic, with little social life for Paul, his brother Felix, and his sister, Betty. Felix committed suicide relatively early in his adult life, apparently over frustration with his lack of achievement. Betty clung to the family, looking after her father and mother, Flo, until marrying in her 30s. Paul never lost his resentment over his father’s tight controlling hand. Later in life, he would voice that resentment, sometimes surprising friends and even bare acquaintances, breaking his regular silence with a diatribe against his father’s treatment of him. As he grew older, and especially in his marriage to the Hungarian sister of Eugene Wigner, Manci, he seems to have freed himself to some degree, finding that he could enjoy hobbies like mountain-climbing and swimming. But he maintained an odd, withdrawn character throughout his life, customarily sitting in silence in both scientific discussions and in social situations.Paul’s mother, Flo, was also seemingly hemmed in by Charles’ strong hand. Their marriage deteriorated but ended only with Charles’ death, and long before that she came to look to Paul as her primary emotional support. The combination of a controlling father and a clinging mother put Paul in a kind of vice, no doubt partially responsible for his odd personality.Then there is Dirac the scientist. He was a mathematical physicist, a theorist of a pure kind. And it is that mathematical purity that may be his most profound legacy as a scientist. It is certainly a central theme of Farmelo’s account of his life.Dirac was propelled by mathematics. With a background also in engineering, he certainly was attentive to the need to tie mathematical speculation back to verifiable observations, but it was the math that moved his thoughts.Farmelo quotes Dirac — “The most powerful method of advance that can be suggested at present is to employ all the resources of pure mathematics to attempts to perfect and generalise the mathematical formalism that forms the existing basis of theoretical physics, and after each such success in this direction, to try to interpret the new mathematical features in terms of physical entities . . . “It would be hard to say that Dirac was the first physicist to take his lead from pure, abstract mathematics — after all, the debate over the role of abstract theory vs. experiment and observation goes back to Descartes and Bacon. But it would be just as hard to find a stronger proponent for going wherever the math leads, and then picking up the thread of reality in its wake. In fact, maybe Dirac’s best known original contribution — anti-matter — was a mathematical construction. It took significant time before his speculations could be confirmed in observations of cosmic rays at Caltech and then by his colleagues at the Cavendish Labs at Cambridge. Farmelo stresses Dirac’s insistence that good theory in physics meet a criterion of “mathematical beauty”. “Beauty"" here is somewhat ironically undefined, for someone as meticulous as Dirac in determining the meaning of any theoretical terms. But it relates essentially to simplicity and universality, traceable back to Dirac’s early reading of John Stuart Mill’s A System of Logic — something that seemed to have strongly influenced him throughout his career.Another quote serves to state how important the role of beauty in theory was for Dirac — “It is more important to have beauty in one’s equations than to have them fit experiment.” Despite his atheism, it’s hard not to attribute a kind of faith to Dirac, that the universe itself is “beautiful”, that it be describable in simple, clear terms, because the universe just is a mathematical entity.Despite Dirac’s eccentric social behavior he was at the center of the quantum revolution in physics. I realized I had never appreciated how many theoretical contributions he made, not only in new, original concepts, like antimatter, but also in pushing existing theory to meet his mathematical standards. He worked directly with all of the leading physicists of his time, a regular visitor to the labs of Bohr in Copenhagen and Born and Heisenberg in Gottingen, as well as circulating among the theoretical and experimental physics groups at his own Cambridge. Later in life, he was a frequent visitor to the Institute for Advanced Study, where Einstein and others sought him for a permanent position. Farmelo’s writing is easy, relatively non-technical, even though this is definitely not a “page-turner”. He has the physics credentials to tell us the science side, but it is as much personal biography as intellectual biography. You won’t find a lot of equations, or even complex technical discussion. Yet I think Farmelo did a good job of going to the depth necessary to make it clear that such concepts as anti-matter evolved, in Dirac’s thought, through a compelling mathematical path rather than as blue sky speculations. This might be the greatest strength of his writing."
28,0465018270,http://goodreads.com/user/show/63942723-claire,4,"Out of all the physicists who developed quantum mechanics and quantum field theory, Dirac is my favorite. He had a unique intuition grounded in mathematics — especially projective geometry — and a sense of beauty applied to equations. The biography by Farmelo does a great job evoking Dirac's approach to physics, the thinking behind his many successes (the Dirac equation, the prediction of positrons, showing that magnetic monopoles result in the quantization of electric charge, the idea of the path integral before Feynman, a precursor to the use of strings as fundamental objects, and beyond) as well as some of the ways his intuition misled him. The writing is at times clunky and speculative and I almost put the book down given what felt like too long an introduction about Dirac’s childhood, but I recommend persevering since the content is overall quite interesting. For example, I loved the chance to follow the history of physics in broad strokes starting from the atomic theory of Bohr that preceded quantum mechanics, all the way up through the atomic bomb and the development of quantum field theory and even string theory. The book gave a picture of the interconnectedness of many of these developments, and left me eager to read more detailed accounts focusing on each era of discovery separately.It was intriguing to learn how certain aspects of the way we approach physics have been directly inherited from the past, as well as the many ways these ideas have evolved. For example, Farmelo touches on the influence of John Stuart Mill on the conception of “beauty” as a guiding principle of science around the time Dirac came to Cambridge. Additionally, it was interesting to see how much pushback there was against having theorists predict particles (e.g. positrons by Dirac, neutrinos by Pauli) since up to that point, it simply wasn’t how science was done. Nowadays, it is quite uncontroversial that experimentalists often work to verify the predictions of particle theorists, yet there are other areas where new ideas are objected to on the grounds that they diverge from the way science has been done in the past.Dirac was an interesting character in addition to a brilliant physicist, and Farmelo includes a number of endearing anecdotes about him (for example, the way Dirac carefully measured the span of his children’s cat’s whiskers in order to build a trap door that was optimally comfortable for it).The book ends with some speculation about Dirac being autistic. Farmelo is careful to qualify that it is risky to diagnose someone after their death in general, and especially as a non-expert. My main objection is that the chapter relies on some outdated ideas about autism. For example, Farmelo emphasizes that most people diagnosed with autism are men. While this is certainly true, there is growing evidence that autism manifests slightly differently in women and gender non-conforming people, whether due to differences in socialization or for some other reason. Since the diagnostic criteria are skewed towards the way autism appears in men, others may be under-diagnosed which could account for a portion of the discrepancy. Farmelo doesn’t just mention the gender skew but goes on to speculate that this might explain why there are so fewer women in physics than men, which made me cringe. This is sloppy, well outside his area of expertise, and most importantly wholly unnecessary to the argument he is trying to make (that Dirac may have been autistic) which is already somewhat speculative.Added note: I also agree with another reviewer who commented on the danger of spreading the misconception that autistic people lack empathy, or that all autistic people are alike."
29,0465018270,http://goodreads.com/user/show/35417328-rafid-al-humaimidi,5,"I really loved this book. I always wanted to know more about the life of Paul Dirac and so I was very keen to read this book when I knew about it. I wasn't disappointed, as it was a very detailed biography of this amazing physicist. The writing style of Farmelo is also amazing. I found myself very committed to reading this book until I finished it, and by that time I felt sad that I reached the end. At some point, I might read this book again."
30,0465018270,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7375383-satam-choudhury,5,"Naipaul once said that writers should write sympathetically. Having read a couple of biographies, it occurs to that modern biographers have taken this injunction rather seriously. Hence, the absurdly flattering accounts of some of the most eminent men.Farmelo's book is a noted exception. I would not call it 'pathbreaking', given my intellectual limitations. But this is a fascinating account of one of the most enigmatic geniuses of our time. And written with caution. Nevertheless, Dirac would continue to remain an abiding mystery for all of us but Farmelo makes a serious endeavour not only to enlighten us on the certain facets of his personality, his idiosyncrasies but also to delineate the assortment of influences that shaped this promising Electrical Engineer into one of the finest theoreticians the world has known. All the while, Farmelo never fails to cite Dirac's follies, the disastrous pre-dinner oration at the Nobel Prize ceremony for instance. What we have, as a consequence, is a balanced and flesh-and-blood portrait of an eccentric, a conservative theoretician who finds practicals demeaning, a reluctant socialist who makes himself a butt of ridicule when he seeks to apply his physical theories to economics, a self-possessed fellow given to infrequent outbursts, yet a genius, with an unmatched mathematical prowess and theoretical rigour perhaps comparable only to Newton, who gave us a peek into the world of the incredible, the inexplicable and shaped our understanding of the world unseen and unknown."
31,0465018270,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7238440-piotr,5,"An exceptionally well-written biography of one of the greatest physicists, Paul Dirac, one of the creators of quantum mechanics. It's a rare combination of a page-turner and a book written with the English reserve.Besides the history of an important part of physics, and its historical background (including the rise of Nazism and Stalinism, WWII and later - Cold War) one can clearly see that science is not a dry product, polished from its very beginning. It's a process, created by various people, of different personalities and views, having simple and genial ideas, making blunt mistakes, and having life besides science (even Dirac).Also, it shows science (here: physics) as a sociological process, with its centre shifting from Cambridge (centred around E. Rutherford), Copenhagen and Gottingen to Princeton, Moscow, ...When it comes to Dirac himself - it's a moving example of a person, who may look as cold and devoid of emotions, but in fact is a loving father, loyal friend (defending the imprisoned (P. Kapitza), and excluded (W. Heisenberg)) and a responsible man. And one, who had never became reconciled with his brother's suicide.The biography leaves a little doubt when it comes to Paul Dirac's autism, or Asperger's syndrome. While introversion, withdrawal, reticence, and persistence may stem from different causes, being literal-minded, characteristic response to stimuli and poor insight into other minds are, IMHO, hard to interpret in any other way."
32,0465018270,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2579781-paul,3,"This was a pretty in-depth biography of Paul Dirac that, I think, gives a good sense of who he was and what his personality was like. I think the stuff about how horrible his father was is probably way overblown; the big example of his cruelty was that he forced his kids to speak French to him - which is actually standard advice for ensuring that your children are bilingual. Reading between the lines, it seems like the bad relationship between Dirac's parents influenced his opinion of his relationship with his father.That said, I think the in-depth discussion of Dirac's personality (clearly leading up to the suggestion that he was on the autism spectrum, which seems pretty obvious in a ""historical diagnosis"" sense from the fact that he didn't realize parents were supposed to care about their children until he was in his 20s) distracted from my understanding of what is probably the more important part of his life (for me) - his career. If you look at Wikipedia's list of things named after Paul Dirac, there's a huge list of stuff, most of which seems barely touched-upon in the book. In the end, his personal life was not nearly as interesting as his professional life, though I understand that a professional biography of Dirac would basically be a textbook on quantum mechanics, still I think I would have liked that. For what it was, it was thorough and well-written.3.5 of 5 stars"
33,0465018270,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1717479-terry,4,"Paul Dirac is part of a cadre of theoreticians for whom I have immense respect and admiration despite knowing nothing of the meat of their work. I can follow a Feynmann diagram but the Dirac  is almost always beyond me. Dirac's mental faculties exceed mine probably by orders of magnitude and his ability to wield mathematics is vast and humbling.Graham Farmelo had quite a task for himself and he some-what met it. I found Paul Dirac fascinating from the start and generally love even mediocre science biographies so his was an easy task. I do have a few criticisms:1) The cover-art of Dirac holding a model airplane is never explained2) The pen-ultimate chapter reviewing Dirac as a person with autism should not have been included in the text proper but should have been an afterword or somewhere outside the main text.3) The final chapter ""Legacy"" should have been expanded4) More of Dirac's theoretical creations and hypotheses that turned our wrong should have been included.5) Many of the end notes should have been footnotes as they added considerably to the narrative and flipping back and forth was annoying.6) There are vastly too many references to John Stuart Mills' theory of science and the opening talking about the history of science is never closed at the end."

I could swear I've now read three, but the only other one I can think of is the 'autobiography' of the former Arsenal midfielder Paul Merson, which I read when I was about twelve. Nevertheless, even with that lack of experience I am confident in saying that The Strangest Man is an excellent one. Dirac was not the most forthcoming individual, and yet Farmelo manages to paint a convincing portrait that seems fully-fleshed, which makes you think of Dirac as a friend, and which is as readable as an adventure novel. I can't say that I came away with a much better grasp of the science, but then there would probably be far too much to explain while keeping the book appealing to a mass audience and workable as a biography rather than a textbook (or several). I do however have a much better grasp of the parts of the key players in the development of quantum mechanics, in particular of course the part of the endearing Mr Dirac. Highly recommended.My favourite part was the recounting of Dirac's response to the advances of his future wife Manci, when she was then but a fledgling pen-friend. When Manci asked Dirac why he didn't answer all of the questions in her letters, he responded with a numbered grid of those questions with his answers alongside, including:6. Q: Were there any feelings for me? A: Yes, some."
35,0465018270,http://goodreads.com/user/show/26300850-jennifer-brickner,5,I decided to read this biography on my Kindle because he lived in Tallahassee (pictured in the book) in my town. I like to read books about those gifted in Physics like my son. I have to say that I stayed up late reading this book and was really swept away. I bought the paperback for my son to read and take to college. We went to see his marble statue at FSU at the Paul Dirac Science library (next to the Physics building) and went up to the fourth floor and saw pictures of his Nobel prize and other key moments in his life. His story is so relatable to what is happening in Physics today. He was really 75 years ahead of his time. I was especially fascinated by the interactions between Dirac and Albert Einstein. The fact that Einstein carried around a Quantum Physics book by Dirac and referred to it often just shows you what a great mind Dirac had. There were many great anecdotes about how they worked down the hall from each other and totally ignored each other. Love it!!!
36,0465018270,http://goodreads.com/user/show/37051585-geoffrey,4,"Fascinating read about one of the greatest scientists of the 20th century, considered by many to be the best physicist after Einstein. An interesting man. The writer tries to make a case that Dirac may have been autistic, but the argument is only half-hearted, although interesting. I did appreciate that the writer nuanced Dirac's contributions to science with his own often self-critical perceptions. He also succeeds in giving a sense of some of the complexities of scientific discoveries, and their often unfinished nature during the process - it is often only in hindsight that their full power is understood. On the down side, I felt that although the writer clearly wanted to present a nuanced portrait of a complex man, he fell into the trap of assuming that a person is primarily one thing, one identity. I think Dirac escaped such attempts to pin him down. However, overall a very good book about someone who made huge contributions to 20th century physics."

However, in my opinion, there are too many stories about private life of Paul Dirac and his acquaintances, these stories seem to me too much like ""yellow press"" stories. I really did not want to know the causes of deaths of all these great physicists and to read about their relationships with wives and non-wives. I wanted to know how the quantum mechanics was developed! But I found the explanations of the physical processes too rough and often not providing an insight to the idea behind.It is written in Chapter 30 (the chapter with reasoning why Paul Dirac is presumably autistic): ""Besides, it is not easy to psychoanalyse someone who is dead"".

Farmelo conveys facts and tries to explore motivation, including a chapter exploring the possibility that Dirac was autistic. From my other reading and experience, it does seem likely that Dirac had Asperger's Syndrome. He was a quirky focused man with no gift for small talk. My favorite biographies allow me to almost get inside the head of the subject. This book doesn't do that, but it may well be the nature of Paul Dirac rather than Farmelo's writing. "

This book can be enjoyed by all. It is not a book FOR physicists, rather a book about a physicist. One of the best books I've read this year."

47,0465018270,http://goodreads.com/user/show/11116317-kevin-orrman-rossiter,5,"Physicists of note can sometimes seem quintessentially different to even ordinary scientists, whether it is the other-worldliness of Einstein, the wise-cracking genius of Feynman, the bizarre existence of Hawking, or the world changing works of Newton. P. A. M. Dirac is right at home in this elite company. One of the youngest physics Nobel prize winners, holder of the Lucasian Chair in Mathematics at Cambridge, renowned for developing the relativistic theory of quantum mechanics, and predicting the existence of antimatter, Dirac’s scientific legacy is comfortably in the company of Newton and Einstein. Dirac though is almost unknown outside of the world of the physics community, although he did decline a knighthood in 1953 and did accept membership of the Order of Merit in 1973, making a biography of him, a strange and fascinating tale.It is the how of Dirac’s scientific output, that occupies Graham Farmelo’s The strangest man. Presented historically it covers: Dirac’s childhood, the dysfunctional and divergent relationships with his mother and father, his early schooling and first degree in Engineering from Bristol, his move to Cambridge University and his prodigious scientific output there, his views on Russia and communism, his marriage, his latter output and twilight move to the Florida State University, after being bundled out of his Lucasian Chair at the statutory retirement age of sixty-seven. For those who want to delve more deeply into the scientific contributions of Dirac, Helge Kragh’s Dirac: a scientific biography, is an excellent technical complement to Farmelo.There were two intertwined, characteristics of Dirac that made him standout in any company. The first was his almost silence, his sparse use of words [quote the measure of a Dirac] and his extreme shyness of people and publicity; the second was his unique view of what made a problem worthwhile to spend his talent on, and then how he approached this science.The former of these Farmelo provides adequate and insightful examples and discussion. His wife of 47 years, Manci, described Dirac as “an emotional cripple”, whereas his closest intimates Neils Bohr and Paul Kapitza both saw a sensitive side that was only visible in their close and supportive home lives. Dirac himself blamed much of this on his dysfunctional relationship with his father, Charles Adrien Ladislas Dirac. According to Paul, his father singled him out for special treatment - forced to dine alone, separate from his mother and his two siblings, with his father who spoke, and only allowed, perfect French to be spoken at the meal-times. His reticence and fumbling speech was rewarded with verbal and physical rebukes “his best defence against the unpleasantness and hostility he perceived all around him was to retreat into the bunker of his imagination.” At the same time Dirac was forced to eat all the food on his plate, despite being plagued all his life with poor digestion, as an adult eating plainly and sparingly. Dirac recounts times where he vomited at meals as a child, sick from the food and worry about his imperfect French.Paul’s older brother Felix was forced by his father, Charles, to study Electrical Engineering at Bristol rather than his passion, Medicine. Both an average student (awarded third class honours) and subsequent Engineer, he was unfairly compared by his father to his brilliant younger brother. This disparity between the brother’s academic talents was stark. Lacking in self-worth, Felix was jealous and rowed often with Paul. Paul was famous later for his lack of tact and absence of any empathy, it is unlikely that this was any different as a young man. Farmelo explores this aspect tactfully in a short late chapter on the possibility of Paul Dirac being autistic. No conclusion could be reached due to lack of substantive evidence. This exploration by Farmelo is a good indication of the depth and honesty that is pursued in this biography. The tragic end to Felix’s short life is stark; on March 4, 1925 he committed suicide, leaving no final message. It was four days before Paul was notified in Cambridge of Felix’s death by letter from an Aunt. There are no documentary evidence of his reactions to the death.In 1925, nearing the completion of his graduate work at Cambridge, Dirac was described as “a natural researcher” and “quite the most original student I have met in the subject of mathematical physics” and having secured a three-year Exhibition of 1851 Scholarship was eager to prove his worth on the international stage. Inspired on by a comment in a just published paper by Heisenberg, Dirac rewrote the fundamental equations of quantum mechanics building a mathematical bridge between Newtonian mechanics and the new quantum theory. Dirac’s paper, when published in the Proceeding of the Royal Society, jolted the physics community.Farmelo brings to life these instances, the Illuminating history and sociology, the ‘how’, of science, with great nuance and liveliness. An example of this is the ‘how’ Dirac made his name and the events leading to him ‘jolting the physics community’. Ralph Fowler, Dirac’s PhD supervisor, recently elected Fellow of the Royal Society submitted Dirac’s manuscript for publication in the confident expectation that it would be published without delay. Dirac was disconcerted to find that other European physicists, Max Born in particular, had arrived to the same conclusions before him. Similarly in mid-1926 when he explained the energy spectrum radiated by a black-body, Dirac found after publication that both Enrico Fermi and Pascual Jordan had independently derived the same results. Similarly when Dirac solved one the theoretician’s most pressing problems: the quantum version of Maxwell’s electromagnetism. He found out that an American physicist, John Slater, had independently reached similar results. Dirac’s new theory though ‘avoided the embarrassment of having to chose between the particle and wave descriptions [of light] and replaced the two sharply contrasting pictures with a single, unified theory.’During the 1927 Solvay conference, Bohr asked him what he was working on, his reply was greeted with ‘But Klein has already solved this problem’. Daunted by this for a few months Dirac then went on to solve the problem and in doing so made his mark on physics. His equation, united both special relativity and quantum mechanics, in doing so it predicted the spin and magnetic field measurement of the electron - the real electron so familiar to experimenters. At the same time the theory predicted the existence of electrons with negative energy. Dirac’s equation created a sensation when published, however for the next year unless someone could explain the meaning of the negative-energy electrons, the Dirac equation seemed doomed. Neither Bohr nor Pauli were convinced by Dirac’s “sea of negative-energy electrons” explanation.Since Heisenberg’s 1925 paper theorists had led experimentalist in setting the objectives in fundamental physics. Dirac argued most forcefully that the best way to make progress in physics was to seek ever-more-powerful mathematical foundations for fundamental theories. In 1931 Dirac had extended his work to predict the existence of the anti-proton and magnetic monopole in addition to the anti-electron. This latter prediction was vindicated in July 1932 when American Carl Anderson, unaware of Dirac’s theoretical work, recorded positively charged particles the same mass as the electron arising from cosmic ray collisions in his cloud-chamber detectors - antimatter had been ‘seen’ for the first time.The results were quickly ‘replicated’ by Patrick Blackett in the Cavendish Laboratory and the new particle named the positron by Anderson. It was only a few months before this that Dirac had been elected to the Lucasian Chair in Mathematics at Cambridge University. Two years before in 1930, Dirac had been elected to a Fellowship of the Royal Society. By the end of 1933 he, along with Edwin Schrodinger, would be awarded the Nobel prize in physics. P. A. M. Dirac had sensationally predicted an unknown type of reality solely by his aesthetic in pure theory, without any hint from data.The strangest man is an eminently readable biography. Farmelo has written it with an eye to readers who demand more from a biography than a gushing hagiography or a titillating expose of a private and eccentric individual. The work is well researched, with extensive, but not distracting, notes and bibliography; a boon for my own and no doubt others’, research. I find the the subtitle The hidden life of Paul Dirac, mystic of the atom, to be misleading and initially distracting. Though his quixotic views on the aesthetics of mathematics made him different to many of his peers, this subtitle suggests elements of Fritjof Capra; which Dirac certainly was not. The book deserves wide readership, never dull, it provides a fascinating glimpse of both a great modern scientist and how cutting-edge science is really achieved."
48,0465018270,http://goodreads.com/user/show/8614696-st-fu,3,"In our age of identity politics, my peeps would be the strange people. This is the story of one of us and based somewhat on my own experience, I'd like to give my theory of what contributed to his strangeness. It matches the data in this book and I find it beautiful which is Dirac's requirement for a good theory. Imagine that you are a young child and find the culture you're immersed in makes no sense. You don't know why people behave the way they do or why they are interested in what they pursue. You try to act as they do but since you're just going through the motions, no one is convinced. The rules you are forced to follow make even less sense. You give up communicating because you don't expect to be understood. You hide your reactions because they are criticized and condemned. You are seen as lacking empathy, but empathy requires an understanding of others that you don't have because so much of it is cultural yet it is imagined by others to be natural. You're drawn to the literal and to subjects like mathematics with rules that don't seem arbitrary and alien. Technical people are known to lack social skills but perhaps the cause and effect go in reverse. Those who can't grok people will find comfort in tech. Your interest and time studying science pays off as you develop skills while others mainly avoid it. Also, as an outsider, you approach problems in new untried ways. Your behavior seems strange to others but to you, it's all that you understand. No one seems to understand why you are the way you are--that is THEY lack empathy with you. What is wrong with your brain that the culture is difficult to adjust to? Sometimes you feel broken. Other times it feels like is that everyone else is broken; that the ability to absorb the culture requires belief in it and those who believe are deluded. Also, you are praised for your understanding which encourages you to persist. Sometimes, solving difficult problems is just a matter of having the confidence to not give up working on them.Seen this way, Dirac's behavior is adaptive rather than strange. Scientists look outward toward the world to find answers and not within to the experiences of the person which are also private and thus not the data of science. Farmelo thus thinks in terms of behavior and diagnosis, landing on autism spectrum disorder (despite Dirac's verbal fluency) though recognizing that understanding of this condition is in its infancy like particle physics was when Dirac was born. Later, you can see Dirac isn't sucked into the anti-communism craze that the ""normals"" who are quick to follow the culture are prey. Perhaps his lack of cultural understanding isn't always a negative. Didn't Einstein discover that what appears to be a fact turns out to vary with the circumstances of the observer?Recognizing that most of his readers lack the ability to understand modern physics, a condition that isn't diagnosed as a disease, Farmelo avoids giving too much detail about it. He tells us that Dirac favored using Hamiltonians and rejected renormalization. Curious about what these might mean I turned to the internet. I also looked at Dirac's books on relativity and quantum mechanics. My knowledge of these subjects isn't great (you can look at some of the related books I read in my Goodreads profile). As a teen, I'd read One, Two, Three...Infinity: Facts and Speculations of Science by George Gamow, who at the time I didn't realize was Russian and a scientist as well as one who wrote books for teens like me. All this I didn't learn until the current book where Gamow has a significant role. (In the audiobook, his name is pronounced on some occasions as rhyming with ""cow"" and other times rhyming with ""dove"". Also, Von Neuman's name gets pronounced as ""Newman"" and other times as ""Noyman"".) Although in my youth, I had studied both engineering drawing and projective geometry, subjects Farmelo says were an important influence, I still couldn't get too far in Dirac's writings. I did however get a clear understanding of his aesthetic. He approaches problems by looking for commonalities or invariants. He wants to see disparate phenomena as related to each other. He wants to adapt techniques used elsewhere to new uses. He designs notations to emphasize similarity and symmetry. This is a mathematician's idea of beauty which he shared with Einstein. From my perspective, valuing beauty over data in science does not qualify one as a mystic. I think Farmelo uses ""mystic"" almost as a slur. He seems to be trying to figure out how someone with the ""mystic""affliction got to discover such amazing things. He thought going over the data of Dirac's life would reveal it. In the end he settles on autism which is trendy these days. Perhaps I'm wrong about Farmelo's motivation here but my guess is as least as valid as some of his speculations about Dirac's inner life. He still managed to turn out a book worth reading."
49,0465018270,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7226831-josh-friedlander,4,"Dirac was famously a weird guy, as implied by the title. Only at the end of this book does Farmelo shift from telling-great-Dirac-stories mode (the tales are legion, and really are great) and consider whether he was some type of autistic, and maybe we really ought not to laugh at him. Like - and it hurts me to type this - a real life Sheldon from The Nerd Show, he was painfully literal, uninterested in small talk, and singlemindedly focused on physics and maths. Farmelo, a theoretical physics PhD and professional science populariser, gives a fairly light treatment of Dirac's physics work but is masterful in untangling the pathology of the expanded Dirac family. Dirac père was friendly to his son but treated his wife with contempt and cruelty, and possibly drove his eldest son - eclipsed by his genius younger brother - to take his own life. Both Dirac parents attempted to keep up a relationship with their son through cheerful letters as his fame increased, and tried to see him, but he kept them at a distance and wrote ice-cold letters. (He wrote a few sentences about Cambridge weather one week, omitting the fact that he had been made a fellow of the Royal Society.)The move from relativity to quantum physics included a change from a world just barely imaginable with real-world parallels (the bowling ball on the bedsheet, say) to one based in mathematical models which makes no sense in macroscopic terms but somehow align with experimental data. Einstein is said to have been an intuitive thinker, who picked up maths only on a need-to-know basis. Despite early training as an engineer, Dirac loved maths, and it was his mathematically informed quantum ideas that formed the basis for the new field. (His textbook was considered a classic of clarity and beauty for many years.) Farmelo considers that his desire for mathematically beauty in theories led him to reject the newer ideas in quantum electrodynamics and that like his idol Einstein, he probably wasted the latter half of his career (the so-called ""Nobel curse""). He married Eugene Wigner's sister Manci (an odd but seemingly pleasant marriage) and moved to Florida. But still he remained perhaps the second-most influential physicist of the 20th century, a strange and lonely man who will be remembered for centuries to come."
50,0465018270,http://goodreads.com/user/show/15597783-ron-z,3,"This books gives a very intimate portrait of Paul Dirac. ""A Beautiful Mind"" if ever there was one. About 3/4 way through, I started getting sad because I knew this biography would end with Dirac's death. It was like loosing a close friend. I was sorry to close the book. If I had to think of two words to describe Dirac: Intense, quiet. If allowed to add a third: brilliant.The only thing wrong with the book, is that it doesn't give the reader a better understanding of the mathematics that was integral to Dirac. An appendix with some skillfully reduced algebra could help. This would allow the mathematically-inclined to get an idea of how Dirac thought and, at the same time, allow the lay-reader to skip equations in favor of the prose descriptions. I had to suffice with video lectures from the internet.I would have very much enjoyed getting a better description of the Dirac equation, negative energy solutions and how these predicted positrons.In addition, the reader could be helped to understand how a theoretical physicist approaches a problem. I give some simplified ideas below.Anyone reading this book (scientifically-inclined or not) will enjoy getting to know this quiet brilliant man, P.A.M. Dirac.-----If you decide to read this book, here's an example of how a theoretician thinks. Perhaps this will help you understand Dirac in some small way.The book cover shows Dirac with a balsa plane. Suppose you want to understand how much tension a rubber band produces when being wound-up as with a balsa plane's propeller. Mathematically you could start by assuming that the tension, T, is proportional to the number of windings of the rubber band. The equation would look like this:T = k x nwhere T is the tension, n is the number of windings and k is a ""constant of proportionality"", a number that converts windings to tension. These constants exist everywhere -- they help convert Fahrenheit to Celsius or tablespoons to cups, or mass to energy.Suppose k =0.1. Then 10 windings of the rubber band would produce 1 amount of tension: 0.1 x 10 = 1 tension.It would be an easy matter to measure k. Just measure the tension on a rubber band, divide by the number of times it was wound and get a value for k. Then you'd have an equation at your disposal to predict how much tension you'll get after 10 windings, or 100 windings or 200 windings. This could be useful to you, since you want to get the most power for your plane -- too much tension and the plane flies up in a loop and crashes back where it started; too little and it only flies a few feet.With your formula, a plane designer can create a balsa plane that is sleek and requires a lot of power, or a high-lift plane with less power. In either case, your tension equation can be used by the plane designer to tell people how many windings to turn the propeller to tension the rubber band for optimal power.Now suppose some enterprising experimentalists wind-up a rubber band 150 times and the band has started doubling onto itself, or even tripling. Further, imagine that the experimenters show that the tension, in this situation, rises faster than your original equation predicted. Each turn produces more than k amount of tension.You'd be inclined to figure out some new equation to represent the tension in this new situation. You might be inclined to define a constant k2 for this new region where T = k2 x n.This is where Dirac and his colleagues found themselves at the start of the 20th century. The classical equations of Newton's physics did not apply to the interior of an atom. And their best attempts to make new equations (new k2's) weren't working either. The new equations couldn't predict all the outcomes that experimenters were observing.This would be like you proposing, T = k2 x n, then an experimenter shows that k2 is incorrect when they pass 200 windings.In this strange new world of physics, Dirac comes along and simply writes down an equation that correlates with everything the experimenters are seeing and also predicts some stuff they haven't started looking for yet. Boom! Problem solved.As an example of how amazing this is, consider what Newton did for the gravity equation. He said the force of gravity between two objects is proportional to the masses of the two objects divided by the square of the distance between them. In math terms, F is the force, G is the constant of proportionality, m1 and m2 are the masses and (r^2) is the distance squared (the distance times itself):F = G x m1 x m2 / (r^2)Newton simply stated this formula after thinking about gravity over a vacation from college. How did he know this was the correct formulation? It makes sense to think that the force should be proportional to the masses -- the larger the masses, the stronger the force. But how did he know that the force should decrease as the square of the distance? Why not decrease as the distance cubed (r^3, or the distance times itself times itself)? Or as the distance to the 1.75 power? Why did he know it was exactly the power of 2?No one knows... but his formula worked. The same can be said with Dirac. He simply wrote down the formula to describe the motion of an electron.The formula doesn't only describe slow-moving electrons either, but it also describes electrons moving near the speed of light. He wrote it down in an epiphany, motivated by the ""beauty"" of the formulation. He had tried a few other formulations that didn't work. Perhaps his penchant for relativistic theory helped guide him. Perhaps his mind was subconsciously guiding him. Again, no one knows how the creative spark appeared to him, but it did.Scientists started using the formula and found it useful. In addition, some scientists showed that the formula could also describe a ""negative energy"" electron. Some thought this meant that the formula was flawed and should be replaced with one that didn't allow a description of ""anti-matter"". But the formula was working so well and no better ideas were proposed. So they kept using it and they wondered if the negative energy was an undesired part of the math that should be ignored, or if it was actually trying to describe something real in nature.Eventually, years later, people found ""negative energy"" (i.e. ""positively charged"") electrons and they were dubbed, ""positrons"". Dirac's flash of beautiful mathematical insight predicted the existence of anti-matter. Brilliant."

I am not a science buff but was drawn to this book because I wanted to learn what was so strange about him. As I was reading about how he basically preferred to keep to himself and was not very sociable I kept thinking he sounded like classic Asperger', but as he lived in the early part of the 1900's that was not a diagnosis and people were thought of merely as 'strange' so he never had any kind of diagnosis. At the end of the book it gives the pros and cons of whether he was autistic, but the author is not qualified to give a diagnosis. There were parts of this book that were interesting, but when it got into more detailed aspects of his scientific works I was mostly bored. I trudged through it but it is not a quick read and I kept putting it down to read other things. "

53,0465018270,http://goodreads.com/user/show/18942380-william-schram,5,"The Strangest Man: the Hidden Life of Paul Dirac is a biography of Paul Adrien Maurice Dirac, the brilliant theoretical physicist that deduced the existence of antimatter through equations alone. With his early personal life, it was overshadowed by his domineering father, Charles Dirac, a teacher of foreign languages. He forced his children to speak to him only in French during supper and did other things that contributed to Charles being called a bully. His mother, Florence, was stifling and too affectionate in Paul’s eyes. Paul Dirac was a prodigy through and through but did not possess much tact. For this, his brother resented him, especially since Paul was younger than he was. Along with not having much tact, Paul Dirac was sorely lacking in other social skills. A superb mathematical student, he quickly overtook his classmates in everything mathematical. His teacher even sent him to the Library to study alone, and study he did. With a voracious appetite for mathematical works, he heard about Einstein from a news article from Friday, November 7, 1919. This was the day that relativity burst onto the world stage, with Einstein’s face being in every newspaper and many other sources.From that day on, he attempted to learn everything he could about the theory of relativity and its mathematical basis. Unfortunately, no one where he lived had heard anything about it, and that early on most of the accounts of relativity were contradictory, incomplete or had other flaws. For instance, the Atomic Model produced by Niels Bohr had a number of issues with it. The equation only worked with single Hydrogen Atoms in certain situations. Meanwhile, Dirac had problems with his personal life. His brother committed suicide and Paul Dirac was struggling to make ends meet. After he was sent a paper by Heisenberg, Dirac discovered how far behind he was in Quantum Theory.After making some initial assumptions, Dirac decided that to make the theory work it had to be relativistic; that is, it had to make predictions consistent with Einstein’s Special Theory of Relativity. Dirac was in a unique position to accomplish this. He was trained as an engineer, he had the qualities of a theoretical mathematician, and he had skills in mathematical physics. While he did accomplish this task, at the time it was mocked because it went against observation and common sense. Dirac claimed that the proton was a hole in a negative-energy sea of electrons. His colleagues had misgivings about this though since the particle in question would last a billionth of a second, say, and no matter would exist. However, Dirac was certain of his theory and decided that it pointed to an undiscovered particle that he dubbed the anti-electron.Throughout his work on Physics, the World moved on. Paul Dirac lived through a very trying time. World War I happened while he was a young man, the Jazz Age passed him by without him noticing, and while he was working on his most influential papers he saw the rise of the Nazis in Germany and the Communists in Russia. Along with that was a little event known as the Great Depression.In the early 1930s, it finally came to pass that someone observed the anti-electron but they didn’t realize what they had discovered. Since scientists were wary of Dirac’s theory, many of them chose to mock it or deny it rather than check to see if it made sense or confirm it experimentally.The saddest part of Dirac’s life is the fact that he himself considered it a failure despite his achievements. I suppose his long life had eroded his earlier confidence in his abilities. Although his biggest claim to fame was the Dirac Equation and his prediction of the positron, Dirac also came up with the idea of the magnetic monopole. Although he seemed like an automaton to many people, he had a fondness for Disney cartoons and music by Cher.In closing, this book was very entertaining and really made an effort to humanize Dirac and bring him down to Earth. It didn’t show much mathematics, but this book did do a good job of explaining the equations that figure into the story."

55,0465018270,http://goodreads.com/user/show/20737226-a-win-mannepalli,5,"There is a powerful argument to be made that modern science begins in 1925 when quantum mechanics as we know it is discovered. Among her most significant architects was a quiet and shy prodigy from Bristol named Paul Adrien Maurice Dirac. Though rarely recognized outside of the world of physics, his work eventually made possible everything from the integrated circuit to your iPhone. It is impossible for me not to be overcome by a wave of emotion when looking at Dirac’s commemorative marker at Westminster.But there were no biographies of the man. Perhaps his personality had much to do with this historical oversight. Certainly he was an odd creature; he regularly liked to leave his office early and climb trees even as a full grown adult. This was to say nothing of his notoriously frugal speaking style that rarely extended beyond one or two syllables. Most of all, I think, he sought anonymity and privacy to a perverse degree. The story was that he wanted to refuse the Nobel prize fearing the attention that would be showered on him. No doubt Dirac was “on the spectrum” as it were. Given such a personality, rare and brave is the man who would attempt to tell Dirac’s story. Luckily for us, Graham Farmelo’s able hands handle Dirac’s biography with scholarly rigor, objectivity and keen sense of compassion. It makes for a fantastic and fast paced read as well.Farmelo – originally trained in physics - is uniquely qualified to write this book. There is no way to write a biography of Dirac without explaining or at least acknowledging topics such as the delta function, Lagrangian, the positron, and so on. The author is very good at conveying these terms at the level of the average dentist. And when a topic is too mathematical to explain in simple words, Farmelo does not try to ham fistedly resort to facile analogy. Instead we are told of the consequences of such an idea and are left with a clear picture of a topic’s importance even if we cannot understand the pure mathematical formalism.More importantly, this is not some dry collection of Dirac’s technical papers. We are given a window into the history of quantum mechanics itself. The personalities who broke new ground working with Dirac and those that competed with him (namely Wolfgang Pauli famous for his eponymous exclusion principle) are rendered in intimate detail. Just as important are the discussions of the politics of the age. Dirac’s sympathies with communism and atheism are central to understanding the man. How this man went out of his way to save his friend Pyotr Kipitza from the rough hand of Stalin tells us of a man who doesn’t fit our narrow preconceptions. Most of all, we learn of a kind woman that would pursue this shy man and give him two children. In the end Dirac is rendered a funny, kind and caring genius.We are lucky that people still write books like this."
56,0465018270,http://goodreads.com/user/show/787126-n-dalal,3,"A pretty standard biography of an amazing person. It goes chronologically from his birth to his death, it doesn't meander, and it's very straightforward. I would suggest it to anyone who has an interest in what happens to science when its linked to defense, anyone who has an interest in modern physics, cosmology and quantum mechanics. Paul Dirac is surely one of the founders and true geniuses of the field.But if you're looking for interesting writing, a more postmodern, creative style of storytelling-- look elsewhere, my friend. Look elsewhere.At the end, Farmelo spends some time considering whether or not Paul Dirac was autistic, at some level. I feel like this sort of post-pathologising is confusing at worst and mere speculation at best. I wonder why biographers are so drawn to this sort of enquiry. The only ""symptoms"" to diagnose Dirac by were a rather extreme shortness of words, a fabulous brain for mathematics, and a seeming lack of emotional connection. Oh, except with his wife. And his friends. And his baby daughters.He never visited shrinks, there were no psychological notes (or even doctor's notes) for Farmelo to pore over with a few decades' worth of new diagnoses. Just stories about how distant he could be. About how distant his father was. Well, clearly, since autism runs mostly in men, since there may be some hereditary factor to it. Since Paul and his father were both rather emotionally distant, and since Paul spoke so little. Of course, since Paul was so very good at math...it follows that he was probably autistic.I admit, there is a case for it. I just wonder if there's any use pursuing cases like this. Can I not just appreciate Paul Dirac for the brilliant, eccentric, wonderful man he was, without wondering if there was something essentially wrong with him? Without dragging him down into our petty world of pathological bickering.Though, I should probably admit-- I did end up falling in love with Paul, by the end of the book, just a little bit. I mean, when asked what he thought the fledgling republic of India should consider he said, ""A unified language...peace with Pakistan. The metric system."" When his girlfriend sent him a letter asking ""Whom could I love but you?"" he answered with ""You should not expect me to answer this question. You would say I was cruel if I tried."" He loved Mickey Mouse, Cher, and beautiful equations. He had no time for small talk-- someone at a dinner tried to open a conversation saying ""Have you been to the cinema this week?"" because Dirac's love of movies was well-known. Dirac waited a moment and answered, ""Why do you want to know?""He refused offers of honorary degrees, because he believed in awards being given for merit, not fame. He refused a knighthood, because he didn't want to be addressed as Sir Paul, but only Mr. Dirac. Isn't he wonderful?"
57,0465018270,http://goodreads.com/user/show/17831138-john-park,4,"He liked Mickey Mouse, the movie 2001, A Space Odyssey, hiking, classical music and Cher. He blamed his social ineptitude and unhappiness on his father. He was probably autistic. Paul Dirac, Nobel Prize winner in 1933, was one of the foremost theoretical physicists of modern times, one of the handful from the twentieth century to have a equation named after him. His development of a quantum mechanical model consistent with special relativity implied the hitherto mysterious spin of the electron and predicted the existence of antimatter. He planted one of the seeds of string theory. When, late in life, he was considered for a university position in Florida the head of department there said that signing up Dirac would be like the English department hiring Shakespeare.His father, outwardly a good family man, had been emotionally abusive to Dirac himself and to his mother and brother, and perhaps contributed to the latter's suicide, as well as to Dirac's own discomfort with the world.For much of his life Dirac was isolated and inexpressive, extremely regular in habits, silent or monosyllabic in company, apparently oblivious to most nuances of social interaction. His main recreation was long solitary walks on Sunday afternoons. Nevertheless he taught himself such skills as giving lucid and effective lectures, and gradually built up friendships among other physicists. Eventually he married, acquiring two stepchildren and later two daughters of his own. With married life came widening interests, as his success brought international recognition, and perhaps as he recognised his creative powers as a scientist were diminishing. Farmelo's narrative develops a surprising amount of tension and varied interest. Many of the big names in twentieth century physics have major roles and acquire well-developed personae—Pauli, Heisenberg, Born, Bohr, Schrödinger, Rutherford, Oppenheimer, Einstein. . . . And not so far in the background are the big events of the century: two world wars, the Russian revolution, the nuclear bomb and the various phases of the cold war, all of which impinged in various ways on Dirac's life. (His close friend Peter Kapitza was interned by Stalin, and Dirac took part in a vigorous but unsuccessful campaign to secure his release. And, though Farmelo does not make the point, it seems clear that, like others, Dirac lost several of his most creative years to war work in the 1940s.)Inevitably the ending is anticlimactic and rather sad. By the end, virtually all the friends of his youth were dead; his stepdaughter, rejected by her mother, had apparently killed herself. Physically and mentally depleted, Dirac died in Florida in 1982. A commemorative stone was placed in Westminster Abbey next to the gravestone of Isaac Newton and a few paces from that of Charles Darwin."
58,0465018270,http://goodreads.com/user/show/32969530-dick-heimbold,5,"Really good book with a long title The Strangest of Men, The Hidden Life of Paul Dirac, Mystic of the Atom. It was a complete treatment chronicling Englishman Dirac’s life from birth to grave. His childhood in Bristol was rough on him and caused mental anguish through much of his life. His tyrannical father made him eat dinner with him insisting they only speak French. While the rest of the family ate in another room and spoke English. It was not a happy home. Dirac was extremely quiet and laconic when he did speak. He married a complete opposite personality, a very sociable and loud Hungarian lady, Manci, with whom they had three children. Some think Dirac was afflicted high functioning autism because he displayed many of its symptoms. Thankfully there is only one equation in the whole book. So it is accessible to readers with no or limited mathematical knowledge. The descriptions of the quantum mechanics and electrodynamics evolutions are engrossing as told by author Graham Farmelo. The portrayal of the times, in which great physicists competed with each other to build the scientific edifice of quantum mechanics and discover the underlying mathematics, was most enjoyable. The Second World War and the Cold War were background events that had profound impacts upon the community of physicists and mathematicians that evolved quantum physics. The physicists ended up on different sides of these conflicts but often renewed their ties afterwards. This crowd frequently visited each other in Cambridge, Göttingen, Copenhagen, Princeton and other centers of physics study. We learn a bit about Bohr, Heisenberg, Kapitza, Einstein, Schrödinger and many more with whom Dirac interacted during his long career that ended in Florida where he was a professor at FSU during the last decade of his life. The condensed version of Dirac’s contributions at the end of the book was clear and well presented and offered a glimpse into his contributions in many areas including microelectronics that underlies so much of modern life. He preferred “beautiful mathematics” to methods that used utilitarian techniques that got the right answer but were not mathematically elegant. If you are the kind of person who likes to see how human knowledge evolves, this is a book for you."
59,0465018270,http://goodreads.com/user/show/25360918-blair,3,"I choose to read the biographies of the pioneers of modern physics as one of the pathways to understanding these most amazing ideas of all time. Explaining the science is not one of the strengths of this book. There is little effort to explain the fundamentals to the reader before we get to the ideas of Dirac himself. Then we get a mixture of oversimplification and taking for granted the reader understands certain complex constructs. However, if you already know a lot of this, the book is useful for putting Dirac's contributions in perspective.One theme of the book is the attraction of Dirac and many of his colleagues to communist ideology, even during the worst of Stalin's atrocities. The author handles this well, factually reporting on what Dirac thought or did, while subtly adding what was really happening in the Soviet paradise at the time, without comment. For example, at one point Dirac is living it up with Soviet physicists in a Dacha near Moscow, while only a few miles away Stalin's opponents were being brutally tortured. He makes no attempt to speculate on how such brilliant scientists, who are supposed to be ruled by evidence, could be taken in by such a total failure of an ideology. Sure, it all sounded nice in theory before we got to see it consequences. Well, the author felt he should stay on topic, but this reviewer does not have to. Full disclosure: I used to believe in the same rubbish myself. I am not proud of that.While reading the details of Dirac's behaviour, I kept wondering how can the author not mention Autism? My favourite story is when Dirac was asked ""I don't understand the equation on the left,"" he did not respond. When pressed by the host of the meeting to answer the question, Dirac replied, ""That was not a question, it was a statement."" He was not being mean, that is simply the way he thought. Finally, the second to last chapter is devoted to a very thorough discussion of the possibility of Autism.I can't call this a great book, but it does cover many of the great ideas in modern physics, is good for getting an historical perspective of living through the rise of the Nazi party and the Second World War, and takes a close look at a rather strange man.
