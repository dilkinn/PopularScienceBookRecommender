0,0375424296,http://goodreads.com/user/show/175635-trevor,4,"Of course, there is that scene in Cosmos where Carl Sagan is sitting on a beach somewhere and talking about the stars. He picks up a handful of sand and says that the number of grains of sand in his hand is about as many as the number of stars you might be able to see unaided if you looked up at a clear night sky. He then says that modern cosmology has shown that there are more stars in the universe than all the grains of sand on all the beaches of the world. This is a book about what happened when people went from being able to see merely a handful of grains of sand to suddenly getting to witness the endless beaches overflowing with grains. As you might expect, it took people a while to work out just what it was they were looking at, just how big it actually all was.I found this book quite fascinating. Astronomers are very strange creatures and they probably need to be observed as closely as they themselves might view their favourite celestial object. I had no idea Edwin Hubble was supposed to be quite so handsome. Someone, in fact, said that if they had decided to make a film of his life and he had applied to play himself they couldn’t take him as no one would believe he was right for the part - he was simply too good looking to be a scientist.He was also remarkably strange in his own way. He became a Rhode’s Scholar and went off to Oxford – but came back with a strange (and quite fake) English accent, and a taste for English tailored shirts and suits, all of which he kept up for the rest of his life.In many ways this book is a series of biographies, the most interesting of which is that of Henrietta Swan Leavitt, a bit of a hero of mine now – the human computer. She discovered the Cepheids and what they meant and then went virtually unnoticed despite this most incredibly important discovery. And Cepheids are incredibly important. They are stars that vary in intensity over fixed periods of time. What Henrietta discovered was that there was a relationship between how long they took to vary from bright to dim and back again and their maximum intensity. That is, a Cepheid that has a period of 10 days will always have a certain maximum luminosity – one that varies ever 20 days will always have some other maximum luminosity, no matter where in the sky it is. So, if you were standing beside a Cepheid with a period of 10 days and you looked out into the dark depths of the sky and saw another Cepheid also with a period of 10 days you would know that both of these stars actually were shining with the same brightness.So what, I hear you say? Well, knowing how bright an object is in the sky allows you to know how far away it is – as light becomes dimmer with the inverse square of the distance the star is away from you. That means that Henrietta was one of the most important people in astronomy as she provided the yardstick by which we are able to measure the universe. If she had had the good sense to have been born a man we might even remember her today – but, typically, women never seem capable of learning this most simple of laws.A large part of this book is devoted to the question of whether those odd looking little spiral things that appear to be hanging off the side of the Milky Way are virtually connected to our galaxy or are island galaxies all on their own and just as large as our galaxy. This story of how evidence was piled up on both sides to defend each side’s favourite prejudice is a wonderful example of people ‘hearing what they want to hear’. But just in case you have lost all faith in humanity and science there is a wonderful moment in this book where conclusive proof is finally presented to one of the scientists who argued fiercely all of his life against there being more galaxies than the Milky Way and who then said something to the effect of ‘Oh well, their goes my view of the universe’ and from that day on was a champion of the new theory. Anyone who can change their mind (on just about any topic) is about as close to Godlike in my book as we can expect here on Earth.This is the fascinating story of the people who gave us our current perspective on our place in the universe. The science here is told in simple prose and should present no problems to even the most scientifically ignorant. Great stuff."
1,0375424296,http://goodreads.com/user/show/793473-clif-hostetler,5,"This book provides a virtual front row seat to the discoveries of facts about the universe that were bigger, stranger, and more spectacular than anybody could have imagined at the beginning of the 20th Century. Today the newness has worn off of such terms as expanding universe, space-time continuum, and multiple galaxies. So it's good to imagine the excitement that must have been felt when these words were first uttered. If these concepts seem unfathomable now, they were even more unbelievable then.This book covers the professional biographies of multiple individuals who played important roles in the advancement of astronomy from 1900 to 1930. Consequently the book's structure reminds me of Doris Kearns Goodwin's book, Team of Rivals where she provided multiple mini-biographies of Lincoln's cabinet. The author, Marcia Bartusiak, in this book skillfully hops from one personality to another, each mini-biography being told chronologically, but generally jumping backward in time when changing from one astronomer to another. The narrative is written with such skill that it's hard to imagine it being told in any other way.Of course Edwin Hubble ends up being the star in the end. But the service provided by this book is to tell the story of others who provided the base of knowledge upon which Hubble was able to build. Among the personalities involved, Hubble was not the most likeable person to select if one were choosing a storybook hero. He was physically attractive, but a stuffed-shirt guilty of some boorish behavior. Nevertheless, in addition to being very intelligent, he had the luck of being at the right place at the right time. All the others in this story were very intelligent people, and there were several who could have achieved the findings regarding the size of the universe before Hubble, but for various reasons didn't do it. The following quote from the book provides a good summary of the excitement and significance of the time.""...perhaps never again will astronomy face such a dramatic shift in its conception of the universe. It took only three short decades―from 1900 to 1930, ... ―to make this mind-altering transition. The Milky Way, once the universe's lone inhabitant floating in an ocean of darkness, was suddenly joined by billions of other star-filled islands, arranged outward as far as telescopes could peer. ... Astronomers barely had time to adjust to this astounding celestial vastness when they were faced with the knowledge that space-time ... was expanding in all directions ...Conservative religious people who feel that science is always chipping away at their views of the universe should remember that when evidence of the ""Big Bang"" was first reported that many religious people enthusiastically welcomed the news as vindication of their views about creation. This is a reminder that science goes where the evidence leads, and occasionally science and religious myths may end up in the same ball park (metaphorically speaking).One of the individuals who could have beaten Hubble to his findings was Harlow Shapley. Unfortunately, he was so convinced of the single galaxy model that he didn't look for contrary evidence. When he first received a letter from Hubble describing his initial findings, Shapley was quoted as saying, ""the letter has destroyed my universe!"" The book's narrative goes on to say, ""Once proven wrong, ...(Shapley)... didn't look back and quickly adjusted to the new cosmic landscape, soon becoming its most boisterous promoter.""Here's my favorite quotation by Harlow Shapley from his 1969 memoir:""The solar system is off center and consequently man is too.""The above quotation is a comment about the discovery that the solar system is not located at the center of our galaxy. And for that matter, the Milky Way Galaxy is only one of many billions of galaxies and isn't at the center of anything, least of all the universe. So if God created the universe for the exclusive enjoyment of earthlings, he/she/it apparently selected an arrangement that emphasized our insignificance. After Copernicus discovered that the earth wasn't in the center of the solar system, we should have known that there was going to be more news headed in that direction.The following is from the author's blog:""... taking the Copernican principle to its finale―our universe may not be the only one. As physicists attempt to construct a theory that unifies all the forces of nature, one theme repeatedly arises: that additional cosmic realms may be lurking in other dimensions. We could be part of the multiverse; the Big Bang might have occurred when universes outside our dimensional borders bumped into one another."""

How big are we talking?Hubble : Well, you know the Milky Way? Okay, now see through this telescope, see those little wispy things there?Astronomling: You mean those spiral nebulae?Hubble : Well what if I told you they weren’t spiral nebulae?Little astronomer: Aww, you mean they’re just smudges on the lens? Damn. We wasted a lot of time on those things. Hubble : No. I mean that those wispy little doodads which no one has been able to figure what in tarnation they are up to now are actually nothing more than other Milky Ways, vast conglomerates of billions upon billions of other stars separated by incalculable distances of deep space.Lesser astronomer : Hmm. You don’t say so. Hubble : But I do say so.Unimportant astronomer : Oh I know you do. It’s just an expression. ***Gotta tell you that for a non-scientist like myself, the 30 page introduction to this pretty much told me everything I needed to know and the rest was a bunch of unattractive men arguing politely about difficult sums. Not much sense of wonder there."
3,0375424296,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2869030-patrick,5,"This book is a fantastic, popular-science history of a pivotal era in astronomy: the moment in time when we went from a belief that the Milky Way was the Universe entire, to the knowledge that the Milky Way is but one galaxy in a Universe comprising billions of others.Both the famous names (Hubble, Einstein, etc) and the less well-known players (Vesto Slipher, Milton Humason, Georges Lemaître, etc) are represented in this fascinating, well-written, and well-researched book."
4,0375424296,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2309246-cassandra-kay-silva,5,"I can't even imagine what it would have felt like to have seen some of these early images of the expanding universe during this time but it must have been completely inspiring, and if any book gives you a glimpse into what this must have felt like this book is it. It contains an assortment of well known and less well known but equally important contributors to Astronomy in the early 1900's leading towards today. It really makes you look differently at the giants of this time such as Edwin Hubble and Slipher and how the inter play between so many different contributors lead to the view of the expanding universe as we now see it. A wonderful companion to any collected works on astronomy. I would have loved to have seen more of the early images though, I found myself having to revert to google throughout the book. "
5,0375424296,http://goodreads.com/user/show/146952-grumpus,3,"Oh, to have been an astronomer in the heyday in the early 1900s. I've always wanted to be an astronomer (was never good in physics). Now I know what time I would have ideally wanted to be one. Everything was new...the telescopes, the country, the skies were free from light pollution, and the glory of discovery. Oh, to dream."
6,0375424296,http://goodreads.com/user/show/757896-dave,5,"This is easily the most interesting book that I'veread this year and I've read quite a few. Pleasedon't shy away from it due to a fear that it mightbe a difficult read, it's totally accessible andrequires no prior knowledge of astronomy &c.The action really starts just prior to 1900 andcontinues on for the first three decades of thatcentury, a period that revolutionized our under-standing of the Universe, its structure, extentand our place in it.Einstein's is a name familiar to all of us, and Edwin Hubble to perhaps more than a few, but you will meet many more people, likely for the firsttime, whose combined efforts, in what was at timesa contentious struggle, were able to answer some seriously perplexing questions.Was our own Milky Way the extent of the Universe,or were the faintly perceived nebulae themselves""island-universes"" lying beyond its bounds, re-ducing us to just one of untold many Galaxies?Was the Universe static and bounded, or was spaceitself in a state of unimagined expansion? HadEinstein added new understanding with his Special Theory of Relativity or had he managed to make theissue even murkier, the problems more difficult?How distant were the objects that we were finallyable to resolve with the ever larger telescopes?Are they truly moving away at speeds that were almost impossible to believe? If so, why? How werethose measurement problems solved and what new understanding came as a consequence?Not the least interesting part of the story is thewide range of talents and backgrounds of the peopleinvolved in the search for answers. Some of theirstories are heroic, some are tragic and the creditsdon't get evenly parceled out. If it were a novelit would be hard to find some of it credible. It's a compelling story."
7,0375424296,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1484507-brian,2,"the title of this book should be changed to ""The entire history of star gazing PLUS the entire backstory of every person that ever had a telescope in their life AND (maybe) the day they all got together""i did not finish this book. i made it about halfway through and it was the most boring thing ever! i was expecting a book about a single day and some in depth knowledge on that day and some stuff about astrophysics and scientists who i have heard of and who i havent.well, this is not that. and i should have known better. it is about every person ever in history BEFORE the day that changed the universe. because it wasn't like an AHA! discovery in was a series of little discoveries proven and disproven over time. oh, and if you want to understand the language in this book, you should probably have some kind of degree in physics."
8,0375424296,http://goodreads.com/user/show/10961320-shane-phillips,4,Great information. Not just on the discoveries but the people and politics behind them. 
9,0375424296,http://goodreads.com/user/show/56169217-darsh-bakshi,5,I always loved astronomy and was expecting something different from this book which it delivered. It had a lot of names of astronomers but the small stories were so coherent and beautifully told that by the end of it I was amazed and inspired. Enjoyed every single page of it.
10,0375424296,http://goodreads.com/user/show/40823165-yibbie,3," Aside from the misleading title, this was an interesting, well-written book. It is the history of the controversy surrounding the size of the universe that raged till the late 1920s. It most closely focuses on the struggles to identify and measure what were then called spiral nebulae. To do that, it also includes the history of two leading observatories and the people that worked at them.  The vast majority of the book though details time-consuming acquisition of new data and the sometimes personal debates that raged about it. If you are interested in the history of science and scientists, I think you will find this as an interesting book.  While the focus of the book is not on the origins controversy, it is brought in ever so slightly towards the end of the book. There were a couple of curse words. "
11,0375424296,http://goodreads.com/user/show/14639696-gossamerblu,5,"A dramatic and wonderfully written book about a special group of scientists that shaped our knowledge of the universe, in turbulent period at the beginning of the 20th century. It follows their lives, their work, their battles of ideas, theories and calculations that inflated our universe from our solar system and Milky Way to the ever-expanding vastness filled with countless galaxies.Meet the scientists that searched for their answers among the stars, people like James Keeler, Heber Curtis, Henrietta Leavitt, Harlow Shapley, and finally, Edwin Hubble, learn about their lives and their personalities, their persistence, their successes and their errors.Discover how astronomers painstakingly learned to measure distances and velocities of distant objects, see how Lemaître proved to Einstein that universe is not a static space filled with unmoving galaxies. Very informative read, suitable for anyone who wants to learn something about people that changed our understanding of the world. Five out of five stars."
12,0375424296,http://goodreads.com/user/show/34169037-mark-reynolds,5,"Excellent ""detective story"" of the search for the size of the universe. Were those fuzzy nebulae inside the Milky Way? Or were they ""island universes"" of their own? Hubble showed that they were outside our galaxy, and he and Lemaître showed that the universe was expanding. Great stories of the observational astronomers at Lick Observatory, Mt Wilson, and Lowell Observatory. I only have a few small technical quibbles, but for the most part the science is described accurately. Bartusiak does an excellent job - which she also did in her other book on the search for gravitational waves, ""Einstein's Universe."""
13,0375424296,http://goodreads.com/user/show/16109453-david,4,"Interesting history (mainly 1910-1930 ish) of how they determined that those fuzzy ""small and nearby"" nebulae were really far distant galaxies. I liked it because it doesn't just say ""and they found it was this far away;"" but she explains how they came to and verified their conclusions."
14,0375424296,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1339246-gendou,3,"History is boring, Astronomy is fun. So, this book was half way in between."
15,0375424296,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1705225-carol,4,"The universe is expanding and so is my brain from reading this book, although not at the same rate."
16,0375424296,http://goodreads.com/user/show/77918515-rock-howard,5,My favorite book about the history of astronomy. I have read it 3 times including quite recently.
17,0375424296,http://goodreads.com/user/show/16310702-glenn,4,"Studies (as late as 2013) continue to confirm that the Universe is approximately 14 billion years old. Anyone who has come into contact with astronomy during their education, probably takes it for granted that we live on a planet in the backwaters of an unremarkable galaxy in a universe of billions of galaxies. Furthermore, most of us know that our Universe is expanding in all directions from a point where, in distant history, an event we call the ""Big Bang"" took place. But how do we know all of that?During the late 19th and early 20th centuries the size and age of the universe was the subject of intense scientific debate. As late as 1923, large numbers of scientists believed that earth was at the center of one gigantic galaxy -- the only galaxy in a vast sea of pretty much nothing else. Because of this belief, most astronomers were simply focused on the (somewhat monotonous) task of cataloging stars, trying to discover more about our solar system, gathering data on occasional comets, and going on solar eclipse treks. Only a very few were focused on the fuzzy clouds at the outskirts of our ability to see -- nebulae.This book covers the personalities (men and women), techniques, funding and (eventually) technologies that resolved this debate and allowed astronomers to determine the approximate size, age and expanding nature of the universe. The ""Day"" in the title of the book refers to 1/1/1925, the date on which Hubble's paper ""Cepheids in Spiral Nebulae"" was presented to the American Association for the Advancement of Science , at their convention in Washington D.C. The ""Cepheids"" to which Hubble's paper referred provided the final breakthrough to understanding the true size and age of our universe.My interests wander around technologies & methods, most of which Bartusiak describes fairly well. Spectrography, a technology that has been evolving since Newton's time, allows us to both determine the composition of celestial bodies and provides key information to help us determine their distance. However, before we were able to develop large stable mirrors for reflector telescopes, spectrography had limited use. Refractors (Galilean type telescopes) absorb many wavelengths. Only a reflector allows those wavelengths to be seen and analyzed spectrographically. Reflectors of sufficient size only appeared in the 20th century.We also needed ""mileposts"" to estimate distances. Cepheids, a type of periodic stars, are the perfect mileposts but, until large reflectors (like the 100 inch at Mount Wilson) were available it was impossible to catalog a sufficient number of them to plot the data to understand their distance relationships. So a meticulous Rhodes Scholar like Edwin Hubble needed Mount Wilson's new 100 inch reflector to make meaningful observations of galactic nebulae, and gather sufficient Cepheid data, in order to determine distances to these ""galaxies"". Doppler theory & red shifts are involved and covered adequately by Bartusiak.""The Day We Found the Universe"" tells a very human story of competing theories, astronomers (Hubble, Shapely, van Maanen, Vesto Slipher), those who acquired or funded their efforts (Hale, Yerkes), underpaid and occasionally brilliant women (such as Harvard's Henrietta Leavitt) and physicists like Einstein and Lemaitre. It is ultimately a story that confirms (to the frustration of Shapely, van Maanen and others) the triumph of meticulous work, examined in the court of scientific method, over human ego. Marcia Bartusiak does an excellent job of unpacking the drama of how all of these characters contributed to the current and more humbling understanding of our place in the universe."
18,0375424296,http://goodreads.com/user/show/42261661-lucas-g,3,"The central theme of this book is explaining the the events that led up to the now-prevailing cosmological model known as the Big Bang Theory. I picked it up in order to understand some of the history surrounding the developments in astronomy in the early twentieth century. While I did get that, the book does not read like a history book. Instead, it reads more like a series of intertwined biographical episodes, with each chapter focusing on one or two important figures in late nineteenth century and early twentieth century astronomy. Unfortunately, I'm not the biggest fan of biographies, so this book was a chore to get through at times. I would have preferred it if this book emphasized the science with biographical content only added in every so often. What little scientific details are found in these pages are so engulfed in biographical language, it is hard to get a clear picture of the progression of the scientific developments. This is further complicated because the stricture of intertwined biographical episodes required Bartusiak to jump around back and forth in time, resulting in a departure from a chronological telling of history. Nevertheless, it was an interesting read. With that said, if you're interested in understanding the backstories of many important figures in the history of astronomy, this is probably the book for you. But if you want to dive into the details of the scientific developments, this book doesn't have much to offer."
19,0375424296,http://goodreads.com/user/show/28383415-gretchen,4,"Bartusiak expertly weaves the tapestry of astronomical players and their ideas together, tying into Hubble's culminating moment and subsequent theory. She not only highlights the science but the personalities of the individuals involved in the ""Big Bang"" of progress during the early decades of the 20th century. One of the most progressive elements occurred in the development of telescopes themselves, evolving both in size and type to gather more light--fascinating! Anyone interested in astronomy or biographies of significant figur will enjoy this book. Technical without being inaccessible.Also fascinating are the hypotheses and assumptions on which cosmology rest, one leading to another as further and better exploration is done. While the men chronicled here made immense contributions, their observations are ultimately the outline in a coloring book, waiting for details to further develop the picture. One scientist noted how many and how quickly paradigms were developed, supported, evidence, and rejected. This sounds like an uncertain system on which to build a whole system of belief, despite the amazing discoveries and insights of astronomers, mathematicians, physicists, and philosophers alike."
20,0375424296,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4046161-james,5,"A fascinating history about Edwin Hubble's discovery (with the help of quite a few others) that our universe was much larger than we ever imagined, this is a book that grabs you from the beginning and holds you until the end. Much of what we know about our universe now was not so apparent until Hubble's findings were unveiled on January 1, 1925. The impact of that unveiling has reverberated to this day. What is even more incredible is to consider that those of us fortunate enough to reside in or around the Pasadena/Los Angeles area are so close to such an historic site, the Mount Wilson Observatory. Having had the privilege of personally observing through both the 60- and 100-inch telescopes, and having walked among the very site where much of Hubble's discovery was made, I can say that the experiences have been no less than breathtaking. This book managed to put into clear historical perspective, the meaning, not only of the historic findings, but of the historic site, that contributed so much to a knowledge that continues to expand much as we now know our universe does. This is a highly recommended read!"
21,0375424296,http://goodreads.com/user/show/18568588-dave-stone,5," Outstanding! I've often been confused by the seeming interchangeability of the words Galaxy and Universe. Here is the reason why. Until the 1920's they thought the Milky Way was the whole universe. This book tells the story of the scientific discoveries that changed out view of the universe and our place in it, in 30 short years. Colorful and memorable characters from Percival Lowell and Edwin Hubble to Einstein and Georges Lemaître (the Catholic priest who proposed what later became known as the ""Big Bang theory"")This all sounds dry and academic but this book is fun. I enjoyed reading about all theses guys and ladies (especially Henrietta Leavitt who discovered how to judge the distance of a variable star)here is a view of a world that goes from horse draw coach the atomic bombs is one leap and discovers the universe along the way."
22,0375424296,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1037566-joaquin,4,"It was great to hear about the many steps and people involved in the great accomplishments that usually are credited to Hubble and Hubble alone. There is so much more, as always science stands on the discoveries of all the predecessors and no scientist works in a vacuum. This is very well narrated, though the metaphors get a bit stretchy here and there, but it gave me a sense of discovering through each step as if I didn't already know what the final discoveries would be. It's a fun read, thoroughly informative, and inspiring."

Many later misconceptions about who did what are debunked, and there is fascinating discussion of the people involved with no attempt to gloss over their often too human characteristics. "

But it's the thing where you've had some sort of impossible to articulate epiphany about something. Wait, maybe that's an epiphany. Dammit. Words are so hard. Whatever the case may be, I recall with great clarity the moment that I realized that some little piece of trivia I'd picked up in passing was probably the entire life's work of a brilliant man or woman at one time, and quite possibly, was the result of several lifetime's worth of work by numbers of people. And for me, it's 30 seconds with Google, and I've got the problem licked. This book, it's about one of those things. In the broadest of brushstrokes, it's about how we came to view the modern view of the universe as we do today. I don't mean stars and planets, which has been discussed endlessly, but the cosmos at large. You know, galaxies and the large scale structure of the universe we live in. It's hard to imagine that we're not that far removed from a time when all we had to figure out the universe was our naked eye, and maybe a holy book to put things in perspective. It's really a giant feat of ingenuity that we know as much as we do. That people are smart enough to figure out so much about how the world works, and our world's place in the cosmos, it why I vehemently disagree with the notion that pyramids or whatever ancient structures we have had to have built by aliens... or for that matter, for the modern belief by many that computers and jet airplanes are technologies pilfered from crashed alien vessels. That sort of thinking is an insult to the things we've accomplished. Whatever, that's more of a general rant I have anyway, I guess I was looking for an excuse to share it, or at least that teeny part of it. And getting back to my kinda sorta narrative here, the events of this novel go back to around the turn of the 20th century up until the 1930's and show us the state of knowledge about physics and astronomy at the time. And how within a few short decades we completely upended our previous notions of the universe. Loved this book. And seeing the struggles that these people were going through, racing to make discoveries and to build better equipment. That things we take for granted now, were altogether unheard of then (like the idea that building a telescope at altitude, in a dry, non-cloudy climate, might help). About how the reflector telescope might be superior to the refractor, and especially, how the science of spectroscopy really changed everything. I mean, reading about how the transition from sketches made by the observer to photographic plates allowed pictures to be formed a photon at a time over the course of multiple viewings (20 or 30 hour exposures weren't uncommon) was inspiring. Inspiring because keeping a region pinpointed in the sky over several nights meant the observer would climb up into the scope, on a mountaintop, in frigid temperatures, and be forced to keep the crosshairs of the scope centered on whatever they were observing the entire time. Constant adjustments had to be made to keep they constantly moving sky centered for those long exposures. I don't know how astronomers didn't regularly get hypothermia.This book lays out the work of several luminaries in the field, what inspired their work, and how their stories overlapped with one another and really culminates with Edwin Hubble putting everything together and eventually probably getting more credit than he deserves for his role in discovering that so many of those 'nebulae' that many believed were star forming regions within the Milky Way were actually independent galaxies, and were flying away from us at unthinkable speeds. Great read, a must read, probably, if the history of science is of interest to you at all. Many of the names and stories might be familiar if you've read a lot about the field anyway, but there was still tons of stuff brought up that I'd never known before. Great stuff. Although I still don't know how to rate a non-fiction book. Still, I was quite intrigued by the subject matter, and it was well written. So four stars. "
39,0375424296,http://goodreads.com/user/show/58435235-andrew-hove,4,Great book on the brief history of Astronomy in the time leading up to Edwin Hubble's discovery that the Milky Way as one of many Galaxies in the universe and not the only one. Fantastic information on the politics and technological advancement of Astronomy. Does a great job describing the impact that Einstein and his theory of relativity had on the field.
40,0375424296,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3265556-converse,3,"In the 1920s we found out that the universe is much bigger than we thought and getting bigger. The main person who generally gets the credit is the American astronomer Edwin Hubble, who worked at the Mount Wilson observatory near Pasadena, California. Hubble's contributions were important but not the whole story. Vesto Slipher, an astromer at the Lowell Observatory in Arizona, had noticed that the light from what were then called spiral nubulae were mostly Doppler shifted to the red end of spectrum, indicating that most appeared to be moving away from us. In the late 1800s James Keeler of the Lick Obervatory had noticed that there seemed to a lot of these spiral nebulae about; whenever he took a picture of one, other, fainter ones were visible in the background. Henrietta Leavitt at Harvard had shown that a particular kind of star, Cepheid variables, could be used to measure distances. And Harlow Shapley had shown that our galaxy was much bigger than previously thought, and that the Earth was not at the center of it, though during the 1920s he started off opposing the idea that spiral nebulae were separate galaxies. Hubble was the one who found Cepheid variables in other galaxies, and from that data was able to show that these bodies were outside even of Shapley's very large Milky Way. He and his collaborator Milton Humason then put together the their distance information with red shift spectra (initially using what Slipher had found about a decade earlier) to come up with what is now interpreted as the expansion rate of the universe. But Hubble rarely wrote in those terms, as he did not want the validity of his work to be tied to a particular interpretation. He was probably excessively worried on that point. Meanwhile, theorists such as Einstein, the Briton Arthur Eddington,, willem de Sitter of the Netherlands, and, most importantly for this story the Belgian Georges Lemaitre, came up with a mathematical model based on relativity theory that allowed for an expanding universe."
41,0375424296,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1108123-bettie,0,"Description: On January 1, 1925, thirty-five-year-old Edwin Hubble announced the observation that ultimately established that our universe was a thousand trillion times larger than previously believed, filled with myriad galaxies like our own. This discovery dramatically reshaped how humans understood their place in the cosmos, and once and for all laid to rest the idea that the Milky Way galaxy was alone in the universe. Six years later, continuing research by Hubble and others forced Albert Einstein to renounce his own cosmic model and finally accept the astonishing fact that the universe was not immobile but instead expanding.The fascinating story of these interwoven discoveries includes battles of will, clever insights, and wrong turns made by the early investigators in this great twentieth-century pursuit. It is a story of science in the making that shows how these discoveries were not the work of a lone genius but the combined efforts of many talented scientists and researchers toiling away behind the scenes. The intriguing characters include Henrietta Leavitt, who discovered the means to measure the vast dimensions of the cosmos . . . Vesto Slipher, the first and unheralded discoverer of the universe’s expansion . . . Georges Lemaître, the Jesuit priest who correctly interpreted Einstein’s theories in relation to the universe . . . Milton Humason, who, with only an eighth-grade education, became a world-renowned expert on galaxy motions . . . and Harlow Shapley, Hubble’s nemesis, whose flawed vision of the universe delayed the discovery of its true nature and startling size for more than a decade.Here is a watershed moment in the history of astronomy, brought about by the exceptional combination of human curiosity, intelligence, and enterprise, and vividly told by acclaimed science writer Marcia Bartusiak."
42,0375424296,http://goodreads.com/user/show/19248744-patrick-ross,3,"The format of this book--tell a story of a significant development in history while covering multiple individuals rather than one--can be both informative and fun to read; think Isaacson's The Innovators or Ambrose's Nothing Like it In the World (about the transcontinental railroad). Bartusiak attempts here to tell the story of the astronomers who figured out that our galaxy is not alone in the universe, but that nebula are in fact other galaxies, and they are far away, multiple beyond count, and part of an ever-expanding universe.It's an interesting story, and because it is from the early 1900's there's plenty of primary material--letters, journal articles, etc.--for Bartusiak to mine. And she does it capably. Her storytelling style isn't quite at the level of Isaacson or Ambrose, however. I didn't feel a sense of adventure as much as I would have wanted, and what could be more adventurous than massively expanding our view of the universe? (It didn't help that the most famous protagonist of this story, Edwin Hubble, was a bit of a pompous ass.) A strength of this book--and in that case she is on par with one of my favorite biographers, Dava Sobel--is that it is readable even if you have no background in astronomy or physics. Her explanations are straightforward and comprehensible; but she also recognizes the real story is in the characters she's portraying. "
43,0375424296,http://goodreads.com/user/show/976229-joshua,3,"Before the first world war the universe was not much bigger than the Milky Way. Every pinpoint and smudge of light that could be seen through the best telescopes of the time were believed to exist within the confines of our own galaxy. During the decade after the war, all that changed when Edwin Hubble came to Mount Wilson to peer at the night sky through the 100 inch reflector. By 1930, we new that the universe was made of innumerable galaxies speeding away from us at every increasing velocities with increasing vast distance, and that Edwin Hubble was the astronomer, we were taught, who solely revealed this new universe. Well, not quite.There were, of course, other astronomers whose contributions went almost completely unheralded in the glow of Hubble's star. This book is mainly about those scientists whose work laid the foundations for the discoveries which changed our understanding of the cosmos. Marcia Bartusiak competently tells of the men and a few women, the triumphs and failures, the cooperation and conflicts which marked the endeavor to know what's out there, how it works and how it came to be. A good read for those interested in delving beyond what we learned in high school.  "
44,0375424296,http://goodreads.com/user/show/9543482-philip,5," A solid book if you're into the history of astronomy or cosmology. It investigates the people who's discoveries and work laid the foundation for Hubble's discovery and the day alluded to in the title, and the people who were substantially more daring than Hubble (Hubble was rather conservative and not much into the theoretical, very much into CYA) who had a better grasp of the implications of Hubble's work than Hubble himself did. Henrietta Swan Leavitt's work on Cepheid variables really set the groundwork for Hubble's distance estimate to thwe Andromeda Galaxy. Vesto Slipher's spectroscopic work on the red-shift of the ""spiral nebulae"" gave a much under-appreciated Belgian astronomer, mathematician, and cosmologist (also Catholic priest tossed in there too) Georges Lemaître the needed data set to mathematically explain that the universe was expanding using Einstein's relativity and a ballpark rate for that expansion that prefigured Hubble's constant. Lemaître also came up with the idea of the Big Bang. Anyhow, I really liked this book quite a bit. "
45,0375424296,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2221534-brie,4,"A very interesting book. I have to admit that when I first started to read it, I found the writing very dry, and only my interest in the subject kept me reading. I'm not sure whether the writing improved throughout the book, or if I became used to her writing style, but by the end I loved the book. I hope she writes a continuation covering the discovery of the Big Bang theory, and the astronomers involved in that discovery. The author starts off talking about each astronomer and their discoveries (Keeler, Curtis, Hale, etc), leading up to Hubble finding that the spiral nebulae were actually other galaxies. Around the halfway point of the book the astronomers tales become intertwined, and this is where I found the book to be the most interesting. I would definately recommend this book, as it sheds light on some lesser known astronomers who had a big hand in leading up to Hubble's discoveries."
46,0375424296,http://goodreads.com/user/show/10580118-bob,5,"If you care about how we learned what we know today, then the history of science is important and you will like, probably love, this book. A complete and well-told story of a branch of astronomy featuring Lick Observatory (the first built at high elevation), the infancy of space photography, spectroscopy, and all the contributions that led to Hubble's seminal work in the 1920s. A great illustration of how the scientific method produces new understanding. it made me humble: it's easy to mock people who thought the world was flat or that the sun circled the earth. My own parents were equally ignorant, thinking galaxy and universe meant the same thing. I am probably ignorant in some way as well, is there more than one universe for example? I consider this book a must read for anyone who likes science. "
47,0375424296,http://goodreads.com/user/show/318324-kurt,5,"A great blend of science and history, this is the story of how we came to understand the scale of our universe and our place within it.It boggles my mind to realize that less than one hundred years ago conventional scientific theory considered our Milky Way galaxy to be the entire universe, and our Sun the very center of that universe. Between the years of the late 1800's through the early 1930's all this changed. This book describes how men (and a few women) strived to understand and explain the astronomical phenomena that they observed as technology increasingly gave them better tools to aid them.Every event and every concept within this book is described in a way that is both fascinating and understandable. Marcia Bartusiak deserves praise for making science and the history of science so accessible to the public."
48,0375424296,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7247043-jodip,5,"This was a very interesting account of how scientists discovered that the Milky Way is not the only galaxy, and that the universe was much, much, larger than thought. It was like a great detective story, with many false leads, egos and missed opportunities along the way. When Hubble ocnfirmed that nebulae were actually distant galaxies, this resulted in eventual unerstanding that the universe was TRILLIONS of times bigger than estimated prior to this. This line is int he introduction and stuck with me the entire book. I will have to look for more by Bartusiak; she writes well, giving enough detail but not getting bogged down."
49,0375424296,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1721143-bob,4,"Challenging enough to teach one something, and be worth one's time. Very clear in explication. In the early 20th century we learned that the universe is much larger than we at first thought. Edwin Hubble was the dashing, romantic figure who proved it, but Marcia Bartusiak doesn't slight the other important figures who were part of the discovery. Bartusiak's explanations are clear and straightforward, and additionally, she is a very nice lady. Don't miss her Thursday's Universe.Thursday's Universe"
50,0375424296,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1235528-gregory,5,"Ms. Bartusiak recounts the development of astronomy from the decades of the first big research telescopes to Hubble's Zeitgeit-shifting proof that the Milky Way is just one of millions of galaxies. The writing is fluid and lively, with great attention to the personalities involved and their very human struggles. I couldn't put this one down. My only quibble, and it's a minor one, is that a few of the author's attempts to describe the phenomena of the universe come up short. Her explanation of how the rate of pulsing of Cepheids indicates their distance made no sense to me at first, but luckily there is a great tutorial at Khan Academy."
51,0375424296,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2505253-leefrances,0,"Oh my god. I started this book two and a half years ago and I finally FINALLY finished it. It was extremely interesting leading up to Hubble. In the ""Adonis"" chapter, where the author introduces Hubble, I completely lost interest. I disliked Hubble's persona and arrogance which put me off finishing the book for so long. I've been reading so much physics and cosmology lately though, I just couldn't leave this unread any longer. I got through my personal distaste of Hubble but focusing my attention on the science, which is of course remarkable."
52,0375424296,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2830383-jeff,5,"Picked this up at the gift shop at the Griffith Park Observatory (great place to visit BTW). This is a fascinating and engaging story of how Edwin Hubble proved that we weren't the only galaxy in the universe and about all the players that came before him and contributed to what he ultimately determined. The astrophysics wasn't too difficult to keep up with, and the the story of the cast of characters was interesting. Good, easy read"
53,0375424296,http://goodreads.com/user/show/22605322-quinn,5,"This is the first astronomy book I've read since I was in grammar school, so I was a bit nervous that it would be over my head. It wasn't! Marcia Bartusiak is such a masterful writer, she took a complicated topic and made it both readable and interesting. I highly recommend this book to anyone interested in astronomy, history, or science in general. This book has opened doors to me for further reading about the heavens!"
54,0375424296,http://goodreads.com/user/show/19874940-jesse-reiss,5,"Terrific insight and careful explanation about how the universe was discovered. Wonderful anecdotes, background information and buildup to Einstein's acceptance and confirmation of it all. Hubble plays a major role but all the characters and their roles are laid out and explained. No complex math. Any layman with a high school education could read this book and leave it fully enlightened about the universe they live in. "
55,0375424296,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5788644-joe-frank,5,"This is a delightful chronicling of the early days of American astronomy and the study of the ""spiral nebulae"". It focuses primarily on the group of astronomers at the Lick and Mount Wilson observatories in the first three decades of the twentieth century. Equally informative and entertaining, Marcia Bartusiak presents us with a book that is designed to please the eager science history enthusiast. "
56,0375424296,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1166624-barb-in-maryland,4,"Very well done popular history of the state of astronomy research in the late 1880's to pre-WWII. The title refers to Hubble's paper, released in early 1925, verifying that there were other galaxies (aka island universes at that time) than our own Milky Way. Great capsule biographies of several of the major players, such as Shapley and Hubble. Highly recommended."
57,0375424296,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1627452-katy,3,"For someone who may not have the slightest background in astronomy and only the basic knowledge of who Einstein was, this book does a wonderful job of describing the fascinating science behind the discovery of the universe as we know it today. Ms. Bartusiak is a wonderful author and truly painted a more meaningful picture of the night sky. "
58,0375424296,http://goodreads.com/user/show/993611-carol,5,"In depth survey of the scientists and lay people whose works combined to measure the distances to the galaxays. Thus opening a new vision of our place in the universe.The story is well known, but some of the lesser known people are given their due.I've always enjoyed Marcia Bartusiak's science writing. This one is no exception."
59,0375424296,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1232882-lance,3,There was a lot to like about this book. It told the history of astronomy leading to the realization that the Milky Way is just one of billions of galaxies and is not the center of thing. Biggest surprise was how huge a role Lick Observatory played in this. Disappointed that the author didn't recognize that lots of good work is still going on there.
