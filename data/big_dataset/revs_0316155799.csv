Despite the fact that it's sloppily argued and poorly written, I'm embarrassed to say that I found it unputdownable. If you also enjoy watching smart, opinionated people shooting their mouths off in public, you may well have the same reaction. Susskind, writing in 2005, confidently promises to explain Life, the Universe and Everything. He is one of the founders of string theory and the phrase is in the title, so no prizes for guessing that it will be an essential ingredient. In a nutshell, his argument is as follows. The rest of this review is available elsewhere (the location cannot be given for Goodreads policy reasons)"
1,0316155799,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5740364-eric-malone,5,"This book is one of the best physics/cosmology books I've ever read (read 3 times in fact). The most interesting parts, for me, were related to the Anthropic Principle and the discussion of the Landscape and Multiverse theories. As I understood it the biggest issue was with the cosmological constant he discussed. If it were exactly zero, as Einstein believed, we would live in a ""flat"" (read: not-curved) universe and everyone would be OK with that. But better and better measurements show that the cosmological constant only appears to be zero...after some 120 decimal places it suddenly is not zero anymore. Why exactly this means our universe is ""fine-tuned"" for us to live in...I'm not exactly sure. I just understood the more surface level explanation of the weirdness of something that appears to be zero for 119 digits suddenly not being zero anymore. Like if the digits of Pi started repeating your phone number after a billion decimal places.Other anthropic issues are discussed as well: why is our planet in Goldilocks zone, why are we so lucky to have a large moon to stabilize our rotation, why are we so lucky to have Jupiter sweeping up our solar system's debris, why is the life of proton so remarkably stable, why is the gauge constant exactly where it needs to be to enable chemistry to happen, and on and on. The combination of all these ""coincidences"" is what Susskind argues gives the APPEARANCE of intelligent design or a benevolent God tuning the dials on our universe. But string theory's multiverse allows such a mind boggling number of different universes with different physical laws that when we ask ""Why do we live in a universe so perfectly tailored to allow us to exist?"" then the answer becomes ""Because obviously if we didn't then we wouldn't be asking the question."" Why does our planet have liquid water and atmospheric oxygen??? Because if not, we'd be dead and never have asked the question in the first place. At least that was my understanding of it.eric"

Basically, he is telling us something that Hume told us, what, about 300 years ago, that the universe seems beautifully designed to allow life to exist (which leads some to propose the notion that it must therefore have been specifically and deliberately designed for us to live in) because we do in fact live in it. It's the only one we know about, so we think it was made for us. The reality of course is that we arose in it; it caused us, and we are its effect. Hume lacked the theoretical physics to explain it mathematically, but he was right. He must be right because the great Leonard Susskind says so.Okay, that is me intruding my own unpleasant personality on the subject matter. The upshot is, screw this, I'm going to read Feynman."
3,0316155799,http://goodreads.com/user/show/18293816-bill-leach,4,"- A review of Feyman diagrams, propagators and vertex diagrams.- The fine structure constant (alpha = 1/137 or 0.007297351) is an important constant of nature. It represents the probability that an electron will emit a photon as it moves along its trajectory.- Feyman developed Quantum Electrodynamics (QED) which predicts the probability of any event based upon the propagators and the vertex diagrams, and upon coupling constants such as the fine structure constant.- Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD) is the theory of quarks and gluons.- There are 6 quarks - up, down, strange, charmed, top and bottom.- Only the up and down quarks form the stable nuclei.- A proton is 2 u and 1 d: Charge is 2/3 + 2/3 - 1/3 = 1- A neutron is 2 u and 1 d: Charge is 2/3 - 1/3 - 1/3 = 0.- QCD is the theory of strong interactions where gluons tie the quarks together.- The numerical constant governing the emission of gluons is called the alpha-QCD and is 100 times larger than the fine structure constant.- Weak interactions are another part of the Standard Model. Nothing in QED or QCD explains how a neutron can emit an electron and become a proton.- Quarks and electrons can emit w-bosons, as can the neutrino.- One of the 2 d quarks in a neutron can emit a w-boson and become a u quark, turning the neutron into a proton. The w-boson then splits into an electron and an anti-neutrino.- The Standard Model makes use of about 30 fundamental constants. Extensions to the Standard Model and cosmological theory bring the number of constants to over a hundred.- All evidence suggests that the constants do not vary over the observable universe.- Einstein thought the universe to be stable and determined that an extra term was possible under General Relativity that would represent a force that would counteract gravity, which would otherwise act to pull the universe together. He denoted this cosmological constant as lambda. Unfortunately this resulted in an unstable equilibrium.- Hubble discovered that the universe is expanding and the cosmological constant could be set to zero.- Quantum mechanics predicts that empty space will be filled with fluctuations where particle pairs are created and annihilated over very short times (billion-trillionth of a second). These short lived particles are termed virtual particles and represent a vacuum energy.- Fermions, such as electrons, contribute negative vacuum energy while bosons, such as photons, contribute positive energy.- The vacuum energy exerts a force that is indistinguishable from the cosmological constant.- Calculations of the vacuum energy produce a result that is vastly larger than what would be consistent with the observable universe.- Super-symmetry (fermi-bose symmetry) suggests that there is a boson corresponding to every fermion (and vice versa) such that the vacuum energy nets to zero. However, there is no super-partner for the electron or other elementary particles.- There are no viable theories as to why the vacuum energy is essentially zero.- Steven Weinberg: The Anthropic principle: Some property of the Laws of Physics must be true, because if it wasn't we would not exist.- Calculations show that if the cosmological constant is much different from what is empirically observed, the universe would not be suitable for our existence.- The Planck mass, time and length are described.- The quantum jitters of space occur on the scale of the Planck length and time. The Planck mass turns out to be equal to the smallest possible black hole.- To a physicist a vacuum denotes a space where physics can take place.- The Laws of Physics depend upon the values of the physical constants of a space.- A field is the result of the coordinated movement of particles. Each particle has an associated field.- Physicists discovered that the Standard Model is mathematically inconsistent, but could be made consistent by adding the Higgs particle.- The mass / inertia of particles depend upon the value of the Higgs field. The exceptions are the two massless particles - the photon and the graviton.- In the 80's, String Theory looked to be an elegant theory that would merge the Standard Model with gravity. However, since then 3 problems have emerged:1. The number of mathematically consistent versions increased dramatically, opening up a stupendous Landscape.2. The models became increasingly complex and less elegant.3. All versions produce a non-zero cosmological constant.- The Cosmological Principle - the large scale structure of the universe is homogeneous and isotropic.- The galaxies are receding with a velocity equal to the product of their distance and the Hubble constant.- Three possible geometries for space: zero, negative and positive curvature:1. If the mass density is great enough to reverse the outgoing expansion, it will distort space into a 3 sphere. This is a closed and bounded universe or k=1 universe.2. If the mass density is less than what is required to close the universe, it is insufficient to reverse the motion. It distorts space into a hyperbolic geometry. The universe expands forever, or k= -1 universe.3. If right on the knife edge, the geometry of space is flat and uncurved. The universe endlessly expands, but at a diminishing rate. This is the flat or k=0 universe.- A megaparsec is about 3 million light years, or 30 million trillion km - a little more than the distance to our neighboring galaxy Andromeda.- The Hubble constant is about 75 km/sec per megaparsec.- According to Hubble's Law, the Andromeda galaxy should be receding at 50 km / sec, but is moving toward us due to gravity.- It would take only 10 E-25 kg/m3 to reverse the outward flow of the galaxies. This is roughly 50 protons / m3.- The average cosmic density is around 1 proton / m3.- Therefore, we appear to be living in an infinite open (k= -1) universe.- The mass of the galaxies can be determined from their movement. Each galaxy is 10 times more massive than all of the visible stars and gas. The remaining mass is almost certainly not made up of ordinary matter. It is termed dark matter as it gives off no light. Dark matter is likely composed of some new, heavy elementary particles that have not yet been discovered.- When including the dark matter, the amount of mass in the universe appears to be 5 times too small to attain a flat universe.Hubbel calculated the age of the universe from the distances and speeds of the recession of the galaxies. Unfortunately, he calculated a billion years and rocks had been found that were 2 billion years old.- Modern calculations put the age of the universe at 10 billion years. However, there are stars that appear to be 13 billion years old.- If the vacuum energy were to amount to 30 protons / m3, it would solve the 2 biggest problems in cosmology:1. A small cosmological constant would result, giving a flat universe which is what we observe.2. The repulsive force would cause the expansion of the universe to accelerate. Run backward, the age would be calculated at 14 billion years, consistent with the ages of the stars.- Type I supernovae always generate the same luminosity, and so observation gives both the distance and the rate of recession. The more distant supernovae are older, because of the time it takes light to reach earth. We observe a larger Hubble constant for older supernovae. These show that the expansion of the universe is accelerating. The value of the cosmological constant is just what Weinberg had predicted.- The oldest light reaching earth has been Doppler shifted to microwave frequencies. The Cosmic Background Radiation (CMB) is very cold at 3 deg K.- When detected from high altitude balloons, oscillating blobs can be seen. These are well enough known in theory that their size is known. Comparison of their known sizewith their apparent size allows measurement of a triangle and establishes that space is flat on scales of 10-20 billion light years,- It appears that the universe inflated exponentially for a period in its earliest phases, and this has resulted in the surprisingly homogeneous nature of space.- While expansion of the universe results in decreasing density of matter, that is not true of vacuum energy which is constant per volume of space.- A chapter on the Anthropic Principle, how it requires a landscape of possible universes, and whether it is a valid scientific theory.- Hadrons are the particles made up of quarks, anti-quarks and gluons.- All hadrons belong to one of three families - baryons, mesons and glueballs.- Baryons include protons and neutrons, and are made up of three quarks connected by strings.- Energy can only be added in discrete steps.- Mesons are made up of a quark and an anti-quark joined by a string.- Glueballs are closed strings and can be formed when the quark and the anti-quark of a meson connect.- A point particle moving through space-time gives a world line.- A meson moving through space-time gives a world sheet and a close string gives a pipe. Junctions result where particles combine or separate.- Particles exchange gluons so these sheets are made up of a fabric of lies representing the exchanges.- String Theory requires 9 + 1 dimensions.- Forces are the result of exchanging particles: gravity - graviton electromagnetic - photon weak nuclear - pion strong nuclear - gluon- The strength of the forces depends on the mass of the messenger particle.- The strings of String Theory vibrate at all modes (harmonics) of oscillation due to the quantum jitters. They appear to oscillate to the ends of the universe.- String Theory was originally developed to describe hadrons. However, it has been expanded to describe all particles and forces, including gravity.- Leptons are fermions that do not have strong interactions like quarks.- Compactification - some dimensions are closed and compacted towards the size of the Planck length.- Some particles move only in the compacted dimensions. Strings can be wound once or more around a compact dimension (winding number).- The distance around a compact dimension is termed the winding scale, and is typically a few Planck lengths.- The compact scale fixes properties such as the electronic charge and the masses of the particles. In effect, the compact scale determines the Laws of Physics.- The 6 compact dimensions are rolled up in what are called Calabi-Yau spaces. Millions of possible C-Y spaces exist.- The parameters that determine the shape of the C-Y spaces are called moduli, and number in the hundreds.- The spaces can taper so that the dimensions vary from point to point. This is equivalent to saying that the Laws of Physics vary from point to point. Thus the C-Y spaces allow a Landscape of possibilities.- Super symmetry is a concept whereby each fermion has a boson twin and vice-versa. However, there is no twin observed for the electron and other proposed particles do not appear to exist.- Distortion may cause the twin partners to be different, perhaps very heavy. It may be that super symmetry may yet be applicable.- Branes are membranes - 0-branes are points, 1-branes are surfaces, etc.- String Theory may involve multi-dimensional branes that are compacted into the extra 6 dimensions.- Fluxes, akin to fields, are now included in String Theory.- de Sitter described an exponentially growing space. It would feature an event horizon representing the furthest distance at which points could be observed.- Eternal Inflation is the idea that islands of vacuum energy form in an inflating meta-stable de Sitter space.-These islands or bubbles could have Laws of Physics corresponding to any of the possibilities given in the Landscape of String Theory.- The many worlds idea is that parallel universes have formed in these bubbles. This is the mega-verse.- A review of complementarity and the Holographic Principle as applied to black holes.- A review of various contemporary physicists and their views on String Theory and the Anthropic Principle.- Susskind says that there are no serious alternatives to String Theory. Lee Smolin has a Loop Gravity theory but it may be an alternate formulation of String Theory, rather than an alternate theory.- Many dislike the Anthropic Principle because it is too easy and may be akin to giving up. It may reduce the drive to explore more deeply.- That the laws of nature are emergent is the idea of Robert Laughlin. He pictures a universe composed of a material like superfluid helium where the properties emerge only at the macroscopic levels. However, black holes do not work with this theory and Laughlin argues against some of the generally accepted properties of black holes such as Hawking radiation.- Lee Smolin proposes a natural selection of universes whereby baby universes form inside black holes which are inside universes, etc. This repeated replication results in an evolution toward maximally fit universes.- One problem with the Landscape is that String Theory loses it's predictive power. There are too many valleys in the Landscape to predict, for example, the mass of the top quark.- Early inflation of the universe resulted in vacuum energy being converted to heat and particles. It is also theorized that some vacuum energy was converted to vast collections of entangled strings. These strings would not be visible as light or other electromagnetic radiation, but they would emit gravity waves. They may be detectable in the coming decade. - Susskind sums up saying that there may yet be possibilities for testing String Theory that are not apparent today."
4,0316155799,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1187112-mallon-khan,3,"How do you explain theoretical physics with no equations? lots of metaphors. Susskind runs the gamut on theoretical physics in the early 21st century. A whole new ballgame sine the 50's. Our scope of the cosmos has just widened to unprecedented proportions. Anything is possible, even *GASP* God!!This is the guy that disproved Stephen Hawkins' theory of black holes. He went to write about it and wrote this book instead. Why? Because after a hundred years of sucking Newton's throbbing laws and licking Einstein's sweaty theory, pumping away chasing that ever allusive grand unified theory. The Physics community just realized we can only see less than 1% of the universe. 80% of space is ""dark matter or dark energy"" it effects us, but we can't see it or measure it. Coupled with the possibility of 10 other dimensions, doesn't it make you feel less than a Man. So much for that Grand unified theory. Also see ""Large Hardon Collider"""
5,0316155799,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5876978-anthony-tenaglier,4,"This book was hard to put down because the presentation of string theory was excellent. It was easy to follow and understand with wonderful analogies and descriptions. Still not sure on how to wrap my head around the idea of ""compactification"" though, as this is such an important tool in string theory. How can dimensions be reduced to ""practically"" nothing and still call it something theoretical???? The book was great though, until there was a ""hiccup"" at the end with his bragging about how he proved Hawking was wrong with information lost in a black hole and that his new radical idea of information being transmitted with the outgoing Hawking radiation was the solution. Not quite sure how that really fits in with String Theory... I imagine he wants you to buy his book on waging ""war"" with Hawking.Also, I recommend his books over his lectures on iTunes University. His skills in teaching are far better in writing than what I witnessed in his classroom presentations. "
6,0316155799,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5237420-ana,5,"Absolutely beautiful popular science book, right up the alley of someone who really wants to understand physics but lacks even the minimal basics. Susskind writes an easy-to-follow prose, a thing to be appreciated given the scope and importance of his subjects. Found some great references to other authors/works that I'd like to follow up with. "
7,0316155799,http://goodreads.com/user/show/10145524-charles-daney,5,"This is quite a remarkable book. In 380 pages physicist Leonard Susskind gives a concise but easily understandable overview of a wide range of topics in physics and cosmology. The topics include basic quantum theory, quantum electodynamics (the theory of light, electricity, and magnetism), quantum chromodynamics (the theory behind nuclear energy), and general relativity (the theory of gravity). But that's just to get started on the main topic.All of these topics are just the background for the big questions: How did the universe get started? Why is the universe the way it is, and in particular, how is it a suitable place for life as we know it? Is the universe that is now visible in our telescopes actually all that exists, or is it just a small part of an ensemble of many separate ""universes"" – a ""multiverse""?In order to describe a possible answer to those questions, Susskind first addresses, in the same concise, understandable way, other topics: string theory, the ""cosmological constant"" (also known as ""dark energy""), and ""cosmic inflation"" (a once speculative theory that explains several otherwise susprising facts abou our universe). All of this just leads up to the book's real topics: the ""anthropic principle"" and the ""cosmic landscape"".The anthropic priniciple is simply that whatever theory is used to ""explain"" the universe, the theory must be able to account for an indisputable fact: sentient, ""intelligent"" life exists. And not just any type of life. It must be our type of (human) life. That is: life based on the element carbon, which requires liquid water to function, and which takes a long time to evolve to what we're familiar with (probably a few billion years).Despite its name, the cosmic landscape does not refer to the physical space we're familiar with. Instead it is an abstract space of extremely high dimension. How high? Quite possibly 10^500 (1 followed by 500 zeroes) dimensions. That is the abstract space of all independent parameters that might describe in full detail the exact topology (i. e. shape) of the smallest building blocks that make up the 9 spatial dimensions of string theory. (In addition to the 3 dimensions we can perceive, there are 6 more dimensions in the minuscule building blocks.)What happened to string theory itself? Wasn't that supposed to be the ""theory of everything""? The theory was tasked with accounting for the array of ""fundamental"" particles and forces of the ""Standard Model"", along with about 30 specific values for particle masses and force strengths that have been measured in high-energy physics experiments. What happened is that when it was realized such a huge number of independent parameters might be involved there was no obvious way to figure out how they determined the details of the Standard Model. String theorists kept hoping that some new mathematical principles would do this job, but after over 40 years of theorizing, absolutely nothing has turned up. String theory is a fine, consistent mathematical theory, but it doesn't (yet) explain basic physical facts.This is where the cosmologial constant comes in. It is the added term in Einstein's fundamental equation of general relativity which, with no experimental failures so far, seems to perfectly describe the force of gravity – as a consequence of the curvature of 4-dimensional space-time. Einstein added it as a mere afterthought, hoping it could explain why the universe didn't collapse under its own gravity. That was misguided, but when it was determined (about 90 years ago) that the universe was rapidly expanding, the cosmological constant turned out to be essential in explaining the rate of expansion.""Dark energy"" is a form of energy that may permeate space that is perfectly empty of matter. It could be what is responsible for the cosmological constant. However, the cosmological constant has now been very accurately measured since 1998 by astronomical observations, and it is incredibly small compared to what is predicted by the Standard Model – about a factor of 10^120 too small. Alternatively, if a conjectured physical symmetry called ""supersymmetry"" exists and is not ""broken"", then the dark energy and hence the cosmological constant should be exactly 0. But that is most definitely not what is observed. And on top of that, there is so far no experimental evidence for supersymmetry that is either unbroken or just slightly broken.Now, the cosmological constant as measured just happens to have almost exactly the right value for life as we know it to exist. If it were a bit smaller, the universe would have collapsed in much less than the roughly 4 billion years it has taken for our form of intelligent life to evolve. If it were a bit larger, the universe would have expanded too rapidly for stars and galaxies to form. In that case, neither carbon nor oxygen (needed for water) – which as far as we know are only formed inside stars – could exist. Stars are also (probably) needed for rocky planets with liquid water. And so, mysteriously, the cosmological constant seems to be almost just right as a necessary (though not sufficient) condition for our form of life to exist. Steven Weinberg had already noticed this about 10 years before an accurate measurement of the cosmological constant.The idea of cosmic inflation was proposed 35 years ago (by Alan Guth) and is now accepted by most cosmologists, even though definitive evidence for it is still somewhat scanty. It's widely accepted since it does explain a lot, such as the extreme ""flatness"" and homogeneity of space. It's also a key ingredient of the cosmic landscape hypothesis. An extension of the inflation idea – ""eternal inflation"", due to Andrei Linde – proposes that not just our universe, but an unending series of ""pocket universes"" come into existence over time by basically the same mechanism as originally conceived. And in each of those pocket universes most physical constants, including the cosmological constant, can have random different values.The cosmological constant is the key, since it may be the amount of energy in ""empty"" space. As an energy it can have almost any value. In almost all cases it is probably very large to begin with – much too large for our form of life to exist. But no matter how large it starts out, it can also drop rapidly by quantum tunneling into a lower energy level of the landscape, almost like water running downhill. However rarely this happens, the constant can become small enough for us, so here we are. Other physical constants of the Standard Model can also vary.Another important constant is the ""fine structure constant"". It controls the strength of the electromagnetic field. This has to be right so that chemistry essential to life can occur. Another constant regulates the strong nuclear force, and it has to be right in order for carbon to form in stars (assuming stars exist in the first place). Besides those things, the strength of gravity (which is extrememly weak compared to other forces) has to be weak enough (together with the cosmological constant) so that the universe doesn't collapse almost as soon as it forms. And there must be other things that must be ""just right"" as well. (Martin Rees' Just Six Numbers: The Deep Forces That Shape the Universe is a good reference on this.)The anthropic principle is a credible tool only if all the right conditions don't ""just happen"" at the instant a new pocket universe forms. There are just far too many variables (potentially 10^500) that have to be just right. So there needs to be a mechanism that allows a pocket universe to ""evolve"" over time to successively lower values of the cosmological constant (the energy of empty space). All possible values of each variable exist in the cosmic landscape by definition. However, hardly any are associated with existing pocket universes. But when there is a pocket universe in a particular state, to transition to a ""nearby"" state of lower energy, which will also have different values of all other variables, it can do so by the mechanism of quantum tunneling. Eternal inflation guarantees that there's enough time for an infinite number of pocket universes to exist. So, eventually, at least one but possibly infintely many will exist that could be like ""ours"".Susskind's book was published in 2006. It's fair to ask what has happened with the cosmic landscape idea in the last 10 years. In that time there don't seem to have been any dramatic discoveries, comparable to the measurement of the cosmological constant, that either significantly add or remove support for the landscape idea. But, Susskind says, even in 2006 cosmologists mostly had a positive attitude toward the idea. That still seems to be true now, though there definitely are exceptions. The attitudes of physicists, however, were more mixed in 2006, and probably still are. Some physicists are still hopeful that eventually some new mathematical development may yet make it possible to construct a ""theory of everything"", based on string theory, that will be simple and elegant and nail down all of the variables to make a universe exactly like ours. Other physicists are exploring different theories that will, at least, unify gravity and quantum mechanics and also yield a universe like ours.Yet many physicists do share Susskind's view. It's important to note that Susskind is not only a physicist himself, but in fact was actually the originator of string theory (although at least two others independently had similar ideas about the same time). However, Susskind gradually gave up on the possibility that string theory by itself could explain ""everything"" – in particular the exact values of all variables, leaving no arbitrary values that could be discovered only by experiment. Many physicists still pin their hopes on that possibility, somehow or other. But perhaps the multiverse and the landscape, however much they lack in simplicity and elegance, is how things really are.There are, incidentally, several more recent books that also have good accounts of the landscape and the multiverse – Brian Greene's The Hidden Reality: Parallel Universes and the Deep Laws of the Cosmos and Max Tegmark's Our Mathematical Universe: My Quest for the Ultimate Nature of Reality, for example.

8,0316155799,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5686119-book,4,"The Cosmic Landscape: String Theory and the Illusion of Intelligent Design by Leonard Susskind""The Cosmic Landscape"" is an informative, provocative theoretical physics book about how the world came to be the way it is. Dr. Leonard Susskind takes the layperson behind the scenes of an on-going debate among physicists and cosmologists; it's a battle between those who believe that the laws of nature are determined by mathematical relations, and those who believe that the Laws of Physics have been determined by the requirement that intelligent life be possible. This book is educational and sometimes challenging but ultimately satisfying. This stimulating 416-page book includes the following thirteen chapters: 1. The World According to Feynman, 2. The Mother of All Physics Problems, 3. The Lay of the Land, 4. The Myth of Uniqueness and Elegance, 5. Thunderbolt from Heaven, 6. On Frozen Fish and Boiled Fish, 7. A Rubber Band-Powered World, 8. Reincarnation, 9. On Our Own?, 10. The Branes behind Rube Goldberg's Greatest Machine, 11. A Bubble Bath Universe, 12. The Black Hole War, and 13. Summing Up.Positives:1. A well-written, accessible book for the masses.2. The fascinating topic of cosmology in the hands of subject-matter expert.3. Even though the Dr. Susskind is obviously a string theorist he does a commendable job of being fair and even-handed.4. Does a wonderful job of introducing the Laws of Physics to the readers at an enjoyable and accessible level. Dr. Susskind takes pride in educating the public on very difficult and esoteric topics. Very few equations, those of you math-adversed do not fret.5. Explaining the theories that best explain the universe. ""Inflationary cosmology, which is our best theory of the universe, is leading us, sometimes unwillingly, to a concept of a megaverse, filled with a prodigious number of what Alan Guth calls ""pocket universes.""6. Despite the intellectual battles on contentious cosmological debates among scientists there seems to be a great deal of respect, honor and most importantly drive to find the answers to our biggest cosmological questions. Dr. Susskind is very complimentary to his brethren. An all-star cast of physicists. ""I have always admired the clarity and depth of Steven Weinberg's physics. In my opinion he, more than anyone, can lay claim to being the father, of the Standard Model.""7. Making elementary particles accessible to the masses via Feynman's pictures.8. The cosmological constant in perspective. Was it truly Einstein's ""biggest blunder""?9. Cosmic Landscape in proper context. ""It denotes a mathematical space representing all of the possible environments that theory allows"".10. Elegance in science. ""The best theory would be not only a theory of everything, but it would be the only possible theory of everything.""11. Is the universe finite and bounded as Einstein thought, or is it unbounded filled with an endless infinity of stars and galaxies? What is the geometry of space? Find out.12. The great achievements of cosmology. ""The connection between the quantum theory of the microscopic world and the large-scale structure of the astronomical and cosmological world is one of the greatest achievements of cosmology.""13. Dismantling intelligent design...always a personal favorite.14. Stirring up the hornet's nest with ""The Anthropic Landscape of String Theory"". Dr. Susskind explains his baby, String Theory. Three chapters of everything String Theory.15. In defense of the populated Landscape. ""Mechanisms that rely on well-tested physical principles gave rise to a huge, or even an infinite, number of pocket universes, with each and every valley in the Landscape being represented.""16. The chapter on the black hole war covers beautifully the behind the scenes battle among scientists. Stephen Hawking eat your heart out...""If Gerard is conservative I would have to say that Stephen Hawking is the Evel Knievel of physics.""17. Really closes out the book with a bang. The Summing Up chapter summarizes beautifully the essence of this book.18. Love how Dr. Susskind goes over the most prominent physicists of the day and their contributions, including the younger generation. His admiration for Gerard `t Hooft is palpable.19. An excellent epilogue.20. A helpful glossary.Negatives:1. How scientific is modern cosmology? String theories? A lot of it has that sci-fi feel to it, no matter how hard Dr. Susskind tries to sell it as scientific.2. Let's face it, there are some topics in physics and cosmology that are truly ""far out"" and are bound to be over your head. Branes will challenge your brain.3. Very few endnotes.4. It requires an investment of your time.5. No formal bibliography.In summary, despite some of the challenging topics I really enjoyed this book. Dr. Susskind did a very good job of introducing basic principles and concepts while not shortchanging the public on many of the perplexing challenges that physicists/cosmologists face to describe how the world came to be. The book captures the on-going debates in the physics community and describes quite well where the scientists stand. My biggest concern has to do with how well the theory really captures reality.

9,0316155799,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1046657-micah-johnson,4,"This book is about one of the most shocking ideas in modern physics. Susskind's argument goes a little something like this: There are certain measurable physical constants in the universe that we inhabit that can be quantified. These constants represent things like how strongly particles are attracted to one another or how far an electron is from the nucleus of an atom. Lately, some physicists have come to the conclusion that if even one of these numbers was even minutely different, then life and therefore intelligent life could never have existed at all. Furthermore, these values are so very exactly known and within such small tolerances that they seem to have been ""tweaked"" by some outside agency. Yikes. Now we veer into religion.To me, this seems like some really awesome ammunition for the intelligent design crew. (Remember, you can't spell ""IDiot"" without ""ID."") Obviously, the tweaker in this case would be the Intelligent Designer and there are some high level physicists who posit this exact scenario. Not so, says Susskind, who then goes on to describe our universe as just one out of an unimaginably large number of universes, maybe even as high as 10 to the 500th power, and out of that many, it stands to reason that there would be a universe exactly like ours which we just happen to inhabit. And though these other universes exist, there's no way to ever observe them or prove it. Make sense? I know I'm probably screwing up the details, but for me, I just can't get past his idea that there really might be something un-knowable about the universe or the multiverse for that matter, should it turn out to exist. It turns my core beliefs into the same kind of superstitions and dogma that I have tried to avoid. I give it four stars because I'm still thinking about it, even months after I read it. Incredible ideas, sad conclusion."
10,0316155799,http://goodreads.com/user/show/122235--uht,5,"We've got 'The Rare Earth' and now we've got 'The Rare Universe.' This book details Leonard Susskind's theory that our universe one of 2-500X (2 to the 500th power) possible universes. He goes through some of the current theories on how 'pocket universes' form and exactly what would be possible in order for those universes to support life. 'The Cosmic Landscape' is his coined term for the multiverse, or the higher-dimensional space within which our universe was created and for the 'landscape' of possibilities for universes in general. There's some great discussion about why 3 extended space dimensions is conducive for life and probably the best explanation about the Planck length/time I've ever heard (changing the units leading to one of the greatest quantum insights ever). Brilliant shit. But the most interesting part of the book (for me) was the anthropic principle. I'd read about the weak/strong anthropic principle before but always viewed it as a copout. But Susskind is so passionate that 'this universe is exactly how it is because we are here to contemplate it' that he really has won me over. Yes, we still need to figure out why and how, but ultimately life was able to form because this rare universe did what it did. This got me thinking about epistemology and the problem of 'the external world.' In a sense, we each create the entire universe anew every day and when we die, that particular universe is gone. Think about it."
11,0316155799,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1508173-david,3,"In this book noted physicist Leonard Susskind presents an emerging paradigm of cosmology based on modern string theory. This cosmology addresses the difficult question of why our universe appears to be so specially constructed. For instance, the ""cosmological constant"" of the universe appears to be the sum of two terms, which cancel to 120 decimal digits, yet fail to cancel in the 120th digit! What can be the explanation for such phenomena? Susskind then discusses developments in modern string theory, which (by his own admission) has miserably failed to provide a simple crisp explanation of our modern world. To the contrary, string theory suggests that there are 10^500 possible universes. Susskind then suggests that maybe this failure is the way out of the paradox. Perhaps our universe appears so extraordinarily well designed is merely an instance of the ""anthropic principle"" in action -- sure, we are a one-in-10^120 chance; but in an ensemble of 10^500 universes, hey it is bound to happen at least once.It should be noted that other physicists are dead-set opposed to this line of thinking, which they regard as a complete surrender of the quest for a crisp falsifiable theory. See for instance Smolin's ""The Trouble with Physics""."
12,0316155799,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1310120-lisa,3,"An interesting read, with some excellent explanations of physics. My quibble is how heavily the author leans on a flavor of the Anthropic Principle which seems to put the cart before the horse. In this Panglossian paradigm, the universe has been 'fine-tuned' for our benefit. It seems to me that reverses the logical cause and effect- since we have evolved in this universe, obviously the physical constants and laws must permit our existence. We are fine-tuned to our universe, not vice versa. The author ultimately concludes that there is a 'Landscape of possibilities, populated by a megaverse of actualities', and that like Laplace his hypothesis does not require a god, but that seems rather at odds with his prior explanations of the anthropic principle. "
13,0316155799,http://goodreads.com/user/show/61033954-m-r,4,"When you think you have all the answers, it’s time to stretch boundaries. Physicists get to do this all the time, and their boundaries seem to have no end. Leonard Susskind in his book The Cosmic Landscape takes the reader along to share his perceptions of the ultimate boundary; the one about our universe. However, rather than stretching the boundary, it’s about the existence of a boundary itself that keeps that makes this book well strung together.Most people consider the boundary to our universe to be the detection limit based on our senses. But with particle accelerators and space based telescopes, we can discern much more than solely using the Mark 1 Eyeball. Physicists combine new observations with earlier ones to organize our existence into some type of meaning. Joining the physicist’s dash into the extremes are the mathematicians. They keep pace with and sometimes exceed the expanding boundary of our knowledge. Observations and rules lead to field theory, topology, the Planck scale, the cosmological constant and of course really neat differential equations. String theory is one technique still hovering around the boundaries of the physicists as it shows much promise in linking aspects of our universe. It also raises the question of uniqueness. That is, though string theory may tempt us into thinking we’ve got a handle on gravity and space/time, this handle is only one of many. Other handles may exist which relate to other universes which may, in some manner, share an existence with our own.Considering our universe as being one of many seems all the rage these days. Susskind, with his book, leaps into the foray and uses cheerful wit and colourful images to turn some pretty extreme physics into common consideration. He targets the lay person as the general audience and is bang on target. As seems to be standard, though somewhat sadly to my thinking, there are no equations. Susskind gets about as adventurous as mentioning the size of a googolplex. Yet, he doesn’t short change the reader, after all he’s been at the leading edge of discovery in physics for sometime. Using an approach that is part historical and part empirical, he takes the reader through the ideas of the interconnectedness of properties, relations and entities and then aligns them with the idea of intelligent design and the Anthropic Principle. Specifically, he addresses the question as to whether the universe is the way it is because we see it that way or because of another reason. Susskind’s answer to this question is in his book, but it is not a straight forward yes or no. As with many good authors, he gives enough information to the reader to help them understand the complexity of the question and make their own conclusions about universes.Providing the basis for the universe is no trivial manner. Yet this is the focus of most of the book. As Susskind says, he establishes his view based on hard science rather than aesthetics and emotions. Presenting this with the absence of mathematics leads to many thought experiments. Allies help him. For example, there’s continuing tribute to Feynman and his representative diagrams, as well as the invented fyshicists that look out from their own watery world. However, don’t expect this to be the be all and end all for explaining physics. It is neither expansive nor exhaustive. Yet he does dote upon gravitons, bosons, fermions, Higgs field, glueballs and many other of the more esoteric concepts. Susskind shows a wonderful ability to portray their relevance without overloading the reader. Of course, those readers with a priori knowledge will get more from this book, but there’s nothing stopping the uninitiated from drawing out their own worthwhile conclusions.Though Susskind uses his idea of a landscape to tackle the question of intelligent design, he’s not always clear on his direction. He provides a good summary of small particles/high energy physics. These are certainly a basis to our universe, but he doesn’t make a clear connection to his argument. Also, he goes through an insightful history of string theory but, again, doesn’t clearly connect the history to his landscape. Overall, the writing is well edited for clarity, but not all his points relate to the topic. For the general reader, there may be insufficient background to follow the rational. However, for those who’ve delved a bit deeper in cosmology or high energy physics, this book will provide an interesting viewpoint of what’s on the other side of the boundary of our universe, assuming there is one.Perhaps we feel a sense of impertinence in trying to determine what’s outside our universe. But not many years ago, the same was said for those who thought there was something outside the celestial spheres that encompassed the Earth. Leonard Susskind takes this view in his book The Cosmic Landscape, and may be impertinent. But he’s using well known and determined physics, together with years of teaching, to present the reader with a chance to broaden their own boundaries."
14,0316155799,http://goodreads.com/user/show/74820709-boris-bere-ek,4,"This book is definitely worth reading. The ideas presented in the book really open up the views to the reader, whether they are right or wrong (I'm not competent to comment on that)."
15,0316155799,http://goodreads.com/user/show/15651131-last-ranger,5,"Mapping the Void: This book is endlessly fascinating, frequently frustrating and is, hands down, one of the most difficult books I've ever read. The only reason I was able to get through it at all was Leonard Susskind's ability to clearly communicate complex ideas to the layman reader. Nonetheless, ""The Cosmic Landscape"" was a real chore to read. String Theory has been around, in one form or another, since the 1960s and has evolved into the many different forms we see today. Like Quark Theory, Quantum Mechanics and some other branches of Theoretical Physics, String Theory is purely a mathematical construct. No one has ever observed an actual ""String"" or, for that matter, a ""Quark"" either. But both theories are alive and well, and the subject of ongoing research, to this very day. In ""The Cosmic Landscape"" Susskind gives the reader a kind of ""primer"" on these difficult subjects and traces their research history as well. Along the way Susskind introduces several unfamiliar concepts: Condensed Matter Physics, the S (or scattering) Matrix, reading and understanding Exchange Diagrams. The way that Susskind writes is very low key but it's also like taking a corse in Theoretical Physics and listening to Professor Susskind give one of his lectures. Mixed in with the hard science are references to other scientists and their theories, thoughts on his colleagues and past interaction with them. His colorful analogies help the reader to visualize some very abstract concepts. Is he partial to his own thoughts and theories? Of course he is, that's why he wrote the book in the first place. It's up to the reader to take it to the next level and consult other writers for any, possibly alternative, conclusions. Susskind closes his book with a chapter on Summing Up and an Epilogue in which he does some speculating on the future of Theoretical Physics, String Theory and various odds and ends. He also talks about some of his fellow scientists and their thoughts, pro and con, on the theories in this book. The Kindle edition does not include any bibliography for other works in this field though the author does recommend a couple of book in his Notes. There is no cross reference index so you're kinda on your own for any book search. All in all this was a very challenging book but it was well worth my time and it provided me with lots of food for thought, I highly recommend it. While I had no downloading problems with the Kindle edition I did notice a problem with the ""chapter notes"" that the reader should be aware of. Normally, when there's a chapter note to be read, it's indicated by a number in the text that you click on and the system takes you to that particular note. In this edition, however, when you click on, say, #5 the system will take you to #6. At that point all you have to do is back page to the correct note. Still, the editors should have done a quality-control review before publishing the e-book. No biggie, but just saying. Last Ranger "
16,0316155799,http://goodreads.com/user/show/8145729-brett,3,"This book contains interesting theories of origin concerning the universe as a whole, as well as the various quantum particles the universe is understood to be comprised of. This book gives its theories free of the God-of-the-gaps explanation that: ""God made it so"", which I agree is completely sensible and expected in a real science book, since science deals with matters of the physical world and only its most necessary constituents, not matters of faith or philosophy.The book contains many profound facts on elementary particles and fundamental forces, and it is an interesting read on these points alone, however the ""the Illusion of Intelligent Design"" part of the title should have never been published as part of the title as there is ZERO argument against intelligence or its uncanny ability TO design, that doesn't surpass the sophistication of: ""it appears designed, but it really isn't"" unless you believe the mere existence of particles and equations to be sufficient evidence to reject intelligence, in which case, in my humble opinion such a claim backfires because it takes intelligence to even make sense of 'particles and equations' in the first place...I was so waiting for this ""illusion"" to be revealed, and it never happened. I'm sure having that as part of the title helped sell more copies though...The fact is, there is no force, either guided or unguided that can create the level of sophistication that we see 'intelligence' doing every day in all manner of disciplines and creative ways. Until one comes along, I'll be a major skeptic of those who belittle it's scope and capability. A person can decry the validity of intelligence to CREATE something you'd PREFER to be blindly natural, but that hardly stands as any more compelling proof than accepting the opposite based on inferring from what we know intelligence is already capable of. In my opinion such a rejection of common experience offers far LESS proof."
17,0316155799,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1714801-yael,5,"THE COSMIC LANDSCAPE tells the intriguing story of the gradual acceptance by physicists of the implications of certain weird aspects of quantum mechanics, implications that entail an infinite multiverse or megaverse comprising endless populations of universes of every conceivable form and variety. Here, too, is the story of the battle between the proponents of Intelligent Design, who draw on quantum mechanics to try to show that our universe is uniquely fashioned for life and intelligence, and scientists who believe that our universe arose as a result of natural processes, its hospitability to life and intelligence a product of scientifically comprehensible phenomena. When Susskind was a student, he was laughed at by his scientific idols for his ideas -- ideas which are now the solid stuff of physics. Over the last century, physical science has growth from Newtonian mechanics to Einsteinian relativity to a quantum-mechanical wonderland, a process that Susskind details beautifully in this fascinating book. For newcomers to quantum mechanics, it's slow going at first, but Susskind's patient, step-by-step discussion of basic concepts is understandable to any intelligent reader, and soon the novice has enough of the new concepts under his belt such that the reading begins to go faster and faster. By the end, one is whizzing through the brave new multiverse the author has introduced to us, delighting in every parsec of it. I got my copy through the Science Fiction Book Club; that's how accessible it is even to laymen. I loved it."
18,0316155799,http://goodreads.com/user/show/30982871-james-f,3,"Leonard Susskind is the co-discoverer of string theory, and has many other physics accomplishments to his credit. Unfortunately, being a good popular writer does not seem to be one of them. This book is somewhat rambling and repetitive; it does not explain string theory as understandably to the layman as Brian Greene, or the Anthropic Principle as well as Lee Smolin. There was very little new in this book that I hadn't read before. To be fair, though, the book was not intended simply as a popularization of physics, but as a discussion of how the concept of the Landscape affects the meaning of the Anthropic Principle as a philosophical concept -- how it answers the problem of ""the illusion of intelligent design."" On the positive side, the book was very straightforward and focused on the science -- none of the ""gosh-wow"" that turns me off to some popularizers -- and it was interesting to see how a leader in the field interprets some of the ideas that I have read about by other authors. The final chapter deals with his dispute with Steve Hawking on Black Holes and information; I will be reading his book on that subject next."
19,0316155799,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1423502-drchak,3,"String theory has a multitude of solutions resulting in many possible universes each with its version of physics - the ""cosmic landscape"" is the solution space of all possible universes. Some are friendly to life and many others that do not. What is special about our universe? A potential answer relies on the anthropic principle that has gone out of fashion a few hundred years ago. Susskind and others incl Weinberg have embraced this - meaning our universe is one of many. From a layman's perspective I can believe this given what seems to be the evidence. But as with quantum theory this notion seems very alien to us.Interesting perspective on how the universe is not ""elegant"" with a mish mash of particles, forces, dark matter, dark energy etc. Sometimes the book touches on a few tantalizing subjects and moves on - I was left scratching my head on quite a few topics. The penalty of being a layperson i guess!"
20,0316155799,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4696922-ushan,2,"Both the fundamental constants of nature (the mass of an up or down quark divided by the mass of an electron, the fine structure constant etc.) and the initial conditions of the Universe at the time of the Big Bang seem very fine-tuned for our existence; if they had been even slightly different, organized matter would not exist. Susskind says that perhaps there are many universes, each with its own constants, but only those where the constants are close to ours have beings like ourselves. I don't get it. If the fine structure constant is different in different universes, it must have been drawn from some probability distribution, which we cannot estimate because we only have one sample. So instead of one number for which we don't know where it came from we have many numbers, the moments of the distribution. Are these numbers the true constants of nature, or are they themselves drawn from some distributions? Is it turtles all the way down?"
21,0316155799,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5268904-david-hammond,4,"This book is a wonderful review of 20th and 21st century physics. Susskind does an amazing job of explaining things so that a layman such as myself can understand them, or at least get a better sense of what truly understanding them would mean. Although I know that I will forget many of the finer points in short order, I at least feel that I now have a better grasp of many of the major advances in physics from the last century.Susskind spends a great deal of time and energy in this book defending the anthropic principle, and I found these parts of the book the least interesting. Perhaps I am not embroiled enough in the debate to totally get the point of it. As he explains it, the anthropic principle is a framework for explaining and exploring the properties of our universe. It is not, I don't think, the only framework for doing so. Oh, well, that's not for us laymen to argue about."
22,0316155799,http://goodreads.com/user/show/8463644-ed-terrell,4,"This is one of the better books that I have read about Quantum Mechanics. It combines theory, common sense with a touch of the historical developments in physics and cosmology. I have always thought that understanding the development of ideas was key to a better grasp of the facts and Susskind hits on this with all cylinders firing. He moves effortlessly from discussions of the standard model to virtual particles hopping into and out of existence, as well as those moving backward in time. From quantum jitters and quantum fluctuations to Feynman diagrams and vacuum diagrams, the book rolls along nicely until I got tied up in knots with the complexity of string theory and needed to skip the last 100 pages. I suppose since the brightest minds can't yet quite agree on how this actually works, I'm not going feel bad. Sometimes the overriding complexities and inconsistencies reminded me of the Ptolemy universe. If the explanation is too complicated we might be missing something."
23,0316155799,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2436371-dennis-littrell,3,"Mostly an unconvincing justification of string theoryThe first thing to note is Professor Susskind's insistence on using 14 billion years as the time since the Big Bang whereas most authorities today give 13.7 billion years. He does not explain why. That of course is a minor point. More troubling is Susskind's unconvincing and quixotic support of the anthropic principle in cosmology. He characterizes the principle as ""really shorthand for a much richer set of concepts that I will make clear in the chapters that follow."" (p. 7)Unfortunately--perhaps revealing the poverty of my discernment--after reading nearly four hundred pages of rather dense text I was not able to appreciate his ""richer set of concepts."" What I do know is that ""The Anthropic Cosmological Principle"" (title of John D. Barrow and Frank J. Tipler's book from 1986), which I like to call the ""anthropic cosmological fallacy,"" is really a kind of mystical expression that declares we are here only because of a miraculous series of events or conditions, when in fact we are here precisely because we are the sort of creatures that those events and conditions allow.A better way to state the cosmological anthropic principle is simply this: if things in the universe were not as they are we would not be here. This avoids the unfortunate suggestion that somehow we cause the universe to be the way it is. We cause nothing. We are a result--an example--of what is possible considering the way the universe is. Notice ""a"" result, ""an"" example. Other beings might be here if the laws were different.On page 363 Susskind writes that the anthropic principle ""provides marvelous explanatory power for questions like, why is the cosmological constant small?"" But this is not so. It happens that this “small” (small relative to what?) cosmological constant is compatible with a universe that allows life as we know it to exist. Again there is no causation, and life itself provides no explanation for a small cosmological constant. If aphids appear in your garden we can say that they would not appear in your garden if you grew cacti instead of vegetables. This does not mean that the growing of vegetables caused the existence of aphids. It merely says that of all the places that aphids could exist, your vegetable garden is one of them.In the glossary Susskind defines the anthropic principle as ""The principle that requires the laws of nature to be consistent with the existence of intelligent life."" If we turn this around and say that ""the physical characteristics of intelligent life must be consistent with the laws of nature,"" we can better see the direction of causality and why most physicists consider the anthropic principle to be vacuous.It would help a lot if Susskind and others when they use phrases such as ""for life to develop"" to include the left-out qualification ""for life to develop as we know it."" That way they will be reminded that all this ""fine-tuning""(a phrase that implies a fine-tuner, by the way) they are raving about is just an after-the-fact projection of an anthropomorphic perspective.Another problem I had with this book is Susskind's unrelenting endorsement of string theory as something proven and true, as something ""discovered."" Also annoying is his answer to the fact that string theory has no--zero--experimental support: namely that experimental support isn't really necessary. See especially Chapter Nine ""On Our Own?"" in which he speculates on whether the Standard Model in particle physics (and of course string theory) could have been discovered without experimental verification. It might be better if Susskind said that he and the others ""designed"" or ""created"" string theory instead of saying they ""discovered"" it, which suggests that string theory is somehow true. A mathematical representation of the world is what they ""discovered.""I also don't think that Susskind did a very good job of explaining why we should believe that string theory is an accurate description of our universe. I had the sense of a man trying to support his prodigal son by saying ""Trust me he's going to turn out right"" despite the fact that he hasn't done anything yet to prove it. ""Just see how good-looking he is!"" Well string theory may be a beautiful mathematical edifice, but until some beautiful experimental support comes along, it will remain as it objectively is, just one way of describing reality.Curiously, after all the confident expressions about the truth of string theory, Susskind describes string theory as ""our best guess for a theory of nature."" (p. 302) Now it’s a guess!By the by, Susskind explains that after many years famed physicist Stephen Hawking gave up his heretical idea that information is lost in black holes and came around to agree with Susskind and most physicists that information cannot be lost. What is not mentioned in this book is Hawking's addendum. I suspect it is not mentioned since it amounts to a satire on Susskind's position. What Hawking said was that the information lost in black holes in this part of the ""megaverse"" would be preserved in other parts in which there are no black holes. In other words, Hawking came up with an argument, like that of Susskind's Landscape, which relied on information from parts of the universe which can never be reached! The salient point is that his statement, like the reality of Susskind's ""Landscape,"" cannot be proven one way or the otherSometimes we reveal ourselves and our ideas without meaning to. In reference to the idea of supersymmetry, Susskind writes, ""…the whole exercise was only a mathematical game, a pure theoretical exploration of a new kind of symmetry that a world--some world not our own--might possess."" (p. 241)Could this be an unconscious but accurate expression of the true nature of string theory? --Dennis Littrell, author of “The World Is Not as We Think It Is”"
24,0316155799,http://goodreads.com/user/show/329588-adam,0,Wasn't great but wasn't bad. Everything in the book was put into good wording for breakdowns and it's obvious that he's not blowing smoke. There were 2 weak points. One is that the chapters tend to ramble and become incredibly dry. He usually brings up something simply to tell you that it's in another chapter. My main problem was that it never actually goes into the concept of string theory and intelligent design. I can see how a physicist would think he addressed the topic but it's really string theory and the anthropomorphic principle. Suskin seems to consider these the same things but that's only true through the semantics of a physicist. From a layman or even a philosopher the ideas can be connected but are not the same. It was interesting and smart but not the book I was hoping to read.
25,0316155799,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2539590-dan-martin,0,"Okay, it would be unfair of me to give this any sort of ranking due to the simple fact that I understood about five percent of it. W-bosons, quarks, photons, and all the other particles of the universe that I will never grasp are right up there with mathematics for me - completely over my head. That aside, the five percent I did understand was awesome. Like, for example, the idea that String Theorists are constantly looking for that one unique, elegant theorem that explains why we exist, what are we doing in this universe, etc. It's no different, at least in my eyes, than what I as a storyteller am searching for - that one unique, elegant universal theme. Anyway, if that's all I got out of this book, it was worth it. And for anyone who loves mathematics and String Theory, this book is definitely for you. "

Yet Dr. Susskind has the good sense to reveal his fleekness by referring to God as ""she"". He asks the question, ""If the universe is intelligently designed by a supernatural being, who designed the designer?"" Wow! Never heard that one before! The answer, based on the last 2500 years of theological development, is: the definition of an intelligent designer is also one who is not himself created or designed. In other words, it's possible that designing and creating are human ideas, not a characteristic of God. A decent read overall, but somewhat hard to follow especially if you are not familiar with the vocabulary."
27,0316155799,http://goodreads.com/user/show/53100033-jody,4,"In describing the universe, Susskind really sums the book up best himself: ""A Landscape of possibilities populated by a megaverse of actualities."" And on the question of God: ""I have no need of this hypothesis.""Without a more technical knowledge of the mathematics involved, I feel like Susskind can only give us a mere glimpse at a far more astounding Landscape that theoretical physicists are be able to see.No one, at least to my satisfaction, can yet answer the question, ""Why Something rather than Nothing?"" But Susskind does a good job of explaining how unimaginably vast that Something may really be."

Definitely knocks Warped Passages out of the water when it comes to how well written it is and how well explained the topics are! I gotta say, Leonard Susskind is my idol and I hope to work in the string theory field of physics one day so I may be bias, but the way he explains the rolled up dimensions is phenomenal! No equations! Except one minor one somewhere... but it was fairly simple. If you're curious about modern science and advanced physics but don't have any formal education in the subject, don't fret, it's easy to read and very interesting. "

The only thing that is disturbing is the overly certain tone, with no skeptic sense for questioning.

Book attempts to reconcile seemingly serendipitous physical constants against an argument for Intelligent Design by showing how an anthropomorphic viewpoint can be used to discover more of how how physical universe can be explained. It inverts the logic of a universe built for us to one of understanding this universe because we are here.
