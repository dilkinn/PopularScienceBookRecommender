0,0393058638,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2231715-lewis-weinstein,4,"I'm taking a course at Oxford this summer on ""The Brain and the Senses."" So this is a little extra homework. The idea of memory, where thoughts come from, etc., is fascinating to me. And, many years ago, before I was there, Kandel had his laboratory at the Public Health Research Institute, of which I was later CEO. I'll post more when I get into it.I HAVE NOW COMPLETED BOTH THE COURSE AND KANDEL'S BOOK.BOTH WERE TERRIFIC!The course, offered by Oxford tutor Gillie McNeill, combined descriptions of sensory processes with an explanation of the underlying molecular activity that integrates the incoming perceptions and what's already in memory to create a coherent narrative.We started by eating a cracker and considering what was involved in our individual perceptions of that event ... taste, smell, sight, feel, sound, and memory of crackers and herbs previously ingested. Quite a bit for the first few minutes of the course.Kandel’s book offers enchanting glimpses of his life story, the history of brain psychology and science, and a description of the experiments (of Kandel and others) which are moving our understanding of the brain forward at an incredible pace while also revealing just how little we still know.Kandel’s decision, early in his career, to begin his life’s work with the study of a single cell, set the stage for the way he approached his work. He decided to study the giant marine snail Aplysia as his first means to understand how information was brought into a cell and transferred out to another cell. Learn how that happens, multiply by tens of billions, and you have a working human brain.These quotes may communicate the excitement of Kandel’s journey (which by the way led to a Nobel prize)...“the realization that the workings of the brain - the ability not only to perceive but to think, learn, and store information - may occur through chemical as well as electrical signals expanded the appeal of brain science from anatomists and electro-physiologists to biochemists.”“I was testing the idea that the cellular mechanisms underlying learning and memory are likely to have been conserved through evolution and therefore to be found in simple animals.”“We pointed out the importance of discovering what actually goes on at the level of the synapse (the place where signals are passed from one cell to another) when behavior is modified by learning.”This last quote is almost a synopsis of what the course at the Oxford Experience was about. It turns out that there is considerable growth and change in the brain connections and that this goes on all the time. Your brain has changed since you started reading this review."

From epithets of Anti-Semitism to meeting his wife and the beautiful shining brain stuff of legend is found within. “Without memory, we would be nothing” and we discover words---like swords “böser jude” delineating the struggles of Jews in Austria and leaving parents behind at 9 years old. The cerebral cortex is concerned with perception, action, language, and planning. Three structures lie within…amygdala coordinates autonomic and endocrine responses in the context of emotional states. —Eric R. Kandel How is a neuron like a signal? Inside this book we explore this and Freud (as usual) has a part in deciphering. In the brain---hard cheese like consistency—each cell is truly unique. Faces and how they are processed by the brain and the reactivity on the parts of facial recognition is an interesting study. We find how our responses gauge our reality at the time and what our brain retains. Information in a neural circuit travels, in what way? Noting well that this is a book review and not a report---and we take a voyage to Kristallnacht (1938) with Dr. Kandel and the transition of Vienna from being the center of culture to a place of oppression and humiliation. Personally, I can attest and confer being in Vienna (one of the most stunning cities in the world) it’s hard to imagine the horror that occurred. Must read! Savor, buy and share with loved ones."
2,0393058638,http://goodreads.com/user/show/16212136-peter-pete-mcloughlin,5," Kandel is a neuroscientist and polymath with a fascinating life story and a great contributor to neuroscience and nerve cell biology in memory and cognition. Easily traveling between the worlds of history, Philosophy, and the hard science of brain physiology Kandel is a gifted writer with broad experience. There are many reasons to pick up this book for the history, the science, and just the curiosity on what makes us tick from an extraordinary individual in extraordinary times. Definitely something worth reading."
3,0393058638,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2128737-gerald,5,"I'm really enjoying this book so far, especially as I'm considering a career in neuroscience research. Kandel's memoirs are both personal and historical. Reading about Kandel's personal growth to eventually become one of the leading scientists of the field has given me much opportunity to reflect on my own career goals. Also learning about the historical development of neuroscience as a discipline has been an interesting to the field as well (and much lighter to read than Principles of Neuroscience!). "
4,0393058638,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3897817-morgan-blackledge,4,"Warning: this book can be a little dull in the autobiographical sections (which you are free to skim), and a bit challenging in some of the technical parts (particularly if you are new to the nuts and bolts of cognitive neuroscience). But if you're a cognitive neuroscience dork (like me) and you love reading about the history of science (like me), and if you are reading this book on an e-reader, so you can pop back and forth between the text and web based resources e.g. Wikipedia etc. (like me), than this book is amazing! It's part autobiography of a son of a middle class Viennese toy merchant, who came to America as a child refugee from Nazi Germany, and went on to become a founder of a revolutionary new branch of science, and then was awarded a Nobel prize, and then kept going. This book is also an account of the 150 year (+) emergence of neuroscience and its confluence with molecular biology, psychiatry, behaviorism and cognitive science (eventually to become its own sub discipline, cognitive neuroscience). Additionally, this book functions as a step by step primer (more or less a condensed text book) on the biological sub straights of learning and memory, beginning with the neuron doctrine, and proceeding up to our current cutting edge, without omitting any important steps along the way. Lastly, this book serves a tacit function as an advice manual for young students who want to answer big questions (like what is consciousness), but really should begin by looking at small things (like neurons). I think of this book as the ultimate supplemental reading (or refresher) for any bio psych, or cognitive psych course. It really fills in some of the big blanks and brings the data to life, making it more human and thusly, much more memorable (irony aside), and therefore, much more functional/useable. If you have a real interest in the mind and brain (like me). And if you love to learn a subject both in the abstract, and from within a personal and historical context (like me), than I think you'll love this book."
5,0393058638,http://goodreads.com/user/show/8887610-anca,5,"This is one of the most eye-opening books I have ever read. It was not easy reading it as I constanly felt the urge to pay 100% attention in order not to miss anything and to try to understand and decode all the precious information that I had before my eyes. It was more of a study book from which I've learned about history, psychology, biology and genetics.Reading this book, I've learned that anxiety and depression are disorders of emotion whilst schizophrenia is a disorder of thought. I've learned that mental illnesses are caused by both genetics and environmental factors. I've learned that proteins' synthesis are the basis of long term memory and that Drosophila, better known as the annoying fruit-fly, is a key experimental tool for the scientific studies. I've learned that what we believe to be a conscious action is actually initiated by the unconscious, but it get's to be validated by consciousness. ""Our conscious mind may not have free will, but it does have free wont"", Richard Gregory and Vilayanur RamachandranThis book will remain a reference for me and I know that I will come back to it to refresh my memory, because, as Kandel himself says, practice makes it perfect.  "
6,0393058638,http://goodreads.com/user/show/966448-patricia,4,"A very readable science book for the layperson, explaining the basic neuroscience of memory. The author, a Nobel-prize-winning neuroscientist, weaves three threads together: a memoir about his own life, the history of thought and research on the workings of the brain, and an account of his own research into the biochemistry and physiology of memory formation. It's a tribute to the author's lucidity that I--whose 10th-grade biology class was 40 years ago now--was able to understand a lot of complex, cutting-edge science research. I expected to hit the wall that I always hit in reading an interesting-sounding Scientific American article, where the first paragraph poses a fascinating question, the second paragraph makes me think I'm ever so clever for understanding so much science, and the third paragraph loses me entirely at about the fourth word. But every time Kandel approached what I thought would be that sudden wall in his scientific explanations, he switched neatly back to an episode of his own life, thus leading me through the whole book believing that I was quite clever. Kandel's own early history, leaving Vienna just ahead of complete Nazi takeover, is compelling. He offers lots of insights for outsiders into the scientific research community, and a lot of history of how we came to know what we know about the human brain and consciousness.I read the book on my Kindle and didn't realize there was a helpful glossary until I had finished the book."
7,0393058638,http://goodreads.com/user/show/20989544-laura,5,"A remarkable book about memory, it may also work as an introduction to neuroscience, though, some background in neuroanatomy and related areas may be required.When I read the synopsis: ''Nobel Prize winner Kandel intertwines cognitive psychology, neuroscience, and molecular biology with his own quest to understand memory. '' I thought the book was going to be very technical and arduous, so I prepared myself for that. However, when I started reading it, I discovered that it was really easy-readable. Further, I didn't know that it also was an autobiography and I truly enjoyed those parts, because when you want to follow a similiar path, it's good reading about what others have done. As I said, the book is mixed with his life (marriage, nazi period, Nobel prize), his discoveries, other scientists discoveries and explanations about memory/the brain. Ofyenly, the last was hard to get, not because the concepts were difficult, just because the rhythm in the book changes. Therefore, sometimes you are reading about his life, and then he starts speaking about the brain, its chemistry, anatomy.. etc. I got used to it, but it maybe a little bit disturbing.I found it weirdly interesting when he talked about psychoanalysis (he was going for that career path. Nonetheless, he decided to go for Neuroscience). Psychoanalysis is not dead for him, he even talks about it getting a bit together with neurology. For me, that's a ridiculous idea, I think they are really opposite, but I am curious, so if anyone knows a book that talks about that idea, I will welcome it.Great book anyway."
8,0393058638,http://goodreads.com/user/show/95878161-ardon-pillay,5,"Simply magnificent. Kandel, who is perhaps one of medicine’s lesser known Nobel laureates, outlines the major advances in neural science over the last hundred or so years, from Ramon y Cajal's seminal work on neurons to the most recent advances in understanding how consciousness works. He is a champion of the reductionist approach for understanding how executive functions and emotions come about. His exploration of how we know how nerves work is truly a testament to the inherent logic that underlies the functioning of physiological systems. Memory, which is the main focus of the book, is explained using the central tenets of how neurons work, making it very easy to understand. However, as Kandel does acknowledge, there is a lot more work that needs to be done - we only really have some pieces of the overall ""memory jigsaw,"" and once we have more pieces, we can start putting it together to get a better idea of how memories are retained in the brain. The work Kandel himself has done is quite incredible; he discovered the underlying molecular basis of strengthening connections between neurons during operant conditioning and learning. Funnily enough, it links to one of the most prominent intracellular secondary messengers - cyclic adenosine monophosphate. His analysis of how this messenger leads to growth of synaptic terminals forms the scientific basis for popular memory techniques like active recall and space repetition. What is most curious of all is that these studies were not based on humans, they were on a sea snail! Despite the magnitude of the impact Kandel has made on neuroscience, he is remarkably humble, pausing only near the end of the book to describe the Nobel ceremony, but otherwise, mentioning the win only once or twice. He also explores his Austrian heritage, and how Austria, like Germany, was subject to intense anti-semitism during Hitler's rule. I suppose my main takeaway from this book is that there is a lot of beauty in the rationality that is built into physiological systems, from the brain down to individual blood vessels."
9,0393058638,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1627591-robert,4,"This is an improbable book by an improbable man. Eric Kandel fled Vienna with his parents and brother when he was nine, just as the Nazis were moving in. The family settled in New York where Eric excelled in school and then went to Harvard to be...an intellectual historian...no, a psychoanalyst...no, a Nobel-prize winning brain scientist. Here, he weaves elements of his personal autobiography together with elements of his scientific biography. There are many ways to get at the science he presents, but this is a good one, starting with work at the cellular level on learning and moving toward memory and the role of genes in the multiple components of the brain. For a nonscientist this book can be demanding but also astonishing. Kandel's story takes us several important steps toward understanding the interaction of organic features of human life with environmental features (nature v nurture). We end up with no ""ghost in the machine"" but a mysterious ability to take experience and record it at the molecular level, where memories are stored.Kandel's life really is his fascination with science, his attachment to his wife, and his generosity toward his scientific colleagues. Once he is clear of Vienna, he has the freedom to explore, examine and verify the underpinnings of what he calls ""mind,"" not ""the mind."" Along the way he helps elevate biology, previously a descriptive science, to the analytic/synthetic heights of chemistry and physics. This exposition reminds us of our capabilities as human beings while at the same time illustrating the ways in which science outstrips social reality. The things we can do scientifically simply dwarf our abilities to fashion just, liberal societies.Kandel continues to believe that Freud, originally a neurologist, remains relevant, particularly in the dimensions of understanding the conscious, the pre-conscious, and the unconscious. He frequently cites Freud's speculations about how much more his generation had to learn about the brain and how future generations undoubtedly would advance new paradigms for understanding it. The ultimate problem, of course, is subjectivity: why do certain experiences evoke different reactions in different individuals, all of whom really do see pretty much the same blue and hear pretty much the same note C.Kandel often mentions his love of music, but he doesn't reach the obvious conclusion: the role of the artist is to fashion a compelling aesthetic subjectivity to which the multitude can have access. Art is the deepest exploration of mind we know. That's why it is so hard to produce."
10,0393058638,http://goodreads.com/user/show/193848-piotr,3,"One of the biggest questions plaguing behavioral biologists during the 20th century was the localization of the engram, or, a memory trace in the brain. Well, most of them who weren't dualists were looking in the brain. One of the most thorough studies of engram localization was performed by Karl Lashley, who spent a good chunk of his career doing cortical lesions on rodents and primates. he sums up his (mostly) negative results with this quote:""I sometimes feel, in reviewing the evidence on the localization of the memory trace, that the necessary conclusion is that learning just is not possible...Nevertheless, in spite of such evidence against it, learning does sometimes occur.""That was 1954 or so. We're in the 21st century now, and how far have we come on localizing an engram? Some would claim we know more about memory circuits than any other brain function. Others would claim that memory is a lie, and we can't be sure we really remember anything. Those people usually wear kilts and clutter state university philosophy departments.Kandel's autobiography is a nice mix of personal history, scientific history, and the the charmingly naïve obsessions which drive many of the greatest scientific discoveries of our time. He describes how he pioneered the use of the invertebrate Aplysia as a model system to study cellular bases of associative learning, in a network of some <1000 neurons. He also chronicles the discoveries of his peers working in other systems such as mammals, and discusses many convergent and divergent themes in the field of synaptic plasticity. The language is by far accessible to anyone with a rudimentary grasp of the English language, so no need to fear a bloated lesson in advanced neurophysiology.The most interesting aspect of the book is his description of cultural history. I would have actually liked him to go more in depth into this (although others on this site have voiced differing opinions) as heritage is a great analogy to a sort of ""cultural memory."" This would have strengthened the autobiography as a trans-subject analysis of science, history, and autobiography instead of a memoir. He describes his efforts to reconcile certain moral battles which are still being fought in Europe, and briefly, his approaches to preserving his own culture."
11,0393058638,http://goodreads.com/user/show/52456301-adnan-khaleel,5,"Really good book that describes neuronal function from the ground up, and does so in a very easy to understand way. The one thing I did notice is that the book is semi autobiographical and I wasn’t expecting this. It doesn’t detract too much from its central purpose but even so, its a great book on the subject. "
12,0393058638,http://goodreads.com/user/show/8235474-ruxandra,5,"After reading this book I feel it is the only one I've read, apart from MAUS, that deserves five stars."
13,0393058638,http://goodreads.com/user/show/24377699-cheese,3,"Torn with this one. It’s an autobiography of someone I knew little about. I read this to gain insight into cognitive memory and relearning over bad habits. In the end this became in depth into the science of memory. I mean this stuff pans over decades, so it’s detail can be off putting even for someone so interested in biology as I. A well written book, but it doesn’t flow very easily. It was a slog. "
14,0393058638,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2422276-mag,5,"A unique blend of memoir and science describing Kandel’s (Nobel prize winner for Physiology or Medicine in 2000) quest for memory both at the personal and scientific level. Kandel, a 9 year old Jew in Vienna in 1938, starts his book with his memories of Anschluss and Kristallnacht, describes the vividness of these memories and how years later they made him interested in why and how certain memories are remembered while others are lost. Throughout his career, he tackled brain and memory research at different levels from molecular biology to psychoanalysis, his most groundbreaking research being on Aplysia, a sea snail with very simple, yet molecularly big nervous system. All stages of this research are described exquisitely well in the book. Extremely informative and enlightening on all levels. I could have lived without some parts of the personal account, though. In particular, I had a bit of a problem with the overly self-righteous tone of some of his personal tales.Link: Kandel’s lecture on memory loss and aging http://www.iwf.de/iwf/do/mkat/details.aspx?Signatur=C 128844.5/5"
15,0393058638,http://goodreads.com/user/show/25375533-sarah-jane,4,"Kandel creates a tangible link between “speculative metaphysics” (9) and experimental research. At once, this is a story of Kandel’s self and a story of creating and finding the space where the conceptual self can take shape. Kandel weaves his personal history into the history of biological inquiry into the nature of the mind. His method is ambitious, but, as an initially skeptical reader, I ultimately found it deeply meaningful. Through unifying philosophical, physiological, and his personal conceptions of the mind, Kandel leads us to consider that, perhaps, the space between these divergent ideas is the space in which we can find the utmost clarity on a range of fundamental metaphysical questions. Kandel ends his story through expressing gratitude for the fact that he had the privilege to explore these questions throughout his life and career. His words are humble but self-aware, at once light-hearted and blunt regarding the uglier parts of his personal history. I finished Kandel’s book grateful to have become acquainted with the honest, bright human voice behind such grand ideas. "
16,0393058638,http://goodreads.com/user/show/21689794-konstantin-okonechnikov,5,The book provides a perfect explanation how difficult it is to be a real scientist and how to combine so many factors in life and research. A perfect motivation. And also with strong bias in my topic of interest: everything about memory.
17,0393058638,http://goodreads.com/user/show/92721414-will-dorrell,3,"Nobel Laureate talks about his life and career - gives a broad strokes description of the cellular and molecular basis of memory and the progress it took from zero in the 1950s to hero in 2000. In no small part due to the author.Enjoyable, occasionally biochemically dense, but usually remarkably lucid (for a scientist). For those of you still unconvinced that abstract concepts like memory can be pinned down to molecules in nerve cells this is an effective antidote."
18,0393058638,http://goodreads.com/user/show/60793429-john-turlockton,0,An autobiography rather than detailing the neuroscience of the mind. I don't want to give it a rating cause it's not bad it's just not what I wanted.
19,0393058638,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7463675-steve,3,"This book more-or-less successfully combined an autobiography and a research history into a holistic narrative of the life's work of the author. I would highly recommend it to anyone interested in learning more about how brains enable animals to change their responses to environmental events.The title captures the main theme of the book as far as the research aspect is concerned: Kandel spent much of his life examining neurons and related biological structures to determine a measurable, experimentally verifiable, biological basis for memory and learning. It was at times thrilling and other times a bit dry to read about lines of experiments to probe the inner workings of cells and how they enable learned responses to stimuli. I believe I would've gotten a bit more out of the book if I had a stronger background in biology (something beyond high-school bio), but it did leave me very interested in learning more about the rise of the empirical study of ""mind"". Much of these parts of the book will also provide guidance and inspiration to young scholars regardless of discipline (and can be summed up by: work really hard, work with other really smart people, and don't be afraid to move around to find the best place for you to succeed). The importance of the scientific community is also on display in this book: discoveries don't happen in isolation, they take collaborators and competitors to help stimulate fruitful inquiry.While certainly many more pages were devoted to the Nobel winning science that shaped Kandel's life, a substantial amount of space was spent characterizing the role of Vienna, Judaism, and family in Kandel's life. He is a testament to the importance of strong family relationships: escaping Nazi-held Austria as a child with the help of relatives in America, having a supportive wife who was essentially a single mother to allow Kandel time to his scientific pursuits, and having grown children who recognize the important work their father did and tolerated his absence from parts of their childhood (though still give him some lip about it). Kandel also placed great emphasis on being Jewish and the role faith played in his life - the book isn't preachy, but it doesn't ignore his religious background either. It's impossible to talk about 1930's Vienna without talking about Judaism in any event. As the Nazi movement spread into Austria and Jews were first marginalized and then persecuted, Kandel laments the loss of the intellectual center of Europe at that time (and dutifully highlights the role Jews had in building Vienna's intellectual elite). This is an important point that he would later be able to revisit upon earning the Nobel prize. Invited to celebrate another intellectual win as a native son of Vienna, Kandel took the opportunity to shine a light on the persistent anti-semitic views of too many citizens of Vienna. To be honest, I didn't realize that Holocaust denial or down-play was even possible in Europe in recent times, and I wish Kandel and his collaborators well on their current efforts to address that issue.Finally, I will end on a note about the tone of the book. I found Kandel to come off as being a little condescending in places, especially when he was writing about the scientific discovery process. Obviously, Kandel is brilliant and is writing from a position of knowledge, but I just felt as though he could have made more of an effort to come across as an equal rather than a superior. Just an opinion, but I don't think it detracts from the book overall."
20,0393058638,http://goodreads.com/user/show/46716836-andrew-kosenko,5,"This is a wonderful book. Part biography, part intellectual history, part first-rate survey of neuroscience. Or -perhaps- all biography, all intellectual history, all neuroscience. An intellectually and aesthetically beautiful work of a great mind and a phenomenal scientist. The joy of science, and the dark history of anti-semitism in Vienna, scientific triumphs and deaths of close friends and colleagues, inimitably clear descriptions of complicated scientific phenomena and the stories of their discovery, a child’s poem about sea slugs and a family at the Nobel prize ceremony - it’s all there in a beautiful portrait of one extraordinary scientist’s rich life. "
21,0393058638,http://goodreads.com/user/show/24914252-yuriy-stasyuk,3,"In search of memory by Robert KandelThis was a strange and unusual read. Kandel combines a personal autobiography with the history of and an introduction to neuroscience. (With footnotes from the history of the philosophy of mind). If you are here because of Kandel you may like this, if you are looking for a history of neuroscience, some of the nostalgic longing for 20th century Vienna may be distracting - it was to me - and I love history. Some key takeaways for me:• There is serious physicalist work happening at understanding the neurobiological foundation of moods, emotions, memories, personality and identity.• Any long term memory - by definition - changes the mind.• The brain has a great amount of neuroplasticity, anything that can be learned can be unlearned, and relearned. • Neuroscience solves Kantian a priori vs Lockian tabula rasa debate in philosophy. ""The anatomy of the neural circuit is a simple example of Kantian a priori knowledge, while changes in the strength of particular connections in the neural circuit reflect the influence of experience. Moreover, consistent with Locke’s notion that practice makes perfect, the persistence of such changes underlies memory.""• Declarative vs procedural memories: ""What we usually think of as conscious memory we now call, explicit (or declarative) memory. It is the conscious recall of people, places, objects, facts, and events. Unconscious memory we now call implicit (or procedural) memory. It underlies habituation, sensitization, and classical conditioning, as well as perceptual and motor skills such as riding a bicycle or serving a tennis ball.""• Emotions begin in the subconsciousness: ""a consensus is emerging on how emotions are generated. The first step is thought to be the unconscious, implicit evaluation of a stimulus, followed by physiological responses, and finally by conscious experience that may or may not persist. ""• ""Normal anxiety exists in two major forms: instinctive anxiety (instinctive or innate fear), which is built into the organism and is under more rigid genetic control, and learned anxiety (learned fear), to which an organism may be genetically predisposed but which is basically acquired through experience. - Both forms of fear can be deranged. Instinctive anxiety is pathological when it is excessive and persistent enough to paralyze action. Learned anxiety is pathological when it is provoked by events that present no real threat,""• ""Depressed people express a systematic negative bias in the way they think about life. They almost invariably have unrealistically high expectations of themselves, overreact dramatically to any disappointment, put themselves down whenever possible, and are pessimistic about their future. This distorted pattern of thinking… is not simply a symptom, a reflection of a conflict lying deep within the psyche, but a key agent in the actual development and continuation of the depressive disorder."""
22,0393058638,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1086452-dia,4,"Kandel begins and ends his memoir/neuroscience primer with bold declarations of faith, that consciousness itself, as well as (and of perhaps even greater import) the unconscious processes deduced by psychoanalytic investigations, can be accounted for entirely via molecular and cellular activities. The book is therefore a great education and challenge for those who are interested in the problems and possibilities of reductionism. Kandel's work, for which he won a Nobel prize, shows that the simplest forms of learning do have molecular and cellular correlates in simple animals. It seems premature, though, to get excited about reducing higher cognitive abilities to the neural level, and Kandel does acknowledge some major scientific and philosophical problems with reductionism, but mostly he remains optimistic. (Thus I was surprised to read that he once cautioned a colleague [rival?] against pursuing the question of consciousness -- it seems to go against everything he did and all that he explicitly recommends in the final chapter of his book!) Some of the interesting threads Kandel weaves throughout this memoir include his childhood in Nazi Austria and his later, surprisingly recent, efforts to help Austrians acknowledge past atrocities; the brief histories of neuroscience he gives each time he begins describing a new topic of research he pursued; his unapologetic involvement with the biotechnology industry; and the many brief but vivid and gracious portraits he offers of his colleagues. Thankfully, his writing is clear, as well. I would have liked to have learned more about Kandel's own experience with psychoanalysis. This is not a tell-all memoir, nor should it be, but some discussion of his own analysis might have helped the reader understand why Kandel remained allied with the tenets of psychoanalysis long after many reductionists would have discarded them. It might also have helped the reader understand why Kandel made some of the career moves that he made, important moves that seem inexplicable as the book now stands; for example, one professor told him to look to the cell for an understanding of the psyche -- and so he did, for the rest of his life. Without some sharing of his own analysis, Kandel deprives the reader of a clear understanding of why he became a reductionist, really -- other than that he just really enjoyed research, and research implies reductionism. On the other hand, it probably is best that he didn't air his inner dynamics -- and he has plenty to say without all that.  "
23,0393058638,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1950709-derek-davis,5,"This is a superb study of the science of mind as well as a superb study of Kandel as a human being. It traces his progress from a child escaping the Holocaust to his Nobel Prize in medicine and physiology, and beyond. Starting out in psychiatry, he switched to being a research scientist who followed his own intuitions, rather than professional advice, to slowly unfold the secrets of how memories are formed in the neural system, first in a sea snail, then in mice, finally in humans. Though the progress toward a ""theory of mind"" still has miles to go, his part in its development today is fascinating.This is probably the clearest outline of scientific research that I've ever read, but it goes well beyond that, because it is interwoven with the personal progress of a remarkable human being. His telling personal details—especially the horrifying complicity of the Austrian population in the Holocaust and the country's inability and disinterest in dealing with that shame—give special weight to his life story. Yet the most winning aspect to his writing is the balance he brings to all these details and his apparent inability to attach blame to even the most intolerant. He attempts to share all credit at every level for what he's accomplished and appears not to have a jealous or condescending molecule to his makeup.If your bent is toward biological science and the unraveling of mental processes—especially the intermediate ground that is neither pop science nor numerical overload—I can't imagine a better book. If there were a Nobel for human decency in science, Kandel would deserve it."

But, I wanted to say a few things about it in case anyone else was interested. Kandel does a fantastic job of explaining the neurobiology of learning and memory to the layman. He makes it understandable without dumbing it down. If you're interested in that, read this book. This guy is one of the greats. He has a noble prize and co-wrote Principles of Neural Science, the standard neuroscience book that every neuroscientist has. And I'm a neuroscientist. This book is part autobiography. Sorry, but although I have the utmost respect for him as a scientist, the autobiography part is pretty dull. He left Vienna in time to escape Hitler when he was a child. Other than that, boring stuff. If you're looking for a fantastic book that mixes biography and science, pick up Genius by James Gleick. It's about Richard Feynman, who's a character and a half. Gleick's other books aren't as good, so don't let that stop you. Three stars just because I applaud people who explain science well. He does that. "
25,0393058638,http://goodreads.com/user/show/81564-sarah,3,"This is half a memoir, half a book on the biological basis of cognition, and I dove into it enthusiastically. Unfortunately, there's easily enough material in here for two books, one for the personal aspects and one for the science. I burned out halfway through Kandel's career, and couldn't muster the enthusiasm to finish the final hundred-odd pages before it was due back at the library.Still, I'll keep an eye out for a used copy, because the subject is fascinating indeed: how does one study the biological foundations of thought and cognition? What's the mechanism for self-awareness? Understanding how electrical impulses are propagated between neurons is difficult enough: how do you design an experiment to measure thoughts? Kandel's certainly one for asking the big questions, and his tales of laboratory serendipity offer an amusing look inside the life of a research scientist."
26,0393058638,http://goodreads.com/user/show/25021993-biser-hong,5,Kandel has created a narrative that fuses his own scientific development and interests with the broader historical and landmark developments in neuroscience. He gradually focuses in on his own expanding research to present his own findings on memory and learning along with other related work. I found the book incredibly clearly written and his explanation of tricky scientific ideas very approachable. The autobiographical sections can be a bit unexciting but his interests in art and psychoanalysis contribute for an interesting tour of ideas. It was particularly interesting to see that in his thinking about the workings of the mind he considers ideas from a very broad spectrum - from nonempirical psychoanalytic thought to genetics.
27,0393058638,http://goodreads.com/user/show/10195778-nancy,0,What can say? This book is a great book for anyone at all interested in Neuroscience. Fascinating discoveries on why some memories are stronger than others.

With time the strength of the memories will fade. worth reading.

I do not remember myself reading a book which emphasized Jews so much, thus seeing history from the authors perspective was really educational and interesting. I wanted to give this book a five-star review, however, it did drag on a bit, so I'll take half a star away. The book did have a great overview of how the science of memory came to be, yet I wonder what happened in the past ten years, the time after the book was published. "
33,0393058638,http://goodreads.com/user/show/46238669-varun-padmanaban,4,"Kandel in his autobiography gives not only an elegant and thoughtful account of his Nobel-prize winning research career but beautifully explains memory and all of the researchers who have pushed that frontier alongside Kandel. He begins with the cultural anti-semitism (along with ‘radical’) that is prevalent in Vienna before he is forced to emigrate to the United States to escape. This anti-semitism is a source of angst for Kandel as he laments over the death of an intellectual haven that was Vienna. Regardless, he moves on and combines through a series of fortunate experiences he has at the NIMH and others with a love for psychiatry and Freudian thinking. One of the things I was looking for was the fact that he had initially no idea what he wanted to work on but eventually did come up with a question that he found passionate enough to explore. And in this he took a leap of faith and moved to Paris to work on the Aplysia which really brought him insecurities and a feeling that while “one cannot decide on cold facts because facts are often insufficient, one ultimately has to trust one’s unconscious, one’s instinct and one’s creative urge.” Eventually he went on to show through an elegant dissection of a primitive Aplysia reflex the molecular basis of conditional learning and eventually went on to show the underlying molecular mechanisms of long term memory. "
34,0393058638,http://goodreads.com/user/show/58743626-camille,4,"Kandel is well known for being an incredible scientist and creative pioneer in his field, and in this book he is also a delightful storyteller. I loved reading about his journey that led to his lifelong goal to understand the neural basis of memory, and he ties this quest beautifully with his traumatic childhood in Vienna and his initial desire in medical school to understand human consciousness through psychoanalysis. This book is introduced as being geared towards those who have little background in neuroscience, but I did learn a lot about the links between discovery that led us to what we know today (i.e. how Sutherland's discovery of second messenger cAMP helped shape Kandel's uncovering of that link to neuronal memory consolidation). I also admired his courage in moving forward with his research on a little-studied organism, the aplysia snail, and was able to make foundational discoveries at the biochemical and cellular level of memory. In his later life after winning the Nobel Prize, Kandel raised conversation and recognition of Austria's involvement in the Holocaust, bringing us back full circle to his childhood and initial college studies in history. Overall, this was a beautiful life story and would recommend to anyone interested in science, medicine, and/or history. "
35,0393058638,http://goodreads.com/user/show/39395937-rhonda-sue,4,"This is an excellent autobiography and history of brain science. The author has a nice way about him, humble and grateful and I most enjoyed the stories that accompanied his science research and career path. The science history is all good, however, as a laymen, I found some of the science too technical and glossed over it. There is a nice glossary in the back, so that is useful.The takeaway for me was that brain science and science in general is constantly evolving and changing. The fact that psychoanalysis has merged with cellular biology and neuroscience is quite fascinating. The author recounted his life story from his childhood in Vienna to his education in Brooklyn, to Harvard, and his studies from medical school to research labs, and his foray into biotech and pharma. He is a Nobel laureate and won the prize in 2000. Throughout the book there is an undercurrent and concern with anti-Semitism, particularly that of Austria, the author's birth country. Lots of discussion about lab studies and experiments in the Aplysia snail, rats, mice, etc. The story is very well written. If you want to understand brain science, even a little, you will enjoy the read but be prepared to take notes and to spend some time as the book is 430 pages excluding the glossary and endnotes. "
36,0393058638,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5424738-catie-watson,5,"This was an excellent read for me on several levels. I picked it up to learn to more about the science behind the formation of short and long term memories and was not disappointed. Dr. Kandel undertakes the task of explaining the scientific research in neurology and the mind to which he’s devoted his life. He succeeds admirably at making his descriptions simple enough for a general reader for whom high school or college biology may be a distant memory. What I hadn’t expected to find were the biographical details that showed how the memory of fleeing Austria with his family as a child to escape the Nazi regime affected the author his entire life. He also describes his efforts to make the current Austrian government and scientific community acknowledge Austria’s role in the Holocaust. Another aspect of the book that I enjoyed were the author’s descriptions of a life spent “doing science.” He is generous in his praise of colleagues and seems to have had no trouble navigating the politics of an academic career. Finally, I was touched by the love and respect with which he spoke of his wife Denise, who made sacrifices scientific career to shoulder most of the responsibility for raising their two children while he devoted himself to his passion for scientific discovery."
37,0393058638,http://goodreads.com/user/show/27127236-robert,5,"The natural sciences, abetted by technologies they themselves have made possible, have become increasingly difficult for lay people to understand. There are even a few twentieth century idioms that express this gulf: when we want to say something isn't particularly hard, we can say ""well, it's not rocket science"" or ""well, it's not brain surgery."" If we're going to ascend the heights of domains like astrophysics or neuroscience, then, those of us not fortunate enough to have studied the fields need excellent sherpas in such rarefied air. Many years ago, I read Brian Greene's The Elegant Universe, and while I wouldn't pretend to understand it (or String Theory) with any kind of refinement, I did feel like I had gotten a whole education in relativity and quantum mechanics just from the wealth of background material Greene provided. Here, Nobel laureate Eric Kandel does the same thing for the neurobiology of memory, except with even greater clarity and sense of narrative.The book is partially a memoir, which could easily make for heavy going, but it doesn't here: Kandel, an Austrian Jew, was a refugee from the Anschluss and his early years are intrinsically interesting. After accounting for his early years, Kandel quickly delves into his education and early interest in psychology and, later, neuroscience. He doesn't stop at himself, though, and this is what makes the book such a perfect, magisterial introduction: to elucidate the (often very narrow) problems of simple learning that he studied during his career, Kandel offers an account of the development of modern neuroscience by following the conjectures, questions, frustrations, and insights of scientists (and even philosophers) as they occurred. So we go all the way back to Galvani's discovery that electrical impulses could move muscle fibers; we learn how Franz Joseph Gall was expelled from Austria for hypothesizing that the mind and brain are not separate; we follow the young Freud as he conjectures that the subconscious could be biologically rooted, and Santiago Ramón y Cajal as he verifies and documents those biological roots, showing how neurons connect to one another across synaptic clefts. Instead of simply describing the action of neurotransmitters and the interplay of chemical and electrical signals in the brain, Kandel dramatizes the ""soup vs spark"" debate that raged midcentury, explaining the evidence that led scientists in different directions and showing how, when the argument was decided largely in favor of ""soup,"" some fine scientists on the losing side went on to do excellent research on brain chemistry. This rooting of a large, complex mass of information in a historical, narrative form makes In Search of Memory feel exciting: difficult and informative as it is, reading it never feels like merely eating one's vegetables. Kandel is just as clear when describing his own work, and although his discoveries of physical mechanisms for storing memories are breathtaking, he treats them with great humility. Unlike so many popular summaries of scientific work, Kandel refuses to draw conclusions beyond what the evidence actually warrants. Any speculation (e.g., does what works for a sea snail work for more complex organisms, like mice or cats or human beings?) is subjected to the most rigorous experimentation. So this book functions not just as a fine historical introduction to neuroscience, nor solely as an account of one scientists's career, but also as a masterclass in the scientific method at its best. If our culture of public debate acquired one tenth of Eric Kandel's circumspection and rigor, we would find ourselves in an improved, and unrecognizable, world.In 2017, it bears noting that the memoiristic sections of In Search of Memory contain some chilling and highly relevant details. At a dinner he attended in Austria some years after winning the Nobel, Kandel is accosted by an Austrian woman who, quite without remorse or self-awareness, tries to explain away the Kristallnacht and Austria's collaboration in the Holocaust by appealing to economic insecurity and fear that Jews unfairly dominated academic and media jobs. In another place, Kandel documents how his early mentor Harry Grundfest lost funding and suffered serious career setbacks because of McCarthyist suspicions (which proved unfounded). Kandel is optimistic about his adoptive country, but many of these patterns of thought remain with us far more than they ought to. The book is a timely warning.Near the end, Kandel diversifies his scope considerably, taking us on brief tours of the hard problem of consciousness, the emerging collaboration of neuroscientists with pharmacologists and cognitive psychologists, and new directions of research into the treatment of refractory brain diseases. He shows enormous erudition here, and even further afield, when he ruminates on Austrian modernist art or the operas of Wagner. In short, Eric Kandel is a towering intellect and, much rarer, one who can lead the general public up into the Himalayan air that he breathes with native ease. The journey is long, but if you take it, it will merely feel like it is over too soon. Highly recommended."
38,0393058638,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4442364-franz,5,"Kandel received a Nobel Prize for his research on the brain. His book is in part an intellectual autobiography beginning with his life in Vienna and subsequent emigration to the US after the Nazi Anschluss; but mostly he describes his researches on the learning and memory processes of snails, mice, and other creatures. Impressive in its detail of not only his experiments, but those of many other scientists when they overlapped his. His writing is engaging in spite of the detail of the nervous system and brain that he describes, and he shows how science is done in collaboration with others and how his research was influenced by others. Terrific introduction in the historical development of neuroscience in the second half of the 20th century, to which Kandel was a major contributor, and to how the brain functions. "
39,0393058638,http://goodreads.com/user/show/36989564-jyothi,5,"This book is the author's scientific and personal journey. This book provides explanations about the inner workings of the mind, particularly memory. He also talks about the different approaches scientists have used and the variety of experiments to get a better understanding on the mind. Before this, I read a book on gene (Gene: an intimate history), and this book has many references to the advances in genetic studies which nicely intertwined in my mind. In all, a great text for beginners who want to understand the workings of the mind biologically. I also recommend watching Dr Kandel's TED talk.

It's awe inspiring to see that during one lifetime and some, thinking about the brain went from virtually bronze age to modern neuroscience.One of the fundamental driver of that new knowledge has been animal research, and as someone who experimented on animals his entire life, it is somewhat surprising that Eric Kendel never once addressed in his book his personal view on the ethics of animal research. The second half of the book was pretty technical and harder for me to get through as a non-biologist, but I'm still happy I pushed through. An enlightening read, if a difficult one at times."
42,0393058638,http://goodreads.com/user/show/14901932-anna,5,"Kandel turns his autobiography into a fascinating read by vividly sketching various events that have guided his research career & his personal life (starting by describing his childhood as a Jew in pre-war Vienna). In addition, his book incorporates a well-written, informative overview of modern neurobiology - spanning topics from reflexes to psychiatry. Even though the material gets a little technical sometimes, I enjoyed it nonetheless, largely because Kandel describes not only the discoveries but also the people who made them possible. Overall, a great book that describes the life of a great scientist. "
43,0393058638,http://goodreads.com/user/show/74777457-emir,5,"Kandel merges his own life story with the story of his career in quite an understandable fashion. Although I sometimes got lost while reading the hardcore neurology parts (which are not more than a few), in overall, I found it quite a good piece of work about the cognitive neuropsychology of memory.

After accounting for his early years, Kandel quickly delves into his education and early interest in psychology and, later, neuroscience. He doesn't stop at himself, though, and this is what makes the book such a perfect, magisterial introduction: to elucidate the (often very narrow) problems of simple learning that he studied during his career, Kandel offers an account of the development of modern neuroscience by following the conjectures, questions, frustrations, and insights of scientists (and even philosophers) as they occurred. So we go all the way back to Galvani's discovery that electrical impulses could move muscle fibers; we learn how Franz Joseph Gall was expelled from Austria for hypothesizing that the mind and brain are not separate; we follow the young Freud as he conjectures that the subconscious could be biologically rooted, and Santiago Ramón y Cajal as he verifies and documents those biological roots, showing how neurons connect to one another across synaptic clefts. Instead of simply describing the action of neurotransmitters and the interplay of chemical and electrical signals in the brain, Kandel dramatizes the ""soup vs spark"" debate that raged midcentury, explaining the evidence that led scientists in different directions and showing how, when the argument was decided largely in favor of ""soup,"" some fine scientists on the losing side went on to do excellent research on brain chemistry. This rooting of a large, complex mass of information in a historical, narrative form makes In Search of Memory feel exciting: difficult and informative as it is, reading it never feels like merely eating one's vegetables. Kandel is just as clear when describing his own work, and although his discoveries of physical mechanisms for storing memories are breathtaking, he treats them with great humility. Unlike so many popular summaries of scientific work, Kandel refuses to draw conclusions beyond what the evidence actually warrants. Any speculation (e.g., does what works for a sea snail work for more complex organisms, like mice or cats or human beings?) is subjected to the most rigorous experimentation. So this book functions not just as a fine historical introduction to neuroscience, nor solely as an account of one scientists's career, but also as a masterclass in the scientific method at its best. If our culture of public debate acquired one tenth of Eric Kandel's circumspection and rigor, we would find ourselves in an improved, and unrecognizable, world.In 2017, it bears noting that the memoiristic sections of In Search of Memory contain some chilling and highly relevant details. At a dinner he attended in Austria some years after winning the Nobel, Kandel is accosted by an Austrian woman who, quite without remorse or self-awareness, tries to explain away the Kristallnacht and Austria's collaboration in the Holocaust by appealing to economic insecurity and fear that Jews unfairly dominated academic and media jobs. In another place, Kandel documents how his early mentor Harry Grundfest lost funding and suffered serious career setbacks because of McCarthyist suspicions (which proved unfounded). Kandel is optimistic about his adoptive country, but many of these patterns of thought remain with us far more than they ought to. The book is a timely warning.Near the end, Kandel diversifies his scope considerably, taking us on brief tours of the hard problem of consciousness, the emerging collaboration of neuroscientists with pharmacologists and cognitive psychologists, and new directions of research into the treatment of refractory brain diseases. He shows enormous erudition here, and even further afield, when he ruminates on Austrian modernist art or the operas of Wagner.

He also talks about the different approaches scientists have used and the variety of experiments to get a better understanding on the mind. Before this, I read a book on gene (Gene: an intimate history), and this book has many references to the advances in genetic studies which nicely intertwined in my mind. In all, a great text for beginners who want to understand the workings of the mind biologically. I also recommend watching Dr Kandel's TED talk.

Eric Kandel elegantly intertwines his life story with the progress in brain research.

It's awe inspiring to see that during one lifetime and some, thinking about the brain went from virtually bronze age to modern neuroscience.One of the fundamental driver of that new knowledge has been animal research, and as someone who experimented on animals his entire life, it is somewhat surprising that Eric Kendel never once addressed in his book his personal view on the ethics of animal research. The second half of the book was pretty technical and harder for me to get through as a non-biologist, but I'm still happy I pushed through. An enlightening read, if a difficult one at times."

In addition, his book incorporates a well-written, informative overview of modern neurobiology - spanning topics from reflexes to psychiatry. Even though the material gets a little technical sometimes, I enjoyed it nonetheless, largely because Kandel describes not only the discoveries but also the people who made them possible.

91,0393058638,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6537377-alex,4,"Kandel provides incredible insights into the experimental challenges presented in his lifetime through periods of massive developments in molecular biology, medicine, and neuroscience. Throughout his career, he repeatedly showed an unparalleled ability to formulate the correctly sized questions to fit the technologies available and never lost sight of how to fit his scientific findings into an overarching framework of how memory operates on a neural level. His writing in this book really exemplifies this ability to fit a wide range of topics and experiments into a synthesized idea, and he doesn't shy aware from the hard details involved in the lab work that led to crucial findings for various fields. He knows that to grasp the true significance of any experimental work, the details of design and control need to clearly explained in order to reach a real understanding of the conclusions found therein and (more importantly) how to formulate the next questions to ask. In his career he experienced the explosion of science that came form DNA sequencing and remained on the forefront of neurobiology by applying these advances in the laboratory to find key genetic mechanisms at play in memory systems. His insights showed the intricate complexities of how genes are integral to how changes in memory occur, how they are triggered, how they are sustained, and how they stored in a multitude of locations and animals. He even began to touch the massively more difficult problems of systems integrations, and how the nervous system could possibly use the signaling from such a huge number of seemingly disparate specialized centers to create a unified whole of human experience. Despite all of the insights this book provided, there is still an insidious aspect of his perspective that precludes him from grappling with much larger philosophical problems presented by modern advances in neuroscience. The theme of consciousness being the ultimate problem to solve and his rejection to really engage with this problem in one way shows his tact for choosing his battle in an informed manner, but by the end of the book, he doesn't seem to have a firm understanding of where these fields are truly going, and he constantly tries to stuff all of his achievements and the half century of advancement in cognitive psychology into the box of psychoanalysis all because he has an insufferable amount of nostalgia for things he once was drawn to. It reaches the point where he seems to imply that psychoanalysis is like some kind of intellectual sponge that can soak up every ounce of knowledge from every approach to psychology every spawned over the last century (behaviorism, cognitive, gestalt, molecular, computational, etc.) and come out the better than any one of them independently. His rampant defenses of Freud that crop up through his introspective segments boarder on the line of embarrassing for a man of his status and ability. I still highly recommend this book to anyone interested in the history of neuroscience or seeking a better insight into the foundational experiments that led to much of what we know about neurobiology. Kandel is truly an icon and provides unparalleled insights into his lab work over the course of his career. "
92,0393058638,http://goodreads.com/user/show/26259694-tauras,4,"Years ago I added this book to my little ""to read"" list with expectations of this book being helpful on how to improve memory. Well, I was way off the mark with this.After having read the book, I'd guess the target audience is a neuroscientist or person aspiring to become one in the future. Luckily, I am a curious physicist and getting a book about an of science in which I'm clueless, is an attractive adventure. At points, the technical chapters do get over the top. I will likely forget all the cyclic AMPs, kinase A's and other peculiar names, yet it left me with an intuitive understanding, a mental visualisation of sorts, that I am grateful for. This book tackled the topic from the very beginning which was especially helpful for a person having a minimal background in the biology side of things. It became more complex (and maybe tedious) with time, yet it was not impossible to follow the book through.Another part of the book was very autobiographical, which led to lots of names (which, again, I'll likely forget) and educated me slightly more about some aspects of history. I do not remember myself reading a book which emphasized Jews so much, thus seeing history from the authors perspective was really educational and interesting. I wanted to give this book a five-star review, however, it did drag on a bit, so I'll take half a star away. The book did have a great overview of how the science of memory came to be, yet I wonder what happened in the past ten years, the time after the book was published. "

Absolutely fascinating, yet had to reread some sections because it was hard for me to comprehend. The best part is how he intertwined his life story into his studies of the brain. Fascinating!"
121,0393058638,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6537377-alex,4,"Kandel provides incredible insights into the experimental challenges presented in his lifetime through periods of massive developments in molecular biology, medicine, and neuroscience. Throughout his career, he repeatedly showed an unparalleled ability to formulate the correctly sized questions to fit the technologies available and never lost sight of how to fit his scientific findings into an overarching framework of how memory operates on a neural level. His writing in this book really exemplifies this ability to fit a wide range of topics and experiments into a synthesized idea, and he doesn't shy aware from the hard details involved in the lab work that led to crucial findings for various fields. He knows that to grasp the true significance of any experimental work, the details of design and control need to clearly explained in order to reach a real understanding of the conclusions found therein and (more importantly) how to formulate the next questions to ask. In his career he experienced the explosion of science that came form DNA sequencing and remained on the forefront of neurobiology by applying these advances in the laboratory to find key genetic mechanisms at play in memory systems. His insights showed the intricate complexities of how genes are integral to how changes in memory occur, how they are triggered, how they are sustained, and how they stored in a multitude of locations and animals. He even began to touch the massively more difficult problems of systems integrations, and how the nervous system could possibly use the signaling from such a huge number of seemingly disparate specialized centers to create a unified whole of human experience. Despite all of the insights this book provided, there is still an insidious aspect of his perspective that precludes him from grappling with much larger philosophical problems presented by modern advances in neuroscience. The theme of consciousness being the ultimate problem to solve and his rejection to really engage with this problem in one way shows his tact for choosing his battle in an informed manner, but by the end of the book, he doesn't seem to have a firm understanding of where these fields are truly going, and he constantly tries to stuff all of his achievements and the half century of advancement in cognitive psychology into the box of psychoanalysis all because he has an insufferable amount of nostalgia for things he once was drawn to. It reaches the point where he seems to imply that psychoanalysis is like some kind of intellectual sponge that can soak up every ounce of knowledge from every approach to psychology every spawned over the last century (behaviorism, cognitive, gestalt, molecular, computational, etc.) and come out the better than any one of them independently. His rampant defenses of Freud that crop up through his introspective segments boarder on the line of embarrassing for a man of his status and ability. I still highly recommend this book to anyone interested in the history of neuroscience or seeking a better insight into the foundational experiments that led to much of what we know about neurobiology. Kandel is truly an icon and provides unparalleled insights into his lab work over the course of his career. "
122,0393058638,http://goodreads.com/user/show/26259694-tauras,4,"Years ago I added this book to my little ""to read"" list with expectations of this book being helpful on how to improve memory. Well, I was way off the mark with this.After having read the book, I'd guess the target audience is a neuroscientist or person aspiring to become one in the future. Luckily, I am a curious physicist and getting a book about an of science in which I'm clueless, is an attractive adventure. At points, the technical chapters do get over the top. I will likely forget all the cyclic AMPs, kinase A's and other peculiar names, yet it left me with an intuitive understanding, a mental visualisation of sorts, that I am grateful for. This book tackled the topic from the very beginning which was especially helpful for a person having a minimal background in the biology side of things. It became more complex (and maybe tedious) with time, yet it was not impossible to follow the book through.Another part of the book was very autobiographical, which led to lots of names (which, again, I'll likely forget) and educated me slightly more about some aspects of history. I do not remember myself reading a book which emphasized Jews so much, thus seeing history from the authors perspective was really educational and interesting. I wanted to give this book a five-star review, however, it did drag on a bit, so I'll take half a star away. The book did have a great overview of how the science of memory came to be, yet I wonder what happened in the past ten years, the time after the book was published. "
123,0393058638,http://goodreads.com/user/show/46238669-varun-padmanaban,4,"Kandel in his autobiography gives not only an elegant and thoughtful account of his Nobel-prize winning research career but beautifully explains memory and all of the researchers who have pushed that frontier alongside Kandel. He begins with the cultural anti-semitism (along with ‘radical’) that is prevalent in Vienna before he is forced to emigrate to the United States to escape. This anti-semitism is a source of angst for Kandel as he laments over the death of an intellectual haven that was Vienna. Regardless, he moves on and combines through a series of fortunate experiences he has at the NIMH and others with a love for psychiatry and Freudian thinking. One of the things I was looking for was the fact that he had initially no idea what he wanted to work on but eventually did come up with a question that he found passionate enough to explore. And in this he took a leap of faith and moved to Paris to work on the Aplysia which really brought him insecurities and a feeling that while “one cannot decide on cold facts because facts are often insufficient, one ultimately has to trust one’s unconscious, one’s instinct and one’s creative urge.” Eventually he went on to show through an elegant dissection of a primitive Aplysia reflex the molecular basis of conditional learning and eventually went on to show the underlying molecular mechanisms of long term memory. "
124,0393058638,http://goodreads.com/user/show/58743626-camille,4,"Kandel is well known for being an incredible scientist and creative pioneer in his field, and in this book he is also a delightful storyteller. I loved reading about his journey that led to his lifelong goal to understand the neural basis of memory, and he ties this quest beautifully with his traumatic childhood in Vienna and his initial desire in medical school to understand human consciousness through psychoanalysis. This book is introduced as being geared towards those who have little background in neuroscience, but I did learn a lot about the links between discovery that led us to what we know today (i.e. how Sutherland's discovery of second messenger cAMP helped shape Kandel's uncovering of that link to neuronal memory consolidation). I also admired his courage in moving forward with his research on a little-studied organism, the aplysia snail, and was able to make foundational discoveries at the biochemical and cellular level of memory. In his later life after winning the Nobel Prize, Kandel raised conversation and recognition of Austria's involvement in the Holocaust, bringing us back full circle to his childhood and initial college studies in history. Overall, this was a beautiful life story and would recommend to anyone interested in science, medicine, and/or history. "
125,0393058638,http://goodreads.com/user/show/39395937-rhonda-sue,4,"This is an excellent autobiography and history of brain science. The author has a nice way about him, humble and grateful and I most enjoyed the stories that accompanied his science research and career path. The science history is all good, however, as a laymen, I found some of the science too technical and glossed over it. There is a nice glossary in the back, so that is useful.The takeaway for me was that brain science and science in general is constantly evolving and changing. The fact that psychoanalysis has merged with cellular biology and neuroscience is quite fascinating. The author recounted his life story from his childhood in Vienna to his education in Brooklyn, to Harvard, and his studies from medical school to research labs, and his foray into biotech and pharma. He is a Nobel laureate and won the prize in 2000. Throughout the book there is an undercurrent and concern with anti-Semitism, particularly that of Austria, the author's birth country. Lots of discussion about lab studies and experiments in the Aplysia snail, rats, mice, etc. The story is very well written. If you want to understand brain science, even a little, you will enjoy the read but be prepared to take notes and to spend some time as the book is 430 pages excluding the glossary and endnotes. "
126,0393058638,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5424738-catie-watson,5,"This was an excellent read for me on several levels. I picked it up to learn to more about the science behind the formation of short and long term memories and was not disappointed. Dr. Kandel undertakes the task of explaining the scientific research in neurology and the mind to which he’s devoted his life. He succeeds admirably at making his descriptions simple enough for a general reader for whom high school or college biology may be a distant memory. What I hadn’t expected to find were the biographical details that showed how the memory of fleeing Austria with his family as a child to escape the Nazi regime affected the author his entire life. He also describes his efforts to make the current Austrian government and scientific community acknowledge Austria’s role in the Holocaust. Another aspect of the book that I enjoyed were the author’s descriptions of a life spent “doing science.” He is generous in his praise of colleagues and seems to have had no trouble navigating the politics of an academic career. Finally, I was touched by the love and respect with which he spoke of his wife Denise, who made sacrifices scientific career to shoulder most of the responsibility for raising their two children while he devoted himself to his passion for scientific discovery."
127,0393058638,http://goodreads.com/user/show/27127236-robert,5,"The natural sciences, abetted by technologies they themselves have made possible, have become increasingly difficult for lay people to understand. There are even a few twentieth century idioms that express this gulf: when we want to say something isn't particularly hard, we can say ""well, it's not rocket science"" or ""well, it's not brain surgery."" If we're going to ascend the heights of domains like astrophysics or neuroscience, then, those of us not fortunate enough to have studied the fields need excellent sherpas in such rarefied air. Many years ago, I read Brian Greene's The Elegant Universe, and while I wouldn't pretend to understand it (or String Theory) with any kind of refinement, I did feel like I had gotten a whole education in relativity and quantum mechanics just from the wealth of background material Greene provided. Here, Nobel laureate Eric Kandel does the same thing for the neurobiology of memory, except with even greater clarity and sense of narrative.The book is partially a memoir, which could easily make for heavy going, but it doesn't here: Kandel, an Austrian Jew, was a refugee from the Anschluss and his early years are intrinsically interesting. After accounting for his early years, Kandel quickly delves into his education and early interest in psychology and, later, neuroscience. He doesn't stop at himself, though, and this is what makes the book such a perfect, magisterial introduction: to elucidate the (often very narrow) problems of simple learning that he studied during his career, Kandel offers an account of the development of modern neuroscience by following the conjectures, questions, frustrations, and insights of scientists (and even philosophers) as they occurred. So we go all the way back to Galvani's discovery that electrical impulses could move muscle fibers; we learn how Franz Joseph Gall was expelled from Austria for hypothesizing that the mind and brain are not separate; we follow the young Freud as he conjectures that the subconscious could be biologically rooted, and Santiago Ramón y Cajal as he verifies and documents those biological roots, showing how neurons connect to one another across synaptic clefts. Instead of simply describing the action of neurotransmitters and the interplay of chemical and electrical signals in the brain, Kandel dramatizes the ""soup vs spark"" debate that raged midcentury, explaining the evidence that led scientists in different directions and showing how, when the argument was decided largely in favor of ""soup,"" some fine scientists on the losing side went on to do excellent research on brain chemistry. This rooting of a large, complex mass of information in a historical, narrative form makes In Search of Memory feel exciting: difficult and informative as it is, reading it never feels like merely eating one's vegetables. Kandel is just as clear when describing his own work, and although his discoveries of physical mechanisms for storing memories are breathtaking, he treats them with great humility. Unlike so many popular summaries of scientific work, Kandel refuses to draw conclusions beyond what the evidence actually warrants. Any speculation (e.g., does what works for a sea snail work for more complex organisms, like mice or cats or human beings?) is subjected to the most rigorous experimentation. So this book functions not just as a fine historical introduction to neuroscience, nor solely as an account of one scientists's career, but also as a masterclass in the scientific method at its best. If our culture of public debate acquired one tenth of Eric Kandel's circumspection and rigor, we would find ourselves in an improved, and unrecognizable, world.In 2017, it bears noting that the memoiristic sections of In Search of Memory contain some chilling and highly relevant details. At a dinner he attended in Austria some years after winning the Nobel, Kandel is accosted by an Austrian woman who, quite without remorse or self-awareness, tries to explain away the Kristallnacht and Austria's collaboration in the Holocaust by appealing to economic insecurity and fear that Jews unfairly dominated academic and media jobs. In another place, Kandel documents how his early mentor Harry Grundfest lost funding and suffered serious career setbacks because of McCarthyist suspicions (which proved unfounded). Kandel is optimistic about his adoptive country, but many of these patterns of thought remain with us far more than they ought to. The book is a timely warning.Near the end, Kandel diversifies his scope considerably, taking us on brief tours of the hard problem of consciousness, the emerging collaboration of neuroscientists with pharmacologists and cognitive psychologists, and new directions of research into the treatment of refractory brain diseases. He shows enormous erudition here, and even further afield, when he ruminates on Austrian modernist art or the operas of Wagner. In short, Eric Kandel is a towering intellect and, much rarer, one who can lead the general public up into the Himalayan air that he breathes with native ease. The journey is long, but if you take it, it will merely feel like it is over too soon. Highly recommended."

This anti-semitism is a source of angst for Kandel as he laments over the death of an intellectual haven that was Vienna.

If you want to understand brain science, even a little, you will enjoy the read but be prepared to take notes and to spend some time as the book is 430 pages excluding the glossary and endnotes. "
156,0393058638,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5424738-catie-watson,5,"This was an excellent read for me on several levels. I picked it up to learn to more about the science behind the formation of short and long term memories and was not disappointed. Dr. Kandel undertakes the task of explaining the scientific research in neurology and the mind to which he’s devoted his life. He succeeds admirably at making his descriptions simple enough for a general reader for whom high school or college biology may be a distant memory. What I hadn’t expected to find were the biographical details that showed how the memory of fleeing Austria with his family as a child to escape the Nazi regime affected the author his entire life. He also describes his efforts to make the current Austrian government and scientific community acknowledge Austria’s role in the Holocaust. Another aspect of the book that I enjoyed were the author’s descriptions of a life spent “doing science.” He is generous in his praise of colleagues and seems to have had no trouble navigating the politics of an academic career. Finally, I was touched by the love and respect with which he spoke of his wife Denise, who made sacrifices scientific career to shoulder most of the responsibility for raising their two children while he devoted himself to his passion for scientific discovery."
157,0393058638,http://goodreads.com/user/show/27127236-robert,5,"The natural sciences, abetted by technologies they themselves have made possible, have become increasingly difficult for lay people to understand. There are even a few twentieth century idioms that express this gulf: when we want to say something isn't particularly hard, we can say ""well, it's not rocket science"" or ""well, it's not brain surgery."" If we're going to ascend the heights of domains like astrophysics or neuroscience, then, those of us not fortunate enough to have studied the fields need excellent sherpas in such rarefied air. Many years ago, I read Brian Greene's The Elegant Universe, and while I wouldn't pretend to understand it (or String Theory) with any kind of refinement, I did feel like I had gotten a whole education in relativity and quantum mechanics just from the wealth of background material Greene provided. Here, Nobel laureate Eric Kandel does the same thing for the neurobiology of memory, except with even greater clarity and sense of narrative.The book is partially a memoir, which could easily make for heavy going, but it doesn't here: Kandel, an Austrian Jew, was a refugee from the Anschluss and his early years are intrinsically interesting. After accounting for his early years, Kandel quickly delves into his education and early interest in psychology and, later, neuroscience. He doesn't stop at himself, though, and this is what makes the book such a perfect, magisterial introduction: to elucidate the (often very narrow) problems of simple learning that he studied during his career, Kandel offers an account of the development of modern neuroscience by following the conjectures, questions, frustrations, and insights of scientists (and even philosophers) as they occurred. So we go all the way back to Galvani's discovery that electrical impulses could move muscle fibers; we learn how Franz Joseph Gall was expelled from Austria for hypothesizing that the mind and brain are not separate; we follow the young Freud as he conjectures that the subconscious could be biologically rooted, and Santiago Ramón y Cajal as he verifies and documents those biological roots, showing how neurons connect to one another across synaptic clefts. Instead of simply describing the action of neurotransmitters and the interplay of chemical and electrical signals in the brain, Kandel dramatizes the ""soup vs spark"" debate that raged midcentury, explaining the evidence that led scientists in different directions and showing how, when the argument was decided largely in favor of ""soup,"" some fine scientists on the losing side went on to do excellent research on brain chemistry. This rooting of a large, complex mass of information in a historical, narrative form makes In Search of Memory feel exciting: difficult and informative as it is, reading it never feels like merely eating one's vegetables. Kandel is just as clear when describing his own work, and although his discoveries of physical mechanisms for storing memories are breathtaking, he treats them with great humility. Unlike so many popular summaries of scientific work, Kandel refuses to draw conclusions beyond what the evidence actually warrants. Any speculation (e.g., does what works for a sea snail work for more complex organisms, like mice or cats or human beings?) is subjected to the most rigorous experimentation. So this book functions not just as a fine historical introduction to neuroscience, nor solely as an account of one scientists's career, but also as a masterclass in the scientific method at its best. If our culture of public debate acquired one tenth of Eric Kandel's circumspection and rigor, we would find ourselves in an improved, and unrecognizable, world.In 2017, it bears noting that the memoiristic sections of In Search of Memory contain some chilling and highly relevant details. At a dinner he attended in Austria some years after winning the Nobel, Kandel is accosted by an Austrian woman who, quite without remorse or self-awareness, tries to explain away the Kristallnacht and Austria's collaboration in the Holocaust by appealing to economic insecurity and fear that Jews unfairly dominated academic and media jobs. In another place, Kandel documents how his early mentor Harry Grundfest lost funding and suffered serious career setbacks because of McCarthyist suspicions (which proved unfounded). Kandel is optimistic about his adoptive country, but many of these patterns of thought remain with us far more than they ought to. The book is a timely warning.Near the end, Kandel diversifies his scope considerably, taking us on brief tours of the hard problem of consciousness, the emerging collaboration of neuroscientists with pharmacologists and cognitive psychologists, and new directions of research into the treatment of refractory brain diseases. He shows enormous erudition here, and even further afield, when he ruminates on Austrian modernist art or the operas of Wagner. In short, Eric Kandel is a towering intellect and, much rarer, one who can lead the general public up into the Himalayan air that he breathes with native ease. The journey is long, but if you take it, it will merely feel like it is over too soon. Highly recommended."
158,0393058638,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4442364-franz,5,"Kandel received a Nobel Prize for his research on the brain. His book is in part an intellectual autobiography beginning with his life in Vienna and subsequent emigration to the US after the Nazi Anschluss; but mostly he describes his researches on the learning and memory processes of snails, mice, and other creatures. Impressive in its detail of not only his experiments, but those of many other scientists when they overlapped his. His writing is engaging in spite of the detail of the nervous system and brain that he describes, and he shows how science is done in collaboration with others and how his research was influenced by others. Terrific introduction in the historical development of neuroscience in the second half of the 20th century, to which Kandel was a major contributor, and to how the brain functions. "
159,0393058638,http://goodreads.com/user/show/36989564-jyothi,5,"This book is the author's scientific and personal journey. This book provides explanations about the inner workings of the mind, particularly memory. He also talks about the different approaches scientists have used and the variety of experiments to get a better understanding on the mind. Before this, I read a book on gene (Gene: an intimate history), and this book has many references to the advances in genetic studies which nicely intertwined in my mind. In all, a great text for beginners who want to understand the workings of the mind biologically. I also recommend watching Dr Kandel's TED talk. ""Apart from the fleeting present, memory is what makes our past and future"". - Eric R. Kandel "
160,0393058638,http://goodreads.com/user/show/106400683-younes-bouhadjar,5,"This book is both inspiring and illuminating. Eric Kandel elegantly intertwines his life story with the progress in brain research. He touches on so many areas, from psychoanalysis, psychology, and behavior to molecular/cellular biology and nerve signaling.In this book, I learned: 1. the autobiography of Eric Kandel (which I found thrilling and full of surprising facts)2. a large part of the history of neuroscience 3. the neural mechanisms of long and short memory work in Aplysia and how it translates to other invertebrate and also vertebrate.4. molecular/cellular biology and how it helps to decipher the neural circuitry of high cognitive functions e.g. memory5. the usefulness of the reductionist method to solve complex questions, like for instance memory and mental illnesses.

161,0393058638,http://goodreads.com/user/show/68963576-lucam,4,"This was a fascinating read, which makes me wish I had had more history of science classes back in University. It's awe inspiring to see that during one lifetime and some, thinking about the brain went from virtually bronze age to modern neuroscience.One of the fundamental driver of that new knowledge has been animal research, and as someone who experimented on animals his entire life, it is somewhat surprising that Eric Kendel never once addressed in his book his personal view on the ethics of animal research. The second half of the book was pretty technical and harder for me to get through as a non-biologist, but I'm still happy I pushed through. An enlightening read, if a difficult one at times."
162,0393058638,http://goodreads.com/user/show/14901932-anna,5,"Kandel turns his autobiography into a fascinating read by vividly sketching various events that have guided his research career & his personal life (starting by describing his childhood as a Jew in pre-war Vienna). In addition, his book incorporates a well-written, informative overview of modern neurobiology - spanning topics from reflexes to psychiatry. Even though the material gets a little technical sometimes, I enjoyed it nonetheless, largely because Kandel describes not only the discoveries but also the people who made them possible. Overall, a great book that describes the life of a great scientist. "
163,0393058638,http://goodreads.com/user/show/74777457-emir,5,"Kandel merges his own life story with the story of his career in quite an understandable fashion. Although I sometimes got lost while reading the hardcore neurology parts (which are not more than a few), in overall, I found it quite a good piece of work about the cognitive neuropsychology of memory. Kandel's work holds a Kandel (heh heh heh) to almost all the other books about cognitive neuropsychology."

If we're going to ascend the heights of domains like astrophysics or neuroscience, then, those of us not fortunate enough to have studied the fields need excellent sherpas in such rarefied air.

Here, Nobel laureate Eric Kandel does the same thing for the neurobiology of memory, except with even greater clarity and sense of narrative.The book is partially a memoir, which could easily make for heavy going, but it doesn't here: Kandel, an Austrian Jew, was a refugee from the Anschluss and his early years are intrinsically interesting. After accounting for his early years, Kandel quickly delves into his education and early interest in psychology and, later, neuroscience. He doesn't stop at himself, though, and this is what makes the book such a perfect, magisterial introduction: to elucidate the (often very narrow) problems of simple learning that he studied during his career, Kandel offers an account of the development of modern neuroscience by following the conjectures, questions, frustrations, and insights of scientists (and even philosophers) as they occurred. So we go all the way back to Galvani's discovery that electrical impulses could move muscle fibers; we learn how Franz Joseph Gall was expelled from Austria for hypothesizing that the mind and brain are not separate; we follow the young Freud as he conjectures that the subconscious could be biologically rooted, and Santiago Ramón y Cajal as he verifies and documents those biological roots, showing how neurons connect to one another across synaptic clefts. Instead of simply describing the action of neurotransmitters and the interplay of chemical and electrical signals in the brain, Kandel dramatizes the ""soup vs spark"" debate that raged midcentury, explaining the evidence that led scientists in different directions and showing how, when the argument was decided largely in favor of ""soup,"" some fine scientists on the losing side went on to do excellent research on brain chemistry. This rooting of a large, complex mass of information in a historical, narrative form makes In Search of Memory feel exciting: difficult and informative as it is, reading it never feels like merely eating one's vegetables. Kandel is just as clear when describing his own work, and although his discoveries of physical mechanisms for storing memories are breathtaking, he treats them with great humility. Unlike so many popular summaries of scientific work, Kandel refuses to draw conclusions beyond what the evidence actually warrants. Any speculation (e.g., does what works for a sea snail work for more complex organisms, like mice or cats or human beings?) is subjected to the most rigorous experimentation. So this book functions not just as a fine historical introduction to neuroscience, nor solely as an account of one scientists's career, but also as a masterclass in the scientific method at its best. If our culture of public debate acquired one tenth of Eric Kandel's circumspection and rigor, we would find ourselves in an improved, and unrecognizable, world.In 2017, it bears noting that the memoiristic sections of In Search of Memory contain some chilling and highly relevant details. At a dinner he attended in Austria some years after winning the Nobel, Kandel is accosted by an Austrian woman who, quite without remorse or self-awareness, tries to explain away the Kristallnacht and Austria's collaboration in the Holocaust by appealing to economic insecurity and fear that Jews unfairly dominated academic and media jobs. In another place, Kandel documents how his early mentor Harry Grundfest lost funding and suffered serious career setbacks because of McCarthyist suspicions (which proved unfounded). Kandel is optimistic about his adoptive country, but many of these patterns of thought remain with us far more than they ought to. The book is a timely warning.Near the end, Kandel diversifies his scope considerably, taking us on brief tours of the hard problem of consciousness, the emerging collaboration of neuroscientists with pharmacologists and cognitive psychologists, and new directions of research into the treatment of refractory brain diseases. He shows enormous erudition here, and even further afield, when he ruminates on Austrian modernist art or the operas of Wagner.

Absolutely fascinating, yet had to reread some sections because it was hard for me to comprehend. The best part is how he intertwined his life story into his studies of the brain. Fascinating!"
211,0393058638,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6537377-alex,4,"Kandel provides incredible insights into the experimental challenges presented in his lifetime through periods of massive developments in molecular biology, medicine, and neuroscience. Throughout his career, he repeatedly showed an unparalleled ability to formulate the correctly sized questions to fit the technologies available and never lost sight of how to fit his scientific findings into an overarching framework of how memory operates on a neural level. His writing in this book really exemplifies this ability to fit a wide range of topics and experiments into a synthesized idea, and he doesn't shy aware from the hard details involved in the lab work that led to crucial findings for various fields. He knows that to grasp the true significance of any experimental work, the details of design and control need to clearly explained in order to reach a real understanding of the conclusions found therein and (more importantly) how to formulate the next questions to ask. In his career he experienced the explosion of science that came form DNA sequencing and remained on the forefront of neurobiology by applying these advances in the laboratory to find key genetic mechanisms at play in memory systems. His insights showed the intricate complexities of how genes are integral to how changes in memory occur, how they are triggered, how they are sustained, and how they stored in a multitude of locations and animals. He even began to touch the massively more difficult problems of systems integrations, and how the nervous system could possibly use the signaling from such a huge number of seemingly disparate specialized centers to create a unified whole of human experience. Despite all of the insights this book provided, there is still an insidious aspect of his perspective that precludes him from grappling with much larger philosophical problems presented by modern advances in neuroscience. The theme of consciousness being the ultimate problem to solve and his rejection to really engage with this problem in one way shows his tact for choosing his battle in an informed manner, but by the end of the book, he doesn't seem to have a firm understanding of where these fields are truly going, and he constantly tries to stuff all of his achievements and the half century of advancement in cognitive psychology into the box of psychoanalysis all because he has an insufferable amount of nostalgia for things he once was drawn to. It reaches the point where he seems to imply that psychoanalysis is like some kind of intellectual sponge that can soak up every ounce of knowledge from every approach to psychology every spawned over the last century (behaviorism, cognitive, gestalt, molecular, computational, etc.) and come out the better than any one of them independently. His rampant defenses of Freud that crop up through his introspective segments boarder on the line of embarrassing for a man of his status and ability. I still highly recommend this book to anyone interested in the history of neuroscience or seeking a better insight into the foundational experiments that led to much of what we know about neurobiology. Kandel is truly an icon and provides unparalleled insights into his lab work over the course of his career. "
212,0393058638,http://goodreads.com/user/show/26259694-tauras,4,"Years ago I added this book to my little ""to read"" list with expectations of this book being helpful on how to improve memory. Well, I was way off the mark with this.After having read the book, I'd guess the target audience is a neuroscientist or person aspiring to become one in the future. Luckily, I am a curious physicist and getting a book about an of science in which I'm clueless, is an attractive adventure. At points, the technical chapters do get over the top. I will likely forget all the cyclic AMPs, kinase A's and other peculiar names, yet it left me with an intuitive understanding, a mental visualisation of sorts, that I am grateful for. This book tackled the topic from the very beginning which was especially helpful for a person having a minimal background in the biology side of things. It became more complex (and maybe tedious) with time, yet it was not impossible to follow the book through.Another part of the book was very autobiographical, which led to lots of names (which, again, I'll likely forget) and educated me slightly more about some aspects of history. I do not remember myself reading a book which emphasized Jews so much, thus seeing history from the authors perspective was really educational and interesting. I wanted to give this book a five-star review, however, it did drag on a bit, so I'll take half a star away. The book did have a great overview of how the science of memory came to be, yet I wonder what happened in the past ten years, the time after the book was published. "
213,0393058638,http://goodreads.com/user/show/46238669-varun-padmanaban,4,"Kandel in his autobiography gives not only an elegant and thoughtful account of his Nobel-prize winning research career but beautifully explains memory and all of the researchers who have pushed that frontier alongside Kandel. He begins with the cultural anti-semitism (along with ‘radical’) that is prevalent in Vienna before he is forced to emigrate to the United States to escape. This anti-semitism is a source of angst for Kandel as he laments over the death of an intellectual haven that was Vienna. Regardless, he moves on and combines through a series of fortunate experiences he has at the NIMH and others with a love for psychiatry and Freudian thinking. One of the things I was looking for was the fact that he had initially no idea what he wanted to work on but eventually did come up with a question that he found passionate enough to explore. And in this he took a leap of faith and moved to Paris to work on the Aplysia which really brought him insecurities and a feeling that while “one cannot decide on cold facts because facts are often insufficient, one ultimately has to trust one’s unconscious, one’s instinct and one’s creative urge.” Eventually he went on to show through an elegant dissection of a primitive Aplysia reflex the molecular basis of conditional learning and eventually went on to show the underlying molecular mechanisms of long term memory. "
214,0393058638,http://goodreads.com/user/show/58743626-camille,4,"Kandel is well known for being an incredible scientist and creative pioneer in his field, and in this book he is also a delightful storyteller. I loved reading about his journey that led to his lifelong goal to understand the neural basis of memory, and he ties this quest beautifully with his traumatic childhood in Vienna and his initial desire in medical school to understand human consciousness through psychoanalysis. This book is introduced as being geared towards those who have little background in neuroscience, but I did learn a lot about the links between discovery that led us to what we know today (i.e. how Sutherland's discovery of second messenger cAMP helped shape Kandel's uncovering of that link to neuronal memory consolidation). I also admired his courage in moving forward with his research on a little-studied organism, the aplysia snail, and was able to make foundational discoveries at the biochemical and cellular level of memory. In his later life after winning the Nobel Prize, Kandel raised conversation and recognition of Austria's involvement in the Holocaust, bringing us back full circle to his childhood and initial college studies in history. Overall, this was a beautiful life story and would recommend to anyone interested in science, medicine, and/or history. "

The author has a nice way about him, humble and grateful and I most enjoyed the stories that accompanied his science research and career path. The science history is all good, however, as a laymen, I found some of the science too technical and glossed over it. There is a nice glossary in the back, so that is useful.The takeaway for me was that brain science and science in general is constantly evolving and changing. The fact that psychoanalysis has merged with cellular biology and neuroscience is quite fascinating. The author recounted his life story from his childhood in Vienna to his education in Brooklyn, to Harvard, and his studies from medical school to research labs, and his foray into biotech and pharma. He is a Nobel laureate and won the prize in 2000. Throughout the book there is an undercurrent and concern with anti-Semitism, particularly that of Austria, the author's birth country. Lots of discussion about lab studies and experiments in the Aplysia snail, rats, mice, etc. The story is very well written. If you want to understand brain science, even a little, you will enjoy the read but be prepared to take notes and to spend some time as the book is 430 pages excluding the glossary and endnotes. "

242,0393058638,http://goodreads.com/user/show/26259694-tauras,4,"Years ago I added this book to my little ""to read"" list with expectations of this book being helpful on how to improve memory. Well, I was way off the mark with this.After having read the book, I'd guess the target audience is a neuroscientist or person aspiring to become one in the future. Luckily, I am a curious physicist and getting a book about an of science in which I'm clueless, is an attractive adventure. At points, the technical chapters do get over the top. I will likely forget all the cyclic AMPs, kinase A's and other peculiar names, yet it left me with an intuitive understanding, a mental visualisation of sorts, that I am grateful for. This book tackled the topic from the very beginning which was especially helpful for a person having a minimal background in the biology side of things. It became more complex (and maybe tedious) with time, yet it was not impossible to follow the book through.Another part of the book was very autobiographical, which led to lots of names (which, again, I'll likely forget) and educated me slightly more about some aspects of history. I do not remember myself reading a book which emphasized Jews so much, thus seeing history from the authors perspective was really educational and interesting. I wanted to give this book a five-star review, however, it did drag on a bit, so I'll take half a star away. The book did have a great overview of how the science of memory came to be, yet I wonder what happened in the past ten years, the time after the book was published. "
243,0393058638,http://goodreads.com/user/show/46238669-varun-padmanaban,4,"Kandel in his autobiography gives not only an elegant and thoughtful account of his Nobel-prize winning research career but beautifully explains memory and all of the researchers who have pushed that frontier alongside Kandel. He begins with the cultural anti-semitism (along with ‘radical’) that is prevalent in Vienna before he is forced to emigrate to the United States to escape. This anti-semitism is a source of angst for Kandel as he laments over the death of an intellectual haven that was Vienna. Regardless, he moves on and combines through a series of fortunate experiences he has at the NIMH and others with a love for psychiatry and Freudian thinking. One of the things I was looking for was the fact that he had initially no idea what he wanted to work on but eventually did come up with a question that he found passionate enough to explore. And in this he took a leap of faith and moved to Paris to work on the Aplysia which really brought him insecurities and a feeling that while “one cannot decide on cold facts because facts are often insufficient, one ultimately has to trust one’s unconscious, one’s instinct and one’s creative urge.” Eventually he went on to show through an elegant dissection of a primitive Aplysia reflex the molecular basis of conditional learning and eventually went on to show the underlying molecular mechanisms of long term memory. "
244,0393058638,http://goodreads.com/user/show/58743626-camille,4,"Kandel is well known for being an incredible scientist and creative pioneer in his field, and in this book he is also a delightful storyteller. I loved reading about his journey that led to his lifelong goal to understand the neural basis of memory, and he ties this quest beautifully with his traumatic childhood in Vienna and his initial desire in medical school to understand human consciousness through psychoanalysis. This book is introduced as being geared towards those who have little background in neuroscience, but I did learn a lot about the links between discovery that led us to what we know today (i.e. how Sutherland's discovery of second messenger cAMP helped shape Kandel's uncovering of that link to neuronal memory consolidation). I also admired his courage in moving forward with his research on a little-studied organism, the aplysia snail, and was able to make foundational discoveries at the biochemical and cellular level of memory. In his later life after winning the Nobel Prize, Kandel raised conversation and recognition of Austria's involvement in the Holocaust, bringing us back full circle to his childhood and initial college studies in history. Overall, this was a beautiful life story and would recommend to anyone interested in science, medicine, and/or history. "
245,0393058638,http://goodreads.com/user/show/39395937-rhonda-sue,4,"This is an excellent autobiography and history of brain science. The author has a nice way about him, humble and grateful and I most enjoyed the stories that accompanied his science research and career path. The science history is all good, however, as a laymen, I found some of the science too technical and glossed over it. There is a nice glossary in the back, so that is useful.The takeaway for me was that brain science and science in general is constantly evolving and changing. The fact that psychoanalysis has merged with cellular biology and neuroscience is quite fascinating. The author recounted his life story from his childhood in Vienna to his education in Brooklyn, to Harvard, and his studies from medical school to research labs, and his foray into biotech and pharma. He is a Nobel laureate and won the prize in 2000. Throughout the book there is an undercurrent and concern with anti-Semitism, particularly that of Austria, the author's birth country. Lots of discussion about lab studies and experiments in the Aplysia snail, rats, mice, etc. The story is very well written. If you want to understand brain science, even a little, you will enjoy the read but be prepared to take notes and to spend some time as the book is 430 pages excluding the glossary and endnotes. "
246,0393058638,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5424738-catie-watson,5,"This was an excellent read for me on several levels. I picked it up to learn to more about the science behind the formation of short and long term memories and was not disappointed. Dr. Kandel undertakes the task of explaining the scientific research in neurology and the mind to which he’s devoted his life. He succeeds admirably at making his descriptions simple enough for a general reader for whom high school or college biology may be a distant memory. What I hadn’t expected to find were the biographical details that showed how the memory of fleeing Austria with his family as a child to escape the Nazi regime affected the author his entire life. He also describes his efforts to make the current Austrian government and scientific community acknowledge Austria’s role in the Holocaust. Another aspect of the book that I enjoyed were the author’s descriptions of a life spent “doing science.” He is generous in his praise of colleagues and seems to have had no trouble navigating the politics of an academic career. Finally, I was touched by the love and respect with which he spoke of his wife Denise, who made sacrifices scientific career to shoulder most of the responsibility for raising their two children while he devoted himself to his passion for scientific discovery."
247,0393058638,http://goodreads.com/user/show/27127236-robert,5,"The natural sciences, abetted by technologies they themselves have made possible, have become increasingly difficult for lay people to understand. There are even a few twentieth century idioms that express this gulf: when we want to say something isn't particularly hard, we can say ""well, it's not rocket science"" or ""well, it's not brain surgery."" If we're going to ascend the heights of domains like astrophysics or neuroscience, then, those of us not fortunate enough to have studied the fields need excellent sherpas in such rarefied air. Many years ago, I read Brian Greene's The Elegant Universe, and while I wouldn't pretend to understand it (or String Theory) with any kind of refinement, I did feel like I had gotten a whole education in relativity and quantum mechanics just from the wealth of background material Greene provided. Here, Nobel laureate Eric Kandel does the same thing for the neurobiology of memory, except with even greater clarity and sense of narrative.The book is partially a memoir, which could easily make for heavy going, but it doesn't here: Kandel, an Austrian Jew, was a refugee from the Anschluss and his early years are intrinsically interesting. After accounting for his early years, Kandel quickly delves into his education and early interest in psychology and, later, neuroscience. He doesn't stop at himself, though, and this is what makes the book such a perfect, magisterial introduction: to elucidate the (often very narrow) problems of simple learning that he studied during his career, Kandel offers an account of the development of modern neuroscience by following the conjectures, questions, frustrations, and insights of scientists (and even philosophers) as they occurred. So we go all the way back to Galvani's discovery that electrical impulses could move muscle fibers; we learn how Franz Joseph Gall was expelled from Austria for hypothesizing that the mind and brain are not separate; we follow the young Freud as he conjectures that the subconscious could be biologically rooted, and Santiago Ramón y Cajal as he verifies and documents those biological roots, showing how neurons connect to one another across synaptic clefts. Instead of simply describing the action of neurotransmitters and the interplay of chemical and electrical signals in the brain, Kandel dramatizes the ""soup vs spark"" debate that raged midcentury, explaining the evidence that led scientists in different directions and showing how, when the argument was decided largely in favor of ""soup,"" some fine scientists on the losing side went on to do excellent research on brain chemistry. This rooting of a large, complex mass of information in a historical, narrative form makes In Search of Memory feel exciting: difficult and informative as it is, reading it never feels like merely eating one's vegetables. Kandel is just as clear when describing his own work, and although his discoveries of physical mechanisms for storing memories are breathtaking, he treats them with great humility. Unlike so many popular summaries of scientific work, Kandel refuses to draw conclusions beyond what the evidence actually warrants. Any speculation (e.g., does what works for a sea snail work for more complex organisms, like mice or cats or human beings?) is subjected to the most rigorous experimentation. So this book functions not just as a fine historical introduction to neuroscience, nor solely as an account of one scientists's career, but also as a masterclass in the scientific method at its best. If our culture of public debate acquired one tenth of Eric Kandel's circumspection and rigor, we would find ourselves in an improved, and unrecognizable, world.In 2017, it bears noting that the memoiristic sections of In Search of Memory contain some chilling and highly relevant details. At a dinner he attended in Austria some years after winning the Nobel, Kandel is accosted by an Austrian woman who, quite without remorse or self-awareness, tries to explain away the Kristallnacht and Austria's collaboration in the Holocaust by appealing to economic insecurity and fear that Jews unfairly dominated academic and media jobs. In another place, Kandel documents how his early mentor Harry Grundfest lost funding and suffered serious career setbacks because of McCarthyist suspicions (which proved unfounded). Kandel is optimistic about his adoptive country, but many of these patterns of thought remain with us far more than they ought to. The book is a timely warning.Near the end, Kandel diversifies his scope considerably, taking us on brief tours of the hard problem of consciousness, the emerging collaboration of neuroscientists with pharmacologists and cognitive psychologists, and new directions of research into the treatment of refractory brain diseases. He shows enormous erudition here, and even further afield, when he ruminates on Austrian modernist art or the operas of Wagner. In short, Eric Kandel is a towering intellect and, much rarer, one who can lead the general public up into the Himalayan air that he breathes with native ease. The journey is long, but if you take it, it will merely feel like it is over too soon. Highly recommended."
248,0393058638,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4442364-franz,5,"Kandel received a Nobel Prize for his research on the brain. His book is in part an intellectual autobiography beginning with his life in Vienna and subsequent emigration to the US after the Nazi Anschluss; but mostly he describes his researches on the learning and memory processes of snails, mice, and other creatures. Impressive in its detail of not only his experiments, but those of many other scientists when they overlapped his. His writing is engaging in spite of the detail of the nervous system and brain that he describes, and he shows how science is done in collaboration with others and how his research was influenced by others. Terrific introduction in the historical development of neuroscience in the second half of the 20th century, to which Kandel was a major contributor, and to how the brain functions. "
249,0393058638,http://goodreads.com/user/show/36989564-jyothi,5,"This book is the author's scientific and personal journey. This book provides explanations about the inner workings of the mind, particularly memory. He also talks about the different approaches scientists have used and the variety of experiments to get a better understanding on the mind. Before this, I read a book on gene (Gene: an intimate history), and this book has many references to the advances in genetic studies which nicely intertwined in my mind. In all, a great text for beginners who want to understand the workings of the mind biologically. I also recommend watching Dr Kandel's TED talk.

Eric Kandel elegantly intertwines his life story with the progress in brain research. He touches on so many areas, from psychoanalysis, psychology, and behavior to molecular/cellular biology and nerve signaling.In this book, I learned: 1. the autobiography of Eric Kandel (which I found thrilling and full of surprising facts)2. a large part of the history of neuroscience 3. the neural mechanisms of long and short memory work in Aplysia and how it translates to other invertebrate and also vertebrate.4. molecular/cellular biology and how it helps to decipher the neural circuitry of high cognitive functions e.g. memory5. the usefulness of the reductionist method to solve complex questions, like for instance memory and mental illnesses. "
251,0393058638,http://goodreads.com/user/show/68963576-lucam,4,"This was a fascinating read, which makes me wish I had had more history of science classes back in University. It's awe inspiring to see that during one lifetime and some, thinking about the brain went from virtually bronze age to modern neuroscience.One of the fundamental driver of that new knowledge has been animal research, and as someone who experimented on animals his entire life, it is somewhat surprising that Eric Kendel never once addressed in his book his personal view on the ethics of animal research. The second half of the book was pretty technical and harder for me to get through as a non-biologist, but I'm still happy I pushed through. An enlightening read, if a difficult one at times."

272,0393058638,http://goodreads.com/user/show/26259694-tauras,4,"Years ago I added this book to my little ""to read"" list with expectations of this book being helpful on how to improve memory. Well, I was way off the mark with this.After having read the book, I'd guess the target audience is a neuroscientist or person aspiring to become one in the future. Luckily, I am a curious physicist and getting a book about an of science in which I'm clueless, is an attractive adventure. At points, the technical chapters do get over the top. I will likely forget all the cyclic AMPs, kinase A's and other peculiar names, yet it left me with an intuitive understanding, a mental visualisation of sorts, that I am grateful for. This book tackled the topic from the very beginning which was especially helpful for a person having a minimal background in the biology side of things. It became more complex (and maybe tedious) with time, yet it was not impossible to follow the book through.Another part of the book was very autobiographical, which led to lots of names (which, again, I'll likely forget) and educated me slightly more about some aspects of history. I do not remember myself reading a book which emphasized Jews so much, thus seeing history from the authors perspective was really educational and interesting. I wanted to give this book a five-star review, however, it did drag on a bit, so I'll take half a star away. The book did have a great overview of how the science of memory came to be, yet I wonder what happened in the past ten years, the time after the book was published. "
273,0393058638,http://goodreads.com/user/show/46238669-varun-padmanaban,4,"Kandel in his autobiography gives not only an elegant and thoughtful account of his Nobel-prize winning research career but beautifully explains memory and all of the researchers who have pushed that frontier alongside Kandel. He begins with the cultural anti-semitism (along with ‘radical’) that is prevalent in Vienna before he is forced to emigrate to the United States to escape. This anti-semitism is a source of angst for Kandel as he laments over the death of an intellectual haven that was Vienna. Regardless, he moves on and combines through a series of fortunate experiences he has at the NIMH and others with a love for psychiatry and Freudian thinking. One of the things I was looking for was the fact that he had initially no idea what he wanted to work on but eventually did come up with a question that he found passionate enough to explore. And in this he took a leap of faith and moved to Paris to work on the Aplysia which really brought him insecurities and a feeling that while “one cannot decide on cold facts because facts are often insufficient, one ultimately has to trust one’s unconscious, one’s instinct and one’s creative urge.” Eventually he went on to show through an elegant dissection of a primitive Aplysia reflex the molecular basis of conditional learning and eventually went on to show the underlying molecular mechanisms of long term memory. "
274,0393058638,http://goodreads.com/user/show/58743626-camille,4,"Kandel is well known for being an incredible scientist and creative pioneer in his field, and in this book he is also a delightful storyteller. I loved reading about his journey that led to his lifelong goal to understand the neural basis of memory, and he ties this quest beautifully with his traumatic childhood in Vienna and his initial desire in medical school to understand human consciousness through psychoanalysis. This book is introduced as being geared towards those who have little background in neuroscience, but I did learn a lot about the links between discovery that led us to what we know today (i.e. how Sutherland's discovery of second messenger cAMP helped shape Kandel's uncovering of that link to neuronal memory consolidation). I also admired his courage in moving forward with his research on a little-studied organism, the aplysia snail, and was able to make foundational discoveries at the biochemical and cellular level of memory. In his later life after winning the Nobel Prize, Kandel raised conversation and recognition of Austria's involvement in the Holocaust, bringing us back full circle to his childhood and initial college studies in history. Overall, this was a beautiful life story and would recommend to anyone interested in science, medicine, and/or history. "
275,0393058638,http://goodreads.com/user/show/39395937-rhonda-sue,4,"This is an excellent autobiography and history of brain science. The author has a nice way about him, humble and grateful and I most enjoyed the stories that accompanied his science research and career path. The science history is all good, however, as a laymen, I found some of the science too technical and glossed over it. There is a nice glossary in the back, so that is useful.The takeaway for me was that brain science and science in general is constantly evolving and changing. The fact that psychoanalysis has merged with cellular biology and neuroscience is quite fascinating. The author recounted his life story from his childhood in Vienna to his education in Brooklyn, to Harvard, and his studies from medical school to research labs, and his foray into biotech and pharma. He is a Nobel laureate and won the prize in 2000. Throughout the book there is an undercurrent and concern with anti-Semitism, particularly that of Austria, the author's birth country. Lots of discussion about lab studies and experiments in the Aplysia snail, rats, mice, etc. The story is very well written. If you want to understand brain science, even a little, you will enjoy the read but be prepared to take notes and to spend some time as the book is 430 pages excluding the glossary and endnotes. "
276,0393058638,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5424738-catie-watson,5,"This was an excellent read for me on several levels. I picked it up to learn to more about the science behind the formation of short and long term memories and was not disappointed. Dr. Kandel undertakes the task of explaining the scientific research in neurology and the mind to which he’s devoted his life. He succeeds admirably at making his descriptions simple enough for a general reader for whom high school or college biology may be a distant memory. What I hadn’t expected to find were the biographical details that showed how the memory of fleeing Austria with his family as a child to escape the Nazi regime affected the author his entire life. He also describes his efforts to make the current Austrian government and scientific community acknowledge Austria’s role in the Holocaust. Another aspect of the book that I enjoyed were the author’s descriptions of a life spent “doing science.” He is generous in his praise of colleagues and seems to have had no trouble navigating the politics of an academic career. Finally, I was touched by the love and respect with which he spoke of his wife Denise, who made sacrifices scientific career to shoulder most of the responsibility for raising their two children while he devoted himself to his passion for scientific discovery."
277,0393058638,http://goodreads.com/user/show/27127236-robert,5,"The natural sciences, abetted by technologies they themselves have made possible, have become increasingly difficult for lay people to understand. There are even a few twentieth century idioms that express this gulf: when we want to say something isn't particularly hard, we can say ""well, it's not rocket science"" or ""well, it's not brain surgery."" If we're going to ascend the heights of domains like astrophysics or neuroscience, then, those of us not fortunate enough to have studied the fields need excellent sherpas in such rarefied air. Many years ago, I read Brian Greene's The Elegant Universe, and while I wouldn't pretend to understand it (or String Theory) with any kind of refinement, I did feel like I had gotten a whole education in relativity and quantum mechanics just from the wealth of background material Greene provided. Here, Nobel laureate Eric Kandel does the same thing for the neurobiology of memory, except with even greater clarity and sense of narrative.The book is partially a memoir, which could easily make for heavy going, but it doesn't here: Kandel, an Austrian Jew, was a refugee from the Anschluss and his early years are intrinsically interesting. After accounting for his early years, Kandel quickly delves into his education and early interest in psychology and, later, neuroscience. He doesn't stop at himself, though, and this is what makes the book such a perfect, magisterial introduction: to elucidate the (often very narrow) problems of simple learning that he studied during his career, Kandel offers an account of the development of modern neuroscience by following the conjectures, questions, frustrations, and insights of scientists (and even philosophers) as they occurred. So we go all the way back to Galvani's discovery that electrical impulses could move muscle fibers; we learn how Franz Joseph Gall was expelled from Austria for hypothesizing that the mind and brain are not separate; we follow the young Freud as he conjectures that the subconscious could be biologically rooted, and Santiago Ramón y Cajal as he verifies and documents those biological roots, showing how neurons connect to one another across synaptic clefts. Instead of simply describing the action of neurotransmitters and the interplay of chemical and electrical signals in the brain, Kandel dramatizes the ""soup vs spark"" debate that raged midcentury, explaining the evidence that led scientists in different directions and showing how, when the argument was decided largely in favor of ""soup,"" some fine scientists on the losing side went on to do excellent research on brain chemistry. This rooting of a large, complex mass of information in a historical, narrative form makes In Search of Memory feel exciting: difficult and informative as it is, reading it never feels like merely eating one's vegetables. Kandel is just as clear when describing his own work, and although his discoveries of physical mechanisms for storing memories are breathtaking, he treats them with great humility. Unlike so many popular summaries of scientific work, Kandel refuses to draw conclusions beyond what the evidence actually warrants. Any speculation (e.g., does what works for a sea snail work for more complex organisms, like mice or cats or human beings?) is subjected to the most rigorous experimentation. So this book functions not just as a fine historical introduction to neuroscience, nor solely as an account of one scientists's career, but also as a masterclass in the scientific method at its best. If our culture of public debate acquired one tenth of Eric Kandel's circumspection and rigor, we would find ourselves in an improved, and unrecognizable, world.In 2017, it bears noting that the memoiristic sections of In Search of Memory contain some chilling and highly relevant details. At a dinner he attended in Austria some years after winning the Nobel, Kandel is accosted by an Austrian woman who, quite without remorse or self-awareness, tries to explain away the Kristallnacht and Austria's collaboration in the Holocaust by appealing to economic insecurity and fear that Jews unfairly dominated academic and media jobs. In another place, Kandel documents how his early mentor Harry Grundfest lost funding and suffered serious career setbacks because of McCarthyist suspicions (which proved unfounded). Kandel is optimistic about his adoptive country, but many of these patterns of thought remain with us far more than they ought to. The book is a timely warning.Near the end, Kandel diversifies his scope considerably, taking us on brief tours of the hard problem of consciousness, the emerging collaboration of neuroscientists with pharmacologists and cognitive psychologists, and new directions of research into the treatment of refractory brain diseases. He shows enormous erudition here, and even further afield, when he ruminates on Austrian modernist art or the operas of Wagner. In short, Eric Kandel is a towering intellect and, much rarer, one who can lead the general public up into the Himalayan air that he breathes with native ease. The journey is long, but if you take it, it will merely feel like it is over too soon. Highly recommended."
278,0393058638,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4442364-franz,5,"Kandel received a Nobel Prize for his research on the brain. His book is in part an intellectual autobiography beginning with his life in Vienna and subsequent emigration to the US after the Nazi Anschluss; but mostly he describes his researches on the learning and memory processes of snails, mice, and other creatures. Impressive in its detail of not only his experiments, but those of many other scientists when they overlapped his. His writing is engaging in spite of the detail of the nervous system and brain that he describes, and he shows how science is done in collaboration with others and how his research was influenced by others. Terrific introduction in the historical development of neuroscience in the second half of the 20th century, to which Kandel was a major contributor, and to how the brain functions. "
279,0393058638,http://goodreads.com/user/show/36989564-jyothi,5,"This book is the author's scientific and personal journey. This book provides explanations about the inner workings of the mind, particularly memory. He also talks about the different approaches scientists have used and the variety of experiments to get a better understanding on the mind. Before this, I read a book on gene (Gene: an intimate history), and this book has many references to the advances in genetic studies which nicely intertwined in my mind. In all, a great text for beginners who want to understand the workings of the mind biologically. I also recommend watching Dr Kandel's TED talk. ""Apart from the fleeting present, memory is what makes our past and future"". - Eric R. Kandel "
280,0393058638,http://goodreads.com/user/show/106400683-younes-bouhadjar,5,"This book is both inspiring and illuminating. Eric Kandel elegantly intertwines his life story with the progress in brain research. He touches on so many areas, from psychoanalysis, psychology, and behavior to molecular/cellular biology and nerve signaling.In this book, I learned: 1. the autobiography of Eric Kandel (which I found thrilling and full of surprising facts)2. a large part of the history of neuroscience 3. the neural mechanisms of long and short memory work in Aplysia and how it translates to other invertebrate and also vertebrate.4. molecular/cellular biology and how it helps to decipher the neural circuitry of high cognitive functions e.g. memory5. the usefulness of the reductionist method to solve complex questions, like for instance memory and mental illnesses. "
281,0393058638,http://goodreads.com/user/show/68963576-lucam,4,"This was a fascinating read, which makes me wish I had had more history of science classes back in University. It's awe inspiring to see that during one lifetime and some, thinking about the brain went from virtually bronze age to modern neuroscience.One of the fundamental driver of that new knowledge has been animal research, and as someone who experimented on animals his entire life, it is somewhat surprising that Eric Kendel never once addressed in his book his personal view on the ethics of animal research. The second half of the book was pretty technical and harder for me to get through as a non-biologist, but I'm still happy I pushed through. An enlightening read, if a difficult one at times."
282,0393058638,http://goodreads.com/user/show/14901932-anna,5,"Kandel turns his autobiography into a fascinating read by vividly sketching various events that have guided his research career & his personal life (starting by describing his childhood as a Jew in pre-war Vienna). In addition, his book incorporates a well-written, informative overview of modern neurobiology - spanning topics from reflexes to psychiatry. Even though the material gets a little technical sometimes, I enjoyed it nonetheless, largely because Kandel describes not only the discoveries but also the people who made them possible. Overall, a great book that describes the life of a great scientist. "
283,0393058638,http://goodreads.com/user/show/74777457-emir,5,"Kandel merges his own life story with the story of his career in quite an understandable fashion. Although I sometimes got lost while reading the hardcore neurology parts (which are not more than a few), in overall, I found it quite a good piece of work about the cognitive neuropsychology of memory. Kandel's work holds a Kandel (heh heh heh) to almost all the other books about cognitive neuropsychology."
