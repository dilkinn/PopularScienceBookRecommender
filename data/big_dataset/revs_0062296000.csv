Somewhat simplistic and haphazard, since all kinds of things are demonstrated changing. Still, the author pulls it off with more than a bit of grace. He flutters between different concepts, managing to reveal just enough tantalizing glimpses from varied topics: from morality to universe to population to internet to genome to culture to leadership to personality to tech to money to government to future. A fun ride of ideas.Of course, some of the ideas are underdeveloped, on many points one could list things excluded from the overview that could add value. So, this is not an encyclopedic work it could have been. Still, I loved the easy progression between the topics and well thought-out chosen tidbits illustrating the author's perception of assorted ideas centered around the topic of change. Q:Friedrich Hayek’s, with his prescient warning in The Road to Serfdom (1944) that socialism and fascism were not really opposites, but had ‘fundamental similarity of methods and ideas’, that economic planning and state control were at the top of an illiberal slope that led to tyranny, oppression and serfdom, and that the individualism of free markets was the true road to liberation. (c) Actually, this was one of the most ludicrous ideas in the history of cherry-picking. Economic planning does not lead to tyranny. Granting a person or a group of them oversized powers without checks and balances does. And planning, if done properly, could very well be one of these checks and implement extra checks. Free markets also aren't quite as free as we might have thought: all kinds of social processes, stochastic dynamics, behind the scenes effects (think LIBOR debacle, consider lobbying practices that are SO LOVED in some countries), technological effects, interpersonal stuff and ... no, markets aren't exactly conductive of freedom. Also, quite a lot of representatives of 'free markets' traded with the poster-child for fascism, Hitler, all the way into the WW2. I don't really see them being really opposed to fascism, no matter how free or unregulated they were. Q:Today we are still in thrall to Great Man history, if only because we like reading biography. American presidential politics is entirely based on the myth that a perfect, omniscient, virtuous and incorruptible saviour will emerge from the New Hampshire primary every four years, and proceed to lead his people to the promised land. Never was this messianic mood more extreme than on the day Barack Obama won the presidency. (c) True enough. And whenever the 'messiah's skin bronzing choices aren't satisfactory, woe to him.Q:The government monopoly of money leads not just to the suppression of innovation and experiment, not just to inflation and debasement, not just to financial crises, but to inequality too. As Dominic Frisby points out in his book Life After the State, opportunities in finance ripple outwards from the Treasury. The state spends money before it even exists; the privileged banks then get first access to newly minted money and can invest it before assets have increased in cost. By the time it reaches ordinary people, the money is worth less. This outward percolation is known as the Cantillon Effect – after Richard Cantillon, who noticed that the creation of paper money in the South Sea Bubble benefited those closest to the source first. Frisby argues that the process of money creation by an expansionary government effectively redistributes money from the poor to the rich. ‘This is not the free market at work, but a gross, unintended economic distortion caused by the colossal government intervention.’ (c)Q:For far too long we have underestimated the power of spontaneous, organic and constructive change driven from below, in our obsession with designing change from above. Embrace the general theory of evolution. Admit that everything evolves. (c) Yeah. Preach some more to this choir.Q:Our habits and our institutions, from language to cities, are constantly changing, and the mechanism of change turns out to be surprisingly Darwinian: it is gradual, undirected, mutational, inexorable, combinatorial, selective and in some vague sense progressive. (c)Q:Language is just as rule-based in its newest slang forms, and just as sophisticated as it ever was in ancient Rome. But the rules, now as then, are written from below, not from above. (c)Q:The history of Western thought is dominated by skyhooks, by devices for explaining the world as the outcome of design and planning. Plato said that society worked by imitating a designed cosmic order, a belief in which should be coercively enforced. Aristotle said that you should look for inherent principles of intentionality and development – souls – within matter. Homer said gods decided the outcome of battles. St Paul said that you should behave morally because Jesus told you so. Mohamed said you should obey God’s word as transmitted through the Koran. Luther said that your fate was in God’s hands. Hobbes said that social order came from a monarch, or what he called ‘Leviathan’ – the state. Kant said morality transcended human experience. Nietzsche said that strong leaders made for good societies. Marx said that the state was the means of delivering economic and social progress. Again and again, we have told ourselves that there is a top–down description of the world, and a top–down prescription by which we should live. (c)Q:With increasingly money-based interactions among strangers, people increasingly began to think of neighbours as potential trading partners rather than potential prey. Killing the shopkeeper makes no sense. So empathy, self-control and morality became second nature, though morality was always a double-edged sword, as likely to cause violence as to prevent it through most of history. (c)Q:Epigenetics is a respectable branch of genetic science that examines how modifications to DNA sequences acquired early in life in response to experience can affect the adult body. There is a much more speculative version of the story, though. Most of these modifications are swept clean when the sperm and egg cells are made, but perhaps a few just might survive the jump into a new generation. Certain genetic disorders, for example, seem to manifest themselves differently according to whether the mutant chromosome was inherited from the mother or the father – implying a sex-specific ‘imprint’ on the gene. And one study seemed to find a sex-specific effect on the mortality of Swedes according to how hungry their grandparents were when young. (c)Q:Leave the last word on the anthropic principle to Douglas Adams: ‘Imagine a puddle waking up one morning and thinking, “This is an interesting world I find myself in – an interesting hole I find myself in – fits me rather neatly, doesn’t it? In fact it fits me staggeringly well, may have been made to have me in it!”’(c)"
1,0062296000,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1651956-riku-sayuj,2,"Dawkins fanboy tries to dress up an ideological book as a scientific one. Tries to show that Darwin's theory of evolution is just a byproduct or a specific version of the general theory of evolution proposed by Adam Smith about the emergent order that will prevail bottom-up in any free society of selfish actors. In the process ends up unwittingly using just another""skyhook"" - that of benevolent evolution - throughout, by arguing endlessly that all the good things happened bottom-up and all the bad things happened top-down. Except that, as per the core argument, all top-down things also must have been products of evolution. If Everything Evolves, all things good or bad, bottom-up or top-down evolved too. Hence the concept of evolution cannot in itself justify just let everything play out - including economics, institutions and even climate change, for that matter. There is really no guarantee things will always play out well if 'bottom-up' - just look at the latest elections!Just ""Let Everything Be"" can't be the ultimate policy outlook unless Ridley truly believes The Invisible Hand to be the Hand of God directing everything as if by providence towards the good of mankind. And if that is not so and Evolution indeed is blind, then perhaps the occasional nudges in the right direction may work too? As with most left vs right debates, the book only enforces for me the fact that pure free market is not the solution, nor is a command economy - evolution can take us to either side and we need to intervene to keep the balance, and that continuous self-correction is part of our social evolution too, as is the occasional over-correction. No Skyhooks needed, we just need to be less in thrall of 'Men of System'. There, I have used enough pointed references for one review. Now enjoy the historic day.11/9/2016"
2,0062296000,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6601778-parker-f,1,"I thought The Evolution of Everything was written by Matt Ridley--the one with a doctorate in zoology, the former science journalist from The Economist, the author of the well-researched Red Queen and Genome. Instead, the Matt Ridley who wrote the Evolution of Everything is a British aristocrat, bank chairman, and Conservative member of the House of Lords. Actually, these two Matt Ridleys are the same person, but the journalist Matt Ridley is a much more compelling writer. The contemporary Matt Ridley seems to prefer quoting Ron Paul to quoting Charles Darwin, even within a book that is ostensibly about evolution. The Matt Ridley who wrote The Red Queen and Genome seemed to have familiarity with scientific literature and access to leading researchers in evolutionary biology and genomics. The bibliographies of these books are full of peer-reviewed journal articles, and Dr. Ridley had a talent for distilling their contents for the enthusiastic non-scientist to comprehend. The sources of The Evolution of Everything are mostly popular books, newspaper articles, and the occasional talk from a libertarian think tank. Apparently, Ridley no longer has access to academic sources, but this is not a problem for his purposes. He is no longer a science writer and instead is a right wing op-ed writer who finds it convenient to make an occasional biology-based metaphor. Matt Ridley is not writing as a science writer but as a conservative politician, but these are not sound reasons to dismiss his ideas. Briefly stated, Ridley believes that the best ideas and solutions to problems arise spontaneously when ""top-down"" forces (i.e., governments in most cases) aren't involved. I would hope that Ridley, a trained scientist, would use an evidence-based method to persuade me that everything will flourish in a libertarian Utopia. He does not. He simply makes things up when convenient, and dismisses or ignores evidence that is inconvenient to his cause. Ridley asserts that publicly funded academic research results in little innovation compared to what would arise from a system in which all research was privately funded. He concedes that it is hard to find evidence for this assertion, because so much research is currently publicly funded that few private foundations would want to waste their money on research. His evidence for his assertion is an article by Terence Kealey from the Cato Institute (a libertarian think tank formally named The Charles Koch Foundation) that says public research and development spending does not result in economic growth. This article peddles exclusively in anecdote. If I may provide my own anecdotes, I will argue the majority of discoveries for which researchers were awarded Nobel Prizes in Physiology or Medicine in the past 50 years would not have been made with profit-driven, private R & D spending. The history of biological discovery is a treasury of cases in which huge, ultimately rewarding, innovations arise from the investigation of topics far removed from profit-seeking. The betting on short-term winners and losers by private investors would be even more of a top-down allocation of resources than the broad federal funding system of the Nation Institutes of Health and the National Science Foundation in the US. In the dream world of Ridley, the study of zoology or evolution, devoid of immediate economic returns, would be a luxury reserved for members of the aristocracy. Ridley claims that opposition to fracking in Europe largely arises from the unpleasant sound of the word. Regardless of the merits of the technique, I think he is entirely neglecting the concerns of those who would disagree with him. Ridley describes the National Health Service of the UK as a New-Coke-like failure in which consumers were stripped of choice and offered an inferior product to that which would be available in a market. His analysis is interesting, but he makes no attempt to compare or contrast the failures of the NHS with the non-nationalized, but more expensive US system. Interestingly, his only reference to US health care is to quote the eminent medical historian, Dr. Ron Paul, who states, that before Medicaid and Medicare, ""every physician understood that he or she had a responsibility towards the less fortunate, and free medical care for the poor was the norm."" As with many libertarian arguments, this is so emotionally compelling that it can exert its effect without factual support.Most egregiously, Ridley devotes a good portion of the book to dismissing global warming, using mockery as his primary method of persuasion. First, he links concern for the environment to Nazism, by quoting a famous global warming denier: ""As Martin Durkin has observed, green thinking was no mere sideline for the Nazis... It was their green anti-capitalism and loathing of bankers which led them to hate Jewish people."" Ridley then goes to say that to believe that man-made climate change is dangerous is to take a non-scientific leap of faith. Ridley asserts that because so many scientists argue that man-made climate change is real, the idea is unscientific, because ""the whole point of science... is the rejection of arguments from authority."" Since both religion and belief in man-made climate change provide explanations for cataclysmic weather, Ridley argues, both are equally ridiculous. Besides, fewer people die from floods now than in the past. This is the crux of Ridley's argument, and it is hard to fathom. Is he denying climate change? He claims not be. He just believes that maybe it might not end up being as bad as many scientists believe; therefore, we should do nothing about it, and if it is bad, we can figure out what to do about it later. If only more science were exclusively privately supported by Big Oil-funded think tanks, I suppose, Ridley would have stronger evidence to support his belief that global warming is a hoax perpetrated by a cabal of Nazi scientists. This is a strange, strange book, and I suppose it is because Matt Ridley has a strange biography: a scientist, turned journalist, turned banker, turned member of Parliament. He has transformed from an effective communicator of science, to a guy who writes about the books he got at the bookstore and how they remind him of how he was interested in evolution when he was younger."
3,0062296000,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4763049-holly,1,"This satisfied my dilettantish wish to know something about everything. That's all. But it's not as if Ridley has done original scholarship, right? He is an acolyte of Richard Dawkins, and author of two books I never got around to but still feel as if I read (The Red Queen and Genome). He's a fan of Greenblatt's The Swerve and uses an epigraph from Lucretius's ""De rerum natura"" at the start of each chapter. Fine. He throws around Dennett's ""skyhooks"" very liberally and literally. Okay. I liked that Dennett book - Darwin's Dangerous Idea - a notoriously difficult read, and I've read several works of Gould, and Dawkins of course, and Sean Carroll, so I'm conversant in the concepts - but Ridley's strangely conversational and superficially confident tone began to disturb me and I began to feel as if I were being tricked. His short chapters and surveys of everything in human culture began to fell reductionistic, or slyly political in way I couldn't guard against, and I started picking up a weird libertarian vibe: he thinks the Wild West had a better system of governance than modern socialist democracies; he thinks climate change will fix itself; he admires Herbert Spencer . . . . This is about social evolution: everything is human society is evolving by the same mechanisms by which the natural world evolves - religion, governance, education, relationships. But, but? "
4,0062296000,http://goodreads.com/user/show/695116-jim,4,"The idea of a bottom up, generalized evolution theory for so many aspects of our life is new to me & well worth exploring, especially since it flies in the face of the current practice of top down legislation which has failed miserably all too often. It's a really interesting premise that's strained a bit occasionally, but overall makes sense.Ridley relies heavily on the views of Epicurus (341-270 BC), Lucretius (99 BC-55 BC), Adam Smith(1723-1790), Charles Darwin (1809-1882), Richard Dawkins (born 1941), & several others. As a Dawkins fan boy, I'm tickled to see his selfish gene theory stretched so well into so many areas. While this book isn't specifically aimed at showing how ridiculous, outdated, & confining religions are, it winds up doing so quite often. Each chapter begins with a quote from Lucretius' ""De Rerum Natura"", the only work of his to survive the Christian purge of his works. What a loss!Very well narrated. Definitely recommended, but keep an eye out for lopsided arguments. Most are pretty well balanced through the first half or 2/3, but get unbalanced after that. Still interesting data, just not convincing or complete.Prologue: The General Theory of Evolution -  Ridley explains his point well in the second paragraph. This book argues that evolution is happening all around us. It is the best way of understanding how the human world changes, as well as the natural world. Change in human institutions, artifacts and habits is incremental, inexorable and inevitable. It follows a narrative, going from one stage to the next; it creeps rather than jumps; it has its own spontaneous momentum, rather than being driven from outside; it has no goal or end in mind; and it largely happens by trial and error – a version of natural selection.He goes on to say that we often see a person as the cause of a change when they're really just a focal point of gradual change before them. No one is at the controls.  1 The Evolution of the Universe -  more about Lucretius than I'd ever known before, but otherwise nothing new.  2 The Evolution of Morality -  makes a really good point that Bible-thumpers always ignore. Morals are NOT passed down by a deity, but arise from the common thinking at the time. The Christian Bible hasn't changed in relation to slavery & rape, but our views on those certainly have. The rate of change has also accelerated. Homophobes were once the norm, but now people are being dinged for holding this view of just 4 or 5 decades ago.  3 The Evolution of Life -  has one of the best refutations of the complexity issue that so many Creationists love to spout.  4 The Evolution of Genes -  has a great explanation of 'junk' DNA & why we have so much of it.  5 The Evolution of Culture -  explores language & diversity. Roughly, there are far more & diverse species closer to the equator, but they tend to be in smaller areas. Ditto for languages. People tend to move about more in the northern latitudes, so more trade, less languages, more interaction.  6 The Evolution of the Economy -  I've never understood the economy & I'm convinced no one else does either. Ridley's notion that it is mostly out of individual (including state) control roughly seems to hold true. When the state does clamp down, it's usually for a brief period until too big an imbalance develops with its neighbors.  7 The Evolution of Technology -  goes without saying since we can see it right in front of us, but he delves a bit deeper & shows how it's almost always a product of its time. Even Darwin was competing with Wallace for springing the idea of evolution through natural selection, but there were 2 dozen people inventing the light bulb before Edison grabbed all the credit in the US. Most other inventions have similar stories & so he thinks Nobel Prizes & patents often do a disservice the process. He points out that Mendel & his genetics were an exception since his work was too early. It was 35 years later that several people rediscovered the idea & finally gave Mendel credit. He didn't mention it, but cast iron was developed in the 5th century BC in China where it died out. It wasn't until underlying tech had caught up that it played a pivotal role in the Industrial Revolution in the West over 2000 years later.  8 The Evolution of the Mind -  There are a lot of quotes from Free Will. He does a creditable job of disturbing my sense of self. This is not a worm hole I want to go down too far nor does our society since it would undermine our justice system.  9 The Evolution of Personality -  covers a lot of the nurture versus nature debate, a pendulum of opinion where 'nature' led to the eugenics movement & then swung to the opposite extreme of pure nurture & the blank slate idea that feminists seem to adore. Now it's swinging back & again seems to be going too far, IMO. I think there's more to birth order & parental influence than Ridley suggests.10 The Evolution of Education -  from informal class rooms to a top down system that is so structured that it stifles learning. He mentions Montessori schools & seems to think private ones are the best. He thinks conformity has gone too far, but he didn't look enough at the USA in the 1800s. We're a special case with our large, diverse population. Some conformity is needed, especially to stop elitism & religious fanatics. All schools indoctrinate, so his argument there isn't a good one.11 The Evolution of Population -  shows how top down efforts at population control aren't very good. They're either inefficient or brutal, such as eugenics. He does a creditable job covering that. Also discussions of food supply (He never named Borlag.) & foreign aid. The latter doesn't work well, usually just leads to corruption.12 The Evolution of Leadership -  not a terribly convincing chapter, but interesting. Again he is arguing that it is a combination of factors, not one person, who really makes a difference.13 The Evolution of Government -  argues for free markets & trade. I especially enjoyed finding out that others share my view that there isn't much difference between fascism & communism in reality. He also shows how the Right & Left have swapped places over the years.14 The Evolution of Religion -  Excellent overview, especially since he works his way up to our current beliefs. Great anecdote about crop circles. He's right that Climate Change & Organic are too often resembling new religions.15 The Evolution of Money -  some interesting examples, but I'm not sure banking practices from 200 years ago are on point. Seemed more like preaching his point. That's gotten more blatant as the book has gone on & now Ron Paul is quoted often. He ignores problems with the exchange & storage of Bitcoins, but has other great points about them & the 2008 US housing bubble.16 The Evolution of the Internet -  Pretty good, but again one-sided. No mention of  Facebook–Cambridge Analytica data scandal, search/index manipulation & biases, or the Dark Web.Epilogue: The Evolution of the Future -  There are two ways to tell the story of the twentieth century. You can describe a series of wars, revolutions, crises, epidemics, financial calamities. Or you can point to the gentle but inexorable rise in the quality of life of almost everybody on the planet: the swelling of income, the conquest of disease, the disappearance of parasites, the retreat of want, the increasing persistence of peace, the lengthening of life, the advances in technology. I wrote a whole book about the latter story, and wondered why it seemed original and surprising to do so...Life is getting better & the future does look bright if we pay attention to what's really happening, not what the 'news' shoves in our faces. It's even more hopeful because the Internet is decentralizing business & other aspects of our lives allowing us more personalized experiences & services."
5,0062296000,http://goodreads.com/user/show/8620410-matt-gough,3,"Matt Ridley has an interesting theory here, and there are a few parts of the book that really shine. For instance, his chapters on the emergence of life, genes, culture, and technology are well-supported by his research, and with those subjects he makes a compelling argument for bottom-up evolution. However, I thought the theory felt forced with the other subjects he chose to focus on, especially education, population, and the economy. When writing about these topics in particular, Ridley seemed to be guilty of confirmation bias, really only looking at the evidence that supported his theory and paying no heed to contradictory evidence. Particularly in those chapters, Ridley's conservative political beliefs were too apparent, which ultimately hurt his argument. Overall, an interesting premise that I thought was stretched a little too thin."
6,0062296000,http://goodreads.com/user/show/979095-alan-cook,5,"I have given a lot of books 5-star ratings, but this book stands out among them. I won't say it solves all the world's problems, but it certainly points to a lot of things that could be done better, which would improve the freedom and well being of the human race. The premise is that just about everything changes (and improves) by evolution in a bottom-up manner, rather than top-down by the action of somebody on high (such as God, the president, or anybody with power), including the universe, living things, morality and technology. Of course, most politicians, priests and CEOs will disagree with this, but the evidence and examples are too good to ignore. I was particularly impressed with the discussion of changes in technology, including the Internet (which Al Gore didn't invent, by the way), because it reminded me of complex computer systems worked on by my wife, Bonny, at Xerox (see Breaking Through the Glass Ceiling, Traveling the World, and Other Adventures, by Bonny Robinson Cook) that involved teams of people from different departments creating new technology using a trial-and-error approach. The book will have you questioning the ""standard"" approach to doing everything. For example, the standard method of teaching is to have an authority figure in front of a roomful of captive students pounding into their heads what she wants them to know. When you learn that this system was developed by the Prussians in the 19th century in order to mentally prepare boys to become soldiers and die for their country you might have second thoughts about it. New approaches to education are evolving all the time. It used to be that you had to take a typing class taught by a teacher in order to learn how to type, but now every teenager can type information into a computer at blinding speed without ever having had a typing lesson. Top-down approaches of governments to problems like welfare, drugs, climate change and infrastructure are expensive, cumbersome, and often complete failures. It is said that skeptics about commonly accepted problems and their solutions are subversive and should be shut up (never mind the First Amendment to the Constitution). Count me as a skeptic."
7,0062296000,http://goodreads.com/user/show/11462400-chris-jaffe,1,"I was on page 10 when I first got the feeling that author Matt Ridley might be completely full of shit. And he never gave me any reason to go back on that impression. I plowed through the book anyway, because I'm into completing things, but can't say I liked it.The part on page 10 that first set off my BS detector: Ridley writes about his discovery of Roman poet/philosopher Lucretius, Ridley fumes at his schoolmasters, ""How could they have made me waste all those years at school plodding through the tedious platitudes and pedestrian prose of Jesus Christ or Julius Caesar, when they could have been telling me about Lucretius . . . . Had the Christians not suppressed Lucretius, we would surely have discovered Darwinism centuries before we did."" Well now, I could day several things about that. Some are ticky-tack things (both the Bible and Caesar actually are well-regarded as literature). But more importantly, does this strike anyone as overstating things by a lot? Not only is Lucretius important to him, but he could/should've made a huge difference to world society -- he even feels the need to throw in a SURELY to describe the obviousness of ... what's just his opinion. Also, this came right after Ridley went over the history of Lucretius - he'd been redisocovered in 1417. Does Ridley really thing the theory of evolution would've broken out in 1143 or something? Theories and ideas are nice, but the real problem was that Rome fell, taken over by semi-barbarian tribes that couldn't keep much in the way of civilization going. Things broke down and fell apart into internal warfare, trade suffered - and literacy fell was nearly completely lost. I mean, if we still have this guy's poems, that's all happening anyway. Finally, that leads to a final problem with the above quote: Christian suppression? His real problem was that civilization collapsed. Sure, churches didn't do much copying of his works, but -1) they focused more on copying church documents, which yeah - they were a church, and 2) they copied his poems down, too - which is how they survived. (Oh, and in a final bit of irony, later on in the book Ridley attacks the Great Man Theory of history -- but Lucretius by himself could've jumpstarted modern science by centuries. Surely). Look, I just spent far too much time on that little piece. It's what first set off my BS detector, but more importantly is why the BS detector kept going off. One major issue is the too broad definition he gives to evolution. It starts off fine, as he discusses actual evolution in the early chapters - Darwin's theory, and DNA, and the like. He then starts to make a series of analogies later on when discussing modern issues, like economics. There is some similarity there (but I'll get to my problems with that in a second). But later he keeps going on to anything that's change. For example, a chapter on education contains a detailed critique of current education systems. OK, fair enough. But how is that evolution? He wants several changes made, and concludes the chapter by stating, ""Let education evolve."" OK, so he's calling for specific, deliberate changes to be made with a clear end result in mind...... And that's evolution? As this book notes, evolution isn't steps made toward a clear, deliberate goal. They are just gradual changes over time acting spontaneously. But he's pushing an agenda here, and hiding behind the theory of evolution to push for specific steps to make.And, frankly, even when analogies work better (such as when he talks about Adam Smith), there are still problems. For one, there is a clear sense pervading this book that evolution is good. That the change it brings in progress. Folks, evolution isn't about progression or regression. It's just change. To whit: the overwhelming majority of species that have evolved have gone extinct - including a huge number of ones that thrived for long times. But there is an even bigger, deeper issue here. It doesn't make much sense at all for evolution to be used as an analogy for modern day social, political, and economic issues - not nearly to extent that Ridley does. Evolution: it works incredibly gradually. There is no intent and thought in mind. It's just gradual changes and mutations that take place over centuries and millenniums that cause animals to change, stay the same, or cease to exist. It takes hundreds of generations for even the mildest of changes to become readily apparent. And as a result of the fact it takes hundreds or thousands of generations to result in gradual changes within a species ... we should start using Bitcoin. Wait - what? The theory of evolution means that environmentalism is an authoritian example of liberal fascism. Or we should enroll students in MOOCs. I mean - huh? There is a spector haunting this book - that of Social Darwinism. That was a 19th century movement that, like Ridley, wanted to use the principles of evolution to reorder society. In their minds, evolution could be used to justify laissez faire economics, imperialism and racism. It's all about survival of the fittest, don't you know. Ridley is NOT advocating racism or imperialism. But you could just as easily use evolution to justify those policies as the one Ridley likes. In both cases, you have to overlook how a theory of biological/genetic changes that take centuries to play out really don't relate too well to modern social issues. Ridley barely mentions Social Darwinism at all. He mostly seems to oppose it because the agenda it pushes is more state-centric, where Ridley is fully in the libertarian camp. There is also some irony at work at the edges of this book. He denigrates religious beliefs, stating that all movements based on faith have a centrality of a single ""skyhook"" - by which he means a central single, perfect answer that explains all. He even includes Marxism as one example of a faith that suffers from this flaw. He has a point there - but seems completely blind to that this same argument can be used against him. Christians can look to the Bible for their One True Faith. Marxists can look to Das Capital. And Ridley has his libertarian brand of social Darwinism. It's the One Truth Faith that is never wrong and can explain all things. Some parts make good points - like when he discusses the vacancy of the Great Man theory of history. Also, the book by Tom Holland on early Islam he mentions is really good. But far too often Ridley makes a serious of bad analogies, overstates his case, hand-waives away any info that goes against his One True Faith, and, well - is basically full of shit. "
8,0062296000,http://goodreads.com/user/show/8101737-peter-tillman,4,"An important book, if somewhat scattershot. Ridley prefers things to be done from the bottom up, instead of from the top down, and so do I. But. Even though I’m sympathetic to what he’s writing, he does get carried away at times. But he’s likely right, and almost always interesting. And he’s done his homework. From my notes:1779-81. Cornwallis’s army decimated by malaria in South Carolina and Virginia, in what one US historian called “covert biological warfare.” Cornwallis’s weakened troops defeated by Gen. Washington at Yorktown, 1781. US wins independence. Thomas Malthus’s evil legacy: A million people dead from the Irish famines, 1840s. “An effective mechanism for reducing surplus population,” wrote one British official.Up to 10 million dead from starvation in India, 1877. Not only did the British Viceroy not feed them, he forbade multiple private attempts to feed the starving people.People on the receiving end have long memories for this sort of thing. Barbara Tuchman's comments re ""The March of Folly"" come to mind.Eugenics, neo-Malthusians: In the US, starting in the 1930s, 30 states passed laws allowing compulsory sterilization of “defective” people. 63,000 sterilized by the 1970s, when the laws were struck down. California was the leading state in this program.Nazi Germany explicitly modeled their eugenics program on California’s. By 1934, Nazis were sterilizing 5,000 people per month. 400,000 people sterilized in Hitler’s first 6 years in office. Then the murders began.India, 1966: US refuses to give famine aid until India sets up “massive” population control. 3 million sterilizations per year, 1972-73. 8 million sterilized, 1976. Congratulations from Robert McNamara. Paul Ehrlich is “astounded” at criticism of the massive Indian sterilizations. Very disturbing chapter. By then, India’s birth rates were already falling, and their food production rapidly rising, from new breeds of grain from Norman Borlaug’s Green Revolution.

10,0062296000,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5686119-book,4,"The Evolution of Everything: How New Ideas Emerge by Matt Ridley “The Evolution of Everything"" is a book on social Darwinism and it’s wide reaching effect from a libertarian perspective. It’s highly readable and provocative but misses the mark on two very important topics: climate change and the 2008 financial crisis. Well known journalist, scientist and educator; Matt Ridley, makes the persuasive case that evolution explains virtually all of human culture changes: from morality to technology, from money to religion. This stimulating 368-page book includes the following sixteen chapters covering the evolution of: 1. Universe, 2. Morality, 3. Life, 4. Genes, 5. Culture, 6. Economy, 7. Technology, 8. Mind, 9. Personality, 10. Education, 11. Population, 12. Leadership, 13. Government, 14. Religion, 15. Money, and 16. Internet.Positives:1.	A highly readable, optimistic and provocative book.2.	An excellent topic, evolution is happening all around us. 3.	Ridley is a gifted author; he pulls ideas from multiple disciplines and is able to persuade the reader that successful ideas emerge more so than planned for. 4.	Each chapter begins with an excerpt from Lucretius’s poem De Rerum Natura (Of the Nature of Things) and covers a specific topic and subtopics. The books lends itself quite well to be used as a future reference. 5.	Does a good job of introducing Lucretius and his influence on major thinkers. “Voltaire’s contempt for theodicy derived directly and explicitly from Lucretius, whose arguments he borrowed throughout life, styling himself at one point the ‘latter-day Lucretius’.”6.	An interesting chapter on morality. “Smith went one step further, and suggested that morality emerged unbidden and unplanned from a peculiar feature of human nature: sympathy.” “Morality therefore emerged as a consequence of certain aspects of human nature in response to social conditions.”7.	The foundation of Darwin’s grand idea of evolution. “That is the essence of Darwin’s idea: that beautiful and intricate organisms can be made without anybody knowing how to make them.” “The more we understand genomics, the more it confirms evolution.”8.	A very persuasive look at how language emerged. “Languages mutate, diversify, evolve by descent with modification and merge in a ballet of unplanned beauty. Yet the end result is structure, and rules of grammar and syntax as rigid and formal as you could want. ‘The formation of different languages, and of distinct species, and the proofs that both have been developed through a gradual process, are curiously parallel,’ wrote Charles Darwin in The Descent of Man.”9.	Ridley is a great defender of the free-market enterprise. “The central feature of commerce, and the thing that distinguishes it from socialist planning, is that it is decentralized.” “The Smithian economy is a process of exchange and specialization among ordinary people. It is an emergent phenomenon.”10.	Interesting look at technology and science. “Again and again, once you examine the history of innovation, you find scientific breakthroughs as the effect, not the cause, of technological change.” “Technology comes from technology far more often than from science.”11.	Solid chapter on the mind. “The self is a consequence, not a cause, of thought. To think otherwise is to posit a miraculous incarnation of an immaterial spirit.” “The study of the brain has found no pearl, no organ or structure that houses the self or consciousness or the will. It never will, for these phenomena are distributed among the neurons in the same way that the plan for how to make a pencil is distributed among the many contributors to a market economy.” “We are nothing but the neural signals of our brain, multiply caused by the multiple influences upon us.”12.	An interesting look at personality. “Instead, the truth is that personality unfolds from within, responding to the environment – so in a very literal sense of the word, it evolves.”13.	A very key founding disclosed on sexual innateness. “Never was the consternation of the establishment more acute than in the 1990s, when it became clear that homosexuality was much more innate and irreversible than people had been assuming, and much less a matter of early life experience or adolescent indoctrination.”14.	A fascinating look at violence. “They argued that the cultural-determinist explanations did not fit the facts, and that it was far more likely that men were more violent for similar reasons that other male mammals were more violent – because they had in the past been forced by biology to compete for mating opportunities.”15.	Explains how we learn. “We learn by reading, by watching, by emulating, by doing.” “The lesson that schooling can be encouraged to emerge from below was ignored in favor of the theory that it must be imposed from above.”16.	Debunks myths on how to slow down populations. “The way to get population growth to slow, it turns out, is to keep babies alive, to bring health, prosperity and education to all.” “Malthus’s poor laws were wrong; British attitudes to famine in India and Ireland were wrong; eugenics was wrong; the Holocaust was wrong; India’s sterilization programme was wrong; China’s one-child policy was wrong. These were sins of commission, not omission. Malthusian misanthropy – the notion that you should harden your heart, approve of famine and disease, feel ashamed of pity and compassion, for the good of the race – was wrong pragmatically as well as morally. The right thing to do about poor, hungry and fecund people always was, and still is, to give them hope, opportunity, freedom, education, food and medicine, including of course contraception, for not only will that make them happier, it will enable them to have smaller families.”17.	A counterintuitive look at poverty. “The real cause of poverty today – now that it is avoidable – is the unchecked power of the state against poor people without rights, says William Easterly.”18.	How religions evolve. “To anybody who has read the history of the ancient world, it is crystal clear by contrast that, in the words of the title of Selina O’Grady’s book on the subject, Man Created God. God is plainly an invention of the human imagination, whether in the form of Jahweh, Christ, Allah, Vishnu, Zeus or Anygod else.” “My argument will be that this phenomenon can only be explained as an instance of cultural evolution: that all gods and all superstitions emerge from within human minds, and go through characteristic but unplanned transformations as history unfolds. Thus even the most top–down feature of human culture is actually a bottom–up, emergent phenomenon.” “In short, you can tell the story of the rise of Christianity without any reference to divine assistance. It was a movement like any other, a man-made cult, a cultural contagion passed from mind to mind, a natural example of cultural evolution.”19.	The emergence of money. “Money is an evolutionary phenomenon. It emerged gradually among traders, rather than being created by rulers – despite the heads of kings on the coins: those just illustrated the tendency of the powerful to insist on monopolies.”20.	The evolution of the internet. “Few can doubt that the internet is a force for liberty of the individual.” Negatives:1.	No direct links to sources.2.	Libertarian perspective that can rub some folks the wrong way. In his defense, I generally found Ridley to be fair. My personal progressive views at times conflicted with Ridley’s but I’m open to an intelligently written book which this is. 3.	My biggest disagreement with Ridley is his lack of concern for climate change to put it mildly. His point is that climate change supporters are acquiring religious overtones against deniers. The truth is that Mr. Ridley is underselling the overwhelming global scientific consensus for climate change. We can disagree on the approach to address this real problem but we can’t deny the scientific facts.4.	I disagree with his characterization of the 2008 financial crash. Ridley defends the free-market enterprise at the expense of the facts. No mention of predatory lending, abuse of the banking industry, golden parachutes, lobbying to benefit the powerful, and the fact that you can help those with lesser incomes to purchase affordable homes without compromising the entire economy. In fact a lot of the financial crisis can be attributed to emerging cancer cells of greed that manipulated the market to their benefit at the expense of society. In short, banks privatized the earnings and socialized the losses. 5.	The chapter on money may be above the heads of most laypersons. 6.	Underestimates the power of government to fund projects that are too high risk for private industry.In summary, a very stimulating and interesting book to read. I debated myself whether to give three or four stars to this book and concluded that despite my vehement disagreement on climate change and the financial crisis of 2008 that the book is stimulating and well written enough to justify four stars. In general, I agree with the premise that ideas emerged or evolved than planned for from the top down. Despite my aforementioned strong disagreements worthy of four stars. I recommend it!Further recommendations: If you like books with a libertarian bent you will enjoy anything from John Stossel “No, They Can’t”, “Myth, Lies, and Downright Stupidity” and “Give Me A Break”, “The Rational Optimist” and “The Red Queen” by Matt Ridley, “The Vital Question” by Nick Lane, “The Swerve” by Stephen Greenblatt, “Undeniable: Evolution and the Science of Creation” by Bill Nye “The Greatest Shown On Earth” by Richard Dawkins."
11,0062296000,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4024817-otto-lehto,3,"Starts off strong but devolves halfway into an unfocused diatribe. A more generous judgment is that the book is an ideological polemic with some scientific pretensions. Ridley starts from the intriguing premise (to which I am very sympathetic) that bottom-up processes of ""self-organisation"", from Charles Darwin's natural selection to Adam Smith's invisible hand, explain much of cosmic, biological, human, and socioeconomic evolution. In order to elucidate this claim, Ridley takes on the ambitious task of explaining how evolution applies in a dozen different domains of life, from the rise of the internet to moral progress and the schooling of the poor. At its best, it makes a compelling (although biased) case that people need to abandon their love affair with the all powerful government and embrace evolutionary, bottom-up thinking in economics. The book is ambitious but this is not the problem. The first problem is a lack of focus and order. Since EVERYTHING evolves under a suitably broad definition, Ridley uses this as a license to talk about everything on his mind with the thinnest possible common thread. The second problem is the excessive ideological slant. Instead of developing the central thesis by weighing the pros and cons of various positions, he goes on a shotgun rampage that aims to undermine all the ramparts of the ""central planning"" school. In so doing, he happily glosses over the nuances in the scientific debate by cherry picking studies and perspectives that support his libertarian thesis. Even though his arguments on various policy issues are often good (or at least debatable), he mostly doubles down on the idea that ""oh, human learning / technological development / moral evolution / [insert X] is a bottom-up process so let me talk about it in libertarian terms."" These discussions don't differ much from hundreds of other books. ""Oh, market is an evolutionary process? Let me tell you about markets in X, Y, and Z..."" These loosely connected diatribes on markets, biology, genes, cosmology, human civilization, schooling, foreign aid, global warming, and the internet contain some nuggets of insight and wisdom - especially for people who are new to them - but most of them are rather generic and, dare I say, libertarian talking pointy. This mostly results in vague insights about everything but precise insights about nothing.A typical example of this lack of nuance is his discussion of the origin of internet. There, he dismisses the role of government funding with some hand waving. This is a lopsided position, to say the least. Another example is his discussion on global warming: he presents a heterodox position without bothering with a serious engagement with the consensus view (and what does this have to do with Lucretius and Darwin anyway?). Even where he makes some good points, he overplays his hand by claiming too much on too little evidence. Instead of highlighting the need to think critically about the powers of top down organisation, he ends up advocating for the highly implausible thesis that top down programs can never guide evolution or solve its problems.As a further example of his methodological double standards, Ridley ends up claiming that Mao's Cultural Revolution was a CLEAR example of a top down program but Deng Xiaoping's market reforms were a CLEAR example of a bottom-up process. Both arguments are false. Ridley forgets to mention that Mao's Cultural Revolution - as well as various other cases of human warfare, violence, socialist agitation, and mass starvation - had aspects of bottom-up organization to them. (They were used, for example, by local peasants to vent grievances and to settle disputes.) And plenty of liberal reforms - including privatization, marketization, rule of law, etc. - have aspects of top-down central planning (or what Ridley calls ""creationism"") to them. (They were facilitated by a few key personnel at the top of the Chinese government hierarchy.) My point with these examples is NOT to reverse his arguments on their head but to show how easy it is to reinterpret data.I have perhaps been a little harsh. I like much of the book. It synthesizes lots of interesting research. At its best, the prose is thrilling and entertaining. However, it does not quite deliver on its promise. It's not that the material in the book is implausible or wrong, it's just too biased and unfocused. The author paints the whole world in a single colour and revels in its monochromy. As it is, it only gets a modest recommendation. It delivers exceptional ideas in a middling package."
12,0062296000,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4251182-david,5,"Matt Ridley produces another libertarian classic, to match his earlier The Rational Optimist, with The Evolution of Everything. Taking evolution out of the strictly biological and to the cultural, technological, political, and about every other arena of human endeavor. What interests him particularly is exposing the creationism of the Left and government. By creationism is meant top down planning rather than a creator god. Mr. Ridley argues the case against planning and top down control in favor of a bottom up strategy...in other words, an evolutionary strategy in which an idea, concept, technology, etc. is released into a social environment or market and allowed to freely compete with other ideas in order to determine which is better suited to the environmental niche. The idea of cultural evolution, Mr. Ridley's libertarian variety, is very compelling and fits in very well with his last book -- The Rational Optimist. Rating 5 out of 5 stars Recommended for those looking for an alternative to big government and an intrusive state. A must read for libertarians. "
13,0062296000,http://goodreads.com/user/show/126688-shaw,3,Some sweeping over-generalizations in this book took away from my overall rating but this was still a very interesting book. Recommended with a few grains of salt. 
14,0062296000,http://goodreads.com/user/show/17763301-andrew-carr,3,"Evolution has always been a subversive idea. Order from chaos, progress without direction, design without a designer. But are humans the last word in natural evolution, or do their societies represent the evolution of evolution; from the biological to the ideational, cultural, and technological?This is the argument at the heart of The Evolution of Everything by the science writer Matt Ridley. Not only has life and the universe evolved, so do humans over time. These same basic laws of bottom up, spontaneous order are to be found — and celebrated — everywhere. The book argues that what both explains the human world, as well as creates the best of it, is evolutionary. What is bad or harmful, is attributed to command and control attempts, from creationism to communism.The book works through 16 chapters, each ostensibly focused on a topic such as Morality, Technology, Education, Population, Religion, Genes and so on. Each chapter is packed with different ideas and arguments, bounding around the topic in an always entertaining fashion. The first part of the book which tends to focus more on science or broad social dynamics (morality, culture etc) is especially engaging. In one fascinating section, Ridley presents a view of humans as sites of ongoing evolutionary competition, as their genes, impulses, histories and circumstances dramatically shape their behaviour. So much for free will it seems, at least in its populist sense. He also rightly challenges the idea of ‘great men’ of history, whether pointing out that many, many ideas are developed simultaneously around the world, while many celebrated world leaders often simply got out of the way of big changes, rather than being the cause of them. At the half way mark, I was starting to recommend this book to my friends. The compelling idea within is that if you accept evolution in nature, you should encourage it in civilisation. Focus on open, competitive systems. Look to social norms rather than coercion, and have confidence in innovation and creativity as natural byproducts of humans left to live their own lives as they choose. An unrestrained society is a more moral, prosperous and interesting place.The problem is that as the book moves evermore from science to social science, this thread goes missing. Or rather, Ridley switches from arguing for a pro-evolution explanation, to arguing against management and direction. While these notions are opposed, they are not exclusive. But this distinction often seems lost, and with it an analysis of the role of evolution in human practice. So instead of offering an easily told but important tale of how governance has changed, been tested, failed, adapted and improved over time (and thus perhaps why we should seek further innovation), we get a somewhat banal attack on government as resistant to change, unable to provide services and generally inclined to authoritarianism.As Ridley gets out of his comfort zone of scientific issues, the chapters get clearly weaker. Topics bounce around far more, assumptions are less clearly identified and debates and opposing views more quickly dismissed. In one notable case on page 238 the author jumps uses a study of the evolution of social norms in prison to state that “in other words, government begins as a protection racket”. Quite how this study proves this, I never could understand. Worse, we have significant evidence for how government and states have formed, none of which Ridley seems to have engaged (See Fukuyama’s latest 2 volume on Origins of Political Order tome at the very least). Instead Ridley seems to dismiss all government as simply a form of domination forced upon us at the expense of our development and wellbeing.The Evolution of Everything also seems remarkably unwilling to confront exactly what evolution is or means. We get virtually no discussion of the way it transmits or operates outside of biological environments. And little mention, beyond the noble failures of entrepreneurs of the costs of evolutionary change. Instead, when the development of ideas about human eugenics and survival of the fittest is raised, it is done so to lay the entire blame at the feet of those who believe in government and command and control. Certainly in the application of these abuses government mattered, but it is ridiculous to ignore the logic which motivated these movements. Confusingly Ridley also spends time condemning the British willingness to ignore the potato famine in Ireland even though the ‘we shouldn’t interfere, let god sort it out’ logic was directly shaped by competitive, anti-statist notions. It’s not that we can’t embrace an evolutionary approach because of these downsides, but rather that an honest and ultimately more persuasive analysis of these ideas would confront, accept and discuss remedies head on. Ridley like many libertarians is quick to say he wants government and social aid, while spending most of his time saying how terrible it is and never drawing clear lines for how to do it with the least harm. Ultimately, I agree with most of this book. At its best it speaks of a philosophy that operates with human nature rather than against. One that celebrates human flourishing and works to remove any barriers and impediments that stand in its way. But too much of this book puts aside discussing the way evolution operates, and instead tries to attack what the author sees as some of the main barriers to it. All are well-known, and the book lands few if any telling blows against them.That makes it a frustrating read. I enjoyed it, I am glad I read it. I just wish it fulfilled its promise more effectively so I could recommend it more widely. Ridley is not the first to apply evolutionary ideas to human society, so in the spirit of this book, I hope that maybe those who come after will be more adapted to the task than he was."
15,0062296000,http://goodreads.com/user/show/25983384-jason-lockwood,5,"Some people love Matt Ridley and some people hate him. Whatever your point of view, there's no mistaking that he gets people thinking and challenging assumptions. In his latest book, he gets us all reconsidering the notion that people and societies progress due to a top-down approach. Whether it's politicians who take (or are given) credit for economic progress or CEOs who are viewed as the only source of a company's success, Ridley provides ample evidence that neither are true.What he presents--and I agree with his basic view if not all the particulars--is that life is evolution in every aspect. He does the unthinkable, too: he criticises both the political left and right, but for different reasons. Some reviewers excoriate Ridley for being 'right-wing,' (a notion he mocks in the book), but what he really stands for is what writer Virginia Postrel called 'dynamism versus stasis.' He is equally scornful of government controlled and directed economies and religious control of people. This sets him apart from the warmed over left-right dichotomy so commonly put forth today. Even when I disagree with Ridley, I find that it's a gentle disagreement, because he presents ideas in such a calm way that he comes off not as a polemical crank, but as an avuncular adviser. I highly recommend The Evolution of Everything to anyone who invites challenge to his thinking, even if the book is unkind to many cherished viewpoints. "
16,0062296000,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5948865-james,4,"Interesting walk in the park of history and evolution. There were a couple of ideas thrown in throughout the book that I found intriguing in that he proposed a new way to look at how things evolved (ex. history of religion). The other part of this book was the tie in with Titus Lucretius Carus. Most chapters seem to start with a reflection of one segment from Lucretius's De rerum natura. Written almost 2000 years ago, I will agree that many ideas proposed in his poem do hold true in some facet to today's theories and belief systems. At times it felt like a doctoral paper in the making based on Lucretius's ideas. Nice way to look at root and evolution of many of today's norms. "
17,0062296000,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5469227-d-l-morrese,3,"The following is a rather lengthy review. I'd apologize for that, but some things just need a bit more explaining than others.People have a natural tendency to seek agency. If something momentous happens, then someone must have caused it. If something complex exists, someone obviously designed and built it. But this natural human way of looking at things leads to unwarranted assumptions. No one, for example, planned the evolution of life.Ridley extends Darwin’s insight about biological evolution to human culture and invention. No one planned the development of language. No one planned the industrial revolution. No one planned today’s global economy. These things evolved. They weren’t designed from the top down. They emerged from the bottom up. In this book, Ridley specifically argues that Adam Smith’s Invisible Hand guides economics in much the same way that natural selection guides the evolution of life. Both emerge from the complex interplay of individual agents acting out of self-interest with no common goal. They operate without any grand plan, and yet they create (albeit unintentionally) complex, well-ordered, and reasonably efficient systems. He has great faith in the power of the Invisible Hand. Don’t try to direct it, and good things will happen.To me, his belief in the power of the Invisible Hand seems a bit too…well, utopian. Simplistic. Possibly even a bit mystical. The Hand works in mysterious ways. We don’t know how, exactly, but we must have faith that it is all for the best and let it get on with things. As long as we don’t interfere, all will be well. Society will evolve for the better. The state will wither away, and everyone will live in peace and prosperity. His end state seems ironically similar to the one Karl Marx envisioned, and I think it’s flawed for one of the same reasons Marx’s was—people. They aren’t ready for it…yet. There are those, and I like to believe the number grows with every generation, who do not require coercion or the threat of divine or secular punishment in order to behave properly toward their fellow human beings. But many still do. The state may be an unfortunate necessity at this point in human evolution.If it’s possible to be a cynical optimist, Matt Ridley qualifies. He makes several valid points in this book. Order can emerge from chaos. Actions motivated solely by self-interest can have unintended and broadly beneficial consequences. Human culture does evolve, and it has progressed and improved over time. But he makes an unjustified leap by concluding that it is therefore a mistake to attempt to bring about cultural change or broad social benefits intentionally. Evolution, both biological and cultural, he seems to argue, are best left to natural selection and the free market. Restraining the Invisible Hand leads to disaster.Well, it can, except sometimes it doesn’t. Sometimes the Hand needs a shove. Or maybe it’s better to say that the Invisible Hand has more fingers than he seems to think it has.Ridley often sounds like a cranky old man grinding philosophical axes*, and in this book, he vents his libertarian spleen on all things that smack of authority. This includes religion and crony capitalism, but his favorite target is government in all its current and historical forms. He doesn’t like government (which seems odd considering that Viscount Ridley is a member of the British House of Lords). He sees it as a top-down intrusion on the proper bottom-up evolution of human society. Let the free market work!But there is no free market, and I doubt one would last long if there was. (See Saving Capitalism by Robert B. Reich https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/2...) Markets in our modern society depend on governments to protect capital assets and intellectual property. Governments provide the framework within which individuals and businesses negotiate contracts with one another, and they provide legal recourse in the event of contract violation. Governments maintain competition by restricting monopolies so that large corporations cannot eliminate their existing and potential competitors (e.g. through hostile takeovers, dumping goods, or intimidating suppliers). Governments also help bolster the economy by instilling consumer confidence. Because of governmental regulations, you can be fairly sure that the food and medicine you buy isn’t toxic; that your appliances, cars, homes, and other purchases are reasonably safe to use; and that whatever else you buy will function almost as well as the seller claims it will. If you are in the unfortunate position of having to work for a living, your workplace is probably safer, your workday shorter, your pay better, and you may even enjoy some kind of insurance or even paid holidays because of governmental policies.A firm believer in laissez faire economics might argue that all of these benefits would come about on their own accord through the magic of market forces, but they didn’t, which is why these governmental policies came about. Worker exploitation, sweatshops, child labor, and unsafe working conditions were rampant only a century ago. The case of the Triangle Shirtwaist factory fire in New York City in 1911 is probably one of the most famous examples. (http://www.history.com/topics/triangl...). In a bottom-up effort, voters demanded that something be done. Government responded by enacting laws. (e.g. the U.S., the Federal Trade Commission Act of 1914, the Fair Labor Standards Act of 1937, the Occupational Safety and Health Act of 1970, the Consumer Product Safety Act of 1972). Admittedly, these probably did not all work as well as many hoped, and some may have had unforeseen consequences, but these laws and others were passed because the ‘free’ market had not been able to prevent abuses by private businesses that exploited workers and cheated consumers. Clearly, not all business were dishonest or exploitative, but a top-down mandate was needed, not only to protect workers and consumers, but also to establish a level playing field to protect responsible business owners from unfair competition by those who were not.So, were these societal changes examples of bottom-up evolution brought about by voter demand or were they top-down impositions on the free market by government? Both? Neither?Personally, I think it’s a false dichotomy. Let me begin by saying that power bases emerge in human society whether you want them to or not. They form from the bottom up. We can’t prevent them, nor do I think we should try. They exist to pursue the interests of their constituents, and in doing so can provide benefits to each member that they cannot obtain as well on their own. But they can also unjustly impose their will on nonmembers. If one group becomes too powerful, or if two or more combine forces, they can oppress or exploit others. Maintaining some kind of power balance so that this does not happen can be difficult.Prior to the Enlightenment, government, in the form of a monarch and sundry aristocracy, could be seen as a separate power base, as could the Church, landed gentry, craftsmen, and peasants. Each of these had its own unique interests, which they pursued, sometimes cooperatively but often competitively. If you wish to imagine society as something guided by an invisible hand, these would have been its fingers, the two strongest of which were the monarch and the Church.Modern Western society has different fingers. These can be generalized as workers, consumers, business owners, and bankers. Religion is still with us, of course, and it does have unique interests and it does exert power, so it may be seen as a finger as well. As in the past, these groups may have overlapping constituencies, but they don’t have common goals, and the conflicts between them create the evolutionary pressures that move societies. Together, these five fingers shape human culture in unplanned ways. (I don’t include government as one of these modern fingers for reasons I’ll explain soon.)All of these fingers represent their members and push society in some way. Consumers want quality products at affordable prices. Workers want secure, well-paying jobs. Religions want to spread their faiths. Businesses and banks want to earn profits for owners/investors. Democratic government is a bit different in that it represents (or should represent) interests common to everyone. As difficult as it may be to imagine at times, and despite the real differences that may exist between them, all people have more interests in common than not…safety, property, opportunity, freedom…or as the U.S. Declaration of Independence puts it, life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness.A properly functioning democratic government has the unenviable task of ensuring equal rights for all its citizens and for being an impartial arbiter when the goals of the metaphorical fingers come into conflict. Is it more important for consumers to have lower prices or for workers to have higher wages? Are these more or less important than business owners reaping high profits or banks charging high interest? When does a religion’s goal of spreading the faith intrude on the freedom of nonbelievers? These are not hypothetical questions. All have had to be addressed in the past, and it has fallen on governments to do so because market forces can’t, at least not as well. When one group attempts to dominate, exploit, suppress, or even eliminate another, the purely evolutionary solution of allowing the strongest to win is probably not the best one for the long-term survival of a civilization. The government stands in defense of all, regardless of numbers or wealth. It codifies protected rights that apply to all its citizens, and it acts as a societal ratchet to prevent these rights from being denied in the future. Once proscribed by law, such things as slavery, child labor, and racial discrimination are far less likely to reemerge. A democratic government provides a balancing force so that the many cannot dominate the few and the rich and powerful cannot prey on the poor and weak.The balance breaks down if one societal power base exerts too much influence over governmental policies. Business control of government is just as detrimental to a society as governmental control of business. But democratic governments are self-correcting. They change from the bottom up. The dominating powers will fight to preserve their privileged positions. They’ll try to bend public opinion to maintain their position, but when voters feel that one group has too much influence, they’ll vote for change…and they might even achieve it. We may be seeing something like that happening now in the U.S. Time will tell.There is much about Matt Ridley’s argument with which I do not agree, but his central point that complex systems evolve in unexpected and unplanned ways is undeniable. They do. No single strategy directed the course of human progress. The scientific discoveries and cultural changes humanity has made since our ancestors first chipped stones into knives two and a half million years ago (or thereabout) have created a world that no one could have imagined, let alone planned. These advancements emerged incrementally, iteratively, one thing leading to another, with all the parts interacting in complex and often unpredictable ways. In short, our society evolved. There was no grand plan, but many of the little steps along the way were planned, which is where the comparison of scientific and cultural progress with biological evolution breaks down. The two processes appear similar from a great enough distance, but they differ in the details.Biological evolution lacks intent. Cells and microbes can’t imagine the future. They can’t plan. Over time, the individual cells that comprised the earliest forms of life came together, differentiated, and specialized to form larger and more complex organisms. This improved their survivability, but they didn’t adapt to survive. They survived because they adapted. This is an important difference. It’s a matter of cause and effect. It took natural selection billions of years to go from those earliest microbes to creatures like us because it operates without intent. It doesn’t build to a plan. Discrete biological changes (to DNA) are close enough to random to think of them as such, and most of those random mutations are fatal. Natural selection can create astounding complexity in this manner, but it’s hit or miss, and it takes a while.Cultural evolution is faster. The time span from Homo erectus to Homo sapiens took almost two million years. The time span from steam engines to nuclear power was less than three hundred. Why? Well, a lot of reasons, but complexity isn’t one of them. There are more differences between Newcomen’s steam engine and a nuclear reactor than there are between you and your multi-great grandmother a couple million years ago. A big factor for the difference in time scale is that each evolutionary step from pre-modern humans to us relied on unplanned natural selection. Each development between steam power and nuclear energy was the result of human premeditated action. Each improvement, every new idea along the way was proposed and developed by a human mind with intent.Ridley summarizes his position in the epilogue of his book. “To put my explanation in its boldest and most surprising form: bad news in manmade, top-down, purposed stuff, imposed on history. Good news is accidental, unplanned, emergent stuff that gradually evolves.”Ah, if only reality were that simple. The unfortunate truth is that most evolutionary changes are failures. Unplanned evolution doesn’t always bring success but neither does planned change. Most plans people make fail as well. What Ridley’s argument seems to boil down to is that evolutionary changes that have survived are successful. True, but tautological. Extrapolating from this dubious insight by claiming that unplanned evolutionary change is good and that manmade change is bad is simply absurd. It’s like claiming that doctors shouldn’t cut out tumors, prescribe antibiotics, provide vaccinations, or attempt to cure genetically inherited diseases because the bacteria, viruses, and genetic mutations they are trying to eliminate have evolved through natural selection and therefore must be good.Let me offer an alternate idea. Human culture and technology have advanced rapidly because when people see problems, they take action to fix them. They don’t wait around for the slow plod of evolution to make things better or, alternately and more likely, to drive them to extinction. Humans are toolmakers. The things we create, from hammers to stock markets, are tools that we intentionally design to accomplish certain tasks, and we improve upon them over time to make them work better.By all measurable criteria, our species’ quality of life has improved over time. People today (on average) are healthier, eat better, live longer, are freer, safer, and enjoy more material wealth than at any time in history. No one planned the current state of human affairs. It isn’t anyone’s imagined end state or ultimate goal. There is no end state. There is no final goal. Evolution is a continuing process. The reason our cultures evolve faster than our biology is partly that they have something biology does not. When it comes to the components of human culture, such as our religions, laws, forms of government, economic systems, philosophies, ethics, educational systems, music, art, inventions, and all other creations of the human mind, an intrinsic part of all of them is that they include an element of intent. People designed them from the top down in response to conditions imposed from the bottom up. They saw situations that they wanted improved, considered ways of adapting what they knew to the problems facing them, and came up with ideas they thought might work. Some did. Some didn’t. Those that work are more likely to survive. Richard Dawkins calls such ideas memes, but the important point is that these ideas do not spring up spontaneously. They originate in human minds. And although each of these ideas may be intended to address separate, seemingly unconnected issues, each forms a small component of a larger evolving system. Unlike biological evolution, human progress has an aspect of intelligent design.Which brings me back to Ridley’s issue with government and the free market. The Invisible Hand of the free market is not a separate ineffable force any more than the human mind is separate from the brain and body that create it. Both can be seen as emergent properties. But perhaps a better way to view the free market for this discussion is as a process. Just as evolution describes the process of living matter reacting to its environment, the free market describes the process of humans interacting to improve their lives. To do this, they build tools. If those tools don’t work quite as well as we’d like, we try to improve them.Businesses are tools. Banks are tools. Government is a tool. All of these are designed, built, modified, and used by people in order to improve their lives, and, over time and not at all miraculously, our lives have improved. Since this was and is the common intent, I’d say we’re not doing too badly. Evolution gave us our toolmaking ability. It would be a shame not to use it. ————-*So am I, but that’s beside the point."
18,0062296000,http://goodreads.com/user/show/76014-raghu,2,"Charles Darwin stated in his theory of biological evolution that all species of organisms arise and develop through the natural selection of small, inherited variations that increase the individual's ability to compete, survive, and reproduce. This happens through a process of trial and error whereby beneficial variations are favored and injurious ones discarded. Author Ridley calls this the 'Special theory of Evolution' and goes on to extend it to a General theory of Evolution by applying it to a broad spectrum of human endeavour such as Religion, Morality, Economy, Technology, Culture, Money and so on. His argument is that all these and other aspects of our culture also change all the time but change very gradually and in a bottom-up manner without really being guided or directed, just like the species do. Just as evolution produces more and more sophisticated species albeit without a conscious goal or master plan, so do these aspects of human culture in an ostensibly progressive way on their own. This is the essence of the book and to substantiate the idea, Ridley discusses over sixteen chapters, the autonomous evolution of the following categories: Morality, Life, Genes, Culture, Economy, Technology, Mind, Personality, Education, Population, Leadership, Government, Religion, Money and the Internet. It is an expansive effort but it failed to convince me with its arguments. Of all the arguments, I found that I was in agreement only with the ones on the evolution of Genes and Technology. His contention that Technology has its own inherent advance and is independent of great inventors is borne by good evidence. In the same way, 'the genome has no master gene and the human brain has no centralized command node' is also well argued. However, one can advance counter-arguments to many of the other contentions in the book on Society, Population, Government, Economy, Education etc. I shall just touch on a couple of issues as a sample.Evolution works through trial and error. Ridley does not touch upon the consequences of such an approach when people in society are the ones being experimented upon by evolution. If Society, economy and education are subjected to such bottom-up growth, some of the errors can have disastrous fall-outs for the economy or the people. Surely, no one including the author, would want to suffer these consequences if they can be avoided through top-down planning. Evolution works at its own pace. For example, Dr.Joseph Stiglitz says that the real minimum wage of the US worker has remained stagnant for 45 years now. Globalization was said to trickle down its benefits but, the minimum wage has not seen upward mobility. So, would a minimum wage earner wait for evolution to work its magic or would he prefer active state intervention or protest movements to change his condition?Author Ridley cites the evolution of cities very approvingly as support for his theory. I wonder if he has ever lived in Indian cities like Mumbai for a prolonged period. Cities in India have mostly 'evolved' bottom-up, without any master plan or ultimate goal. What we have as a result, is mostly chaos. The buses and trains often are at odds with each other by way of service. Population grows in these cities without sufficient supply of water or electricity for its residents. There is hardly enough housing and sanitation. Though some of these aspects are due to poverty, Indian cities are often good examples of un-directed, bottom-up evolution. In contrast, Ridley's own city of London shows great top-down planning of its transport system in integrating its buses, underground trains and boats in a way that complement one another. All those beautiful green spaces that Londoners enjoy, like Green Park, Hyde Park, St.James Park and Kew Gardens came about by top-down planning and not autonomously. The book really has a go at Governments. Ridley's thesis is that protection rackets are the ones which eventually became top-down governments. He says that government policy planners underrate the merits of spontaneous, organic arrangements and fail to recognize that the best plan is often not to have one. History tells us that governments in Western countries never looked at things like employment, welfare, environment etc as part of their job prior to the end of the Second world war. In fact, as recently as the late 19th century, the only affluent sections of Western societies were the clergy and the aristocrats with 80% of the population being considered working class and not middle class. It is only active state intervention to institute the welfare state, organize employment for the citizens and provide substantial safeguards against many of the ills that afflicted society, that has resulted in the pervasive prosperity across all classes that we see today in the West. The book is as much about Evolution as it is about politics and ideology. Ridley seems libertarian in outlook and possibly also right-wing, even though he denies it in the book. Consequently, in every chapter, we have him lauding unplanned, bottom-up endeavours without government involvement in the manner of far-right Republicans and railing against totalitarianism and planned human endeavours. Unfortunately, Western societies are all about Security and Control and predictability about the future. The Western way of life is not about leaving things to chance but all about gaining control over the unknowns. With such a philosophy, a top-down, planned approach to life is the automatic consequence. For every one of the sixteen categories that the author analyses, it is probably equally possible to show that we are where we are because of top-down planning and directed growth. The book is good to read for the extensive effort that has been put into it, but in the end, one cannot escape the conclusion that Ridley's General theory of Evolution is not anywhere near the Special theory in its logic or water-tight evidence.

It was also because of how the arguments were constructed. This is a learned, scholarly book, drawing on the author's earlier works, and yet immensely accessible.I'm familiar with the subject matter here: The evolution of our material world, as opposed to our physical world, and everything in it. Writers like Tim Harford have written about this, but in its holistic look at historic events and historical institutions, Ridley's book is special and persistently convincing.I'm not sure of every point in the book, but I've been intrigued enough to explore these ideas more, and maybe look at the world differently. Highly recommended."
20,0062296000,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7926730-elizabeth-gabhart,1,"This book is a wildly biased, full-throated defense of neo-liberal capitalism. I only read about 2/3 of it before I simply couldn't stand it anymore. I have a PhD focusing on inequality and globalized economies, so I'm more familiar than most people are with the research associated with these topics. At times, Matt Ridley's arguments are simply wrong. He cherry-picks data that supports his assertions and ignores the vast literature that disagrees with him. He's cites data that sounds impressive, and then you realize it's so narrowly focused (for example, economic data from 1990 to 1995 (not an exact quote)) as to be essentially meaningless.At other times, he's simply illogical. I nearly fell out of my chair when I read something along these lines: ""Aside from the internet, government-sponsored scientific research has done nothing to help our economy."" (Not an exact quote.) Yes, aside from this giant elephant in the room, there are no elephants in the room. At his best, he's simply presenting one side of a more complex debate. For example, actual economic research shows that economies do best with lots of unions, or with no unions, but economies suffer when there are a moderate number of unions. To no one's surprise, Ridley quotes the idea that unions are bad for economies, and conveniently ignores any data suggesting that lots of unions might help economies. I think the thing that bothered me most about this book was the biased way he presents it all. The book is peppered with phrases like, ""All right thinking people agree...."" or ""It is obvious that...."" There's absolutely nothing wrong with presenting a free market liberal ideology. I do it all the time in my college classrooms. But I present it as, ""Here's one side. Let's talk about it. And then we're going to talk about the other side."" His approach is imperious, manipulative, and almost.... bullying, for lack of a better term. As I was reading, I started playing a little game with myself. After each sentence, I tried to imagine how long it would take me to debunk what he wrote. Almost everything he writes is incorrect, but it would take an encyclopedia's-worth of words to debunk him. This isn't surprising. It almost always takes much more time to debunk a stupid idea, than it took to offer the stupid idea in the first place. I tried to imagine myself actually debunking this book piece by piece and realized I'm too busy for that. I'm not going to even try.The world is not simple. Economics is not simple, even for PhDs. I can't find anything in his biography suggesting he has even an undergraduate degree in economics. He doesn't know what he's talking about. Don't fall for this book."
21,0062296000,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5874435-manu,5,"For a while now, I have believed that Darwin's theory of evolution is the most paradigm-shifting idea to have emerged from a human mind. On a related thought journey, I have also shifted from determinism to free will and back to determinism, all in a few years. This book connects both these thoughts, and is fundamentally an argument for evolution and against creationism. It argues that change is incremental and emergent and has a momentum all of its own, as opposed to the idea that it is directed by a person or a metaphysical force like God. The author calls Darwin's work ""the special theory of evolution"" because Darwin had applied this to the evolution of the human species. But as per the author, evolution is all around us, in pretty much everything we encounter - from culture to the universe and from money to population. The book covers sixteen subjects and sees the progress (or sometimes, the lack of it) for each of these through the lens of its evolution. It is fascinating to see how the blind hand of evolution has guided these ideas to where they are now. I say blind because it has no goal in mind and works mostly based on trial and error. I learned many things from this book beyond the excellent basic framing of evolution in the context of these subjects. About Titus Lucretius and his book De Rerum Natura (The Nature of things) in which he had conceptualised the idea of evolution. About how the role that history credits to one man - whether it is Steve Jobs or Adolf Hitler - is hugely exaggerated because if there is an idea whose time has come, evolution will make sure it manifests - ""the sea will fashion the boats"". About my mistaken notion that science needs to be funded by government - the portion on technology shows how the returns from private funding trumps public grants. I also learned that while the Nazis are the ones who blew up eugenics into a completely different level, from 1932 to 1970, ten thousands of people in the US had been forcibly sterilised or persuaded to undergo voluntary sterility. That Indira Gandhi was forced to scale up her government's sterilisation programmes because the ""civilised nations"" held aid money to India as ransom. About a company called Morning Star Tomatoes that has been experimenting with ""self management"" for 2 decades and is working just fine. That the government and the mafia have essentially the same roots. That the biggest religions of the world had borrowed their origin myths from a common pool and had gotten lucky with timing. On how environmentalism is now close to being religion and has its myths too! It also validated my view (not original) that both nation states and a central currency were ideas whose exit time has come. I came to know that the roots of the 2008 crisis lay in China! This is a fascinating book, and I am also awed by the author's knowledge and background work on so many diverse subjects. This goes very easily into my all time top 10 and I would highly recommend it. "
22,0062296000,http://goodreads.com/user/show/37348163-omar-essawi,5,"Brilliant. Distinguishing between a special and general theory of evolution. The latter of which applies to everything beyond genetics. Building on Dennett's ""crane"" and ""skyhook"" idea to explain how things evolve as bottom up (crane) phenomena as oppose to top down (skyhook) phenomena. Very well written, and although it is actually quite common sensical, it provides a very well rounded explanation putting the idea in to perspective. In addition to this, it provides a concise overview and background to a variety of ideas, inventions and concepts that play a part in our day to day lives. Admittedly I didn't like the tone of over-confidence felt throughout the book, and the politically biased comments here and there were unnecessary, but nonetheless, a very interesting read."
23,0062296000,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4125128-steve,2,"This was interesting for a while, until Ridley took off his scholarly hat and put on the Libertarian one. I don't have the background to make a judgment on his application of Darwin's ideas in realms other than evolution in the natural world, but when he says, for example, that evolution as it manifests itself in the family is largely a matter of biology and parental behavior has little, if any, effect in how the children turn out, my suspicions are alerted and the book is spoiled for me. He also cites writers from the Cato Institute, that haven for Neanderthal capitalists. I feel I'm being manipulated by a clever propagandist even though I agree that it's a good idea to see how the whole idea of evolution expresses itself in different areas of human culture and not just the biological."
24,0062296000,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7227342-richard,4,"These 3 quotes really sum this book up quite well:“For far too long we have underestimated the power of spontaneous, organic and constructive change driven from below, in our obsession with designing change from above.

Some of the arguments in this book showing how so many things in the universe move from centralized to de-centralized and how it might be one of the best explanation for how consciousness works.

26,0062296000,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7915393-simon-mcleish,2,"While there are many interesting ideas, points and quotes in this book, I found it frustrating and unconvincing. While it is apparently about how evolution works in a number of settings, essentially those of complex emergent systems, much of it uses that as the basis for an attack on any form of control or management of these systems - it's a libertarian manifesto in all but name.I have a fair number of issues with the book. First, and fundamentally, I don't think it makes a case for the word ""evolution"" being applied consistently to all the subjects. It starts, naturally enough, with one of the best known and best understood subjects, the evolution of life. Here, there is a sound mathematical foundation, a set of statistical rules which can predict many things (such as, for instance, the ways in which altruism can bestow an evolutionary advantage despite the immediate appearance that it shouldn't). While there are mathematical models for some of the other concepts, such as the economy, there isn't the same broad agreement on the most acceptable model. In some cases (education, for instance) it is hard to even see what a model would be like, and here it feels more as though something is evolutionary because it is complex and changes over time.Second, the shortness of the treatments of the different topics makes it appear that Ridley makes his points through selective quotation. Some of the discussions do talk about other ideas in the field, but I think they are not given even the appearance of a fair hearing. Some authors are quoted repeatedly, which makes selective quoting seem more obvious. I don't think that this appearance was Ridley's intention, but it does reduce the impact of the book.Thirdly, the book seems to me to avoid talking about some of the ethical issues involved in taking the libertarian approach. While he talks approvingly of unregulated private enterprise, and even makes it seem that this will improve the lot of everyone, the problem is that even in today's heavily regulated world, unethical individuals abuse positions of power over others: there have always been companies run as sweat shops, and we still see prosecutions for slavery and exploitation on a regular basis (especially, it seems, in those underground industries which are less regulated because of their essentially criminal nature, such as prostitution). It often seems that those who put forward libertarianism do so because they expect that they would be among the winners, and they don't really think about what this means for the losers. This isn't to say that live isn't going to be grim for the losers in the world as it is today, or hasn't been miserable in the past, and Ridley does cite several examples, including some from the worst moments of British colonialism.Overall, there is much said which is interesting, but I found the book more frustrating than convincing."
27,0062296000,http://goodreads.com/user/show/15416206-paul,1,"Years ago I read Genome by the same author and enjoyed his accessible approach to science writing. Unfortunately it seems that Ridley has forgotten how to be a science writer and instead uses his books as a way to wrap up his personal ideology and present it as hard science. For the most part, chapters are short and reductive, mainly recycling ideas from the likes of Dawkins, Dennett and Pinker without adding anything of substance. Chapter two, for example, on the “Evolution of Morality”, is 15 pages of hand-waving while occasionally name-dropping Hume, Voltaire and (bizarrely) Adam Smith. Ridley seems to become confused as to the objective of the chapter’s focus and it abruptly ends without ever really delving into the question of the evolution of morality at all.Ultimately it seems that Ridley has used this book as an outlet for his weird beef with the environmentalist movement. During a chapter on the evolution of religion as a man-made phenomenon, he abruptly segues into a disparagement of those who claim that global warming is increasing as a result of human activity, comparing the “blind faith” of climate change activists to that of the religious. Bear in mind that he refuses to delve into the rationale for his skepticism as it is “beyond the scope of this book”, but he does hint that “an increasing number of scientists tell [him]” that the current thinking on carbon dioxide emissions is misguided - hilariously giving credence to the very “appeal from authority” which he spends the rest of the chapter bashing.Other arguments are laughably weak. Here is an actual quote: “what if renewable energy rolled out on a grand scale proved so environmentally damaging that it does great harm?” - firstly, what kind of backwards attitude is that? Surely the same could be said of any positive innovation - vaccines, free education, gender equality? Secondly, what possible greater harm can result from wind farms and solar panels than is already being wrought by fracking and burning fossil fuels? You can’t just throw out hypotheticals like that and not give it a proper discussion. It betrays a disappointing cowardice. In a later chapter, Ridley includes the following quote from Martin Durkin: “it was [the Nazis’] green anti-capitalism and loathing of bankers which led them to hate Jewish people”. This flippant juxtaposition of Nazism and green leftism goes unchallenged by Ridley, and I had to look up who this authoritative Martin Durkin was: a climate change denying, minarchist television producer known for being “the scourge of the greens”. This tells you all you need to know about the level of research and analysis Ridley put into this book."
28,0062296000,http://goodreads.com/user/show/68183825-rodrigo-arag-o,5,Simply amazing. Mind blowing.
29,0062296000,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1223705-john,3,"I struggled with this book. I found myself in total disagreement with the author in some chapters and cheering his points in others. Ridley does not fit into our standard left/right or liberal/conservative viewpoints, and he tackles enough controversial topics just about everyone is bound to find something to disagree with. I think it can generate hours of discussion and recommend it to anyone looking for a good book club read or anyone interested in seeing many parts of the world around us in a new/different perspective. This book seeks to explain numerous and diverse swaths of life thru the lens of evolution. He addresses standard biological evolution (for me the most eye-glazing part), but goes far beyond that in discussing evolution of morality, culture, technology, education, cities, governments, money, the internet, etc. The key take-away is that the organic “bottoms-up” approach to just about everything allows for natural evolution of ideas/policies/practices/groups that results in better ends than can be achieved by “top-down” design and planning. “Far more than we like to admit, the world is to a remarkable extent a self-organizing, self-changing place… This book argues that evolution is happening all around us. It is the best way of understanding how the human world changes, as well as the natural world. Change in human institutions, artifacts and habits is incremental, inexorable and inevitable. It follows a narrative, going from one stage to the next; it creeps rather than jumps; it has its own spontaneous momentum… For far too long we have underestimated the power of spontaneous, organic and constructive change driven from below, in our obsession with designing change from above. Embrace the general theory of evolution. Admit that everything evolves.”My favorite chapter was on the evolution of education and the top down forces that today are resisting further evolution/improvements. The historical view of the origins of our education system were news to me and makes me wonder if we aren’t making some serious errors in our current educational approaches. Here’s one excerpt: ““The real tragedy of nationalized education is how little innovation it has seen… It was these Prussian schools that introduced many of the features we now take for granted. There was teaching by year group rather than by ability, which made sense if the aim was to produce military recruits rather than rounded citizens. There was formal pedagogy, in which children sat at rows of desks in front of standing teachers, rather than, say, walking around together in the ancient Greek fashion. There was the set school day, punctuated by the ringing of bells. There was a predetermined syllabus, rather than open-ended learning. There was the habit of doing several subjects in one day, rather than sticking to one subject for more than a day. These features make sense, argues Davies, if you wish to mould people into suitable recruits for a conscript army to fight Napoleon…” I disagrees most with his assessment of faith and religion, and not surprisingly his off-hand disparagement of the Latter-day Saints. While the point was minor in his overall narrative, he claims, incorrectly, that Joseph Smith didn’t show the gold plates to anyone else, while in fact we know of at least 11 others who signed witness statements that they saw and handled the plates, and none ever recanted their witness. Here’s how the WSJ book reviewer summarized it: “Mr. Ridley’s opus will not be well received by those who believe they are smarter than the masses, who think that most people are not capable of self-governance, who fancy themselves as intelligent social designers, or who simply have a hard time imagining non-command-and-control solutions to problems. Yet there is something profoundly democratic and egalitarian—even anti-elitist—in this bottom-up approach: Everyone can have a role in bringing about change regardless of intelligence, education, family background, socioeconomic class, race, religion, gender, sexual orientation or any other category by which we are wont to divide ourselves. In self-organizing emergent systems anyone can participate and make a difference.”Here are a few other quotes from the book to wet your appetite: “The idea that the State originated to serve any kind of social purpose is completely unhistorical. It originated in conquest and confiscation – that is to say, in crime.’ Perhaps we have left all that behind, and the state is now evolving steadily towards benign and gentle virtue. Perhaps not.“Simultaneous discovery and invention mean that both patents and Nobel Prizes are fundamentally unfair things.”“Our habits and our institutions, from language to cities, are constantly changing, and the mechanism of change turns out to be surprisingly Darwinian: it is gradual, undirected, mutational, inexorable, combinatorial, selective and in some vague sense progressive.”“There are two ways to tell the story of the twentieth century. You can describe a series of wars, revolutions, crises, epidemics, financial calamities. Or you can point to the gentle but inexorable rise in the quality of life of almost everybody on the planet: the swelling of income, the conquest of disease, the disappearance of parasites, the retreat of want, the increasing persistence of peace, the lengthening of life, the advances in technology.”“When I began researching this book I thought of Malthusian theory, eugenics, Nazi genocide and modern population control as separate and distinct episodes in human history. I am no longer so sure. I think there is some persuasive evidence that a direct, if meandering, intellectual thread links the Poor Laws, the Irish famine, the gas chambers of Auschwitz and the one-child policies of Beijing. In all cases, cruelty as policy, based on faulty logic, sprang from a belief that those in power knew best what was good for the vulnerable and weak.”“To put my explanation in its boldest and most surprising form: bad news is manmade, top–down, purposed stuff, imposed on history. Good news is accidental, unplanned, emergent stuff that gradually evolves. The things that go well are largely unintended; the things that go badly are largely intended.”“One huge mistake we all make, one blind spot, it is that we all go around assuming the world is much more of a planned place than it is. As a result, again and again we mistake cause for effect; we blame the sailing boat for the wind, or credit the bystander with causing the event.”Summarizing Adam Smith: “specialization inevitably incentivizes innovation, which is also a collaborative process driven by the exchange and combination of ideas. Indeed, most innovation comes about through the recombination of existing ideas for how to make or organise things. The more people trade and the more they divide labour, the more they are working for each other. The more they work for each other, the higher their living standards. The consequence of the division of labour is an immense web of cooperation among strangers: it turns potential enemies into honorary friends.”“Far from being parasitic exploiters of the workers, most businessmen were innovators looking to outwit their rivals, by doing things better or cheaper, and in doing so they inevitably brought improvements to the living standards of consumers.”“In short, the explosion in sub-prime lending was a thoroughly top–down, political project, mandated by Congress, implemented by government-sponsored enterprises, enforced by the law, encouraged by the president and monitored by pressure groups. Remember this when you hear people blame the free market for the excesses of the sub-prime bubble.”“The elite gets things wrong, says Douglas Carswell in The End of Politics and the Birth of iDemocracy, ‘because they endlessly seek to govern by design a world that is best organized spontaneously from below’. Public policy failures stem from planners’ excessive faith in deliberate design. ‘They consistently underrate the merits of spontaneous, organic arrangements, and fail to recognize that the best plan is often not to have one.”“We are told that we are sinning (by emitting CO2), that we have original sin (human greed), which has banished us from Eden (the pre-industrial world), for which we must confess (by condemning irresponsible consumerism), atone (by paying carbon taxes), repent (insisting that politicians pay lip service to climate-change alarm), and seek salvation (sustainability). The wealthy can buy indulgences (carbon offsets) so as to keep flying their private jets, but none must depart from faith (in carbon dioxide) as set out in scripture (the reports of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change). It is the duty of all to condemn heretics (the ‘deniers’), venerate saints (Al Gore), heed the prophets (of the IPCC). If we do not, then surely Judgement Day will find us out (with irreversible tipping points), when we will feel the fires of hell (future heatwaves) and experience divine wrath (worsening storms).”"

The format of each chapter is a brief history of a topic, some examples showing good things happened when you let it freely evolved, and some examples showing bad things happened when it is controlled by human.While the examples are fascinating, the author's writing style can be hard to follow. As English is my second language, I have to search for new words (or old, archaic jargon) in a dictionary a lot.

31,0062296000,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5937558-lynn,4,"Today's post is on The Evolution of Everything: How New Ideas Emerge by Matt Ridley. It is 368 pages long and is published by HarperCollins. The cover is red with the title in bold white. The intended reader is someone who is interested in history, evolution and social science. There is no language, no sex, and no violence in this book. There Be Spoilers Ahead.From the back of the book- The New York Times bestselling author of The Rational Optimist and Genome returns with a fascinating, brilliant argument for evolution that definitively dispels a dangerous, widespread myth: that we can command and control our world.The Evolution of Everything is about bottom-up order and its enemy, the top-down twitch—the endless fascination human beings have for design rather than evolution, for direction rather than emergence. Drawing on anecdotes from science, economics, history, politics and philosophy, Matt Ridley’s wide-ranging, highly opinionated opus demolishes conventional assumptions that major scientific and social imperatives are dictated by those on high, whether in government, business, academia, or morality. On the contrary, our most important achievements develop from the bottom up. Patterns emerge, trends evolve. Just as skeins of geese form Vs in the sky without meaning to, and termites build mud cathedrals without architects, so brains take shape without brain-makers, learning can happen without teaching and morality changes without a plan.Although we neglect, defy and ignore them, bottom-up trends shape the world. The growth of technology, the sanitation-driven health revolution, the quadrupling of farm yields so that more land can be released for nature—these were largely emergent phenomena, as were the Internet, the mobile phone revolution, and the rise of Asia. Ridley demolishes the arguments for design and effectively makes the case for evolution in the universe, morality, genes, the economy, culture, technology, the mind, personality, population, education, history, government, God, money, and the future.As compelling as it is controversial, authoritative as it is ambitious, Ridley’s stunning perspective will revolutionize the way we think about our world and how it works.Review- Overall a very interesting book about human society and culture that at times does get a little too detailed. Ridley is very passionate about his topic and that comes through in this book. His notes are good and I liked his research and felt that it was accurate. When he gets a little too into the details it does not last long. He writes about all levels of human society from religion to science. He talks about how people are the ones who change things not government or great men. I have never thought about that before so it was interesting to think about how the masses affect things for the positive. I am now sold on what Ridley says and I want to do more research into bottom-up change.I give this book a Four out of Five stars. I was given this book by HarperCollins in exchange for an honest review. "
32,0062296000,http://goodreads.com/user/show/35171790-p,1,"This tendentious book ultimately became too tedious for me to read with anything but incredulity.In his zeal to efface the role religion, and specifically Christianity, has played in the 'evolution' of society, he repeatedly ignores facts and conjures up facile explanations for events to make them fit his narrative.By example, when trying to convince readers that changes in morals (progress?) are strictly bottom up (sans any religiosity), Ridley cites the venerable Adam Smith, and Smith's observation that people learn right and wrong through experience, ie., by the reactions others have to what we do. While this was certainly an element of Smith's The Theory of Moral Sentiments, to suggest that this is the way morals are learned is ludicrous. Children are and were taught these things in virtually all families, and when they see the acceptance of their behavior by society, what they've been taught is then reinforced. And what they've been taught is/was most often anchored in religion.To quote directly from The Theory of Moral Sentiments, Smith said:""...by acting according to the dictates of our moral faculties, we necessarily pursue the most effectual means for promoting the happiness of mankind, and may therefore be said, in some sense, to co-operate with the Deity, and to advance as far as in our power the plan of Providence. By acting other ways, on the contrary, we seem to obstruct, in some measure, the scheme which the Author of nature has established for the happiness and perfection of the world, and to declare ourselves, if I may say so, in some measure the enemies of God.""Religion clearly played a played a crucial role for Smith.Astonishingly, Ridley not only ignores this, he completely contradicts it, and instead portrays Smith this way:""Here is an eighteenth-century, middle-class Scottish professor...saying that...morality is an emergent phenomenon"" and ""saying that goodness does not need to be taught, let alone associated with the superstitious belief that it would not exist but for the divine origin of an ancient Palestinian carpenter.""Ridley's conclusions are spurious, contrived, and not worthy of being taken seriously. I could go on with example after example like this, but just suffice it to say, virtually every topic Ridley addresses is manipulated in such a way as to allow him to cram it into his hypothesis, that is, 'evolution' is and has been the primary basis for societal progress. Weak. Very weak."
33,0062296000,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6610972-nina,4,"Written by a smug, British libertarian atheist, I gave the book 4 stars for being very thought provoking, not because I agreed with everything in it. And he started off annoying me by using ""inexorable"" 6 times in the first six pages and sprinkling it liberally throughout the book. Get a thesaurus! I found the chapters on the evolution of personality, education, money, and the internet most interesting. However, like many ultra-conservatives, he poo-poos wind energy and the impact of carbon emissions, but lauds fracking (evidently, he has never spent time in North Dakota). My economic development friends would be interested in his statement that ""always and everywhere, economic planning and control have caused stagnation."" He's fond of using averages or per capita figures without providing any data on distribution (as in wealth). In the chapter on government, he says. ""government began as a mafia protection racket, claiming a monopoly on violence and extracting a rent (tax) in return for protecting its citizens from depredation by outsiders."" He claims the disappearance of infections diseases was a serendipitous, unexpected phenomenon "" that was never intended or planned. He makes a grievous error in saying that ""in the key years 1870 - 1885, there was an average of just 1.5 murders per town [including Wichita, KS) per cattle trading season. That's a lower murder rate than today in that part of America...Yet if anything, the population of the cattle towns was higher in those times. Wichita alone experiences up to 40 murders a year today."" Where on earth is he getting his data? The population of Wichita in 1870 was 689; the population in 1880 was 4,911 -- and the population in 2013 was estimated at 386,552. That big an error makes all his data and assertions suspect throughout the book. But as I say, it is an interesting read. "
34,0062296000,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5856054-alex-macmillan,3,"While I enjoyed this book, but it was inevitably a letdown compared to The Rational Optimist, one of my favorites. This partial-sequel to The Rational Optimist has a weaker unifying theme - people have a bias towards neglecting bottom-up phenomena - connecting the topical hodge podge of chapters. This could have been split into two separate books with more descriptive explorations - one on how emergent phenomena impact individuals & the natural sciences, the other on emergence impacting societies & the social sciences. (As I personally prefer the latter topics to the former, my interest waxed and waned depending on the chapter I was reading.) Mr. Ridley makes many extremely controversial pronouncements, but the brevity of his chapter-length discussions to back up these assertions leaves you not fully convinced, wishing he had more fully fleshed these ideas out in writing. The reading experience often feels more like a book report of all the books an author happened to read over the last five years being compiled into an overarching theory of everything. Nonetheless, this was well worth the read."
35,0062296000,http://goodreads.com/user/show/52141943-leanne,1,"This book is killing me! The author tackles too many topics too shallowly. Also there are a ton of thinly-veiled promos for libertarianism when this did not appear to be a political book at first glance. Each chapter describes how the author has brilliantly solved a complicated policy or philosophy problem in 20 pages or less. Free will: does not exist. You're welcome! Religion: is for babies! Next topic, please! Even when he says things I agree with he spends too little time on complex issues and too much time being smug. Also, biological evolution is a complex and specific thing that is used as a metaphor waaaay too much. Language and technology do not ""evolve"" the way a living thing does. Why don't we just say that they change? Because: science!This is all very one-sided. The topics I'm familiar with I can see the holes in, which makes me suspicious of all the other subjects. This author is unreliable. For example, here is his 1-line mention of Europe's ""right to be forgotten"":""A decision by the Court of Justice of the European Union in 2014 - that people should be allowed to insist on the deletion from search results of old stories about themselves, even if these were true - was a gift for crooks of all kinds.""If you are looking for depth and nuance, keep looking."
36,0062296000,http://goodreads.com/user/show/15613653-kweetat-chew,5,"Do yourself a favor and get this book. Ridley stitches together various topics in this condensed book of evolution by traversing broad swaths of history, a feat that'll ensure an ""aha"" moment every single paragraph! Evolution is all about ground-up changes, not reliant on a super controller skyhook, man in the sky or elsewhere. Ridley traces Darwin's theory of evolution, which he calls Special Theory of Evolution and makes his case why this same phenomenon, which he calls the General Theory of Evolution, should apply to morality, religion, culture, education, and 12 other subjects. Find out what gangsters and hoodlums have in common with governing, how education as we know it today has its roots in a specific war, what religion and crop circles have in common, why politicians and expert economists were dead wrong about the 2008 financial crisis, and much, much more. Forget about the man in the sky, it's all about evolution and this book has sparked my thirst for more of Matt Ridley!"

In this work he sets out with a very ambitious premise and unfortunately never delivers even remotely what he introduces. The huge gulf between his extremely thorough scientific knowledge and his ridiculous over-simplification of the 2008 housing bubble, climate-science, and the evolution of money make this a very uneven read and one that I would not recommend. The notion that bottom-up innovation (evolution) is more prevalent and more likely to be successful in generating better new ideas than top-down innovation (creationism) when applied to many areas of human experience is a good premise, this book does not effectively make that case by a long shot."

Also I'm pretty certain that Ridley overstates some studies where it fits hit narrative while downplaying facts which don't work too well for his libertarian style. Additionally there's the problem of liking evolution just a tiny bit too much. It feels that Ridley thinks that evolution always is good and we should embrace the notion that ""everything"" evolves.

44,0062296000,http://goodreads.com/user/show/9628169-charles-j,2,"“The Evolution Of Everything” is a hard book to review, because it has no substance. Reviewing it is like reviewing a Cliff’s Notes or “For Dummies” book. It is a wholly derivative book, startlingly simplistic and frequently either disingenuous or stupid. What truth the book offers, is obvious, and what truth the book claims is not obvious, is not true.Ridley poorly parrots two different strains of thought, New Atheism and economic libertarianism, to cook up a repetitive, dull stew with zero new insights. True, like a blind squirrel with a nut, sometimes Ridley is accurate and (derivatively) insightful. But he adds nothing to what cannot be read in much better and deeper books. Sadly, I will never see the time I spent on this book again. You don’t have to make the same mistake!For Ridley, neither God nor man “creates” anything. To him, “creationism” is a dirty word that is broadly applicable to any belief that a guided process can produce anything valuable. Instead, all new things result from a wholly bottom-up evolutionary process, unguided at any point, whether that creation is of the ibex or the iPhone.From the very beginning, though, Ridley’s framework is unsatisfying. In fact, Ridley’s real objection is to seekers after power, who always want centralized command for their benefit, not to a nonexistent philosophy of “creationism.” If he wanted to show the failures of central command in all areas of life, he should have focused on Communism and its various leftist relatives, the prime example in the modern world of failed top-down philosophies (see, e.g., Venezuela). But that would imply that atheism might be a problem, and he wants to claim that religion is the problem, and cloak his book in a philosophical wrapper. So he spends the entire book claiming the real problems are (a) religious belief of any kind and (b) any kind of top-down conformity in any area of life, which he ascribes mostly to religious belief, and never to political systems like leftism.Ridley divides his book into chapters each titled “The Evolution of ___________,” each beginning with a quote from the Epicurean philosopher/poet Lucretius’s “De Rerum Natura.” He uses Lucretius as the paradigm of the first modern rationalist, which is a moderately fair appraisal. Apparently Lucretius’s only true disciples, though, other than the uniquely talented Mr. Ridley, are the so-called Four Horsemen of the so-called New Atheism: Sam Harris, Daniel Dennett, Richard Dawkins and Christopher Hitchens. The reliance Ridley places on the first three of these throughout the entire book is truly astounding, although they are nowhere identified as primarily atheist philosophers, but rather merely as the greatest thinkers of the modern age.This oddball worship of dogmatic and simplistic third-grade atheism starts a pattern found throughout the book—a complete lack of nuance, combined with a shrill, inflexible approach to all Ridley’s points, which are always “totally clear,” “without doubt,” and “undeniable.” In particular, throughout the book, Ridley simply lies repeatedly in order that he need never say anything positive about religion or religious believers. He modifies the (apocryphal) Chesterton quote “When a man ceases to believe in God, he does not believe in nothing, he believes in anything” to substitute “something” for “God.” He falsely claims that the Nazi Aktion T4 program, killing the mentally and physically handicapped in 1939 and 1940, was stopped by “protests from relatives,” when the reality is it was stopped by German Catholic bishops, who made public and private complaints at great personal risk, and in fact many relatives cooperated to serve Nazi ideology. He notes approvingly that there was criticism in the West of the West’s support of forced abortion and sterilization in 1970s and 1980s China and India, as there was of earlier leftist eugenics programs in the early 20th Century, but fails to note all of the criticism was religious in origin, given that all people of Ridley’s desired non-religious type (like Margaret Sanger, the founder of Planned Parenthood) were enthusiastic supporters of forcibly limiting the procreation of the lesser breeds. And so on.In keeping with his simplistic approach, Ridley’s first chapter is “The Evolution of the Universe,” in which he endorses Daniel Dennett’s avoidance of “skyhooks” as explanations, a trope that occurs again and again and again and again throughout the book, and then some more. Ridley proceeds to give us a kindergarten version of the development of physics, focusing on the highly unoriginal insight that God was moved out of explanations for the physical world over time (without noting that most of the movers were themselves religious, and the theory of the Big Bang was originated by a Catholic priest in the 20th Century). In the very first pages Ridley’s malicious ignorance becomes evident, when he claims, with complete falsity, that Giordano Bruno was executed “for quoting Lucretius on the recombination of atoms.” This begins the pattern of lying about religion that permeates the entire book. In fairness, though, Ridley is correct that scientific thought has evolved over time, in a bottom-up process, so his conclusion in this chapter is actually correct, and does serve his thesis. If he had stopped here his book would have served for a mediocre Wikipedia entry. But he didn’t.Instead, Ridley then turned to “The Evolution of Morality,” in which, relying wholly on Adam Smith and Stephen Pinker, along with his favorite philosophers of atheism, he claims that shared morality automatically evolves from natural human recognition of “mutual sympathy of sentiments,” and is purely a “spontaneous phenomenon” to which religious belief is totally irrelevant. (Of course, he gives no example of any actual system of morality not based on religion.) He cites Pinker for the idea that morality has evolved in the modern era towards reduced violence, ignoring that Pinker’s arguments are almost purely anecdotal, other than applied to war, apply purely to Western cultures, and say little about morality overall. Ridley also ignores that the morality of Christian societies such as ours is radically different in nearly every way from that of other cultures, such as Chinese or Indian. Naturally, he makes no attempt to compare moral systems, merely stating that they’re all the same, which is obviously false upon a moment’s reflection, and he makes no attempt to say why morality should evolve over time, if it arises spontaneously from human “mutual sympathy of sentiments.” It’s at this point that the reader gets a sinking feeling that Ridley is wasting the reader’s time. The unwise reader forges onward.In every chapter, Ridley manages to combine gross oversimplification with total certainty. He discusses the evolution of marriage for several pages, in his chapter “The Evolution of Culture.” He ascribes “peace com[ing] to Europe” as the result of monogamy, “except where societies continue to be based on polygamy, such as much of the Muslim world, or where polygamy was suddenly reinvented, such as in the Church of the Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints.” I’m pretty sure peace hasn’t come to Europe, and certainly not upon monogamy becoming the universal standard in, oh, 600 A.D., and I’m pretty sure violence in the Muslim world is not primarily due to polygamy. Ridley continues digging, though. He bizarrely claims, in support of his idea that monogamy in the West kept evolving until the modern day, that “not all early saints recommended monogamy” (without citing any examples) and that Christianity succeeded in the Roman Empire because it allowed low-status men to have sex, which was “evangelical gold.” Also, because Charles II and Augustus the Strong had lots of mistresses, polygamy was actually the norm in the late medieval West. OK, then.In the same chapter, Ridley informs us that “cities hardly ever die. Apart from Detroit today and Sybaris in ancient times, there are few examples of cities that even shrink, let alone vanish.” Ridley obviously knows very little about ancient history. Troy? Ephesus? Petra? Hundreds of other cities that also vanished? (And why the mention of Sybaris, which is truly obscure?) Not to mention every city in the West after the fall of Rome shrinking, beginning with Rome itself? Then Ridley tells us that ancient Athens was “run by and in the interests of merchants.” How howlers like this got past Ridley’s editors I’ll never know.Ridley often praises modern liberal social trends, to show his bona fides, yet never shows how these fit into his framework. He says “Britain has moved with the times in social terms, from legalizing gay marriage to appointing women bishops.” But “moving with the times” is not an evolutionary concept. Nor does Ridley tell us how, for example, after discussing the evolution of (heterosexual) monogamy was critical for societal progress, how homosexual marriage fits into his framework. He merely assumes that liberal social movements in the West, all of which have been dictated from the top down by the cultural and political elite, are good, and therefore magically “evolutionary,” even though that’s obviously not true. He tells us that racism, sexism and murder are “wrong,” but “the argument against [them] does not depend on whether [they] come naturally to human beings.” But he never tells us why, in fact, they are wrong, and what that argument is. If organic societal evolution dictates morality, which changes over time, how can anything be objectively “wrong”?Occasionally, Ridley does say something interesting, though never anything original. He notes that it’s a myth that scientific advancement comes largely from academic work or government funding, citing the OECD to the effect that between 1971 and 1998, “whereas privately funded research and development stimulated economic growth, publicly funded research had no impact whatsoever.” He points out that until the 1980s, there was a universal quasi-religious belief that humans were a blank slate, and 100% of their personalities were determined by external influences, mostly parents. Today, of course, it’s universally recognized that genetics play a very large role, but as with climate change today, any suggestion then of heterodoxy was immediately met with scorn and marginalization—and, of course, nobody ever had to apologize and everybody pretends this never happened, because being liberal means never having to say you’re sorry. He praises the common law as an evolutionary success (without noting that it has today been completely eliminated by leftists eager for central, top-down power). He notes the mendacity and ignorance of population controllers and neo-Malthusians like Paul Ehrlich (as well as earlier leftist proponents of eugenics). He criticizes global warming alarmism as a religion, and a not-very-intelligent one at that (though he backs off a bit, afraid of damaging his social liberal bona fides). But finding occasional nuggets of (derivative) truth is a high price to pay for slogging through the rest of Ridley’s prose.Then he returns to stupidity. In a rambling chapter, he denies the existence of free will, telling us that “the more we understand the workings of the brain . . . the more we will find the causes of criminal behavior.” Also, because “each person is [merely] the sum of their influences,” we should not praise people for overcoming their humble origins, like Margaret Thatcher, because every time we do that, “we implicitly denigrate those who do not overcome their disadvantages.” Well, yes.Finally, Ridley issues a George Gilder-esque call for private money, to include Bitcoin, and complains of government strangulation of bottom-up initiatives in money, the economy, and the Internet. This part of the book is actually pretty rational, though Ridley’s real target is not “creationism,” but the simple desire for power by those in power. Again, “creationism” is a straw man. Ridley is, as it happens, correct that top-down solutions work poorly in most areas of life. He’s just wrong that top-down solutions are actually believed in by most people today, and that atheism will lead us to an earthly Paradise."
45,0062296000,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4908284-du-nguyen,3,"The Evolution of Everything is essentially the argument that everything has emerged bottom-up instead of top-down. Now, what does this mean exactly? Ridley poses it as any form of an idea that was designed instead of emerging. Ridley uses examples from varied topics such as genetics, religion, science, economy and more. It's quite a fascinating read but it's also a seductively dangerous one. Ridley doesn't quite keep this book pointed backward on his thesis (which also sounds like it's healthily inspired by Dawkins) but looks forward as well in many areas and presents the ""true"" choice of libertarianism. This became evident to me quite late in the book where sources come from historical figures such as Lucretius and Adam Smith or apolitical ones such as Richard Dawkins (I think?) to essentially being a mouthpiece for Ron Paul and Rand Paul. This doesn't discredit the entire book although it really needs to be noted and remembered when read.I must admit after finishing this book that I thought this bottom-up thinking was the solution to everything but after letting it settle a bit, it just seems a bit wrong in many areas. While the more historical parts of the book are great, sections such as life and evolution, genetics and DNA and technology and Kuhn's scientific theory other sections flounder a bit more. There's the one on personality where Ridley posits that genes and environment determine the personality a person will have and that parents have little choice in ""designing"" their child's personality. Which seems odd as parents are a part of the environment right? And a person can change their personality as well right? Or perhaps the one on government which is an ad for libertarianism. Ridley believes all government is there only to protect people from other governments and thinks that a small government is the only answer, free markets will solve everything. And while there are no small governments around that he can use as an example, he uses communism and fascism as counterexamples. And then as the choice is between communism and fascism or a small libertarian state, no wonder what the answer will be. And this is not because I lean left or whatever on the political scale, but Ridley boils down the problem too much. And then there's the environment. It sounds to me like Ridley is a climate skeptic. Ridley likens the climate to be a modern-day religion where Pascal's wager which is originally about God is turned into the climate-God version of ""If climate change is real, then we should do what we can because either it is real and therefore we might be able to save the planet and ourselves, or if it isn't real then there's no harm done"". Without knowing much about climate change myself other than I believe we must do something about it (thereby I guess, confirming Ridley in that it can seem like a religion sometimes) I think Ridley is fair to question it but uses the wrong methods. It's fair to compare it to religion and to ask whether there might be other causes that would explain climate change apart from carbon dioxide, or rather whether the climate is changing in a human-made manner. But simply comparing it to religion, having debunked religion earlier and then calling it a day seems to be a bit disingenuous. I also think he misuses Pascal's wager, using it as a way to equate climate change to religion and then making the leap that climate change might not be real (because religion isn't real as shown earlier in the book) but Pascal's wager (after some furious googling) turns out NOT to advocate believing in God, in fact, it might be intended as more of a rationality and logical exercise.I don't think this is a bad book. At all. In fact, it's one of the most enjoyable books I've read and it's because of its breadth. That means that there's probably something that will offend you and that's a great thing. It makes you think. BUT and this is important, it should not be read and absorbed, as it's also a very subversive book. It's much more subjective than you might think and as such it's easy to get sucked into Ridley's world view. I would recommend reading this book but at the same time be extremely vigilant. If you agree on something, perhaps check your assumptions. If you disagree on something, check your assumptions and see how Ridley presents his arguments. Use this book to develop your sense of critical thinking and fact checking! That's what I gained the most from this book."
46,0062296000,http://goodreads.com/user/show/60030050-rsmp,2,"I don't often read non-fiction books, and when I do they usually are textbooks dealing with mathematics or other quantitative sciences, making them rather objective and hard (or impossible) to argue against. This book, despite being non-fiction, is not a texbook but a long, persuasive essay. As such, I find it my duty to read it with a critical mind, contrasting it with other sources and reminding myself that despite the Mr. Matt Ridly's being an author and man of high standing, it's okay if I disagree with him or need more convincing arguments on certain topics.A short list of arguments that could be better developed or are poorly defended:-I find his idea of evolution and evolutionary characteristics as defining factors in the development and, well, evolution of things ranging from technology to religion impossible to argue against, being a theory that is nothing new and in the 21st century more common place than the authour leads us to believe, but the degree to which he dimishes the individual influence of the people who, as members of society, take part in said evolution is extreme. Honestly, despite his claiming that this new way of seeing the world is liberating, its emphasis in genetics and the unavoidability of being who you are, whether you like it or not, is anything but liberating.-He quickly clumps businessmen, environmentalists, and artists as very clear misuse of public money. C'mon, that public community theater down the road and the little painting contest at the town square were not a waste of money, nor was the latest campaign from town hall to use fewer plastic bags and more reusable ones.-He then spends a whole chapter lavishing praise on the wonderful economic progress that private investigation leads to and berating public institutions, non-profits, and universities for the lack of financial return from their own research. What a clear misinterpretion. What a lack of understaning. I mean, the neutrino acceleration experiments aren't going to make your product sell better in the market, nor is the detection of gravitational waves, but they are nevertheless important to further our altruistic, non-capitalist, simply-for-the-hell of it research that in turn furthers out understanding of this universe we live on. Mr. Ridley, you yourself, in order to talk about how the brain functions, quote studies done at the Max Planck Society, and altruistic, open source, non-profit institution that likes to do research to purportedly make the world a better place and know more about it. Go figure.-He main gripe about ""environmentalism"" appears to be how much people talk about it. Flood here. Drought there. Food shortage here. Typhoon there. We shouldn't rush to make global warming the main perpetrator, Mr. Ridley says. Well, I can partially agree with that. He is blaming politicians and other outlets of alarmism, of a case of the ""boy who cried wolf"". Sure, sometimes poor infrastructure is at fault. Sometimes deficient central planning is to blame. However, do not compare environmentalism with crop circles, whose consequence doesn't go beyong a few badly produced episosed on the History Channel, or eugenics, which had the effect of maiming, mutilating, and killing millions. The science and danger are there, and they should not be dismished because a few loudmouths talk to too much. If we use cars less and less and force businesses to use more sustainable materials, what is the worst that could happen, Mr. Ridley? Will you have to go to the store on a bike and bring back some fruit on a canvas bag? Goodness me, the humanity!Now, this doesn't mean that I disagree entirely with the authors book. In fact, I wholly agree with the premise of the evolution being prime factor in the developement of this world we live in. I don't however, think that it is the solution to every problem nor do I think the way it functions or affects society is exactly as Mr. Matt Ridley puts it in his book. Nonetheless, a good read."
47,0062296000,http://goodreads.com/user/show/595470-david,2,"Call it 2.5 stars.The basis of this book is solid and interesting: Everything, every phenomenon, actually follows the same trial-and-error, twists and turns that Darwin explained as biological evolution. That things do not poof into existence from top down, but are built bottom-up emerging and evolving from things that came before. The book gives dozens of detailed examples of this--from morality (take for example, attitudes toward homosexual behavior, from ancient Greek times to most of history to the 2000s) to technology; from education systems to government systems.I want to rate this book higher, but a lot of bias and hypocrisy creeps in around the edges of the science presented here. The author needlessly derides certain individuals, organizations, and philosophies when instead they could simply make their point and let the implications stand unsaid. At the heart of the idea is pure libertarianism, right? If things just evolve, then just let things evolve. The author does not laud libertarianism or any other specific political philosophy, but he does take occasional swipes and this political figure or that social movement.Now, because the stuff being derided is stuff I happen to believe in and support, I had to prevent myself from reflexively tuning out of this book from time to time. The truth is, there is a great deal of interesting thinking and deeper truth in this book--things that at times make you rethink your own perspective. In my case, I kept listening, agreed with some things the author said, rejected some things, and marked a few items for further research.The biggest example of the latter two is the author's claim regarding climate change that, although (he admits) CO2 is a control knob in the state of the climate and should be monitored, he states (paraphrasing) that basically, ""the planet will figure it out and humans don't need to do anything differently from what we're doing now."" He mentions research that slight changes in Earth's orbit may be the cause ice ages, and similar claims that I personally do not trust and need to look into further. Another point by the author: just because a lot of people (even a large majority of people) believe something, doesn't mean it's true--case in point: religions. Is a literal God really, truly the creator of mankind? Billions of people believe this to be true, but it is unlikely from a scientific standpoint. The parallel is, just because a vast majority of scientists have come to a certain conclusion on climate change does not mean that that conclusion is correct.The point that the author seems to miss is, there are high, high stakes for humankind when it comes to our environment. A counterpoint he expresses is, is it always worth taking pains to prevent a possibility of harm? You will never prevent 100% of risk. So should humanity give up carbon just because it ""might"" cause devastation to the environment? (This reader thinks that yes, yes we should.)I'm pooh-poohing the book a bit more than perhaps I should, but the above is an example of why it was frustrating to read at times. The snooty British narrator of the audiobook version I listened to did not help matters any, at times downright sneering. But I still think the book (especially at least the first half) is worth checking out. Feel free to roll your eyes occasionally, but by and large I think most people can take some interesting insights away from the book. Things do develop from things that came before, in many ways that are not obvious. This book points out many examples. Some of these are just neat little curiosities, and others may cause one to rethink major aspects of how society or a government is run. If these sound of interest to you, I recommend giving this book a shot."
48,0062296000,http://goodreads.com/user/show/33599214-suha,4,"It took me quite a long time to thoroughly read this book although some ideas are against my beliefs/stands. The main idea of the book is that Ridley extrapolated Darwin’s theory of evolution on human aspects. Languages, our habits, cities and thoughts all are Darwinian. In his opinion, everything occurs gradually (I insist on gradually) in a spontaneous and selective manner. The book covers 16 areas of evolution: evolution of the universe, morality, life, genes, culture, economy, technology, mind, personality, education, population, leadership, government, religion, money, and internet.For me, I found the most convincing chapter on technology and religion whereas I was very skeptical in the chapters of government, economy and money; and the one about leadership was poor. Ridley advocates, that the best state is the state where there is no law enforcement, whereas many states that lack regulations are not performing as beautifully as he thinks so. I got a feeling especially reading the last 3 chapters that he thinks that government control is the root of all evil. He is explicitly saying that everything should be privitased including schooling and healthcare, in this manner innovation and competitiveness will blossom. I believe he contradicted himself with saying that control of government/ regulators slow down the normal process of evolution whereas, in my opinion, it is part of the entire puzzle of evolution.Despite all this, I believe this is a great book; it is well written, very structured the ideas are organized and easy to understand. I give him credit in the idea that goodness is gradually emerging out of the bad circumstances, however do we really want to see badness to let the natural process of evolution (which usually takes generations) occur? Would we allow for no control, no government, chaos, for a period of time to let the goodness emerge? I guess not. I quote:“People are attracted by higher truths that simplify the world and can explain everything. They are nostalgic of the simplicity of medieval religion”.“The environment is the new secular religion that is rising, in Europe especially, from the ruins of a disbelieving world”.“There are 2 ways to tell the story of the 20th century. You can describe a series of wars, revolutions, crises, epidemics, financial calamities. Or you can point to the gentle but inexorable rise in the quality of life of almost everybody on the planet.”“Good things are gradual; bad things are sudden. Above all, good things always evolve.”“Your Personality is yours; you are not a creature of other people. Natural selection made sure that brainwashing was not easy. And it’s time we stopped looking to parenting for the credit or the blame.”“The richest of the rich in a city like New York can do little to make up for their children’s genetic mediocrity, and despite getting little opportunity, brilliant kids from the slums can make it big.”“Given the choice, female monkeys will play with dolls, males with trucks.”“The environment is the new secular religion that is rising from the ruins of a disbelieving world”. "
49,0062296000,http://goodreads.com/user/show/41813485-daniel-moss,4,"I find Ridley's methodology of juxtaposing creationism (top-down) and spontaneous order (bottom-up) a very intriguing one. I suppose it makes sense considering his atheistic bent that he would choose to go that route. For him, the idea of hierarchy is useless, simpleminded, dangerous, and plain superstitious, or at least that's my understanding of his position.Just as I can sometimes agree with American Conservatives and at other times agree with American Liberals and it not because they we share the same paradigmatic approach, the same is true with Ridley and I. Ridley's paradigm starts by pitting top-down against bottom-up and for whatever reason seems to think, at least in the cases he shares in his book, that bottom up is always better. It seems to me that he's a bit of a consequentialist in that he prefers the results that bottom-up orders produce, and so it is actually more true that he has preferences and finds that bottom-up tends to produce results in line with those preferences. Consequentalism is always a weak and self-refuting worldview in that it's relativistic and doesn't offer up grounds for objective truth. In other words, there's nothing inherently moral or immoral about the aggression of governments for Ridley. That they are aggressive isn't necessarily the problem, the problem is that they produce more of what Ridley doesn't like (tyranny or poverty, I suppose) and less of what he does like (liberty and wealth).But this approach is different from the deontological approach that I take which leads me to agree with Ridley at times (government is bad), yet allows me to disagree with him at other times (I think a belief in God is good). For me, the rightness or wrongness of human action is decided not by the resulting outcome, or the mechanism that produces it, but in the action itself. In other words, the ends never justifies the means; the means is just as important as the ends, if not more important. Government is a means, not an end. And as a means it is one that relies on action norms that produce the very action the means is supposed to prevent. As Hans Hoppe says (paraphrasing): government is a property violating property protector. In other words, it is the very thing it claims to prevent. Government is evil not because it produces bad results, but because it's very nature is evil.I'll leave out the questions of God and religion; questions Ridley and I disagree on. It's true these are matters of faith, a fact I'm completely comfortable admitting, even though I'd bet Ridley isn't comfortable admitting his worldview is predicated on faith just the same. All in all, it's a very useful book and my review is certainly not comprehensive. I found the level to which I agreed with Ridley varied at times as if on a spectrum. Our methods for how we come to our conclusions is where we contrast the most. With that all said, I thoroughly loved the chapters on morality, education, and perhaps especially, population."
50,0062296000,http://goodreads.com/user/show/69801085-lee-kuiper,4,"I’ve never read such a bipolar book before. As one might expect from the title, most chapters break down specific subjects and discuss how they evolved while other chapters are absolute misnomers where Matt Ridley simply uses them as launching pads to discuss his opinions on something only tangentially related and then never bothers discussing the actual idea of evolution before smugly ending the chapter.His (intermittent and frequent) opinionated diatribes are often annoying but in the first chapter he takes it to the next level. (*read below) It was a very rocky start to the book. By the second chapter, however, the author gets off his high horse and focuses in on the subject and writes a great chapter that is also relevant to the chapter title; it’s a shining light showing how good the book could be. Then Ridley slips back into his sullied ways, putting forth another chapter of irrelevant and overly-opinionated tangents. (**read below)But (would you believe it?) the next few chapters are phenomenal. I guess Matty Boy finally decided to apply himself. They are insightful and informative even if they’re occasionally just an adjunct summary of assorted people’s ideas. The book finally steps into its title discussing how various things evolved from the bottom up, not from the top down. And, thankfully, from here the book mostly carries on in this fashion until the end. It could have easily been 5 stars had Matty Boy gotten off his entitled throne and kept the book on topic. (Seriously, where was his editor on this one?) Instead, now, the reader will occasionally get stuck in a quagmire-tirade up to their knees as Matty Boy vacillates between ranting irrelevant inanities and vicious vitriol. Good luck. If you get through though, there’s some really great stuff on the other side.—* (In a chapter titled “The Evolution of the Universe,” one would reasonably expect the author to discuss certain creation processes/how things came to be, leading to the unfolding and creating of bodies in space… or something to the effect of what happened after the big bang. Yet he spends the entire chapter defining the term “skyhook” and singing infatuated praises about the wonders of Lucretius. He then whines about Lucretius’s obscurity and begins pointing fingers and vociferously spitting venom at Christianity. He spends the rest of the chapter criticizing various ways of thinking in recent history and never ends up discussing anything about the evolution of the universe. I’ve never read a less professional initial chapter from someone with a credible reputation. Seriously, what a joke. Utterly bad.)** (This 3rd chapter, titled “The Evolution of Life,” is actually on modern social history, philosophy and legal cases but not in the least about how life came about on planet earth. Another absolute failure of a chapter. That’s two strikes Matty Boy. One more and you’re out, buddy.)"
51,0062296000,http://goodreads.com/user/show/28375851-warwick-stubbs,5,"A wealth of information supplied in short bursts which ultimately help stop several subjects from becoming stale (except the chapter on money - that I skipped through). The downside is that, for many, a lot of important information will be missing, or is glossed over. However, for someone like me who has often found science books reach breaking point when they haven't really moved on, this book kept moving on. While the idea of biological evolution may seem a stretch to apply to all other emergent systems, the key concept is how systems have all been a part of an emerging process, rather than a single idea from a single person that can be pin-pointed to one moment in time. All ideas are a process of development. For many this will seem obvious, especially those with an open mind that can look much further back than just their own time-frame, but for those not much interested in the past, it will certainly be an eye-opener to discover that so many modern concepts have existed for a long time already, and are thus continually being shaped by culture and society as we press forward into the modern era.While the book essentially, is a quick history of the world circa 200,000 years past, it is fascinating to read so many different forms of culture and ideas take shape and fail due to human-intended structuring. Ridley's thesis is that much of the good of the world has evolved through these emergent systems rather than being forced into existence on purpose, or through being controlled by a central government, and throughout there is a very clear point to refute religious creationism along the way, simply by showing that the world is filled with emergent systems. Does it do that? No really, since people will cling to beliefs no matter what. And after all, it's impossible to disprove an omnipotent god capable of everything and anything. It may not be as scholarly as some would hope, but it does cover a lot of topics and provides many interesting facts and events from history that support his ideas - these snippets I found fascinating in themselves even without context to the goals of the book. And if snippets aren't enough, there's an 18 page 'Further Reading' reference section to discover more books through.The reader doesn't have to invest in Ridley's concept to start off with - if they do, they can find the attempts to stitch it all together tenuous; however, if they take the book as a fascinating journey through emerging systems that influenced the world, they will gain many great insights into the very world that they live in today."
52,0062296000,http://goodreads.com/user/show/35438505-edward-b,3,"This is an interesting book - but in a bad/problematic way, as well as good.I enjoyed the tour of areas such as morality and (historical, prior to state monopolization) currencies that are/were subject to ""evolution"" in the sense of non-static but largely stable systems that arise/develop in competition with others and adapt (often by adopting successful features from others) without any explicit design or guidance.That aspect of the book reminded me of The Information: A History, a Theory, a Flood and its extended discussion of how Claude Shannon's Information Theory opened up new vistas far beyond computing, in biology, quantum mechanics, and more.I also enjoyed learning that Adam Smith's concept of ""the free market"" referred not freedom from regulation, but from rentiers (aka rent-seekers, such as telecommunications companies in North America, who try to extract as much value out of the market as possible, by capturing regulators and lobbying politicians, rather than meaningfully competing, improving, innovating, adding value).Likewise the idea that the constellation of positions/values that today are considered Conservative do not necessarily, per-force, logically *belong* together - some could be dropped or even reversed, without destroying the coherence of the movement; we're just *used* to seeing such constellations as inviolable wholes.Moreover, some of those positions were considered Progressive in past centuries - eg. ""government regulation"" (in the economy, for example) was severely distrusted by many when ""the government"" meant the unaccountable monarch and/or nobility.HOWEVER,Ridley constantly veers off the rails into polemics, WILDLY overstating his case and (to put it very politely) cherry-picking his data.His explicit conclusion to every chapter (after the more factual first one or two that get you hooked) goes like this: Evolution Works; Evolution Is A Bottom-Up Process (As Opposed To Top-Down); Therefore Every Attempt At Top-Down Design (E.g. Government Regulation Of Anything Whatsoever) Must Fail, Necessarily.More than once, I wanted to chuck the book at the wall.Nevertheless, the book did get me to at least reconsider my own opinions on a few matters.I don't think that I can really *recommend* reading this book, but if the above sounds intriguing, then I guess I wouldn't really *discourage* reading it either."
53,0062296000,http://goodreads.com/user/show/28807296-deepak,4,"History evolves, ideologies evolve, scientific inventions evolve and so on. As a matter of fact, everything evolves and it is a misconception that the change is brought about by top-down approach. The writer starts with two metaphors: skyhook and crane. Skyhook represents an approach that envisages top down handling and managing of events. Crane, on the other hand, represents bottom up approach that brings out the change incrementally and gradually. Reading and understanding of history gives the impression of Great Man without whose intervention and deliberate design the events would not have taken the shape as they have taken; without them no revolutionary inventions would have taken place. For instance, had there been no Edison there would have no incandescent bulb. Ridley opines differently: inventions evolve and they evolve despite the presence of those named inventors. That is the reason that mostly same types of inventions see the light of day simultaneously but only one of those inventors are credited for them.This is Darwin’s natural selection and it is operational not in the field of genetics but in almost every aspect of life. Thus, evolution or bottom up growth is to be found in morality, genes, culture, economy, technology, mind, personality, education, population, leadership, government, religion, money and internet. Each chapter deals with these aspects with point of view that they have evolved on their own rather than planned or designed by some top down agency. Rather on the contrary wherever there has been imposed design or plan as for instance in the modern states the governments intend to interfere and plan for the welfare of people, it has been found that they have done more harm than good. For instance, communist states with their top down interference had been the bane than the boon for the economic development of their countries. Those countries, on the other hand, where free market has been allowed to operate have experienced exponential economic growth.The book definitely enriches and broadens understanding of the nature of things and the world. The Grand Hero theory of history gets repudiated and reluctantly all events around us look to move on their own: without any design yet with a hidden direction determined by natural selection. "
54,0062296000,http://goodreads.com/user/show/13245519-meha-jadhav,2,"I am fan of Matt Ridley’s work and so I picked up this book with great expectations. Alas! This one was a bit of a let-down. This one is quite different from his other books in a number of ways. Some of his other well known works such as ‘Genome’, ‘The Origins of Virtue’, ‘The Red Queen’ explore only one topic. This book, however, has a more general theme. The main idea put forth in the book is that just like evolution of species, the evolution of other things like technology, governments, companies, language, morality, religion etc. is also a random process. It is thus wrong to change these things using a top-down approach, that is a central authority imposing restrictions and rules on the larger group. He argues that decentralization is the key to progress in every avenue. The book is divided into many chapters each focusing on entity such as morality, management, money, technology, religion, to name a few. Using examples from history and various arguments he goes on to show how de-centralisation has been the most effective way to go forward.The central theme is very interesting. It is not something we think about and the book does give you a lot of food for thought through various arguments and examples. But just like most books written on a broad topic, this book also lacks depth. This is the first thing that disappointed me because his previous books were very elaborate and full of interesting insights. The other thing that bugged me was that the book lacked flow. The chapters read as individual essays and had it not been for the prologue, I may not have caught on to the central idea. The chapters themselves are chaotic- while some make his point on de-centralisation clear, others read more like a historical account with the main point lost in the details. The most difficult to follow were the ones dealing with politics, economics and management. Having very little understanding in these matters, I was lost in the jargon and the technicalities. Ridley is a really great popular science writer but when comes to the humanities, he is out of his depth.In the end there were some nice things about it- it gave me a new perspective on some things and some of the concepts were indeed new to me. But I also think that these topics have been explored in detail by other works including Ridley’s own and reading them may be more worthwhile."
55,0062296000,http://goodreads.com/user/show/32281217-evan-micheals,4,"I am slowly evolving into a Darwinist, or an evolutionist as a way of seeing and being in the world. It makes sense regarding how the word works and suits my inherent anti-authoritarian philosophy/psychology. Great people are not that great. We seem to suit the distributed intelligence of an eco-system, rather than the top down dictates of an authoritarian dictatorship. Adam Smith is making more sense in reflecting reality than Karl Marx.I decided to read this following profoundly moved by Ridley’s book “The Red Queen”. He writes well and presents his idea in a coherent and well reasoned manner. The premise of the book is that things emerge, and generally if we try to direct or manufacture it, the phenomena ends in delay of the inevitable and misery for those that try to resist the delay. Ridley sees the world in a bottom up, and governments and authoritarians should get out of the way manner.In saying this I am troubled and do not accept the complete premise of the book. Sometimes (more rarely than Politicians, the Media, and leaders in society would have us believe) genuine leaders do emerge and lead us where we would have not otherwise gone. To an extent we like a competent tyranny in the form of government to stop our lives descending towards anarchy. According to Complexity Theory, chaotic systems self-organise. His ideas seem to be heading mostly in the right direction, but I am not fully on board. I suspect that we need a balance of Chaos and Order in the way we operate ourselves and society. Democracy provides some checks and balances against an Authoritarian Despot. When we find a good governance we should do what we can to maintain it. Some hierarchies are legitimate and necessary. Not every leader is an evil despot, and leaders do not have the power to fix us. We must firstly fix ourselves as best we can, that is under our power. A good leader is a role model to strive to emulate. Even emerging systems can benefit from good and wise leadership – those that don’t have wise leadership are over taken by those that do. In this I agree with Ridley. "
56,0062296000,http://goodreads.com/user/show/15947308-haider-hussain,3,"Barring a few non-sequiturs and sweeping generalizations, the key arguments of the book are not easy to argue against:a. Natural selection also works in every aspect of life, not just biological life. From personality to culture to social order, and from economy to morality; everything follows its own natural selection.b. History is a continuous evolution, an unbroken chain of causes and effects. The outcomes of these causes and effects determine the order which is always spontaneous and unplanned. Things happened because they were bound to happen – i.e., evolution of the past events would have led us there anyway. Nothing hangs from a skyhook, no event occurred because of a sudden change brought out of nowhere.c. The grand design of human life and affairs we see today is not a result of any systematic thinking. Change has always been random, chaotic and without any planning. Because change is the result of human interactions, which might be planned at micro level (e.g. two human beings deciding to do something), but purely random at grand level across time and space.d. Therefore, morality, culture, economy, human personality, religion, technology – even life and mind – evolved into what they are today purely spontaneously without any grand top-down planning. Whenever change – be it economic, social or political – is tried to be forced from above or immediately, it eventually fails.In Uses of History, A. L. Rowse asserts that there are two streams or layers in history: surface stream and underlying current. While surface stream of history may act on human free will, the underlying currents and tides are deterministic. Rowse opines that, therefore, history should be seen as a discipline where determinism and free-will do not contradict, but complement each other. Ridley seems to favor the deterministic trend in history as well. However, do not expect too much here. The Evolution of Everything is neither a comprehensive history of evolution nor a unique argument that has never been discussed before. But still, I enjoyed reading it."
57,0062296000,http://goodreads.com/user/show/8064942-nour,4,"The book is huge and rich in information from diverse disciplines, it's as if Ridley takes the reader to a different section of a huge library in every new chapter. You can't but admire how he neatly gathers historical info, anecdotes, and inferences and connects them together to support his theory; that everything undergoes natural selection, in a bottom-up architecture, without the need of sky-hooks or centralized dictation or authority.Life evolution is a well-studied phenomena, cultures and languages evolutions are also easy to envision and understand. But Ridley makes some really bold suggestions, that morality also evolves, regulations, technology, education, money, governments, and list goes on.At the beginning of the book, it was convincing and easy to follow, but in later chapters I started to feel that some ideas are being forcefully fitted into this evolution-frame. The gathered evidence was sometimes thin, and in many chapters, the top-down approach was criticized much more than focus was exerted to support the validity of the bottom-up model. The insertion of compatible Lucretius's De rerum natura quotes in the first chapters was ridiculously accurate that I took a great interest in the prophesies of that forgotten, undervalued genius, but that didn't last as some quotes later seemed to be either too complicated, off-topic or poorly stitched to an unrelated chapter.Ridley managed to leave me in shock in many chapters, especially while starting the evolution of religions chapter when I thought I knew it all, boy was I wrong! Overall, the book is definitely worth reading. But an important warning from me would be to always be critical while reading books that mix facts with opinions."
58,0062296000,http://goodreads.com/user/show/54518540-cam-lidstone,3,"In this erudite and well-written book, Ridley puts forth an ambitious theory that encompasses an eclectic range of topics (biology, economics, technological innovation, culture, evolutionary psychology, free will, education, and the internet). His theory is that most complex things are the product of an unplanned emergent order, rather than top-down direction or design. It's best summed up in a line by Adam Ferguson (a contemporary of Adam Smith): these phenomena are ""a result of human action but not of human design"". One of the best examples of this is language.I think Ridley is best on biological evolution and economics and the marvel that these complex systems aren't the result of intentional design. I also largely agree with his insights on free will, evolutionary psychology and some of his criticisms of the education system and religion. I'm uncertain about his discussion of famous inventors and leaders. Namely, that they are a symptom of the time rather than influencers. He brings up some fascinating examples of independent inventors simultaneously inventing things or theories as evidence that the things were ripe to be discovered (e.g. Newton and Leibniz with calculus; Wallace and Darwin with evolution; and myriad other examples, my favourite being that about 20 people from around the would have an independent claim to the title of the inventor of the incandescent light bulb in the late 19th century). Ridley also somewhat provocatively claims that most good things we have seen in history (eg feeding billions, eradicating disease, global wealth) are the result of unintended emergent order and most bad things we have seen in history (wars, revolutions) are the result of top-down man made intentions. Although an interesting hypothesis it wasn't really fleshed out and I'm not sure what the historical evidence points to.I'd recommend this podcast of Ridley talking on EconTalk about the book. He comes across as far more even-handed and reserved about the more exploratory parts of his theory."
59,0062296000,http://goodreads.com/user/show/16228806-dominic-forbes,3,"I really enjoyed Matt Ridley’s books Genome and Nature Via Nurture. This is a different kettle of fish altogether. The book ostensibly tries to show that evolution as a concept can also be a means of explaining things outside of biology, with a linking theme of quotes from Lucretius. It’s worth a read if only for some excellent little known history, such as independently minted “tokens” taking off in England when the Royal Mint grew complacent and wasn’t making enough small coins to pay workers. Split into chapters such as “money”, “society”, “education” etc. There is a clear sense that the author is pushing a particular political viewpoint which appears to be socially liberal conservativism/libertarianism. He quotes from “wrongly maligned/misunderstood” thinkers of the past like Malthus, as well as more recent UK politicians such as Carswell and Lawson. Make of what what you will... it’s certainly not as authoritative as previous books, but that’s partly the point. I don’t agree with a fair amount, there is a feeling the author thinks “thing will turn out ok if only people/markets are left to get on with things” which seems a little naive to me. Not that full state control is preferable. Like nature/nurture there is a balance to be found. The book is thought provoking nonetheless and a good reminder of the power of counterfactuals as tools for thinking. Things change and can evolve into new consensuses is a big part of the book. Societal evolution. Other reviewers have gone into more detail on specific problems than I can. Minus points for using the poor and expensive outcomes of the private US healthcare system as an example against state health spending. Recent events such as Brexit and the Bitcoin bubble/crash also make some of the book seem out of date already. Maybe an update is due?"
60,0062296000,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5338819-ed-bernard,4,"Probably more like 4.5 stars, and at least a portion of the half star reduction is because I hate his politics. However ...A fascinating if somewhat problematic analysis seemingly designed to underpin a Libertarian mind-set – a political agenda that ultimately undercuts Ridley’s core assertion, at least for me. In a nutshell – like species, ideas and events evolve … they are not driven from the top down, but rather emerge from the bottom up. In fact, top-down systems always fail or are outperformed by bottom up systems. Ridley cleverly uses a long-lost poem by Lucretius as a literary grounding device, and also invokes Richard Webb’s brilliant concept of Darwin’s theory being the “special” theory of evolution, as opposed to the “general” theory presented here. Very clever! What gets a little dicey is his application of this theory to absolutely everything – he invokes it to declare that Libertarian Greatest Hits like central banking are the cause of economic stagnation and that global warming is less dire (and will take care of itself without big-government intervention) than everyone seems to think. Not sure about either of those … I think it’s an overreach. He also cites how central planning and foreign aid did nothing to help North Korea and Ghana, and how South Korea and Singapore’s economy’s “emerged.” The problem is, both those economies are also heavily planned … as is China’s, though less so than in the past. I definitely found this book provocative and at times brilliant, but I also think Ridley’s political agenda got in the way from time to time (I admit to being a radical leftie politically, so he’s attacking my sacred cows right and left, making my opinion as dubious in this context as his). Still, highly recommended.Grade: A/A-"
61,0062296000,http://goodreads.com/user/show/63532997-james-russo,3,"For me, this book started slowly, particularly the first two chapters, picked up substantially, but crashed again towards the end. I think this probably reflects two things. Ridley's knowledge on certain subjects was much deeper (eg biology) than on other subjects (eg education), which allowed him to build a more compelling case for 'evolution explains everything' in some chapters than others. Also, some subjects he tackled are probably inherently better described by the theory of evolution than others. For me, this made the book bumpy, as it shifted from extremely insightful through some chapters to stretching his analogy beyond the credible in others. Perhaps my biggest beef was how Ridley juxtaposed evolution as description versus evolution as prescription. Ridley claims that evolutionary ideas are essentially a description of reality and that humans prescribing evolutionary ideas as truths can become problematic (eg eugenics). However, he seems to have no issue with 'prescribing' evolution to public good problems such as health care, education and climate change. And these prescriptions are based on some of the thinnest evidence he presents in the book. In fact, these prescriptions seem to reflect Ridley's intuition more than his analysis, and gave the book political tones that I think undermine some of the interesting analysis in earlier chapters.Still, a stimulating read. Ridley's ability to navigate and thread together information from a variety of sources on such a broad range of topics is impressive. And, whether you agree with him or not, this book is likely to get you critically engaged and to promote a strong emotional response. "
62,0062296000,http://goodreads.com/user/show/10543840-conrad,3,"I enjoyed much of this book, although I nearly didn't make it past the prologue due to the overuse of the word 'inexorable' or inexorably'; that very nearly put me off. But thankfully it was stopped after the prologue. The author's thoughts on evolution clearly aren't new, but he puts them forward very well. I found myself re-reading paragraphs often to fully grasp the meaning, which I feel is a good thing; and is the fault of my lack of understanding rather than the authors writing abilities. The book is broken down into sections such as: morality; life, religion, education, population etc. Parallels are drawn between how evolution drives all these functions. He puts forward a very persuasive argument and one I largely agree with. However about two thirds of the way through the author's right wing political leanings start to become apparent, quoting UKIP MP Douglas Carswell for instance. By the time he compares climate change activists with a religious movement he was losing me, that just seems bonkers! I agree with his views of the bottom-up path of evolution in most things as opposed to the top-down 'skyhook' idea. But there seems to be no room for social welfare in his ideas which I found disturbing. Surely socialism and a welfare system aren't incompatible with a free market? I'm not intellectual enough to argue my case, but once he started down that track I began to lose interest. Still, a good informative read and very well written. I will most probably dip into it again from time to time."
63,0062296000,http://goodreads.com/user/show/50064390-timo-bremer,2,"While I agree with the author on many of the individual views that he has on the innumerable topics that he talks about in this book, his central thesis that was supposed to bind them all together is rather weak. Yes, all processes of change and invention, all institutions and all behaviors are subject to trial and error and evolutionary pressures. But instead of providing any enlightening insights on this process itself, the author goes through topic after topic calling out people for attributing change and invention to planning and intelligent design. So it is hour after hour of him calling others stupid. And, what's worse, I think that these are mostly strawmen. There is a lot of overconfidence in the world but noone assumes himself omniscient. Everybody acknowledges the necessity of some trial and error. The author does also offer some advice and personal positions on how many of these issues and areas should be handled. While many of his views have have some merit, that is more or less accidental. They don't follow a consistent pattern. He tries to derive them from an argument against planning and design, but really, all actions always involve some planning and design, you simply cannot go without. So while he might end up right more often than not because less planning is often better, there is no hard and fast recommendation he can give on how exactly to go about things. As a result, there is painfully little to take away from this book."
64,0062296000,http://goodreads.com/user/show/63656163-joseph-knecht,5,"I am amazed by the body of knowledge that the author has acquired on so many diverse topics. Starting from the universe, personality, culture, government, economy, and others, the author shows the evolution on many societal aspects from a high point of abstraction. The main repeating theme in all the chapters is that things emerge from the bottom up or in other words, they evolve. Evolution is not specific to biology but rather is present in all forms of life. And this evolution is to be welcomed because only through evolution (trial and error) things are allowed to improve. The book has a libertarian flavor and rejects central authoritarian planning in all aspects of life, wheater its government, education or money. Top-down central planning in business, government, and economy can never outperform the bottom-up approach because there could never be a CEO, politician or central banker who is smart enough who knows what is the best choice for all the people. Only the people know what is the best for them. Skyhooks are not necessary. This was the first book that I have read by Matt Ridley but it won't be the last one. "
65,0062296000,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4783600-carvas,2,"The author picks up an idea: things can be ""created"" by brilliant minds in a processed best described as ""top-down"", or ""evolved"" from the interaction of millions of intertwined agents (bottom-up)... Such a pity: the idea maybe not revolutionary but it is good, and deserved to have a more impartial approach. The author just wants everything to be bottom-up (like a golden rule) and it will go to great lenghts to justify it:1 - picks up the examples that suit bottom up approaches and extrapolates to a ""rule of law"".2 - there are a few (as far as I know) falsehoods in the book: I can guarantee that fracking won't help a thing against climate-change3 - some arguments are just senseless: ""if live needs no intelligent design, then why should the market need a central planner"" (???) 4 - claims that what is usually perceived as a cause and consequence is actually reversed (it is just the opposite of you just thought)The title is also misleading... You would say it would be an conprehensive review over the history of the systems (money, polulation, education), but the book kind of hovers over the topics picking up what he wants to point out...Overall, it is actually a interesting book as it approaches so many different topics. I loved Matt Ridley's take on education and patent system, but the way that he is even disrespectful when talking (or not talking) about the importance of city planners, policy makers, environmental authorities, etc...Carefull read... often it seemed more like propaganda, than an open discussion"
66,0062296000,http://goodreads.com/user/show/65910258-larry,2,"Ridley is a libertarian at heart and makes a constant case for this attitude in the book. He suggests that ""emergent phenomena are the ideal solution"" to any given issue/problem. But if we have evolved, then maybe we have evolved to see where top-down management of some issues is at times needed. (Is the extinction of species okay because our needs supersede theirs? The Internet issues now being discussed may also be such an example.) I liked his discussion of education although maybe not all the evidence is in on vouchers and charter schools (See Sci. American Aug 2017). Certainly his climate change arguments are pretty biased and suspicious. Sometimes I felt he was trying too hard to make his points. I also felt that he wanted no external rules - just let things evolve he seemed to imply. That seems a lot like survival of the fittest thinking, which might be the way nature evolved but that kind of thinking could justify by NOT caring about the weak and the struggling (attitudes that make us human).The book dragged in places but was generally easy enough to read, uncomfortable at times. You need an open but critical mind to enjoy the book."
67,0062296000,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2355414-andrew,4,"In Matt Ridley's book ""The Evolution of Everything"", he does cover just about everything. Ridley's research and development of the book is evident, as he approaches each topic in a very factual way, although not completely unbiased. From the evolution of the universe to the evolution of the religion to the evolution of the internet, Ridley covers a variety of topics. Ridley's main thrust of the book is that, when studied, all of the topics are example of bottom-up evolution and innovation. His contention is that things that evolve organically with no top-down planner, are inherently better and add more value. Whereas, top-down systems, such as those similar to man-made government, are inherently worse and leave everyone worse off. Yes, Ridley does interject opinion throughout the book, which seems to be of a decidedly libertarian slant. But that's okay. He backs up his assertions well, leading the reader through his thinking. This book will probably leave some readers on the left, a bit upset. But this book deserves a read, as it will certainly open your eyes to historical trends. It will leave you with something to think about, if nothing else. "

It never occurs to him that compromise is possible, that compromise may be in fact better than permanent war!One last comment: He hasn't even properly defined his concept of ""evolution"" so that the whole argument on which his book is based is just floating in thin air. Very, very unsatisfactory. Incidentally, I didn't give this one star because there's one thing Ridley does well: writing. He manipulates words with consummate skill, making himself sound like the mastermind he's not. And also, that makes him all the more dangerous. His misleading statements sound like the truths they are not. So, reader, if you are going to buy this book, beware of the pitfalls! "

The flow of the book is quite refreshing, and that the topics dealt with do have significant associations with the future of our planet. I was interested especially in the Evolution of Money and the role of crypto-currencies in the future- although it does not go very much into the depths of how exactly it works- I may have to look up other published literature to understand the underlying concepts.It is a very good starting point to pick up this book- read and understand- how exactly we have come to be, our societies, culture, personality, minds and genes etc....but I would strongly recommend pursuing other more detailed literature that draws out the scenario with more vivid examples. It is true that going into much detail is beyond the scope of a book- but, I haven't come across anything else yet, apart from Bill Bryson's book, that deals with the Evolution of Everything. A good read, indeed."
70,0062296000,http://goodreads.com/user/show/74411801-hana,5,"Remarkably insightfulI am very familiar with Matt Ridley’s work from his early days writing clearly about biology. This book takes the implications of his earlier books up one level to discuss how the same principles at work in biology apply to the economy. That insight is not new, but the depth of his understanding about evolutionary processes gives him a deeper insight than most about the applicability to economic and government policy.Matt Ridley is most definitely a polemicist, not an academic. While I tend to agree with much of what he says, I am well aware that his erudite examples require very little evidence if they support his theories while subjecting competing theories to a very high standard of proof. (For example, he asserts that Montessori schools are better than traditional education based on the evidence that three successful tech companies were started by Montessori students).If you keep an eye out for that technique, though, you can get a lot out of the book while still remaining a healthy skeptic."

It seems like Ridley is trying a bit too hard to fit available data to his central thesis (decentralised=optimal), and I get a bit dismayed when he discusses publicly funded vs. privately funded healthcare and comes to the conclusion that the British (!!!) public would be better off if the NHS was never instituted. I'd be the first to agree that markets do a great job of providing goods and services in almost all cases, but there are some central traits inherent to the nature of healthcare as a service that makes ot very ripe for market failures. The insistence that everything evolved is superior to anything willfully instituted borders on fanaticism, and the book would have been a lot better if he'd toned down the focus on the more controversial examples (or consulted an economist).Importance of subject matter: 3Importance of thesis: 4Presented arguments in favor of thesis: 2Clarity of disposition: 4Author credibility: 1Prose: 5Page turner factor: 4Mind blown factor: 2Final score: 3"
72,0062296000,http://goodreads.com/user/show/13717595-jake,2,"I have mixed feelings about this book. While it poses as a scientific text at first glance, it comes off as surprisingly political. Ridley's general thesis is that functional political structures evolve rather than are created by some top down authority, and these can function because, just like in classic biological evolution, they adapt to their distinct environments and by default survive due to fitness. This contrasts a ""planned political structure"" which arises out of the minds of people attempting to create something that could fit the environment, and then FAIL because well, those artificial structures - so to speak - are ARTIFICIAL. He kinda makes many political topics sound.. well..much less controversial than they really are. While im inclined to agree on many of his opinions, I still felt a bit iffy reading this. Nevertheless there are some pretty good ideas in this text and I recommend it to anyone interested in how societies evolve."
73,0062296000,http://goodreads.com/user/show/38677815-fermin-quant,5,"Very insightful book into how the world really works. It starts off with a tone that might sound a little heretical and fanatical of atheism, but it is nothing of the sort. It merely describes the conflict of beliefs that happened as humanity explored and understood biological evolution.It then proceeds to explain the story of many facets of life and how they actually evolved, and were not really mandated by any one entity. Examples of governments actually trying to mandate how life works and how they have all invariably failed and made life miserable to their citizens. These are just to name a few examples.It really opens up your mind into how different the world actually is, in comparison with what we are taught in our education system and what we innately believe or even want to believe. Kind of like when you first understand probability and statistics, on how one counter-example does not invalidate a theory but actually reaffirms it.Absolutely worth your time."

Some of the points in the book I enjoyed, other seemed too much like a stretch for me, particularly the nature vs. nurture argument in children’s upbringing. While there is an argument to be made that a lot of aspects of our personality are genetically predetermined, it’s unfair to not pay enough attention to the role of parents and their emotional behavior during the childhood of their offspring, especially in the face of an incredible amount of scientific work done in that space. The evolution of money and technology was particularly interesting to me, as well as the examples given in the epilogue for events/discoveries that were brought by deliberate design versus the ones created with no particular intention. Overall, it was an interesting read, although I was not convinced by some aspects of the book, it solidified my evolutionist (as opposed to creationist) thinking. "
75,0062296000,http://goodreads.com/user/show/15548366-richard,4,"The central thesis of this book is that the processes advanced by Charles Darwin related to biological evolution are also occurring in non-biological domains. I've enjoyed several of Matt Ridley's other books (The Rational Optimist is a favorite) and several more are in my reading queue. He's an obvious fan of Nassim Taleb, Sam Harris, Dan Dennett, Richard Dawkins, and Ron Paul -- and references all frequently in this book. The author is a strong Libertarian, which I'm mostly OK with. Personally, I'm a ""naive Libertarian"", in the sense that I generally agree with Libertarian concepts when they are presented to me, but I haven't ever studied Libertarianism. I found that I was only persuaded by 70-75% of the author's arguments on most topics. The further back in history the author was talking about, the more I agreed with his assertions. The more recent he got, historically, the less I was persuaded. But still, a very engaging read that I recommend you check out."

Actually geese fly in V-formation because of less air resistance, and the leader (who does the most work) is often changed. As far as the author is concerned everything is accidental, and if you think there's meaning or design behind the changes you're of a lesser intelligence. Evolution is the force behind everything, and this force is blind and dumb, and doesn't know what it's doing or why. (Sorry if this wasn't the intended message.) Just leave everything to this mysterious force (evolution = god) and all will be well.

There are some ideas worth holding onto, like governments and laws evolving bottom-up instead of top-down, but most of the ideas aren't Ridley's, and he presents them in stuffy, verbose writing.This book is homework.

This is not the Evolution of Everything, it is Matt Ridley writing shallowly about libertarianism- giving himself high fives with specific tired examples. I refused to keep reading after he argues how since private education in poor areas in India is better than public, public education is bad. As someone who has studied education extensively, and with several friends who teach, I can easily say his views on United States education are flawed and dangerous. Now more than ever we need to insist on adequate, quality education for all our citizens, and it is the duty of a democratic country to educate its population if they are to govern themselves.

The entire book is a convincing argument on various facets of our life and how it has evolved.I now really appreciate the concepts of emergence and complexity much better thru this fantastic, well researched and lucidly written book.It’s an excellent book that deserves five stars.

I don't agree with everything Ridley proposes here, but he makes a good case and provides much food for thought. There's a lot of information here you won't find gathered elsewhere. His basic idea is that evolution works in all aspects of human society, (e.g. technology, government, religion, science, education, etc.) and in doing so provides better outcomes than when those aspects are planned by experts or those in power. I especially liked the way he used quotes from Lucretius' On the Nature of Things to emphasize the evolution of various aspects of society. "

It generalizes the well-accepted theory of evolution of species to basically every aspect of our daily lives. This idea is very powerful and changes the view of human history dramatically. However, not everything in this book is perfect. Probably to commemorate his predecessors, the author performs his own version of Lucretian swerve when he forces the evolution theory even to places where it does not fit that easily and naturally. Ironically, the cherrypicking of examples to support his viewpoint, rather than presenting rational arguments is quite noticeable in some places, even though it's exactly the thing the author criticizes in the book."

In fact, as you progress through the book, you increasingly realize the author runs out of cogent examples and starts getting polemical. Also, some may find his take on a few of these topics superficial. Still, there's no denying Ridley has some strong arguments to back his hypothesis of bottom-up progress. My personal favourite chapters are the ones on mind, personality and religion. "

Of course it could be interesting anyway since difference of opinion is how we evolve our arguments and ideas, but it felt a bit forced and a lot of cherry-picking made me lose interest in more than one chapters.

What was particularly enlightening was the quotations throughout from Lucretius’ poem ‘De Rerum Natura’ which rings true even today: ‘And everything she does, does on her own, so that gods play no part...’ "

Whether the topic is truly evolution or the state of being, Matt Ridley gives a superb overview of how societies function. Definitely not top down. People, plants, and lower animals, all develop their societies by the needs of the individual, not by the directive of the powers at the top.Don't miss this book. It is the best reading since Pinker, Dawkins, and Taleb."

Thought provoking and liberating from the chains of literal understanding of the order of things surrounding you.Alongside with Yuval Noah Harari Matt Ridley is the one of the leading ""understanders"" :) (my term) of the dynamic and predicament of human existence.Very observant and well put together.Masterpiece.To be read again."

Sure, there are controversial parts that would offend people which also initially offended me but I tried to keep an open mind and it paid off. There are also parts that tried to prescribe a one size fits all solution to everything but although I don't agree with it, I learned how to think from a different angle. I don't completely agree but it allowed me to see a lot of merits of a very different perspective."
99,0062296000,http://goodreads.com/user/show/18843824-scott,5,"This is a fascinating and thought provoking book. Like any book, the author has his views which are supported by facts, however there are of course opinions throughout.I may not agree with everything, but this book is not about agreeing, it is about listening, reflecting and seeing the evolutionary aspect to all things.For those wishing to explore a broad range of topics and how evolution has impacted so much of our society, this is a book worth adding to your list."

The world is too complex for a handful of people to design anyways. So, the author argues that the best the governments can do is simply get out of the way. This evolutionary approach is in consonance with truly democratic principles - where the power lies with everyone."
101,0062296000,http://goodreads.com/user/show/32461330-bryant-macy,5,"Interesting and thoughtful perspective. A good blend of philosophy, anthropology, history, politics and technology. The author brings it all together in an interesting philosophical framework for understanding the why and the how big things happen in the world that improve the human condition. Or better said from the framework’s perspective, how small incremental improvements add up to big world improving outcomes."
102,0062296000,http://goodreads.com/user/show/63241304-stan-parker,3,"The general idea that Ridley writes about is correct, and his first few chapters are excellent examples of how change in our world evolves rather than is directed. I enjoyed the book to start, and totally agree with the author's outlook.However, in the later chapters his hypothesis is a thinly veiled veneer over his Libertarian views. The two views are complimentary, but not all attempts at trying to direct change are bad. Just as not all government is bad."
103,0062296000,http://goodreads.com/user/show/58076099-justevan,4,"I am a big Matt Ridley fan and this is a great book, with some caveats. As always, I have an issue with books that are stridently atheist. I don't have a problem with atheism, per se, but I do have an issue when it gets in the way of objectivity. I think the book does fall into that trap, on occasion. I also found the discussion of free will to be very shallow. Overall a good book, though with some unfortunate holes. "
104,0062296000,http://goodreads.com/user/show/51487514-john-beckmann,3,"I generally found this book interesting, and it helped me think a lot about the nature of any system - it can be centralized, decentralized, or ideally, some combination of both. The book clearly argues, and the author believes, that decentralized systems are superior. The book was at times a bit tedious in details, but plenty of interesting historical stories, etc...."

Good news is accidental, unplanned, emergent stuff that gradually evolves. The things that go well are largely unintended; the things that go badly are largely intended.” "
106,0062296000,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3427882-elizabeth-meadows,4,"Really interesting, but ultimately naive, exploration of what our culture would be like with no government interference in business and science, leaving progress to happen by itself, in its purist form. My concern lies in the fact that people don't always act predictably nor always for the benefit of themselves and others."
107,0062296000,http://goodreads.com/user/show/85098156-david-walsh,5,"I enjoyed reading this book. I can't say I agreed with everything the writer wrote, or that it was an easy read. No, I loved it and gave it five stars for the brain food it is. It made me think about many things I have observed or read about it my life. From Taoist Philosophy to The Day the Universe Changed by James Burke. It was a great read."
108,0062296000,http://goodreads.com/user/show/41030542-wan-shoo,3,Never came across my mind that any changes that happens within are related to evolution. The evolution of everything retrospectively analyze the history and the present. There are so many on-going evolution within decades and some of them definitely worth our time for deeper thoughts. An insightful description and arguments of evolution. There are chapters that pique my interest but not all.

Hierarchy is an effective imagination, and it should be tackled. Focusing on attempts is probably a good way to find foundations for discussion, as they are all varied and distinct from contexts."

I have taken notes on some good points but there are some explanation that doesn't satisfy my question. I enjoy seeing things in a different perspective and this book gave me that experience. It wasn't what I was expecting but I enjoyed most of the time reading it.
111,0062296000,http://goodreads.com/user/show/603415-temple-dog,3,I would add Matt Ridley’s The Evolution of Everything: How New Ideas Emerge to your must read list because it’s so illuminating that it would be intellectual deprivation not to read it or because it is such unabashed enjoyment that it would be an emotional crime no to experience such philosophical joy.

112,0062296000,http://goodreads.com/user/show/50953703-groot,5,"The always excellent Matt Ridley does it again. I'm a bottom-up, rather than top-down, fan, and he thinks much like I do, so this book resonated. Additionally, as usual, the book is jam-packed with tons of fascinating, arcane, yet important tidbits about technology, history, etc."

Most of the topics are fast paced and easy to read. There are few items that drag out and become quite esoteric. Still a pretty good read."
114,0062296000,http://goodreads.com/user/show/64001781-xander-hoskinson,3,"Very interesting read, however would agree with other reviews in that Ridley's argument is lost as he transitions from science to the social sciences and political topics such as government. Worth reading, but definitely through a critical lens towards the latter chapters. "
115,0062296000,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2699963-mikedariano,5,Very good. Can you say a five star book is too repetitive? I'm glad Ridley included so many domains that demonstrated his theory. This book may be more enjoyable if you space your reading out - a chapter a week.

I regarded Ridley as a very interesting, and scientifically-sound writer, I realize now he's not. Bulshit at its finest. Do not even waste your time downloading it form libgen. An extremely crappy experience. "

Do nothing and the universe will sort things out. The non-falsifiability of this idea, even in the book's own terms, suggests that it is mostly balderdash."
