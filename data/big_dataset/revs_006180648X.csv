0,006180648X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4215702-jenny-brown,1,"The subject matter of this book is extremely interesting. Unfortunately, the author dumbed down his text to the level of a cable channel documentary so that you won't learn very much actual science from reading the book. He gives many pages to long, detailed accounts of human interest anecdotes that don't contribute anything to our understanding of his topic--for example, the discovery of an early hominid fossil or one patient's trip to Mexico to get a treatment based on a theory he discusses. The fossil doesn't have anything to do with parasitology and the author has no idea whether the patient's treatment helped in any way. The pages given to describing the search for the treatment seemed to me to be filler.Or, more likely, what happens when you turn the script for a made-for-TV documentary into a book. The author seems to think his readers are too dumb to have anything described in terms that would explain the actual science involved and that our only interest is in anecdotal material of the kind that is accompanied by woo-woo music. Too bad. Good germs, Bad Germs, an excellent book published some years ago did a much better job of exploring this topic. I had hoped to learn of developments since that book came out, but I'm halfway through this book and I keep expecting the text to be interrupted by a commercial for some product medicare will pay for, or a company claiming it can help me fend off the IRS. NOTE: I finished this book and dropped the rating a star as the second half was more vague and inane than the first. There was enough real material here for a brief magazine article. As a book it's a waste of time unless you don't know anything about ecology. "
1,006180648X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/28825839-stephie-williams,4,"This book examines what are lives are like without the various species we evolved with. In a lot of cases we face issues we never had to face with them. There are plenty of things to think about when reading this book.After an introduction in part one, part two explores why we might be afflicted with Crohn's Disease and other auto-immune diseases in the developed world, but not in other parts of the world. The answer very well might be that we in the modern world with its cleanliness and health care are missing the worms that infect the rest less fortunate part of the world. Less fortunate in the sense that they live without what we have come to rely on and aspect. If we factor in their lack of Crohn's Disease and its like, the matter might not seem so clear. One scientist wondered about our lack of worms, and if it could be responsible for these diseases. In an actual clinical trial Crohn's patient were given a benign species of hookworms, and most of those given the worms either improved or went in to remission. The reason that auto-immune diseases are prevalent might be that without the worms in our bodies for the immune system to fight it attacks our own bodies. Of course, there is a lot more research needed to provide that direct link. It's possible that there could be alternative explanations, or it might be only a part of the explanation.The next part covers the trillions of bacterica that live in and on us. Research has shown that a lot of the bacteria in our guts are beneficial. These bacteria help us digest fiber and play a role in our immune system. Other research has shown a correlation between low fiber diets and colon cancer. The appendix is discussed as being a beneficial organ, long thought to be a relic and useless. Studies have shown that a particular antibody we have actually benefits good bacteria in our appendix. In the developing world where the incidence of appendicitis is rare the appendix replenishes their guts with the good bacteria that live in the appendix after a bout with common diarrheal diseases. Without the need to repopulate our guts in the developed world the appendix can become blotted and rupture, sending the bacteria into the body cavity where it can have deadly consequences. Again more research is needed to improve our understanding of our interaction with the bacteria that could be considered a part of us.Part four covers how domestication of plants and animals have changed us. For me there was not much of interest in this part, except for lactose intolerence was reverse in cultures that domesticated cows and other milk producing species. The subject of part five is the relationship we had and now have with predators. There is a theory that poisonous snakes are responsible for our excellent color vision. In other primates, the better the vision, the more poisonous snakes were in the environment. There are other explanations for color vision, such as the ability to spot nutritious fruits. The modern plague of anxiety disorders may involve a misdirection of fear from predators we used to come across with some frequency.In part six the creatures that live on or did live on us are discussed. There is a theory that our hairlessness, which evolved in relation to lice, ticks, and other bugs that dine on our blood, has led to xenophobia. This theory could be a stretch, but is plausaible. Our hairlessness has also led to our being prone to skin cancers.The final part is on how we could make are city environments more like those we evolved in. Massive rooftop gardens and whole vacant buildings acting as natural cliff environments, which are thought to be part of our evolutionary environment. This section I view as pie in the sky type thinking. Although I believe we need people to dream big, because good things have often come with those dreams and people. The book as a whole is pretty good. It was for the most part interesting throughout. I like the fact that the author presents experiments that support the various theories proposed in the book. The author also did not actually do any of the experiments or propose any of the theories explained in the book. But, like a good scientist he assesses the different theories and their weaknesses, which all of them basically had. I would recommend the book for those interest in our evolution with other species in our environments, and what might be the result of not having them in our environment anymore. Like I said the author is careful in presenting the facts, based on experiments, and the proposed theories. This should be appreciated by readers who value honesty by an author in presenting hers or his ideas. I think it is incumbent upon an author to present known and possible problems with his or hers ideas being presented."
2,006180648X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2305150-lauren,3,"I liked this book, but as a microbiologist, I found the science behind the assertions to be either dumbed down or not explained fully. For example, in the case of intestinal worms improving auto-immune diseases, it would have been nice to see any evidence of a mechanism behind this phenomenon, rather than vague hand-waving about the immune system chasing things that aren't there. I did like many of the ideas in the book, but I found the book to have an overall negative tone that was distracting."
3,006180648X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2986995-mary-ronan-drew,5,"Joel Weinstock was flying somewhere over New York or Pennsylvania when he got his crazy idea. He had been studying intestinal parasites. That day he began reading about Crohn's Disease. Why, he wondered, did people who had intestinal worms not have Crohn's and people who had Crohn's never have intestinal parasites? Could it be that worms prevented Crohn's? Naw. Impossible.But he couldn't get the idea out of his head. In the 1940s half of American children had worms. In 1980 there were something like 10 times more people with Crohn's than in 1940. This is a pretty strong correlation. Weinstock decided to see what happened when he gave whip worm eggs to people with inflammatory intestinal disease.In March of 1999 29 well-informed and consenting patients were given Gatorade laced with whipworm eggs. And by week 24 of the study all but one of the patients were doing better and 22 of the remaining 25 (some, understandably, dropped out of the study) were in remission. These were patients with serious and untreatable Crohn's. And having worms made them healthier.Deborah Wade had an exceedingly bad case of Crohn's disease. She read about Weinstock's experiment and in 2007 she decided she wanted to try the worm treatment. So she found someone (a non-MD in an unlicensed Mexican clinic) who would give her a drink of worms. ""The endeavor felt more like adopting a pet than modern medicine - a long, translucent, sucker-mouthed companion animal.""Deborah Wade is not cured, but she is better. And so are other people with autoimmune diseases who have been treated with worms. Why would ""rewilding"" your body, as the author calls it, keep autoimmunie disease under control? How does it work? They aren't really sure but it has something to do with cells produced by chronic worm infestation that help to tamp down the excessive reactions of Lupus and asthma and Crohn's.This is just one of the dozens of puzzling and sometimes alarming stories Rob Dunn tells in his amusing book about The Predators, Parasites, and Partners That Shape Who We Are Today. The author offers some convincing explanations for how cows domesticated humans, how lice and fleas made us naked, and the exceedingly useful role of our appendix.Most of us who are primarily readers of fiction, ex-English majors, literature junkies, are distressingly ignorant about science. This makes reading popular science written by people like Dunn and Natalie Angier so entertaining. So much is going on out there in the world of botany and astronomy and ecology. Books like The Wild Life of Our Bodies begin to give us a hint of how much we are missing.Read Rob Dunn's blog here: http://www.yourwildlife.org/ "
4,006180648X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/291936-claire,3,"Started out as notable, scientific, informative, disgustingly fun. What is the appendix for? Can intestinal parasites cure us of bowel diseases? And more. But as it goes, the writing is inconsistent at best. Instead of presenting interesting scientific findings about our bodies, Dunn puts more and more effort into first the secret life of scientists (how an anthropologist's new idea unraveled as she made eggs for breakfast!), and then into thought experiments that are not at all fleshed out, either because introduced ideas don't have enough evidence to support them, or because Dunn got lazy. Fun and interesting at times, and certainly great for dinnertime conversation, but I would vastly recommend Parasite Rex by Carl Zimmer over this one."
5,006180648X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6219674-chris,4,"Other reviews mirror many of my thoughts - I really wished the final chapter was fleshed out into two or more chapters. And for some reason I had this idea that the author was going to promote the idea of having our cities be wild to the extent that predators would be let loose there. I kept hoping to read about that somewhere in the last chapter, but I must have missed it.Don't get me wrong, the other stuff about the evolution of mankind from H&G to Agricultural to our post-agricultural age; yet all the while living with all the rest of nature around us. Yet now we are trying to eradicate all that nature. However, what we have done is eradicate the beneficial parts of nature, leaving only the hardiest of pests behind - rats, cockroaches, bedbugs to name a few.Another really cool bit was that humans are a cliff-dwelling species, so we have created huge ecologies of cliffs (cities) - and that many many of the species joining us in these modern cliff ecologies are also originally cliff creatures too - Dandelions, Norway rats, German cockroaches bedbugs, pigeons, starlings, earthworms, and even some domesticated species like goats, guinea pigs, almonds, carrots, and wheat. This was in the final chapter - I wanted to hear more of this stuff too.Finally, I'll end this with a link to a web page that has some designs for urban farms, 3-D farms.http://weburbanist.com/2008/03/30/5-u... "
6,006180648X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1351007-jennie,3,"This book packed such a knowledge punch I am somewhat at a loss for words even days after reading the last page. One of the things I admired most while reading this book was how science was at the forefront – research, evolution and the beginning of mankind in forms that we would hardly recognize now. This book covers a range of topics from the lack of worms in our guts, to how STD’s have changed since we have become pro-less hair. Every page was fascinating and full of ideas that let your mind dance through how people have become the people we have become. Aside from going to Mexico to willingly be injected with a worm, my favorite portion of the book covered the change from gatherers to hunters and then to farmers. I found this most fascinating because it really changed the way our entire future forever. We became less nomadic – creating the food instead of following after it. It was at first hard to realize the impact of this one change but as the author further writes of its weight I began to feel it myself. This changed the landscape of animals, plants, people and the Earth. This is a powerful book that is worth reading, if nothing else for the insight into how our actions have impacted everything around us, and our own bodies. "
7,006180648X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6400843-anne,1,"I didn't actually finish the book, so take my review with the appropriate grains of salt. This is a book about one of the most fascinating topics imaginable, and it's written in such a cutesy, condescending, dumbed-down, frivolous way that it's almost unbearable to read. In fact I'd call it irresponsibly frivolous in some parts, such as the ""upbeat"" story of the guy who just *had* to try infecting himself with parasitic worms in an attempt to treat his IBS, and the brave and plucky individuals who opened illegal clinics in Mexico to offer parasite treatments. I know just enough about the topic to know that this is an extremely interesting line of inquiry in the treatment of autoimmune diseases, and not scientifically wacko per se - however, such things *become* wacko at the moment that people decide to set up shop and offer these treatments based on extremely preliminary research, and it's grossly immoral to write about this kind of thing in such a credulous way without accurately portraying the limits of current knowledge.I would really like to read a GOOD book on this topic, but this one isn't it."
8,006180648X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4501810-heather,3,"The author provides good information on several different scenarios of predators, parasite and partners, but the overarching theme was not fully tied together. "
9,006180648X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6043279-kili,5,"Humans like to think of themselves as different from other living things. Germs and parasites are bad: we should eliminate them. After all, it's what our immune system does. In this book, Dunn argues quite convincingly that this is a destructive view. Species don't evolve in isolation of other species - predators and their prey engage in an evolutionary arms race (which explains, for example, why mollusks have thicker shells in the Pacific as compared to the Atlantic), symbiosis is found all over (for example, our immune system encourages the creation of biofilms), perhaps why tapeworms are proving to be an effective method of controlling certain autoimmune disorders, and why a large number of ""pest"" species (rats, pigeons, dandelions, bedbugs, etc) come from narrow ecological niches (cliffs and caves).When Dunn discusses human evolution and its impact on what we currently are, he doesn't draw the line that I automatically drew: that of being human. Of course, this is an arbitrary line, and I drew it because of my own bias of thinking of humans as being different from other living things. Like other old-world primates, our eyes see colors and we are good at spotting certain shapes, the latter being important in our use of writing for communication. Our long history of being prey (going way before your ancestors lost their tails) still has an impact on how we live - and amuse ourselves. Dunn also opened my eyes on how our myths diverge from what probably happened. For example, how agriculture and domestication of cattle were likely acts of desperation. (I'd love to see Dunn and Harvard primatologist Richard Wrangham collaborate on applying Dunn's approach of coevolution to the emergence of cooking). I was reading this part while walking to the metro on my morning commute to NSF: this section made me stop to think. I looked around at the people around me - I was standing in front of the National Geographic building - and saw the ""obesity epidemic"" around me in a much different light. (A paragraph or so later, Dunn touched on this topic, so all I had done was anticipate him). The author Rob Dunn is an associate professor in the Department of Biology at NC State. Given the state of science in the popular mind of the United States, scientists like Rob are wonderful - not only does he have the ability to explain complex ideas in a clear manner, he actively enlists the public to join him in his research. Spend some time at  the wildlife blog of his lab. (Rob seems like a natural for TED, and I was surprised to see he was not one of the speakers, but the way he is popularizing his part of science can have much broader impact than what TED offers). I read his 2004 Science paper ""Species Coextinctions and the Biodiversity Crisis"" - the paper that first attempted to estimate the rate of coextinction of species - which shows his interest in this topic goes back quite far."
10,006180648X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5935491-tanja-berg,4,"This was a quite interesting and fun read. The title is slightly misleading if it makes you think of only what is on or in our bodies. This book covers more. Interesting chapter titles include ""when cows and grass domesticated humans"", ""we were hunted, which is why all of are afraid some of the time and some of us are afraid all of the time"" and ""how lice and ticks mad us naked and gave us skin cancer"", to name a few. What I learned that I didn't know before: some creatures and living things are alive today who's evolutionary ""half"" has been eradicated. For example pronghorns and their inexplicable and ridiculous speed: missing the American cheetac. Second thing I learned (that I should have known): when you use antibiotics you kill not only the bacteria you intend to kill, but also most other useful microbes in the gut. Third thing I learned: fear of snakes gave us better eyesight. Fourth thing: we might be snaked to avoid ectoparasites. All in all this book is informative and interesting. It is however, extremely adapted to the non-scientific reader, repeating things often and explaining things I don't need explained. The author also names a scientist afraid of snake although he lives in ""snakeless Sweden"". Huh? Define ""snakeless"": no snakes? In which case Sweden is not snakeless, it has at least two species I know of. If it qualifies as ""no known lethal snakes"" so be it, Sweden is snakeless. This makes me think the dear Mr. Dunn might be wrong about other things, but I choose to give him the benefit of the doubt.All in all this is a quite intertaining and highly informative book well worth reading. No need to worry about scientific jargon, that's for sure! All will be explained, whether you like it or not."
11,006180648X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1128490-gabrielle,5,"This book is, in essence, about what it means to be human: ""...our bodies and lives only make sense in the context of other species.""It completely blew me away. (I am going to buy it next time I'm at Powell's, and I'm a die-hard library user.)Unlike Dunn's other book (_Every Living Thing_), which I also loved, you do not have to be a biologist or even a scientist to maximize your enjoyment here. _The Wild Life_ is much more accessible to the layperson. I'm recommending it to pretty much everyone. (Yes, even you.) There are lots of amazing new ideas here, and new research for those of you that don't keep up with the latest (like, our appendix actually has a purpose!)I love Dunn's writing style. He roams seemingly all over, and you're like ""dude where are you going with this"" but he brings the topics neatly back to his original point, so you don't feel lost for long. I picture him teaching, scrawling all over every available whiteboard, and drawing arrows back to previous topics with an ""and so!"" flourish of the marker.I also thing it'd be great to go out to the pub with him and listen to some of these stories. (""Hey, I did not need to know the thing about lice in the eyelashes! Ew!"" ""I know, right!"")"
12,006180648X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2379275-greg,3,"Similar to the New Germ theory of disease in many aspects, the book argues not only that there are many diseases caused by either pathogens, or the lack of them, but that many other aspects of humanity, such as colour vision and xenophobia were fixed in us because of predators or pathogens. Often, he makes a good case, but there is a tendency to jump on any crank suggestion and shout ""ooh, this could be true, we should sow it is wrong before dismissing it"", which might be technically true, but in reality there are so many possible crank explanations of everything, that it is on the proponents to gather the evidence in favour.Another issue I had was his pushing of a viral cause for cancer. This is well known in some epithelial cancers, such as those caused by HPV, but in most others, the evidence is limited at best, but he made it sound as though it was extremely strong and it is only scientists, showing the same reticence to new ideas that they did when the viral cause theory was. In reality, though it was ignored for a time, it later became a major field of study, but people just did not find it then, and it was dropped."
13,006180648X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2327558-eric-rasmussen,2,"This book had a few ""wow"" moments, where I had to get up and tell my wife and family about the amazing insights delivered in this book. Those moments are what keep me coming back to nonfiction, what I live for in reading. Unfortunately, the few wow moments (parasites and autoimmune disease) were more than overbalanced by the shakier theories (loss of predators and modern anxiety issues?) and the rehashing of popular health ideas (good gut bacteria and its necessity). While all of that may be excusable, the author's attempts to add drama were nerve-grating - another reviewer likened the tone to a cable-channel documentary, and that's exactly what this book is, replete with the repetition and an overdramatic narrator - you can almost here the over-the-top orchestral soundtrack that accompanies everything on the History channel. For a casual reader, a great read. For those more familiar with the genre, there may be better options."
14,006180648X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4628362-harry-lane,5,"Dunn's premise is that we have shaped evolution as much as evolution has shaped us, and not always to our advantage. His argument is fairly strong, and his conclusions well worth consideration. But it is something implicit in his presentation that I think is equally important: the degree of specialization in science is a barrier to some types of insights that only come from connecting notions from disparate fields."
15,006180648X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5957551-philip-taylor,3,"Fascinating and, at least occasionally, exciting. We appear to need bacteria and certain parasites. However, as with many popular science books, I can't help thinking that I am not getting the full story and that statistics are being suspiciously used to lead me to a certain conclusion. That's what happens when you are ignorant of many things, you get suspicious that someone is deliberately obfuscating the topic for you. To cynical? "
16,006180648X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/46633496-trevor-falsey,5,I honestly enjoyed this book. It intrigued me. It's so funny because I accidentally checked this book out of the library and thought it was something else. I thought I might as well read it.From the first part I was in love. It helped that the topic was rather interesting but the way the author expressed his opinions and facts made it readable.Totally recommend. 
17,006180648X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1056143-david-brooke,4,"Very informative and interesting. Sadly it ends not very strong, but at that point I was in full agreement so maybe i was disappointed i wasn't won over."
18,006180648X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/17603716-danielle,2,"The point of view was very one-sided. For a much more objective and better written book on the subject, read An Epidemic of Absence by Moises Velasquez-Manoff."
19,006180648X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6423134-bernie-gourley,4,"Dunn’s book addresses a host of intriguing questions such as:-Why are there diseases that disproportionately attack those in the richest parts of the world while being almost non-existent in poor countries? -Why is obesity at epidemic proportions among modern humans?-Why—while people have diverse tastes overall—do there seem to be universal preferences for sweet, salty, and fatty foods?-Why are so many people’s lives wrecked by constant stress and worry?-Is the Appendix really a vestigial organ with no apparent purpose?As the subtitle suggests, this book is about the role that other species have played in human evolution and the way we look, behave, and think today. The message of The Wild Life of Our Bodies is that humanity’s proclivity to see itself as an island--uninfluenced by other species--has its cost. The book is popular science--approachable to a layman but with the usual disdain for gratuitous assertions and shoddy reasoning that define the scientific though process. That being said, Dunn does put some editorial opinion out there in ways that might appear as fact in a slipshod reading. The most prominent example being Dunn’s suggesting that what best defines humanity is not our intelligence or ability for abstract representation (or even our physical appearance), but that we are the only (first?) species that has killed other species off not purely of self-defense or for food, but to exercise control over our ecosystem. I doubt this would strike a majority of impartial scientists as a fair and unbiased way to define humanity. Granted, this point not what The Wild Life of Our Bodies is about, and whether one thinks this it is fair or not is not critical to whether one will find the book to be of value. However, the idea (and the fact) that humans have zealously killed off other creatures is certainly relevant to the discussion at hand.If “terraforming” is the term for how an alien race might environmentally engineer Earth to make it suitable for them to live here, perhaps we could call humanity’s assault on other species “bio-forming” of the planet—choosing a roster of species that strikes our fancy. All the time humans were trying to make ourselves more comfortable by getting rid of inconvenient species, we remained ignorant to the downside. Dunn covers a broad range of mismatches between who we are evolutionarily and how we live in the modern world. The Wild Life of Our Bodies suggests that, like the pronghorn antelope, humans are in many cases over-designed because of the loss of species (parasites, predators, symbiotes, etc.) that helped to make us who we are today. (One question that once puzzled biologists was why pronghorns were so much faster than every species they faced.) While it sounds good to be over-designed (at least relative to the alternative), it’s not without cost. In our case, we had guts that were supremely adapted to having parasites, but the lightning fast (on an evolutionary timescale) elimination of those parasites has left us with bodies that attack a non-existent enemy and this has resulted in a number of new diseases. We are used to diseases that succeed in the poorest—and, hence, least hygienic areas-- but disease that mostly attacked in the cleanest places on Earth have puzzled us for some time. Crohn’s disease is a prime example. “Rewilding” (i.e. putting parasites back into) the guts of Crohn’s patients has shown positive results.Dunn lays out a couple of the theories as to how the loss of our intestinal bacteria may result in a number of first-world ailments. Interestingly, some of these diseases aren’t even digestive in nature, and might seem to have no logical connection to gut bacteria. However, our body’s systems are a system-of-systems—i.e. they are integrally linked. One issue is that some parasites have been able to mask their presence, and our bodies have learned to present a heightened response to account for this veiled threat. Today our systems can’t tell the difference between our squeaky clean guts and a gut full of these sneaking parasites so it drops the immune system version of an A-bomb. This is one example of why some diseases don’t exist in the third-world where the body knows what parasites it’s up against. One might say, “Yes, but these ailments of over-reactive systems can’t be as bad as the effects of the parasites.” That’s often not true. Most people with internal bugs (we all have them to some degree), don’t even realize it. The fact that people with Crohns’ are willing to have predators implanted in them speaks to this issue.  There has been concern for years about downside of the rampant use of anti-bacterials, antibiotics, and antiseptics, and this is a topic Dunn addresses as well. For example, there seems to be little evidence that such agents in soap do any particular good, but they decidedly do bad (encouraging drug resistant species.) Perhaps the single greatest change in the nature of homo sapiens life resulted from the agricultural revolution, and Dunn delves into how this seminal event changed our bodies. With paleo-dieting all the rage, it will come as no surprise that there have been some major changes to the human diet since our hunter-gatherer ancestors roamed the Earth. Once again, we have bodies built on an evolutionary timescale, and they don’t necessarily cope well with our new diets. One problem is that we have strong hardwired drives for foods that were a rarity in our species’ past, but which we now produce in abundance. For example, we eat far too much refined sugar because our bodies are wired to love sweet, but that kind of food was rare to our pre-agricultural ancestors. Hence we have the existence of diabetes, and its greater prevalence where high-sugar diets are common. Many people are also saddled with an evolutionary advantage to store fat because their ancestors come from a clime where food was not abundant year round. The problem is that now there’s a grocery store on every corner and this once great advantage is contributing to burgeoning waistlines. I gave this book a high rating on the grounds that it presented a lot of food for thought, and that’s what I most value in non-fiction. Some of the theories may turn out to be incorrect, but this book offers one a lot to think about and clear explanations of the bases for what can otherwise seem a little outlandish. There is also some wit in places that contributes to heightened readability. "
20,006180648X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5385407-aimee-barnes-pestano,4,"Biologist and science writer Rob Dunn adeptly challenges today's germaphobic view of health with an in-depth exploration into the life supporting role of both parasites and predators (both of which humankind seems hellbent on eradicating). I was blown away by his detailed reporting into the world of worm tourism for those seeking a cure for Crohn's disease, as well as his argument for bringing back large predatory animals onto the American plains. While it seems like many of the reviewers here work in the fields of biology and medicine, I read this book as a layperson with minimal prior knowledge and appreciated its accessibility. Two-thirds of the way in, however, I felt like the subject matter became a little too broad. The chapter on cow's milk, while intriguing, was a bit of a wild card, and the parasite research was so interesting that he could have written the entire book about that alone. ""The Wild Life of Our Bodies"" was quite an eye-opener and I left its pages with copious notes! "
21,006180648X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/70637043-onwrd-homestead,5,"I was surprised by this book. I agreed to read it upon request by an acquaintance. To me the cover art is deceptive. I thought this was going to be a discourse on microflora and microfauna that inhabit the exteriors and interiors of our bodies. DULL. But wait!! This book is NOT that book. Dunn looks at a handful of connections made by scientists in their wildly extreme and narrow studies that at a glance may seem unrelated, in addition to the detours of the research, their findings and Dunn's running this info through the filters of human evolution and ecology make this an interesting look at the factors that ruled us then, rule us now, or are still influencing us different ways today."
22,006180648X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5075908-jeannette,4,"Thoroughly readable, enjoyable, informative. Ranging from lost cheetahs chasing pronghorns on the American plains and absent predators chasing our fear responses plus lost diseases causing appendicitis this book is a travelogue of disease and past history. The author travels round the world, ducking into laboratories and arcane subjects to tell us all about why we respond and how our bodies respond to lost organisms and an overload of modern ones.

36,006180648X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7240015-stephen,5,"You can take the man out of the jungle, but not the jungle out of the man. Such is the lesson of Rob Dunn's brilliantly-written The Wild Life of Our Bodies, which demonstrates to readers the ways in which interactions with other species have shaped human evolution, and the folly of our attempt to sever our ties with the natural world.I initially thought this book was on the body as an ecosystem, host to millions of other lifeforms; some preying on us, others living in a mutualistic relationship with us, helping us to digest food in return for a roof over their little unicellular heads. That's only the start of Dunn's piece, and even there he turns expectations on our heads. Sure, we need bacteria to help digest our food -- but as it turns out, we need, or at least could use, parasites active in our system to give certain immune responses something to do. Absent of real threats, our immune system will happily turn on us, causing various diseases and disorders. We forget how utterly alien the civilized world is to bodies which evolved in the world, becoming geared to compete and strive and fight, to cope with famine and stress.No man is an island, nor is any species. The interactions between species -- as foes, as friends -- drive evolution, giving pronghorns and cheetahs faster legs to outrun the other, and avocado fruits larger volume to attract animals with larger appetites. Humans, in spite of our tendency to view ourselves as separate from the 'animal world', are no different in being shaped by others. Not only have our appearances changed because of relations with other species, but part of our emotional life and even our aesthetic senses have ties to ecology. Take taste, for instance: it's no coincident that fruit bearing seed ready to germinate tastes delightful, while unripe fruits -- those with seeds still readying themselves -- taste bitter. The bitterness is the plant's way of keeping hungry foragers from forcing the seeds into the world before their time. Other species have shaped not only human bodies, but human civilization -- take the lactose-tolerance that prevails in pastoral societies, and the way grasses and cattle have prospered by becoming the staple of many civilizations. This is popular science at its best: insightful, with lessons that apply across the whole of human existence, and enterprisingly written to boot. The implications for medicine are especially worth considering, and the book as a whole reminds of the law of unintended consequences.Related:Guns, Germs, and Steel; Jared DiamondWhy We Get Sick: the New Science of Darwinian Medicine, Randolph M.

37,006180648X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4350004-josh-hamacher,4,"This book really wasn't what I was expecting. I had expected it to primarily be about our internal flora and fauna, the creatures living in and on us. Probably this was my own misunderstanding, and in reality this book is far more interesting than that.It's actually about how no species develops in a vacuum. This seems obvious - the environment in which a species lives impacts its development, of course, and vice versa. But there are many different aspects to this interaction, the vast majority of which the average person probably hasn't considered (or at least I certainly hadn't).For example, there's a correlation between the acuity of vision displayed by species of monkeys and how many poisonous snakes there are in a region. Poisonous snakes are actually a pretty serious threat and are hard to detect by any means other than eyesight, so monkeys that developed in areas with many poisonous snakes tend to develop full-color, sharp vision.Each chapter was short and most contained numerous such examples, illustrating the larger theme of how a species is a product of its history and environment. It really was a fascinating read.But the chapters didn't really flow; there is no central narrative thread running through the book. It was almost as if Dunn was simply looking for an excuse to list out a bunch of really cool things that modern evolutionary biologists have discovered or are currently exploring.If that was my only complaint, this probably still would have been a five-star book just for the number of moments I sat back and thought ""ah, that makes sense now that I think about it"" or even ""wow, that is totally cool"". But I have another major complaint - this book desperately needed an editor.Some of the chapters read more like a first drafts than something ready for publication. There are no glaring spelling errors and the number of grammatical errors is fairly low (although there are at least two instances of ""this happened a 120 million years ago"", e.g., that were particularly jarring). What was particularly annoying, however, was the level of repetition in some chapters. Good editing probably could have cut twenty or thirty pages out of this book and, crucially, made it a coherent whole rather than a series of semi-independent chapters."
38,006180648X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/278063-kurt,3,"There is much to be fascinated by in Rob Dunn's THE WILD LIFE OF OUR BODIES. Learning how our bodies have evolved over time to not only accept other life forms living within us but to depend on their existence to maintain our health--and also that the ridding of them from our bodies is likely leading to the growth of such 20th/21st century centric illnesses as Crohn's disease which is virtually unknown in ""underdeveloped"" countries where modern health runs less rampant. It's not that the worms and parasites and bacteria are always doing something positive, often it is simply that over the last 200,000 years, our bodies have adapted to their existence. When these squatters are booted out, the body turns on itself fighting something that is no longer there. Other parts of the book delve into the surprising importance of the generally ignored appendix, what exactly a Pronghorn is and why it doesn't fit in nature and the story of Jasper Lawrence who reintroduces hookworms into the bodies of Crohn's sufferers for a reasonable fee. All are quite interesting. The problem is that the interesting parts of this book are often islands surrounded by digressions and repetitions and some just flat dead ends. I understand that there are many things we don't know, and it's interesting how much we don't know, but I don't have to be told page after page that we don't know something. I am all about digressions. One of my favorite books, Mailer's THE EXECUTIONER'S SONG is almost entirely digressions from the narrative. Dunn often digresses simply to restate something already stated. He was much better while actually discussing the bugs in the belly, but once he wonders onto other topics he lets loose the reins of discipline. In fact, the first time I started this book I stopped because the entire first chapter is a digression. A digression from what I am not sure--possibly the title. These irritations aside I am still glad I read this--it is fascinating how much is going on right this moment that can't begin to catalog. "
39,006180648X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/434102-josephine,3,"This book wasn't quite what I was expecting. It turned out to be all about evolution and how what we used to be (like millions of years ago, even when we were fish...) shapes what we are today.The first section is about worms and how we evolved to need them as much as they need us. I was disappointed in this section because I didn't think the author gave enough information and evidence. He sited a couple cases of people who were cured of their chrohns disease by infecting themselves with tapeworm, but it only put the chrohns into remission until the worm died and then they needed to get a new worm. It talked about a clinic in Mexico that specializes in infecting people with worms. The best part is that this man breeds the worms from his own worms inside of him. In other words, he passes (poops out) the eggs and then shares them with others, and gets paid big money to do it. I hope I never have an autoimmune disease that causes me such desperation that I would be willing to seek out that kind of a treatment, but I can sympathize with those who are. What was missing in this section though was more info about the worms. What are their negative side effects? He mentions that there are negatives, but never says exactly what. He sites these few instances of people being helped with the worms and he thinks that these few instances make it a fact that we all would be healthier with worms.Anyway, the rest of the sections ranged from interesting to eye rolling to downright depressing. I actually started to get a bit discouraged reading the book and almost gave up, but I'm glad I finished it because the last section was hopeful. I liked the ideas he gave at the end about new ways of producing food and better ways to sustain our growing population. I think it will just take some creativity.Overall it was an interesting read. A little bit wordy, but well written. I like to pick up scientific books every once in a while so I can feel smart and have something to discuss with my scientist husband, so this one was good for that."
40,006180648X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1061106-maura,4,"Fascinating! Rob Dunn does a wonderful job of explaining scientific principles, experiments and theories in a way that the everyday reader can easily follow. Basically, the book delves into why there seems to be an epidemic of certain diseases such as lupus, Crohn's, multiple sclerosis, and the like. The basic premise is that out bodies have spent many thousands of years adapting to and thriving in a more wild environment. Our more refined lifestyles of today leave our immune systems with little to do, but they are programmed to be busy. Just like the border collie that gets into trouble if it can't work at herding something, our immune system needs to be busy keeping parasites and microbes in balance. Without that work, it starts going after (reacting to) things it shouldn't, like our own body parts; hence, our auto-immune disorders. Panic attacks and anxiety are similarly explained as a result of twitchy senses that once saved us from predators. Now those reactions are out of proportion to the threats we generally do face in modern life.This book sort of gives that ""aha!"" moment, so much of it makes sense and it makes so many things fall into place. In particular, I think of the fact that after my dog died, my allergies got very much worse, which at the time did not make sense. If there were fewer allergens (no dog fur floating around), why did my allergies worsen? But it makes perfect sense according to this book. Since my immune system had less stuff to keep it busy, its reactions were too much for the allergen load it actually had to deal with; it had been programmed for several animals and couldn't dial it down when it only had to deal with one remaining animal. Interesting!"

This book was recommended to me on my local public library website so I decided to put it on hold and am I ever glad that I did.Part history lesson, part evolutionary tale, part story about relationships this book is a must for science nerds and health nuts alike. Germs, worms, bugs and critters have made us who we are today and as they change, so do we (and vice versa!). Our obsession with living a germ free lifestyle has had some serious and far reaching consequences, ones we haven't even begun to see the outcomes of yet.This book also talks about evolution and why some of our traits have come to be (or theories on why--the only thing the author could say for certain is that nobody is really 100% certain about most things), why our living relatives have similarities and differences, possibilities for the future for the both of us.I have been peppering my every day conversation with facts I have learned from this book since I picked it up, I like to think it makes me sound worldly and interesting (when in reality it probably makes me sound like a teenage kid who just discovered the internet). For someone that hasn't taken a science class in over 10 years it really awakened my interest in that and I'm definitely going to add some more books like this to my reading list."
42,006180648X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/161317-lia,4,"Humans have gone way ahead of other species, we are so successful in conquering nature, we want to live cut out from it. We begin by building settlements that keep everything nature outside. We also start killing other living creatures for no other reasons because we can. Inside our bodies, there is a belief that erasing everything is good. But it turns out, life and nature was never that simple. We have evolved for millions of years. Our body was shaped by everything in, out of and around it. We are shaped by predators, parasites and partners. Now, when we are trying to take out and erased everything, our body is missing their long time enemy/friends. Right now our body is chasing ghost and they turn against us.Because we clean every worms and other parasites in our gut, our immune system and antibody attack us instead. They see the enemies everywhere. Once, it was useful because enemies were everywhere. But when we obliterated the enemies, they began to attack their own self and they won't stop. There are new types of diseases that emerging in (especially) developed countries or affluent society when life is so pristine, it is vulnerable. Our body need their enemies and partners. We need nature. We cannot barricade our self against nature, because nature is inside of us. That is the message that this book and its author is trying to tell us. "
43,006180648X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5632471-carl,4,"The main theme of this book is the comparison between “what we were and what we are.” By what “we were”, the author takes a long evolutionary view: not just a few decades ago, not just when we were hunter-gatherers, not just when we were little primates, but back to when we were lizards. Over the millions of years we have collected a distressing amount of evolutionary baggage that influences “what we are” and sometimes conflicts with our modern world.The author gives quite a number of examples, which vary from fairly accepted views to highly speculative ideas. It seems to be accepted, as he points out, for instance, that our taste buds were evolved for world in which sugar and salt were hard-to-find. Our taste buds say “Oh yummy yummy, sugar and salt are wonderful! More sugar! More salt!” causing diabetes and high blood pressure.More speculative is the author’s belief that we have a built-in fear of snakes because of millions of years of experience by our ancestors. He makes the interesting suggestion that our visual system sends snake alerts to our unconscious, not waiting for dilly-dallying by our conscious mind.The most speculative suggestion, I thought, was that our ancestors had tape worms, so maybe they would help us under certain conditions."
44,006180648X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/19446286-elentarri,3,"This was an entertaining and extremely interesting book to read, but somewhat light on the actual science. The main idea covered in this book is that humans are in many cases over-designed because of the loss of species (parasites, predators, symbiotes) that helped to make us who we are today. This book covers a wide variety of topics that show the inter-relatedness of humans, their evolution and their environment, including parasites, predators and domesticated organisms. The author discusses (among other things) the possible causes of auto-immune disease (lack of parasites), the reasons for our hairlessness (trying to get rid of lice), the uses of the appendix, our past and present relationship with predators that may cause various anxiety issues and be responsible for our colour vision. The final section of the book discusses how humans could make city environments more like the environment we evolved in. I loved the ideas and hypotheses discussed in this book and the combination of different fields of science, I just with there was more science. If, on the other hand, you don't know too much about science, then you should read this entertaining and informative popular science book."

It is a series of ideas and theories strung together with stories. Here are some examples: intestinal parasites helping to cure IBS, asthma, and Crohnes; the use of our appendix; why our vision developed the way it did; our farming vs. that of ants; our subconscious responses to seeing a sick person. The list goes on. The journal sources are sited.""The information given is a bit staggering, and I like that the author summarizes a lot of science (and had the scientists edit those portions of his book). The content is fodder for many discussions on nature, evolution, health, the human body, too much to mention. The part about intestinal worms alone is worth the read and that is in the first section of the book.The only hard thing about this book is that it jumps around a bit and until the final page, I didn't quite understand the connection between all the studies.

47,006180648X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/731997-brian,3,"Dunn writes that many human ills and behaviors reflect the evolutionary past where we put ourselves above nature and all other species. Our super sterile environment is hurting us all by unbalancing our immune systems, leading to attacks on our own tissues rather than invading organisms. His solution is to repopulate the gut with worms that the immune system tolerates or that may suppress the system’s hyperactivity. Dunn writes that Crohn’s and other such disorders are rare wherever gut parasites are common. There is actually a cottage industry selling worm eggs. Some people have even travelled to go barefoot in a primitive latrine in hopes that worms will infect them to cure their autoimmune disorders. Other subjects he tackles is why some peoples can digest milk but the majority of the world cannot. What the appendix does and why is appendicitis rare in third world countries. How bugs lefts us hairless. Many interesting ideas are raised and discussed.

48,006180648X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2130032-daniel-r,4,"A delightful exploration of research around the evolution of the human body contrasted with how technological evolution maybe causing humans more harm than good. The book looks at the role of parasites in our gut, a new line of thinking about the purpose of the appendix, the impact of the introduction of agriculture, how our flight or fight response maybe harming us, and why humans lack hair. For each theme the author weaves a narrative of current research, his own observations, and anecdotal stories written with cliff hanger transitions. I found the first half of the book covering parasites, the appendix, and agriculture to be much better written and cohesive than the latter half which seemed to focus more on stories than science and didn't fit the wild life premise as well. Overall the writing is enjoyable, approachable, and presents many new theories and thoughts about our growing understanding of the evolution of the human body."
49,006180648X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/10929765-christine,5,"Interesting reading. I have a question for the author - If we lose most of our body hair (due to fleas, lice, etc) then why didn't apes and monkeys do the same? What really had griped my attention is that parasites in our intestines can help or harm us. We got rid of intestine parasites when we live cleanly (wearing shoes is one thing). This man had a really bad asthma and was totally dependent on Prednisone. He was left uninsured when he took a new job because of pre-existing condition. He visited his aunt in UK and his aunt mentioned about a BBC documentary on hookworms and diseases like asthma. He stayed up to research this and found research articles by Joel Weinstock and other scientists. After reading up on this research, he decided to get hookworms by walking barefoot in Cameroon arount laterines. Once he got infected by hookworms, his health (asthma and other problems) got better. I want to know if there is something for someone with type II diabetes!"
50,006180648X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6948763-susan,5,"This book was incredibly fun nonfiction to read. While of great interest to anyone with a bioscience bend, you don’t have to be scientifically minded to enjoy this book. Indeed, the concepts contained in this work are laid out for everyone to enjoy and access. In fact, Rob Dunn often waxes nearly poetic in his passion to imbue this book, and his readers, with knowledge. There are also many footnotes containing esoteric, yet highly amusing, information. For centuries, humans have tried to live apart from the world, cleaning, dousing, shaving, medicating away any other living organism on or near our pristine bodies. But perhaps that has not been the wisest course; after all, the human body, and it’s immune system, evolved over millennium to coexist with these little, microscopic organisms. In this book, this taboo subject is covered."
51,006180648X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7723314-steven,4,"The author delivers on the promise of the book description overall, but I couldn't give a full five stars on account of including areas where the research is still rather far from conclusive. If it had presented slightly differently, perhaps in the context of, ""this interesting research is being done suggestion such and such"" would have been better. Instead, those areas are dwelled upon somewhat extensively, in spite of their speculative nature. Considering the strength of the author's thesis, it seems like the author may have intentionally leaned towards newer research that might surprise and titillate readers, rather than focusing on areas where there is already more scientific consensus.That being said, this is a great book overall, I learned a ton, and I recommend it for anyone interested in anatomy or human evolution."
52,006180648X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6614224-sara-van-dyck,4,"Granted, Dunn’s book is popular science, and he often gets carried away in drawing inferences from research results. But he has done a great job of making microbiology relevant, understandable, and readable, although I would not suggest perusing this book while you are eating dinner. One value in his book is the way he starts out with a question – for instance, why on earth do we still have an appendix? – and follows through various lines of research, explaining how scientists have investigated a topic. It is interesting to see how often clues come from looking at other creatures, other primates, other cultures, even other times. I would recommend this book not so much for basic information on immunology, but as a broad view showing how evolutionary biologists trace through a basis for many of our body processes and illnesses today"
53,006180648X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2168812-jileen,2,"I really tried to give this book a chance. I was fascinated with the idea of symbiotic relationships of parasites and other creepy crawlies on us and within us that help us function, be healthy, and live better. But when the author began the book by suggesting that I look at my husband lying asleep and observe his evolutionized claws and straightened spine I became a bit less excited. I could only get to chapter 3. When I read about the guy who walked barefoot through the feces of hookworm infected people in Cameroon to cure his asthma I had to hang it up. And evolution was crammed.down.my.throat at every turn. Whether or not you believe in evolution is not the problem here. This book and the author's arguments were put together so poorly. A case study of one person healed by something is not very convincing. Maybe there was more to the book... but I will probably never find out."
54,006180648X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6142535-michelle,5,"Interesting book that describes new theories about how various aspects of our bodies evolved to expect the presence of certain species, and what happens now that in our modern society, those species are taken away. The thesis is a fascinating one, suggesting among other things that the appendix is not as useless as we might expect, a new figurative interpretation of the story of Eve and the serpent, and that we should be reintroducing (not the really bad) parasites into our guts to avoid inflammatory bowel disease. Dunn's writing is excellent, although he tends to be a little too flowery and expansive in some places for my tastes, but otherwise he's wonderfully evocative and persuasive. 5 stars."
55,006180648X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4663399-michael-alexander,4,"This book had a number of ideas in it that I found quite fascinating. From using to parasitic worms to treat diseases, to theories on the reason we have an appendix, to how humans being hunted by large cats in the past affects us today. The book is well paced and laid out, and quite easy to follow and understand. The author doesn't go into deep detail about things like how the immune system works, because it isn't really necessary for what he's trying to get across. I would have liked some more of that detail, but like I said, it isn't really necessary. I believe the fact that I'm currently taking a class on parasitology increased my enjoyment of this book, but it is still a good read otherwise."

I found the author’s obvious enthusiasm for his subject matter engaging.What eventually drove me crazy, however, was his insatiable appetite for parenthetical phrases. It irritated me the point of distraction, and I found myself playing with the phrasing instead of focusing on his point.Opening to a random page: “All of this would have triggered a rush of superpowered energy and awareness and, secondarily, a sensation of fear, a sensation meant to trigger a later, more considered, response.”Every freaking thought, is embellished, with a generous, sprinkle, of commas. I blame the editor more than the author."

Was moving from being hunter-gatherers to farmers (while probably a necessity at the time) a really dumb thing to do? Did we evolve from cliffdwellers and if so will going back to a version of that cure some of our ills? So thought provoking and just good reading. Highly recommended."

Too many stories similar to a documentary and too little science in explaining things. From the title I was expecting deeper insight and much more scientific explanations. I liked several parts in the book and I agreed with the author when he says that modern humans started killing nature which was long ago a source of survival. I also liked the point he made about medicine that it help diseases but it is never questioned and researched about the bad things and the negative effects it has on our cells and digestive system.

62,006180648X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/17480837-mary,3,I give the book high marks for chapters that deal with the bacteria in our guts that is well researched but many of the other chapters are entirely speculative. They are perhaps intriguing but not particularly scientific. There is also a tendency to repetition and redundancy within chapters rather than well supported research. Dunn introduces us to the possibility that we have not done a very good job as a species in understanding our relationship to the small creatures that live on and in us and we would do well to focus some scientific energy and money in this direction.
63,006180648X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/312898-ben,2,"The title & synopsis were misleading; I was hoping for a tour of human internal microbiology, something I didn't know about our ""parasites & partners"", but it focused almost entirely on a single ""they don't want you to know"" experimental treatment- the treatment of Crohn's with gut nematodes. Some of the discussion of hygiene theory was great, but I was surprised at how it stuck on nematodes for Crohn's. Kinda weak."
64,006180648X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/975391-steven,4,"Although I expected this book to be filled with little-known facts about how this or that creature has molded our lives (and it is), it's really more of a big picture overview. Dunn brings to light recent theories of how we have evolved (or not!) in reaction to other lifeforms, both around and within us. I was most drawn to the sections describing how our senses, and our brains in general, developed in reaction to the most prominent predators of our species' early development. "
65,006180648X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/37969461-erica-orcutt,4,"I found this book to be extremely interesting. It looked at human interactions with other species, and the consequences of such, with a broad lens. While the science for some may be a bit ""dumbed down"" I enjoyed it more for the big picture aspect. I will probably look up some of the specific studies to go more in depth with the science, but as a popular science book for a lay audience, I thought it was wonderful and thought-provoking"
66,006180648X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1312257-colleen,4,"Entertaining, as long as you remember to take it with a grain of salt. The author repeatedly states that much of what he presents has not yet had adequate research to back it up, but he does so in such a way that readers are likely to embrace all the ideas in the book. Understandably, some people object to the idea of encouraging people to allow themselves to be parasitized by people without a medical degree, but the warnings are there.ALl in all a stimulating and fun book"
67,006180648X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1096980-benjamin,4,"Super super interesting, but it had way more about anthropology and evolutionary history that I expected. The evolution of pronghorn traits was a good allegory (and an excuse to read about giant ice age mammals!). And that ""useless"" appendix we all have is for storing gut microbes in case our intestines get cleaned out!What font is this in, the lower case t's are too small."
68,006180648X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1470356-paul-busch,5,"Rob Dunn is a popular biologist (i.e., he tries to make biology accessible and interesting to those of us not versed in biology). His writing style is engaging and entertaining. He is a story-teller, weaving connected stories througout the book. The book is thought-provoking as well as entertaining. I'm going to read his previous book now too."
69,006180648X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4657558-jennifer,4,I thought this book was well-written and thought-provoking. I was a little annoyed at times because I felt like he just started randomly talking about unrelated things but the topics always ended up being relevant. I'm not sure I necessarily agree with all of the hypotheses discussed in the book but I still found the ideas behind them intriguing.
70,006180648X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5555569-marilyn,5,"Read in my Kindle, this book is now full of bright yellow highlights. I shall easily revisit the many well reasoned 'ah ha' revelations again. Fascinating stuff to share with friends during conversation lulls. It's changed the way I think about who we are and why. This would make an interesting TV mini-series."
71,006180648X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/436816-jen,5,"This book is great for teaching people how evolution has shaped our bodies and behavior. Highly recommended for anyone with even a mild interest in biology. Ecology, evolution, anatomy, it's all there!I would warn against taking everything in the book as the ""Gospel Truth"" as a lot of it is pretty new and not well accepted. Still, it's a great read!"
72,006180648X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6207049-lynda,5,"This was such a good book I only read a few pages at a time. It was like a delicious drink that I wanted to savor on a hot summer's day. Dunn shares how we need ""bugs"" and dirt in our lives. He gives interesting insights on how inch worms may help persons with auto immune diseases go back into remission. The appendix is explained and so much more. I highly recommend this book."
73,006180648X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/38835065-kirsten-surdej,4,"A super interesting book! Gets a little dense at times, particularly if you lack a background in biology or ecology, but the author does a good job translating technical jargon into understandable science. The second to last chapter about diseases, xenophobia, and our behavioral immune system was particularly fascinating!!"
74,006180648X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2168871-indu,4,"Very interesting ideas discussed here. The initial few chapters were a little too scientific than I cared for, but interesting all the same. After that, each and every chapter in the book was exactly on topics that I was keen to know about. The content in those chapters was fascinating to read and assimilate. Definitely a worthy read. "
75,006180648X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2074446-rick-jones,2,"Some really great ideas and people in here, it's too bad the author doesn't recognize the difference between conjecture and research. There are so many phrases like ""It isn't a stretch to think that.."" or ""Certainly one can assume that..."" He is so eager to make his case that he forgets that we aren't friends and he needs to treat the reader like an adult. "
76,006180648X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/17321118-sterling-woodruff,5,"Some of the other readers complained that the book was ""dumbed down"". Well, duh! It wasn't meant for macro biologists to read. They have textbooks. This well written book is for regular (non-scientist) readers who want to broaden their knowledge. I this this is an excellent book, and as a teacher I will encourage others to as well."
77,006180648X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/973925-jim-witkins,3,"Left me with more questions than answers, but the ideas raised are fascinating and deserve more scientific study. University of Wisconsin researchers earn a few shout outs too, which I always enjoy. Not for the squeamish. "
78,006180648X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1222919-david,3,"A good introduction to a promising revolution in the way we look at the relationship between our bodies and other creatures. We not only could not live without them but also we could not live without them within us: bacteria, parasites, etc."
79,006180648X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1166748-mj,5,"I've always thought that our present bodies and minds are shaped by our past...waaaay past and Rob Dunn brings together research from various scientific fields to show how this is so. Necessarily definitive? No. But lots of food for thought? Yes! And not only that, but he has a sense of humor."
80,006180648X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4966959-heather,3,"For some reason, I was put off by Rob Dunn's writing style in the first chapter or two, but I enjoyed the later chapters more. As some other reviewers noted, the book is not just about critters that inhabit our bodies, but other animals (predators, etc.) who have influenced our evolution."
81,006180648X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4669297-jack,3,"A fun non-fiction read for people who enjoy quirky infomation. Somehow he manages to tie to together a lot of disparate information into a good read. After reading this, I can know say I know what the purpose of our appendix is (discovered by two Duke researchers!!). "
82,006180648X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1557229-dianne,4,"Again, a good heavy browse rather than complete read....an accessible biology book of the multitudes of critters who coexist in our bodies. Rob Dunn is a ""rising star in popular science journalism"" - keep an eye out for his magazine articles as well."
83,006180648X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/20351778-trinity-school-summer-reading,0,"In our drive to sanitize our environment, we have killed off too many internal microsymbiotic bacteria that have helped us for ages. In many cases we don’t know how they have helped us, but it’s time to bring them back, argues Rob Dunn."
84,006180648X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2366294-danielle-t,4,"Food for thought re: ecological ghosts in our system and our symbiotic relationships (not to mention how we've shaped other species re: agriculture, etc.) Pop sci for sure, but sources are all in the end notes. "
85,006180648X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/14957997-michael-blackmore,5,"Loved it. Just a fascinating topic exploring how we are a community of life in our bodies and are shaped by our interactions with other species be they cooperative, parasitic or predator/prey. Lots of food for thought.So definitely recommended."
86,006180648X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2924431-pam-porter,4,Very interesting book about the relationships between humans and both the organisms inside of us and in the environment around us. The birth of scientifically unique ideas regarding these relationships is woven throughout the evolutionary history of mankind.
87,006180648X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2493683-angela-boord,3,"Mostly in the vein of ""humans are no different than ants"", with some interesting but a little wacko (possibly true, I wasn't convinced but am not unconvinced either) stuff about hookworms being beneficial for digestive disorders."
88,006180648X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5482608-john,3,"Amazing look at the human we really have become and what we used to be. However, the studies of beneficial parasites is not present but only hinted at. There was so much that this book left out which would have made it fit for any beginning biology student."
89,006180648X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/8094144-deborah,3,"I liked The first two chapters the best. The rest was very informative, and interesting. The book does not lie says it will tell you how we may have been influenced by parasites. I guess, I was expecting a little bit more current interaction."
