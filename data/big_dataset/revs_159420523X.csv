0,159420523X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/25224653-jengordon,2,"I read a lot of ""Prepper"" books, and in general, a lot of apocalyptic literature. This one was a quick read, because it sucked. Dartnell had the kernel of a good idea, but then lost steam about 50 pages into the book, and what he filled the remaining 250 with was a stretch.Good points: explaining how to get certain base-material chemicals from natural sources. Bad points: he did not think deeply about what were the critical, enabling, technologies for ""rebooting"" (his term) life. He assumes that today's technology and standard of living is something we should strive to re-create, without asking about technical priorities, or indeed, about how to set up social structures to perpetuate a decent standard of living. What good does it do to tell me about what a proper harness for a horse looks like, if I haven't been told how to keep horses alive in the first place? It's great that hickory is a good wood for making gears and elm for making wagon wheels, but how many 21st century urbanites can tell hickory from elm from maple? Can you? And why tell me that forceps can be useful in delivery of a baby, without telling me anything about the basics of normal midwifery? Why try to tell me about electric cars (after society has fallen apart) being a more effective useable-energy-per-acre use of biofuels once you've told me that by the time we get to that point, the roads will be in a state of disrepair so as to make them useless?I'm tempted to re-write his reboot. Start from a realistic assumption about what the world is like, and who my audience is. Are they living in a post-pandemic Boston in 2050? Great. What's the climate? What input materials are they likely to have? Can they really scavenge so much from grocery stores in this scenario, since pandemic (say, flu) isn't going to kill off everyone overnight? The moribund living will be eating the canned goods, leaving the survivors with nothing... OK, so I find myself in 2050 Boston, with a growing season that now runs from (date) to (date), annual rainfall of x, and the following animal/plant/insect hazards. I've gathered a commune full of survivors, and we've set up a social structure (which one? what has succeeded in the past for groups like this?) and found a way to defend ourselves against other groups. What are our scavenging priorities? (Hint: don't tell me how to make fertilizer. Tell me to locate and stockpile it so I have years of it to work with! Tell me what seeds to find and preserve -- and how to preserve them!) How do I manage birth control? What books from the library should I make it a priority to rescue before the building starts leaking and the rats start nesting in the books? What resources should I scavenge -- from what museums (what museums have working spinning wheels? looms?) -- and/or take over? What standard of living should I shoot for? What was available in 1400? 1600? 1800? And tell me what they knew at that time. Don't tell me how to build a radio. Tell me how to keep sheep alive.This book has a tantalizing title but disappointing contents, because while it's clear the author knows a lot, he didn't think very much."
1,159420523X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5448792-b-schrodinger,5,"Thank you to both Netgalley and Random House UK for an advance reader copy in exchange for an honest review. If someone came up to me and said ""Hi, here is an instruction manual to rebuild civilisation after collapse. You're welcome!"" guess how I'd react. There would be sarcasm and the little wizened skeptic that lives in my head would be having a field day. And I did approach this volume with an amount of skepticism. How can you boil down all of civilisation into one 250 page volume?Being a fan of post-apocalyptic fiction I am no stranger to the thought experiment. The first 'grown-up' book I ever read was John Wyndham's 'Day of the Triffids'. My older sister was assigned this novel to read in high school and complained about a stupid novel in which stupid plants come to life and kill everyone. Not ideal for a thirteen year old girl, ideal for a eleven year old boy. Ever since then I have had a soft spot for apocalyptic fiction with stand-out favourites being 'Earth Abides', 'The Walking Dead' comics and the other works of Wyndham. So I have been part of this thought experiment for a while now.And as my education has furthered into the sciences and gone into research, my environmentalism has increased and the knowledge of human activity with respect to the stability of the climate has caused these thought experiments to become more of a possible future reality. I believe it is within the realm of possibility that civilisation as we know it could collapse during my lifetime. The more I learn, the more I realise it would not take much at all to tip the scales into a decline in drastic decline in living standards.It's obvious that Lewis has thought extensively on this also. But he is infinitely more talented and had set himself the task to write an instruction manual to reboot civilisation. And despite approaching this work with complete skepticism, I come out the other side amazed and completely humbled by this work and it's author. Lewis has achieved exactly what he has set out to do. This is a work that I would want in my hands in an apocalypse. The irony being that I have read this reviewer copy as an e-book, the most inaccessible method of transmission of data in a coming apocalypse. A part of me even feels that paper might not be robust enough nor last long enough to hold this wisdom. I'd sleep better at night knowing that this was reproduced in stone buried in a sealed crypt somewhere far from any cities.What Lewis offers isn't a complete set of instructions (but some methods are described in great detail), but rather an overview of differing technologies such as agriculture, food preservation, basic and advanced chemistry, communications and more with specific methods and examples of the history of certain technologies and how to reboot these technologies from scratch. And Lewis admits that reproducing the historical progression of science and technology is not the most efficient reboot scenario, and that just having certain knowledge can hopefully leapfrog past certain stages and methods. He even suggests that several technologies that were adopted were inferior to abandoned competitors in hindsight and that a new civilisation should take advantage of this hindsight.Lewis' writing is succinct,accurate and informative. His ability to refine a concept down to one or two sentences that manages to convey exactly how a thing works and why it does what it does is astounding. This is what all educators and science communicators strive for and it seems like he as a great talent. When he was explaining concepts that I have previously learnt I was amazed at the clarity of which he would convey the ideas. How easily can you explain how refrigerators work using the laws if thermodynamics?What Lewis presents is truly an astounding work that actually does have the potential to achieve what it set out to do. I'd recommend this book for not only any post-apocalyptic fan, but anyone interested in science, technology and any curious person who likes to know why things work. I am now an instant fan of Lewis' and I look forward to the publication of this book in April 2014. I'll at least be buying a paper copy."
2,159420523X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2976142-thomas-edmund,4,"This book is going to need two reviews:The first – would I want this book to be in my library should the world end? I’m afraid the answer is no. while certainly this book is cleverly researched, packed with information, and the subject matter carefully chosen (or at least with some sort of system, apparently there is a website.) Equally I realized that there was no well in hell I was going to be able to do any of this stuff. For example I have no doubt the chemistry has been meticulously researched, I just cannot fathom successfully conducting most if not all of the procedures listed in this book. I loved the way Dartnell offhandedly pointed out that some of the phosphorus reactions would in fact be poisonous (he did not however describe how to make a fume hub or gas-mask.)In short if this was to be the book I was left with in the apocalypse I would desperately hope for a whole library of practical advice also, as at best I would use The Knowledge as a reference for what to start looking into.The second (don’t worry this one is better)As a book of general knowledge with an intriguing take, I actually enjoyed it. As long as I cast aside a nagging feeling that if the end of the world were to strike, I would be very doomed, I found trawling through The Knowledge to be a lot of fun. Part of the reason that I liked the book but wouldn’t want it as a doomsday guide, is that Dartnell couldn’t seem to resist delving into the history of technological development which while relevant from a general interest point of view, I wouldn’t be keen to trawl in the disaster scenario.In summary I liked this book, just as a casual read, not as actual doom-preparation "
3,159420523X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/16212136-peter-pete-mcloughlin,4,"You find yourself and a band of others the survivors of a Charleton Heston like apocalypse. You are the last people on earth. How do you rebuild. If infrastructure hasn't been demolished you have a grace period where you can scavenge of the corpse of the old world but pretty soon you and the other survivors will have to restart civilization. None of us in the modern world can single handedly produce a pencil not to mention an iPhone. This book presents the hardy survivor of a holocaust a way to build your own civilization from the ruins. Be warned it won't be nearly as fun as a video game. The first part gives tips on how scavenge from the old world as it crumbles away and progresses on to tell you how to restart agriculture, relearn metallurgy, learn how to make simple machines and equipment, begin to provide medicine, start producing power. In other words it holds the important shortcuts learned from millennia of wrong turns and dead ends to go from being pretty much a hunter and gatherer to a industrial civilization. It is a nice emergency book to have in case of the apocalypse but frankly makes for some grim reading."
4,159420523X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/37541875-beth,4,"This book is absolutely hilarious. It’s not meant to be but it is. Published in 2015, it is a handbook for rebuilding civilization after, say, an asteroid strike, a solar flare, a nuclear war, or – let’s think – a catastrophic pandemic. In fact, Dartnell envisages a pandemic with a rapid-onset mortality of 80% such that survivors would have to leave urban areas to avoid the stench and contamination of all those dead bodies. Fortunately, we’re not quite at that stage in the current situation, so no need to hastily pack up the car just yet.What was I expecting? Well, something about finding shelter, gathering and growing food, finding clean water, and generally battening down with a lot of tinned beans and the last of the world’s toilet rolls. And it’s in there but Dartnell is way ahead of this.This is how to “reboot agriculture” by remaking 18th century farm equipment from the iron that you’ve just smelted from ore because there’s no more diesel for the combine harvesters. Instructions for making your own clothes include those for sheep-shearing and building a loom from the trees you’ve just chopped down. While you’re at it, build a water wheel to mill grain and generate electricity. There are diagrams of rudimentary foundries, metal lathes, the internal combustion engine and birthing forceps along with descriptions of fore-and aft sails, hulls and keels. How to make paper from rags; how to remake a Guttenberg press; how to make crockery from clay and all sorts of useful chemicals from limestone. It is completely bonkers.Frankly, most of us stripped of our central heating, supermarkets, cars, smart phones and high street fast fashion would be as helpless as kittens. I, for one, wouldn’t know lumps of iron-ore or limestone if they followed me round the garden. But if ‘all this’ gets this bad and we find ourselves heading for the hills, I might just stick this book in my pocket. Because, you know, just in case. "
5,159420523X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5276276-juliana,5,I picked this up after reading Station Eleven a fictional account of a group of global Pandemic survivors. It is essentially a how-to book on what you need to know in order to survive and reboot our world if that Pandemic or other event happens. As a former editor for how-to technology books I give this five stars. It is practical and accessible. Reading it now--you learn alot of what makes our current world work. 
6,159420523X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/147289-jason-pettus,5,"I admit, I'm a junkie for those YouTube channels that examine the complex modern world by attempting to deconstruct modern products back to their humble beginnings; you know, like that dude who tried to make a business suit by breeding his own silk moths, shearing a sheep himself, and learning how to use a Victorian spinning wheel and a hand-powered loom. (Seriously, his channel is so interesting.)Lewis Dartnell's The Knowledge: How to Rebuild Our World From Scratch fits exactly into this wheelhouse, premised around an intriguing question: Is it possible to write a single 300-page book that would let a post-apocalyptic society build itself back up into a modern state, including re-learning surgery, industrialized agriculture, the internal combustion engine, and a lot more? Although he doesn't quite succeed (he basically cheats by devoting the last chapter to the scientific method, as a catch-all for everything else he couldn't cover), the attempt itself is fascinating, a shrewd plain-language look at the absolute basic building blocks that have eventually led us humans to complex chemistry, vulcanized rubber, distributed electricity and more, along with guides to how people in Classical and Medieval societies first discovered how to create these things themselves out of such natural material as trees and rocks. Granted, it's not a book to rush through, or else it'll get tedious to the point of giving up before you reach the end; but it's a fantastic bathroom book to read for ten minutes at a stretch, a manuscript that will get you thinking deeply about so many of the consumer goods in our modern society we take for granted. It comes recommended to one and all in this inventive spirit.UPDATE: After reading other people's reviews here, I'm dismayed at how many people gave this book a bad score based entirely on their opinion that ""THIS PLAN WOULDN'T ACTUALLY WORK AT ALL!"" or ""WE SHOULDN'T REBUILD SOCIETY TO ITS FORMER STATE IN THE FIRST PLACE!"" These people grossly misunderstood the entire point of this book, which is to take a fascinating look at how these scientific principles and industrial developments came about in the first place, how people like the Romans literally learned about complex chemistry using nothing but trees and rocks and ash, and why therefore it's entirely possible for humans to learn them again from the same material. What it's not is an actual realistic science-fiction step-by-step plan, and what it's also not is Dartnell's opinions about our modern world, and it's incredibly unfair that this book's score has been lowered by reviewers too narrow-minded to understand this. As a former publisher myself, it incenses me when a book gets an unfairly low score merely from readers who couldn't understand what the book's point was in the first place, much like if you gave Jane Eyre one star because it didn't have any zombies. (""I for one can't even see the point of reading Victorian literature if it doesn't contain supernatural battles! THUMBS DOWN!!!"") Please, people, at least try to be a little smarter than this when it comes to reviewing books."
7,159420523X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/19472134-robert-morris,5,"This book was delightful. I am a big humanities history guy. Unfortunately I've got a bit of a mental block when it comes to science. The second somebody starts describing the details of chemistry or engineering I just kind of tune out. What Mr. Dartnell has achieved here is an excellent way to draw people like me into a broader understanding of our technological civilization. The premise is simple. He doesn't spend too much time on the details, but he imagines a complete societal collapse. What would happen then? How would we rebuild? As a apocalypse nerd I found the premise irresistible enough to pick it up at an airport in Malta. Dartnell then stealthily drew me into a detailed history of science and engineering, with a strong emphasis on the world's chemical underpinnings. I must confess that I didn't follow all of it, but when I took the time to walk through his explanations, I got a ton out of them. The degree to which we are completely dependent on modern chemistry to sustain ourselves was something I was always aware of, but this book has done an excellent job of fleshing out that understanding. The central importance of certain fertilizers in carrying about a quarter of us was something that was made chillingly clear. If the worst comes, who knows, this book could well be what's needed to re-start things. Regardless, I know I will benefit from a re-reading at some point. Most of my finished books get passed on, but I think I'll be holding on to this one for a while. "
8,159420523X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/9628169-charles-j,3,"“The Knowledge” is meant as an assist to the human race. But to properly aid the human race, in a post-apocalypse future, two things are required. One is technical knowledge. The other is an understanding of the human race. Lewis Dartnell here offers technical knowledge, but he limits it to knowledge useful for “peaceful coexistence.” Given that violence is an inherent part of humans, which Dartnell seems to not understand, that limitation sharply diminishes the usefulness of his book.Dartnell covers every relevant general category of knowledge: agriculture, food/clothing; substances (lime, soap, etc.); materials (clay, glass, etc.); medicine; power; transport; communication; chemistry; and reckoning of time and place. Most of these are well covered, if necessarily only briefly. But Dartnell studiously ignores what’s first necessary to make any of these possible to obtain and maintain: weaponry. If history teaches us anything, it’s that substantial numbers of survivors would choose to prey on other survivors. How the non-prey would defend themselves would be the very first order of business—certainly long before, say, photography, a subject Dartnell covers in detail.Dartnell has thought a great deal about the technical aspects of how humans might “reboot” society. Dartnell limits his apocalypse to catastrophic events that kill most people while leaving infrastructure intact, leaving a “grace period” in which survivors can loot the bones of the former civilization, and for a time even use dying technology like cars and solar panels. He explicitly believes that survivors will leave the cities and form wholly peaceful communities striving to recapture past knowledge, perhaps with an assist from his book. But again, the problem is that other than in technical application of scientific principles, Dartnell seems to be ignorant of how humans act in real life—how they’ve acted in history and how they will inevitably act in the future. Which is, by killing each other.Why Dartnell does not cover weapons is fairly obvious. He omits any discussion of weapons, for any purpose at all, for ideological reasons—either because he thinks they’re icky or he believes we should give peace a chance. He even goes into great detail about crops as a food source, and omits any mention of hunting for food, except for an oblique mention of butchering (no details on that, of course). No guns, no spears, no bows and arrows, no traps. No stockades, no tiger pits, no abbatis. When the predators swarm into your camp, that’s the “Knowledge” that you’ll want, not how to use Barnard’s Star to calculate what year it is.And it’s not like Dartnell ran out of space. He even discusses how to create gunpowder, but mandates it only be used for peaceful uses, and naturally declines any instructions on how to create new cartridges for the hundreds of millions of firearms that would survive his type of posited collapse. Dartnell admits, that “You might think that explosives are exactly the sort of technology you would want to leave out of a manual for rebooting civilization, to prolong peaceful coexistence as long as possible.” This is ludicrous. Peaceful coexistence will last in the apocalypse exactly zero seconds. When people aren’t busy trying to make explosives, they’re going to be busy making mustard gas.But let’s say that Dartnell doesn’t want to turn this into a firearms manual like so much “prepper” literature. That’s understandable, and in any case Dartnell clearly envisions a time when former technology, whether cars or guns, no longer works. Or maybe this was a disarmed society lacking guns (though the UK, where Dartnell writes, has enormous amounts of guns, both illegal ones and ones in military hands, that would be immediately “redistributed” post-apocalypse). In that case, the use of basic metallurgy (which Dartnell covers) to create spears, arrowheads, daggers and swords would be critical to enable any community to defend itself. But Dartnell envisions peaceful souls all living in egalitarian harmony as they rebuild the world, so no mention of such unpleasant things sullies his book.Also, these peaceful souls will spend their time loving animals, not hunting and eating them. In one place, Dartnell grudgingly admits that rebuilding medicine “may also call for disagreeable practices like animal testing.” I’m pretty sure the inhabitants of post-apocalyptic Earth won’t be much concerned with animal welfare, other than preparatory to their consumption.Perhaps, one thinks, this is all a brain freeze by Dartnell, and he has subsequently realized that lack of discussion about weaponry creates a huge gap in his book. Nope. Since 2014, when this book was published, Dartnell has maintained a website, which has extensive discussion organized by month. Searching that entire website leads to exactly two results for “weapons”—one in a reference to “Doomsday Preppers,” without actual discussion of weapons, and the other in the famous (and dumb) quote by Einstein about World War IV. Searching for “firearm,” “gun,” “sword” or “spear”? Result: “Nothing Found.” I find it very hard to believe I am the first to point this omission out to Dartnell, so it must be a deliberate choice.“The Knowledge” aims at an interesting goal—being a seed for a post-apocalyptic rebirth of society, containing key knowledge to restart society. By itself, it’s not much of a seed, since the actual how-to knowledge it contains is limited, and it assumes the ability to perform various scientific techniques that in reality might not be simple to perform. I don’t fault Dartnell for that. This book is certainly better than nothing as a manual for rebooting our society. However, Dartnell’s own criterion for inclusion of knowledge in this book is “I’ve tried to include as much as I think would be absolutely indispensable knowledge for rebooting.” Anyone who thinks weapons and defensive tools aren’t the most indispensable knowledge of all is a simpleton. Failure to include such knowledge, given Dartnell’s declared goals, is criminal negligence."
9,159420523X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/9116131-stephen,2,"I have to admit that I struggled to read this book. It's not very engaging or well written. In many cases it reads like one of those science text books that I hated when I was at school. However, despite this, it does have an interesting premise, even though I consider it to be flawed. The premise is that the population of the United Kingdom (and elsewhere) is largely killed off by some unspecified catastrophe. Of the 65,000,000 inhabitants of the UK, only 10,000 remain. How do the survivors rebuild the UK to a standard of technology broadly similar to that of today? The book seeks to answer that question.I think that I didn't really get past the objection of why one would want to rebuild the UK to a standard of technology broadly similar to that of today. Surely a catastrophe such as that would present an opportunity to make a fresh start? If we could rebuild our civilisation, would we want to reignite naked consumerism? Would we pass the chance of replacing maximisation with enoughness? Would we want to avoid the mistakes we made the first time around? I remain very unconvinced by the central premise that a recovering society would be foolish enough to follow the path that we have created for ourselves.In considering this, I was impressed by the scale of the task. The task needs to be scaled in both time and space. The population density of the UK is currently about 0.0037 km2 per person. After the catastrophe described (but unspecified), the density would change to 24.3 km2 per person - roughly a box of 5 km by 5 km per person. There is a step whereby the survivors find each other and form a viable small community before a combination of hunger and thirst starts to impose themselves on the new death rate.This is where it is vitally important to specify the nature of the catastrophe. Will all of the land be equally accessible and free from contamination? Will there be the remnants of a plague like event that keeps people apart? How much damage has been caused to our current infrastructure? What will continue to be usable? If we assume away these issues - as the book does - then we are overlooking a number of key factors that could affect our ability to rebuild our society, even if we wanted to.This is where time comes into play. If we assume a population that doubles in each generation (each couple have four children who survive into child bearing age), then it will take 24 generations for the population to return to 65 million. That would be between 500 and 600 years, assuming no return of the events that caused the catastrophe. Is this credible? I don't think so. I believe that over the course of half a millennia society would develop in ways that we could not imagine from the perspective of today. The author assumes that society is a constant input factor, where experience suggests that it isn't.Does this matter? Yes it does because certain technologies require a threshold population in order for them to be viable. For example, the book discusses the return of the Bessemer converter to manufacture steel. However, steel at that level will not be manufactured unless there is a demand for it, which requires a population of a certain size (possibly about 5 to 6 million). The technology cannot be considered in isolation from the society which it serves. If it is, it will tend to generate nonsensical results.Despite all of the foregoing, I still believe that this book is a useful read. If one is constructing wild card scenarios or storylines, then it provides clues and inspiration about what may be feasible, given a certain population at a certain stage of development. It is also useful to know what knowledge might be lost and rediscovered, even if society is not looking to recreate the position we occupy today. From that perspective, it is worth persevering with the book, even though it is a difficult read."
10,159420523X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5847899-patrick,3,"Having a quick look through the Goodreads review of this book, I couldn't help noticing that a fair part of the criticism reflected the fact that it might not actually be all that helpful in the event of the complete collapse of modern civilisation. Which I couldn't help thinking was rather missing the point. If modern civilisation breaks down completely, you will probably die. I certainly would - without complex modern pharmaceuticals, I wouldn't last long. Real life is not a young adult fantasy novel (although if you want to write one, this might not be a bad guide to lending it some realism). Instead, the book is a thought experiment. Imagine that almost everyone died but, at least initially, the infrastructure of the modern world is not destroyed. It simply decays around you. What would you need to know in order to go about rebuilding something approximating a modern technologically advanced society? Except in reality, that's not the question it's answering. Instead it is looking, through a post-apocalyptic lens, at the question of what the technologies underlying the modern world are, and how they developed. From farming, through the making of clothes to navigation and time-keeping. My problem with the book was probably just that I was too tired when I was reading it to follow a fair bit of the chemistry involved. Always one of my weakest subjects at school, and two decades later, I still struggle to keep in my head what exactly a salt is, or why the Alkali Act of 1863 was needed to control the burning of hydrogen chloride- which I thought was another name for hydrochloric acid? That and the fact that, for me at least, I didn't find the author's written style especially engaging. If time is short, and assuming that you're not living in a post-apocalyptic wasteland (and you're not, because, as I said, you'll most likely be dead) it might be better to listen to the author talking about the book here:http://www.littleatoms.com/lewisdartn..."
11,159420523X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/23347651-noel-coughlan,5,"This is a very informative book with a lot of fascinating detail. It is basically a thought experiment. If most of humanity was wiped out in the morning and a handful of people remained, could they survive and rebuild modern technology? To determine this, Dartnell looks how these technologies were originally developed and any possible short cuts which the survivors could take.The ‘apocalypse’ itself described in book was very clinical but this book is not meant to be a blow-by-blow instruction manual. I couldn’t see survivors sitting around it deciding what to do on Day 24. However, it does contain a lot of high level technological insight that a post-apocalyptic Edison or Pasteur might find useful and could spend years of their lives trying to leverage.The book is apolitical. Its focus is the technology. If you need advice on how to hang on to your post-apocalyptic fiefdom, consult Machiavelli, Sun Tzu and other experts in such matters. Oh, it doesn’t cover killing zombies either.Some readers might find the advanced chemistry section a bit of a drudge, but I can’t see how Dartnell could avoid that, given leaving it out would undermine the book’s purpose. On the flip side, it provides useful context for any fledgling chemistry students.The footnotes throughout the book are consistently very interesting. I think any writer interested in world building would find the book very useful.One thing to note is that the book is shorter than it appears. About the last 20% is filled with references, including a useful list of relevant fiction. One final word of advice. If you want to tuck this away for the apocalypse, so you can amaze the other survivors with your scientific knowhow, remember to buy the paperback, not the ebook. Unless you’re really sure you can get those generators up and running."
12,159420523X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7356150-aaron-hook,2,"The two-stars is deceptive. Not really sure how to rate this. I'm very much opposed to the basic premise of the book. The book is meant to be a guide for quickly rebooting our civilization after a catastrophic collapse. Dartnell acknowledges that the most likely scenarios for such a collapse are due to civilization itself. But he never really addresses the elephant of a question in the room: SHOULD we try to rebuild?That said, the information in the book is great and I enjoyed learning about how so many things we take for granted are produced and how they work. I'd actually highly recommend it from this perspective. But the blind and inconsiderate adoption of technological advances (which will likely plunge us headlong into our own collapse) is probably not the best thing to champion for a potential reboot."
13,159420523X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6874323-thomas-ray,1,"The premise is blithering. Most of us simply won't survive the collapse of civil society--the collapse of the systems that bring food and water to the almost-all of us who have no way of providing it for ourselves--and the resulting violence. It won't be a lack of knowledge that will limit post-apocalypse survivors: it'll be a lack of order, of resources, of ability to rebuild the systems the knowledge will still abundantly exist to show the theory of."

This book attempts to answer that question with solid information on the science and practice of remaking the basics of civilization – from agriculture to medicine, chemistry to energy generation. It also ponders what steps of our historical technological progression could be skipped or avoided entirely; after all, we’re not restarting society from the mindset of cave-men. For a single book, it packs a lot of actionable information, but of course it can’t hold everything. Ultimately it serves as a great jumping-off point for further investigation: not the only resource you’d need, but a good guide for finding more. Well recommended for anyone interested in tech history or disaster preparation. -- Hillary D."
16,159420523X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1339246-gendou,1,"This book is no more interesting than clicking around on Wikipedia to find out how stuff works. Really a high school education should teach you everything in this book. Oh, you can make clothes with a loom. Also, lathes are a thing. To make steel, you start with high-carbon pig iron burn the carbon off then add back in the right amount. Cool...What I was hoping for, and what was promised by the title, was a guide that short-cuts certain steps in technological development. Instead, he tells us how to make do with the junk left over from an apocalypse. I mean, if you're writing a zombie novel, that's cool. But I want to understand which steps are arbitrary in human technological history, and which are necessary. I don't think anyone really knows that, so I'm not surprised. Just disappointed.The book isn't even very well edited or organized, either. Real sloppy."
17,159420523X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3145939-ellie,4,"The introduction does speculate a little about different types of apocalypse, but settles on a viral pandemic as our final foe. This would leave survivors the advantage of a fairly intact infrastructure whilst they find their feet as well as little competition for resources.The book is split into sections dealing with aspects such as agriculture, medicine, power, construction and more advance scientific methods. It’s not just a survival guide but a reminder of how much we take for granted. Josh had recently shown me the TED Talk for the guy who tried to build a toaster from scratch. Just knowing how it works is not enough but you need to know how to mine and extract the base materials required first. This book is very much on that premise, how even simple things will be much more difficult.The earlier chapters do deal with scavenging and making the most of what’s been left behind. It also points out these things won’t last forever and why the country is a better bet than urban areas in the long term. With easy access to forests and the sea, where I live right now isn’t too bad a location if the worst happens!Speaking of forests, trees are amazing. Their potential for fuel is not simply just by burning, you can even rig up a car to run on wood gas. Then there’s charcoal, crucial for filtering water and making compounds essential for further technological advancement. There’s creosote (the thing that makes smoked food taste so good as well as being a fine ting to paint your fence with), sticky pitch, acetic acid (think vinegar) and acetone (think nail varnish remover). Plus you can build shelter with it.I found the agricultural, medical and chemistry bits the most fascinating and accessible, based on my previous knowledge. We’ve already got some sourdough starter and homemade cider in the corner of the room, so we’re ahead in our preparations, at least when it comes to yeast. Some of the engineering bits went a bit over my head. In practical terms, it gives only a brief overview of what you’d need to know, if you have no prior knowledge you would struggle to do all the things in the book.However it is thought-provoking and full of facts if you like stuffing your head with facts. There are some things that seem easier than I would have expected once they’ve been explained, which can only give us all hope for the apocalypse."
18,159420523X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/917269-thomas,4,"So, if the apocalypse does come, I really hope I'm not here to deal with it. Maybe I'll be off traveling while it happens or something. Yeah, that sounds good.The thing is, the one thing Dartnell convinced me of, above all else, is that it's going to be a really hard road for civilization to crawl back out of that pit. Granted, there are a ton of shortcuts available -- for everything except maybe the organic chemistry that, as it turns out, plays a far greater role in our daily existence than most likely realize. But those even with those shortcuts, it's going to be a hard road forward. Forget what the preppers might tell you -- just packing a few years supply of canned goods and stockpile of guns and ammo isn't going to help much.That being said, this book is a pretty great exploration of the landscape if you really want to understand what it will take to climb back up. If you read sci-fi or any of the post-apocalypse literature that's out there (and there is a log of it), this book is going to change the way you view it. Having recently read Lucifer's Hammer, I realize just how much most of these books miss. It's good to recognize that a book like this isn't going to be a cookbook for bringing society back, but it outlines the range of concerns and developments that will need to happen. I was honestly tempted to give this one five stars, but I think it would have had to cover a bit more detail, provided about twenty times more illustrations, and likely been about ten times as long to fully satisfy my desire to understand what this book was trying to cover. Of course, I'll need about 5-10 years to give a thorough study if/when that book finally comes to be. ;~)"
19,159420523X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6963912-kate,4,"Full disclosure, I received an advance copy of this book through a GoodReads contest. That said, I can honestly say I enjoyed this book very much. Dartnell does a very good job setting up the parameters for his thought experiment about exactly what knowledge survivors of an apocalypse would need in order to rebuild society. Because he sets up early on just exactly what type of apocalypse he's using (pandemic infection that leaves man-made structures intact) and about how many survivors he's working with, I found his conclusions exceptionally plausible. I am a sucker for dystopic books and survival stories, and I would recommend this to my friends who share those likes. Dartnell does go into very technical details in some sections (especially the Substances chapter on chemicals and such) which is definitely not my strong suit. Although I didn't understand that section completely, I got the gist, and believe that despite being very elevated in the concepts and academic in the descriptions, the content is still accessible to laypersons (which, when you think about the goal of the book, is exactly what he was going for). One of my favorite examples of this is his line ""So the next time you're warmly tipsy, remember that your brain has been mildly poisoned and impaired by the excrement of a single-celled fungus. Cheers!"" (p. 84 on my advanced copy)"
20,159420523X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5059836-phylwil,5,"I received a copy of this book from a Goodreads giveaway. I am thrilled that I was chosen to receive the book because I would never have bought it and read it otherwise, and it is a fascinating overview of basic technologies needed to reboot civilization after a catastrophe. Although it falls short of being a step-by-step manual, I nevertheless feel that I, with the help of a few others, could make cement from raw materials, smelt and work iron, obtain any number of useful chemicals from trees, purify water, grow and preserve food and make soap, fabric and glass. My only criticism is this: the author explains that the book is intended to cover the technology needed not to just survive but to rebuilt civilization to provide a reasonably comfortable lifestyle. Nowhere does he cover anything about birth control, with seems important for two reasons: (1) a recovering civilization will certainly be better able to thrive if it doesn't overpopulate, and (2) a reasonably comfortable lifestyle for the female half requires the ability to chose when to have children.

21,159420523X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3810876-a-j,3,"One of those books which makes me read interesting facts out loud to other people (which I'm sure must be deeply irritating). I generally enjoyed it, although at times I felt it got too bogged down in unnecessary detail. Not sure I needed to know all the advanced chemistry or radio technology. I also felt that the author was concentrating a little too much on getting back to today's technology, rather than thinking about trying to avoid recreating existing, problematic tech such as the use of chemical fertilisers.I got the feeling that I was being told ""Science is really neat!"" without any reflection on other important aspects of human development. Like social justice and environmental stewardship.There's also the problem of the particular apocalyptic scenario the book is based on. This knowledge is all fine if we have a plague which only some of the human race survive, but what do we need to know if the apocalypse is caused instead by a meteor strike, or massive volcanic eruption?"

How long would it take for society to revert to dark-ages state of things? I don't think it would be long....It would actually be a bit worse...For how many of you know anything about farming? Smelting iron? Raising crops? Making soap? ...this book however gives all this basic information. It's not a manual...but it'll give you the ideas and concepts, so that you can figure it out from the scratch. This book might very well save our civilization, if a cataclysm ever comes.

28,159420523X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2579781-paul,3,"I'm not sure that this would actually help rebuild or save any future society all that much, but it's an interesting framing device by which one can look at how various things work and worked in the past. Additionally, I think it's an interesting thought experiment to bring up how one would be able to ""leap frog"" over intermediate stages, knowing what we know now. I also think it's interesting to consider that some of our prevalent technologies are basically path-dependent (we already have X infrastructure in place, so this globally less-efficient technology is more efficient).One of the major problems I have with this is that while he talks about leap frogging intermittently, it seems like that comes up very infrequently. I would think that access to electricity would massively change the landscape of a lot of chemical and industrial processes and electricity is very easy to bootstrap into if you know what you are doing.I also think he didn't really talk about the best places to do any of this stuff. He said to avoid cities, but we know a ton about geography and weather and local weather conditions. Considering that after the fall you'd likely have decent vehicles and roads for some time, assume that any fledgling society would be able to make more or less any migration that doesn't cross a major body of water - where would be the best places on each continent to restart society? And assuming you can cross a body of water, which of these is best?Still, I would read a sequel to this if it existed. One thing that would be a very interesting, similar thought experiment would be what if you needed to bootstrap a new world - you find a new world with a compatible biosphere and you can bring as much data as you need, but a limited number of people and stuff - how do you bootstrap a technological society from that?"

It tells you how to rebuild a functioning society which reaches a relatively technologically advanced state. However, the manner in which it does this is very dry, listless and grossly overestimated a regular persons understanding of chemistry and science physics. If I live to see the apocalypse, I will take this book with me, as it does offer some useful insights on what should be aimed for, but there is no way I would only be use this book alone. It took me a long while to read this, because the content seemed to drone on at times, but maybe that speaks more for my level of intelligence than the writing of the book. 2 stars."

It prioritizes and outlines key technologies you could plausibly start with from scratch to reboot the essentials for human survival. Importantly, it also gives tips on how to skip centuries and millenia of blind alleys and leapfrog intermediate stages of development. However, the last chapter also highlights the importance of socio-economic conditions required for technology to get implemented and to provide incentives to advance. If people are eeking out a subsistance lifestyle, anything not directly tied to food production may be dismissed as frivelous. People may be constrained from innovating for socio-economic reasons. One missing ingredient here that really concerns me is how to preserve cooperation among the survivors or how to restore it among long-disconnected groups of survivors. The world would be a dangerous place and not every group would be interested or able to do the hard work of survival. How could you restore civilization if you spend all of your resources preparing *in case* a larger, more fierce band of predatory humans comes to take it away? Utopians, please note that at least 2% of the human population are predatory, but most of these have the self-discipline to advance within the rules of society. Ibn Khaldun described how primitive predatory nomads have cyclically overcome more technologically advanced agrarian societies. Even if predators don't snuff out your settlement of survivors, how does your group protect itself from predators within and turn into a feudalistic society? On the flipside, how do you get everyone to contribute when lots of people will want to free ride without contributing to the survival of the group? The author called the scientific method the greatest invention of all, but the ability of large groups of people to peacefully cooperate is absolutely critical and underpins that invention as well."

What are your first needs?Regardless, of the source of the mishap, Dartnell has some ideas on how this might play out. While he focuses primarily on rebuilding society, it is of interesting note that he does touch upon a few pragmatics. For example, prisons can be a good place to start because as hard as they are to get out of, they are even harder dot get into. Dartnell doesn’t dwell much on the absolute anarchy, tribalism, warlord dominated group dynamics that would reign and make the rebuilding so much more difficult. Rather he treats the situation as one in which eventually (it can be a long eventually) we would want to garner up those things that we know and are able to construct that will make all of mankind’s life a bit easier.We need so much, but we need to start with water, fire, food and fuel. “ The Knowledge” covers it all. Come on! How long are you going to live in that basement? At some advanced state, we will redevelop steel, glass and shopping malls. Think about that! First, an admission. I’m an avid reader of apocalyptic novels: From Walter Miller to Margaret Atwood. You Brave New Worldites have nothing on us 1984’s. But supposing it is much more likely to happen on a small scale. Download the film “Lord of the Flies”. Watch it. What would you be able to do?"
36,159420523X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/9912047-peter,4,"The Knowledge is structured around a simple question that I've wondered about a lot: how could you rebuild civilization, thousands of years of collective knowledge, via the fastest possible path. As a child, I was obsessed with Mark Twain's A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court, which follows a similar quest, and I've always loved the trope popularized in Robinson Crusoe and Swiss Family Robinson of being abandoned on an island, left to rebuild a modicum of civilization from first principles.The Knowledge isn't perfect, but its focus on first principles, technological dependencies and shortcuts through the tech tree of civilization is certainly the most rigorous exploration of this concept that I've come across. Even for the non-preppers among us, the idea of rebuilding from scratch is a crystalizing concepts which forces us all to grapple with how little we actually understand about what keeps today's hyper-specialized global economy going, and trying to derive modern civilization from first principles is an exercise in humility, but also delight, as you realize how much of an advantage you might have over the people who came before us.More of a history of technology than a hardcore prepper book, The Knowledge reminded me more of How We Got to Now than it did a guidebook to carry through the first weeks of an apocalypse. But it was fun and thought-inspiring, and I would recommend it to others without question. The world is complicated, but not impossibly so, and it's amazing how many things we know and take for granted lay dormant for centuries but exist in high-school science textbooks the world across. "
37,159420523X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3282620-hilary,5,"In a very readable style, Lewis Dartnell describes a thought experiment in which our world is devastated, human population reduced dramatically, and we've been bumped back to the Dark Ages... but aren't willing to stay there. He covers all the essential topics: minimum colony size for sustainable development, sourcing and storing food, medicine, construction, energy sources, chemistry, physics, navigation, and much more.If you grew up reading stories of intrepid explorers, pioneers and colonists (or Heinlein, which is often the same thing) and wondered whether you'd be as innovative and competent in patching together spare items to meet your society's needs, this is for you.

38,159420523X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/906247-jean,4,"Lots to think about in this book. Dartnell's purpose is to discuss what crucial information we would need to keep going in the immediate aftermath of world disaster and then to describe how to sustain existence in the long term. I disagreed with a lot of what he said about the immediate aftermath and what might happen and what you or I would be able to do. There are a lot of possible scenarios of disasters, and any one of them would affect our resources in different ways. For example, Dartnell assumes we could get gas from gas stations, but I can think of several reasons why this would not be possible. I'm also not sure we could live for many years off canned goods, as he suggests. This assumes that everyone has a nice stock of tuna in their basements or that we can walk to the local grocery store and raid the shelves (like no-one else is going to have the same thought?).When he got to the long-term solutions for living, the book got more interesting. I was particularly interested in how we might be able to make ink (well, you know me), food and clothing, and how we could tell time and our position on the earth. Dartnell's final chapter was the most interesting. He explains that the new world may not evolve technologically or scientifically the way ours has. Lots to think about here.

In fact, this was one of the sources. While this book covered similar territory, it was much less fun.The Knowledge assumes a very particular post-apocalyptic scenario: a disease has wiped out most of humanity. This premise means that we can scavenge some supplies and technology from cities, and can limp along for a while on stored gasoline and twinkies. Then we need to start inventing. The book takes us through essential areas of science and technology and provides one-liners about how to create tech from scratch. More than How To Invent Everything, most of the practical implementation details are left for the reader. Overall, it was an interesting thought experiment, and provided insight into some of the history of common technologies that we rely on for our society today.

It really gives you a strong appreciation for just how much work goes into producing even the most mundane things, like soap. Even more, it justifies why many of these basic things, like soap, are so vastly important to have. However, this is just an overview. I don't feel like you would really walk away from reading this knowing how to do all that much. Rather, you learn enough to know how to start researching.

The book takes the reader through these - how one would grow food,generate power, prepare medicines or get metals out of rocks, look at time and place and rebuild calendar and ascertain one’s location, rebuild system of measures.

I'll list that at the end. Other parts, how to make clay, etc was pretty dry. I'm not sure if this avoidable.

Making up for that, there is an excellent list of further reading.To be clear, this is not at all a survival guide, but rather a guide to the knowledge which underlies civilisation.

52,159420523X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/64789612-valerie-saint-pierre,5,"The world has suffered from some form of apocalypse and most of humanity is gone. What skills and knowledge would the survivors need in order to recreate a modern civilisation again without regressing back to the Dark Ages? How would they find this knowledge, and where would they start? Practical handbooks for surviving and rebuilding after an apocalypse are not new, and there are survivalist groups around the world who spend their lives and their incomes building fortresses and strongholds for just such an eventuality. Moreover, popular media likes to present us with myriad and imaginative ways that our civilisations may collapse; from pandemics to zombies, alien invasions to environmental collapse, asteroid strikes to nuclear holocaust. However, most narratives focus on surviving the disaster and its immediate aftermath of the breakdown of law and order, without much consideration about what happens next.The Knowledge aims to fill that (hopefully hypothetical!) gap. It functions as a primer for understanding what technologies underpin modern society, how to access them and why they are important. Its aim is to halt a quick return to primitive existence (once the current resources that have survived the apocalypse are gone) and jump-start the evolution of science and technology that we take so much for granted, in order to return to a reasonable level of civilisation as quickly as possible. More than that, it describes the steps that are needed for this process, from the basics of providing food, shelter, clothing and medicine, to the longer-term practical issues around growing food, making new tools and materials, and returning to a global society through travel and communication. It’s an ambitious goal for one 300-page book, and to achieve its goal certain assumptions have to made: the apocalypse has been one which has affected mainly the human population (such as a global pandemic) but has not affected the larger environment; the apocalypse has left intact at least part of the current infrastructure, in order to supply a ‘golden age’ where the vastly reduced population is able to survive fairly well for a limited amount of time on the gleanings from the deceased civilisation around it; the apocalypse has left a good proportion of Mankind’s gathered knowledge intact and accessible in some form or other. Once the groundwork is out of the way and the parameters have been set, the book really goes to work. Each chapter explores a fundamental necessity – some not at all obvious - for regaining to our modern lifestyle. The author examines the requirements for the immediate and short-term (such as food, clothing, shelter and medicine), the medium-term (such as agriculture and the generation of power) and the longer-term (such as long-distance communication, travel, and the creation and manipulation of infrastructure materials such as chemicals, glass, metals and plastics). It describes what skills are needed, what tools and infrastructure need to be rebuilt, in what order and why. It does not aim to act as a practical handbook; instead it explains the basic principles that these things will require – from sowing crops to weaving, from making steel to harnessing steam for power, suggests the tools and expertise that will be needed to make them and describes why they are important. And that’s the genius of this book, and the reason why someone living (thankfully) in a world which has not experienced apocalyptic conditions might be interested to read a book with such a doom-laden premise. Living in a socially stable environment, surrounded by modern technology and systems designed to make our lives more comfortable, it is very easy to forget how we have created all things that surround us; the myriad tools we use, the food we eat, the clothing we wear and the buildings we live in, as well as the infrastructure that allows us to communicate with people on the other side of the world or to travel to see them. And that doesn’t even consider the materials that our civilisation is built on; plastics, glass, metals, chemicals, that we use without any understanding of how they have been manufactured. The fundamentals that are behind how our computers and mobile phones work, what our clothing is made of, where our food comes from, how our cars propel themselves, the lights we turn on when it gets dark and the pills we swallow when we feel ill – all of these come from mountains of incremental research, from massive amounts of human ingenuity, mistakes, testing and trial and error. And yet we see only the end results rather than understand the processes and the effort that went into their creation. The Knowledge, therefore, is not only a primer for getting back to our current level of civilisation after a global disaster, its about recognising how far we have come already. It’s an introduction to understanding how we have created the world that we live in through the basic scientific principles that underpin all facets of our modern civilisation. And, ultimately, this book is a paean to the scientific process; to rigorous research, continuing trial and error and to constantly questioning and testing the world around us in our unending search for knowledge and understanding.

57,159420523X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6169728-max-nova,5,"“The Knowledge” is a fascinating thought experiment about how to build the ideal manual for a reboot of civilization. Dartnell decides that a good post-apocalypse reboot manual has a few critical ingredients: 1) instructions for short-term survival 2) a roadmap for longer-term rebooting of key agricultural, chemical, material, and energy industries, along with technological “shortcuts” that our ancestors didn’t discover for centuries (e.g. wheelbarrows, buttons, and using radios to avoid having to build longitude clocks), and 3) a hearty regard for the scientific method.Dartnell does a good job of sketching out the various technologies he mentions and includes fascinating historical tidbits about the technological trajectory that our civilization took. This book is almost more of a history of science book than an apocalypse-prepper book. Would I count on this being my primary post-apocalypse resource? No way. But in any case, it’s a fun read!###############What sentence holds the most information in the fewest words? “I believe,” said Feynman, “it is the atomic hypothesis . . . that all things are made of atoms—little particles that move around in perpetual motion, attracting each other when they are a little distance apart, but repelling upon being squeezed into one another.”A reboot manual would work best on two levels. First, you need a certain amount of practical knowledge handed to you on a plate, so as to recover a base level of capability and a comfortable lifestyle as quickly as possible, and to halt further degeneration. But you also need to nurture the recovery of scientific investigation and provide the most worthwhile kernels of knowledge to begin exploring.Thus a post-apocalyptic group of a few hundred men and women, all in the same place, ought to encapsulate sufficient genetic variability to repopulate the world.The majority of our houses or apartment blocks will last, at most, a hundred years.The steel-reinforced concrete of many modern buildings is a marvelous building material, but although more resistant than wood, it is by no means impervious to decay. The ultimate cause of its deterioration is ironically the source of its great mechanical strength. The steel rebars are cocooned from the elements by the concrete surrounding them, but as mildly acidic rainwater soaks through, and humic acids released by rotting vegetation seep into the concrete foundations, the embedded steel begins to rust inside the structures. The final blow for this modern construction technique is the fact that steel expands as it rusts, rupturing the concrete from the inside, leaving even more surface exposed to moisture and so accelerating the endgame. These rebars are the weak point of modern construction—and unreinforced concrete will prove more durable in the long run: the dome of the Pantheon in Rome is still going strong after two thousand years.A more practical, longer-term solution for purifying larger volumes of water, once you have settled down after the Event, relies on a combination of filtration and disinfection. A rudimentary but perfectly adequate system for filtering out particles in murky lake or river water uses a tall receptacle such as a plastic bucket, a steel drum, or even a well-cleaned trash can. Punch some small holes in the bottom, and cover with a layer of charcoal, either taken from a hardware store or created yourself using the instructions here. Alternate layers of fine sand and gravel on top of the charcoal. Pour the water into your receptacle, and as it drains through, it will be effectively filtered of most particulate matter. The first option for disinfecting this filtered water to eliminate waterborne pathogens is to use dedicated water-purification treatments, such as iodine tablets or crystals available from camping stores. If you can’t find any, there are some surprising alternatives that will also work perfectly well, such as chlorine-based bleaches formulated for household cleaning. By far the largest reserve of preserved sustenance, however, will be the rows upon rows of canned food that fill the supermarket shelves… A single average-size supermarket should be able to sustain you for around 55 years—63 if you eat the canned cat and dog food as well.Each gas station holds a subterranean lake of fuel of typically around 30,000 gallons, enough for an average family car to drive more than a million miles along post-apocalyptic roads.One of the earliest uses of cyanoacrylate adhesive, better known as superglue, was for rapidly closing wounds of US soldiers during the Vietnam War. This application would become very important again in preventing life-threatening infections in a post-apocalyptic world if you don’t have immediate access to sterilized suturing needles and threads.Mechanically minded survivors shouldn’t have too much trouble cobbling together rudimentary windmills from salvaged materials. Thin steel sheets could be cut and curved into the radial vanes of a large fan, mounted on the hub of a wheel, and the torque could be transferred by a chain and bicycle gear set. The principal step is to convert that rotational energy into electricity, and for that you’ll want to salvage a suitable ready-made generator. A source of particularly handy and compact versions is so ubiquitous in the modern world that you would be forgiven for overlooking them. There are around a billion motor vehicles on the planet now—with the US having the most of any nation, around a quarter of the total—and each of them has a salvageable alternator. The car alternator is an ingenious mechanism. Spin the shaft and a perfectly steady 12 volts of direct current appears across its terminals, regardless of how quickly the shaft is turned, making it perfectly suited to be repurposed for post-apocalyptic small-scale power generation.Every modern strain of crop represents thousands of years of diligent selective breeding, and if you lose ready-domesticated species, you may lose any hope of shortcutting the rebuilding of civilization.All of these herbicides, pesticides, and artificial fertilizers are synthesized using fossil fuels, which also power the farmyard machinery. In a sense, then, modern farming is a process that transforms oil into food—with some input from sunshine—and consumes around ten calories of fossil fuel energy for every calorie of food actually eaten. With a collapse of civilization and the disappearance of an advanced chemical industry, you’ll need to relearn traditional methods. Today, organic produce is the preserve of the wealthy; in the aftermath it will be your only option.It’s easy to get a visual check on soil composition. Fill a glass jar one-third of the way with soil (picking out any hard clumps, stems, or leaves) and top it off almost to the brim with water. Screw on a lid, and shake vigorously until all lumps have been broken up and you have a uniform muddy soup. Let the jar stand undisturbed for a day or so, allowing time for the suspension to settle back down and the water to be nearly clear again. The different grains will have sedimented out in order of their particle size to show distinct layers or bands. The bottom band is the coarse-grained sand component of the soil, the middle layer is silt, and the very top layer holds the finest clay particles, allowing you to visually judge their proportions in the mixed soil.Corn, rice, and wheat, as well as barley, sorghum, millet, oats, and rye, are all cereal crops: varieties of grass. This dominance of cereals in our diets, coupled with the fact that much of the meat we consume comes from livestock fed by either grazing in pastures or on grain fodder, means that much of humanity subsists, either directly or indirectly, by eating grass.The combine harvester is undoubtedly one of the most important inventions of recent history, freeing so many of us from being required to work in the fields and enabling us to perform other roles in a complex society.The Norfolk four-course rotation is the most successful of these historical systems and became widespread only in the eighteenth century, spearheading the British agricultural revolution. In the Norfolk system, succession of crops through each plot follows the order: legumes, wheat, root crops, barley.Reverting to small-scale methods, five acres of land will be enough to support a group of up to ten people: wheat for bread, barley for beer, a diverse range of fruits and veggies, as well as cattle, pigs, sheep, and chickens for meat, milk, eggs, and other products.But with a little more ingenuity, some of the human and farmyard waste can be turned into something altogether more useful with a bioreactor. In a compost heap the objective is to keep everything well aerated so that oxygen-needing bacteria and fungi can readily decompose the matter. But if instead you hold the waste in a closed vessel, blocking oxygen from getting in, anaerobic bacteria thrive and partly convert the organic material into flammable methane gas. This can be piped into a simple gas storage facility constructed from a concrete-lined pool filled with water with an upturned metal container fitted snugly within it. As the methane bubbles up into the storage tank, the water forms an air seal, and the metal gas collector rises. The weight of the floating storage tank provides gas pressure, and the methane can be piped off to supply stoves, gas for lighting, or even, as we’ll see later, fuel for vehicle engines. A metric ton of organic waste can produce at least 50 cubic meters of flammable gas, equivalent to the energy of a full tank of gasoline. (It is not surprising that such biogas digesters became common across fuel-starved Nazi-occupied Europe during the Second World War.) The microbial growth slows considerably at lower temperatures, so it’s important to keep the bioreactor insulated, or even siphon off some of the methane produced to heat it.Encouragingly for an accelerated reboot, there was no missing prerequisite technology that prevented the development of canned food centuries earlier in our history—perhaps even skilled Roman glassworkers could have made reliably sealable airtight vessels—so survivors can start canning food soon after the Fall.Whether your garments are stitched from leather or woven fabric, the next problem is how to attach them securely to your body. Disregarding zippers and velcro as too complex to be fabricated by a rebooting civilization, you’re low on options for easily reversible fastenings. The best low-tech solution never occurred to any of the ancient or classical civilizations, yet is now so ubiquitous it has become seemingly invisible. Astoundingly, the humble button didn’t become common in Europe until the mid-1300s. Indeed, it never was developed by Eastern cultures, and the Japanese were absolutely delighted when they first saw buttons sported by Portuguese traders.The traditional method for this anaerobic transformation of wood—the specialist craft of the collier—was to build a pyre of logs with a central open shaft, and then smother the whole mound with clay or turf. The stack is ignited through a hole in the top, and then the smoldering heap is carefully monitored and tended over several days. You can achieve similar results more easily by digging a large trench and filling it with wood, starting a hearty blaze, and then covering over the trench with scavenged sheets of corrugated iron and heaping on soil to cut off the oxygen. Leave it to smolder out and cool. Charcoal will prove indispensable as a clean-burning fuel for rebooting critical industries such as the production of pottery, bricks, glass, and metal, which we’ll come to in the next chapter.Wood can offer so much more than just carbon fuel and alkali from its ashes. In fact, wood was once the major source of organic compounds—providing chemical feedstocks and precursor substances for a vast array of different processes and activities—and was superseded only in the late nineteenth century by coal tar and the subsequent development of petrochemicals from crude oil. In a post-apocalyptic world, therefore, where you may well find yourself without accessible coal or a continuing supply of oil, these older techniques will support the rebooting of a chemical industry.The reason that we’ve been able to exploit hard iron through the history of civilization is that it temporarily changes its physical properties when hot, softening to become malleable enough to be beaten into shape, rolled into sheets, or drawn into pipes and wires. This is a fundamental point, because it means you can use iron tools to work on iron to produce more tools.The crucial knowledge for fully exploiting iron for tools is the principle of hardening steel—quenching and tempering. Steel is hardened by heating it red-hot so that the internal structure of iron-carbon crystals converts to a particularly rigid conformation (which is nonmagnetic, allowing a simple test during heating). If allowed to cool slowly afterward, though, this crystal reverts back to its previous form, and so you need to chill it rapidly to essentially freeze the desired structure: quenching the piece by dunking it, sizzling, into water or oil. However, a hard substance is also brittle—and a steel hammer, sword, or spring that shatters is useless—so after quenching a piece needs to be tempered. You do this by reheating to a lower temperature for a period of time so that a proportion of the crystal structure relaxes: you are deliberately trading off some of the strength to return a little flexibility to the material. Tempering allows you to tune the material properties of steel, a crucial ability for designing the appropriate metal for the intended task.An even higher temperature of around 6,000°C is generated by an electric arc welder: brandishing the power of lightning. Rigging up a row of batteries, or a generator, will produce enough of a voltage that a constant spark, or arc, will leap between the target metal and a carbon electrode, to weld or cut as the electrode is drawn across the surface. Such jury-rigged oxyacetylene torches or arc cutters would be indispensable equipment for salvage crews sent into the dead cities to disassemble the ruins and scavenge the most valuable materials. One very effective way for melting down scrap steel for recycling is the electric arc furnace. It’s essentially a giant arc welder: large carbon electrodes surge electricity through the metal to melt it, with limestone flux used to remove impurities as slag on top and the molten steel being poured as if from a kettle. Running an arc furnace from renewable electricity would be an important technology to try to leapfrog to in order to relieve demands on fuels for thermal energy in the post-apocalyptic world.Astoundingly, not only is the lathe capable of duplicating all of its own components to create more lathes, but starting from absolute scratch, you can even produce, during the rudimentary stages of construction of your first lathe, the remaining components needed to complete it.In our history it took a long process of reiterative refinement to make the first precise metal screw thread, from which many others can then be constructed, and you would want to avoid having to repeat this.Whereas the lathe applies a tool to a rotating workpiece, the milling machine bears a rotating tool against the workpiece, and is exceedingly versatile—once you have a milling machine you can create pretty much anything else.The key to modern civilization is efficiently making steel in bulk. Here’s how you do it. The solution is to force a powerful stream of air up the furnace stack to ferociously intensify combustion.Of the six instruments crucial to the development of the modern scientific enterprise in the seventeenth century, all of which would be indispensible in rediscovering the world after an apocalypse—pendulum clock, thermometer, barometer, telescope, microscope, and vacuum chamber with air pump—all but one of them, the pendulum clock, rely utterly on the unique combination of properties offered by glass.The tool that transformed medical diagnosis is astonishingly simple. The stethoscope need be no more than a hollow wooden tube held to the ear and pushed against the patient’s body, or even a rolled-up bundle of papers, which was how the tool was invented in 1816.Medieval Europe became the first civilization in human history to base its productivity not on human muscle power—the labors of coolies or slaves—but on the exploitation of natural power sources.You might think that steam engines represent exactly the sort of transitional technological level that you would aspire to leapfrog over during a reboot, straight to internal combustion engines or steam turbines, which we’ll explore in detail later. But steam engines offer two major advantages over more advanced alternatives, and so you may need to recapitulate this developmental stage. First, they are external combustion engines and don’t require refined gasoline, diesel, or natural gas to run—they are much less fussy, and their boiler can be fired with pretty much anything that burns, including scrap wood or agricultural waste. Second, a simple steam engine can be constructed with much more rudimentary machine tools and materials and with far more forgiving engineering tolerances than a more complex mechanism.The chemistry behind making synthetic rubber will be fiendishly tricky in the early stages of recovery, so once preexisting rubber supplies have deteriorated after the grace period, reestablishing long-distance trade will be one of your top priorities if you don’t live near a natural source.In terms of the sheer number of people it directly affects every day, the most profound technological advance of the twentieth century was not the invention of flight, antibiotics, electronic computers, or nuclear power, but the means to synthesize a humble, foul-smelling chemical: ammonia… Today, the Haber-Bosch process pumps out around a hundred million tons of synthetic ammonia every year, and fertilizer made from it sustains one-third of the world’s population—around 2.3 billion hungry mouths are fed by this chemical reaction. And since the raw materials in the food we eat become assimilated into our cells, about half of the protein in our bodies is made from nitrogen fixed artificially by the technological capability of our own species. In a way, we’re partially industrially manufactured.The absolute root of science, then, is the careful design and construction of instruments for making measurements, as well as units to count theseIn this way, science isn’t listing what you know: it’s about how you can come to know. It’s not a product but a process, a never-ending conversation rebounding back and forth between observation and theory, the most effective way of deciding which explanations are right and which are wrong. This is what makes science such a useful system for understanding the workings of the world—a powerful knowledge-generating machine. And this is why it is the scientific method itself that is the greatest invention of all.About the only countries that haven’t fully adopted this system are the US and the UK, where outdated units persist with the use of miles on road signs and car speedometers and drinks served in restaurants and pubs by the pint. The historical reason was Napoleon excluding the English-speaking world when he convened a congress in 1798 to encourage international adoption of the new metric system—the British had just sunk the French fleet at the Battle of Aboukir and so were not invited to the party."
58,159420523X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/21103445-klas-sundelin,5,"It is early morning of the first day of the first month in the year of 2017. This is the year where Donald Trump, you know the guy who cannot control his Twitter account, gets his tiny little fingers on the nuclear button. Suddenly a world disaster such as a collapse in world economy, the dismemberment of UN,NATO and EU or even a nuclear war seems more likely than ever before. I sincerely hope that Mr Trump will be the best President he can ever be. But in case he is not, and we are heading for the Apocalypse, this book is definitely the book you need. Lewis Dartnell is a UK Space Agency research fellow at the University of Leicester, in the field of astrobiology and has won several awards for his science writing. Which is completely understandable. This is a very interesting take on the topic of how to survive after a world wide apocalypse. There are lots of books on the topic of survival catastrophies such as this list of top 15 books. But the majority of them deals with a local event where you as an individual have to survive an accident and get back to civilization again. You know get away from immediate threat, first aid, navigation, building a shelter, making a fire etc. Very much like the Boy Scout handbookThis book is something completely different. It´s a guide on how to rebuild our society from scratch. It tells the reader how to go from basic survival to rediscover all the knowledge and technology that underlines our society. How do we grow enough food for everyone? How do we make soap? How do we get metals out of bedrock and how can we make the tools we need? What about basic chemistry to making alkalines or acids? What technology do we need to reinvent to be able to perform basic medicine?Those of you who have played the epic computer game Civilization by Sid Meier*, will be familiar with this way of thinking. What technology will I need to invent and what do I need to research to be able to maintain my cities? In many ways this book feels like the guide book to the tech tree of real life! It starts off with a bit of apocalypse porn, which obviously is entertaining. Dartnell goes off and discusses what kind of disasters could hit us, and what impact they would have. Then goes into chapters such as agriculture, food and clothing, materials, medicine, and how to power our technology. Eventually you as a reader realize that this book is a love story of technology and science. How exactly did we get to where we are today? It also describes really how little each and every one of us really knows about everything around us. An interesting and scary example of how interconnected we are today concerns the simple pencil. Very few people, if any, are able to construct a pencil from scratch. And by scratch I mean not only cutting down the trees, collecting the graphite and making the paint, but also making the tools you need. And even making the tools to make the tools you need.The last chapter is about the importance of the scientific method, and how utterly dependent we are on empirical studies of the world around us. And to study the world properly we need to have instruments for precise measurements. Not to mention units to count the measurements. weight, time, volume, length etc are all be essential measurements for us to be able to deal with our surroundings and each other. I certainly learned a lot from this book. The word broadcasting, for instance, is the name of the sowing technique where the farmer walks around with a bucket and throws out seeds in a semicircle a handful at a time. Who would have thunk it?  If you are at all interested in the history of science, technology and not to mention increasing your chances of surviving the apocalypse of Mr. Trump, I suggest you pick up this book. I loved it!You should also check out the authors webpage The Knowledge, follow on Twitter: @knowledgeciv or even watch his excellent TED-Talk on the subject.""These fragments I have shored against my ruins."" - The Waste Land, T.S.

The knowledge how to rebuild our world is one of those books that you treasure in your library and revisit from time to time. It is so much more then meets the eye, if anything it is a book to grasp both the complexity of all our modern luxuries and basic needs as it is a book to make those complex processes more real. Does it mean that one could start building a windmill or a sextant from scratch with this book? no, but that is not the point of this book, this book is like a guide to help clear your mind and to decide what would truly be necessary if one was in a situation of societal tabula rasa. To demystify the building blocks of both modernity and appreciate the ingenuity of the past both those of lucky breaks and those of generational grinding. Few books can achieve that, even if I do feel that there are some aspects and topics lacking in the book that I feel are needed to rebuild society. I appreciate the authors remark that there can be aspects, processes and techniques that he did not think about when writing and researching this book as I do appreciate his invitation to visit the website to discuss this said possible lack. Me personally I would have added a few things. First, pesticides or biologically friendly alternatives; rightly does Dartnell talk about the importance of fertilizer, yet he does not address the possible strategies to be used to fight of parasites and other blights that ruin agricultural production. It would be a tragic ending for rebooting civilization if after all the hard work a few severe infestations ruin everything. Secondly I do believe a discussion on rebuilding should include defense and offensive capabilities. In the short run (as with all discussed topics in the book) there is a grace period of scavenging for weapons and ammunition but after that society would have to be able to make new ammunition, spare parts and finally making new guns. Not that I am advocating warlord fantasies here, but as even the author himself admits, a tabula rasa situation will have it's mad max types and the rebuilders will need to defend themselves. At the very least there should be a brief part on gunsmiths and the requirements to make standard easy to maintain and learn bolt action rifles and other less complex forms of modern fire-arms (that utilities integrated cartridges in stead of loose powder and bullets). Besides the book already has a gunpowder section for mining explosives and he does make some hints about firearms, yet does not follow up on that. Having said that, I still am impressed by the book and I get the sentiment behind it; that frustrated feeling most inhabitants of the western world have of feeling a bit lost and helpless when one fully realizes how little real practical knowledge we all have if it were to come down to either survival and let alone rebuilding. This book both confronts a reader with that unease and gives inspiration to remedy this lacking of skills. I am inspired to learn and further improve either some form of skill or knowledge that could be useful even today when working in conditions outside our comforting bubble we live in today. "
