0,110198032X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3831795-nelson-zagalo,4,"Thompson writes very well, and is able to engage us in stories and facts. He's a journalist and uses this book to go much further than he could with just simple articles. You'll be surprised and gain a lot of insight into contemporary culture, which will make you think about what you like and dislike and why.This is not the dry academic book, it uses very good storytelling and lots of techniques to maintain the reader interested. On the other side it encompasses too many perspectives, approaches and cultural production that makes it impossible to deliver the promise made by the title. There's really no science in these pages, but only lots of stories, causalities and correlations. Even if Thompson starts with determination and convincing us, bit by bit he acknowledges the impossibility of the task he purposed to achieve. Therefore it's up to you, the reader, to extract the best from it, and build your theories on how successes are made.A more in depth review was made for my blog: https://virtual-illusion.blogspot.pt/..."
1,110198032X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/12307604,3,"I started this book to come down after reading ""The Gene"", which was far more demanding and beefier than this one. ""Hit Makers"" is a good read, but not really all that educational. The books primary question is ""what makes a thing popular?"", and I enjoyed the approach of the author.Every chapter looks at something that became a hit, be it a song, a household product, a movie, etc. It's a good collection of anecdotes, well written as you'd expect from a professional journalist who writes of publications like the Atlantic. In the end, while I enjoyed the reading of the book, at the end I felt like I just read a really long, nice article on the Atlantic. There's not much of a takeaway, except maybe for Raymond Loewy's MAYA (most advanced yet accessible) concept, which in itself isn't that mindblowing anyway. So if you were hoping that this book would reveal some secret formula or real wisdom as to how to make your product a huge hit, you'll be disappointed, but then that'd be a foolish motivation in the first place."
2,110198032X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4592109-lori-l-she-treads-softly,5,"Hit Makers: The Science of Popularity in an Age of Distraction by Derek Thompson is a very highly recommended examination of popularity of things and how and why they gained their status. This is an engrossing look at popularity. Thompson has a comfortable writing style that is full of anecdotes and examples. He creatively ties widely divergent topics together in a fascinating, entertaining format.Nothing really ""goes viral."" There is a reason why a song, movie, book, app, etc. became popular. Thompson explores ""the psychology of why people like what they like, the social networks through which ideas spread, and the economics of cultural markets."" As he succinctly points out, people are both ""neophilic - curious to discover new things - and deeply neophobic - afraid of anything that’s too new. The best hit makers are gifted at creating moments of meaning by marrying new and old, anxiety and understanding. They are architects of familiar surprises."" So, Hit Makers asks two questions: 1. What is the secret to making products that people like - in music, movies, television, books, games, apps, and more across the vast landscape of culture? 2. Why do some products fail in these marketplaces while similar ideas catch on and become massive hits?Thompson covers a wide variety of pop cultural blockbusters ranging from and including Brahms lullaby, the impressionist canon (yeah, the Impressionists, as in painters), ESPN, Cheers and Seinfeld, Star Wars, Rock Around the Clock, Fifty Shades of Grey, Game of Thrones, Etsy, Facebook, the laugh track, Vampires, Disney Princesses, and much more. Even more interesting is how he ties so many different hits together to explain what they became hits. One principle that governs almost all hits is MAYA: Most Advanced Yet Achievable. ""MAYA offers three clear lessons. First: Audiences don’t know everything, but they know more than creators do. Second: To sell something familiar, make it surprising. To sell something surprising, make it familiar. Third: People sometimes don’t know what they want until they already love it.""The incident that created the impressionist canon took me by surprise, and yet it makes perfect sense. Thompson shows how ""the impressionist canon focuses on a tight cluster of seven core painters: Manet, Monet, Cézanne, Degas, Renoir, Pissarro, and Sisley - the Caillebotte Seven. When painter and collector Gustave Caillebotte donated his art collection upon his untimely death, his donation helped to create the impressionist canon. The power of repeated exposure, whether it is paintings that are exhibited or other things is a powerful tool in determining what is a hit.What makes a song succeed? ""Even at the dawn of the American music business, to make a song a hit, a memorable melody was secondary to an ingenious marketing campaign."" Interesting, but clearly true.I wanted to pump my fist and yell ""Yes, this!"" when Thompson points out, and rightly so, that ""there is such a thing as too much familiarity. It’s everywhere, in fact. It’s hearing a catchy song for the tenth time in a row, watching a movie that is oh so predictably uncreative, or hearing a talented speaker use overfamiliar buzzword after buzzword. In fluency studies, the power of familiarity is discounted when people realize that the moderator is trying to browbeat them with the same stimulus again and again. This is one reason why so much advertising doesn’t work: People have a built-in resistance to marketing that feels like it’s trying to seduce them."" I have experienced this many times over the years (mindset or grit, anyone?) Recently when the video for a women's conference kept repeated the name of the event throughout the video as a buzz word, all it did was annoy me and strengthen my determination to not attend.This is specifically for readers. Many of you will understand: ""When people read, they hear voices and see images in their head. This production is total synesthesia and something close to madness. A great book is a hallucinated IMAX film for one. The author had a feeling, which he turned into words, and the reader gets a feeling from those words - maybe it’s the same feeling; maybe it’s not. As Peter Mendelsund wrote in What We See When We Read, a book is a coproduction. A reader both performs the book and attends the performance. She is conductor, orchestra, and audience. A book, whether nonfiction or fiction, is an 'invitation to daydream.'""Disclosure: My review copy was courtesy of the Penguin Publishing Group."
3,110198032X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6991670-bob,4,"Summary: Explores what makes a hit, and explodes some of the myths around hits such as the idea of something going ""viral.""How does something become a ""hit?"" Anyone creating a work of art, propounding an idea, promoting a candidate, launching a new product would like to know. Derek Thompson, a senior editor at The Atlantic, was curious about this phenomenon and out of his research come countless stories about everything from Brahms Lullaby to Fifty Shades of Grey.Brahm's Lullaby is a case in point of the kinds of things Thompson explores in this book. It sounds very much like an Austrian folk melody--familiar elements with a gentle surprise and a ""hook."" Thompson observes that it has both the novel and the familiar and that this combination is crucial for a hit. Thompson explores the MAYA rule of designer Raymond Loewy, MAYA standing for Most Advanced Yet Acceptable. He implemented this principle on everything from mimeographs and trashbins to bullet-shaped train locomotives, Coldspot refrigerators, and Lucky Strike cigarette packs. Advanced yet familiar--and they all sold like crazy. Thompson goes on to show how this applies to music, movies like Star Wars, the rise of vampires and cable news, and phenomena like Taylor Swift and the laugh track on comedies.The other crucial element is distribution. Brahm's Lullaby became a global phenomenon because of German migrations to North America and elsewhere in the second half of the nineteenth century. Thompson explodes the myth of something going ""viral."" Instead, what often makes the difference is when a few figures who already have an audience promote something, millions here and then it takes off. And there is a hidden side of ""dark broadcasters"" whose unseen influence helped build the awareness of people like E. L. James of Fifty Shades fame. On the flip side, success is sometimes isolating the particular audience with an affinity to your product--homophily. What may be critical is knowing who are the friends of your audience. And sometimes, it is plain chaos, where Rock Around the Clock becomes the first rock 'n roll hit when a young boy, Peter Ford, buys the record, and a few months later through his father, Glenn Ford, plays the record for a director filming a movie titled Blackboard Jungle. The rest is history as a record (a ""B"" side!) that had gone nowhere suddenly became the anthem of a generation.What makes this book fascinating is that Thompson is a prolific story gatherer, introducing us to everyone from an obscure, but wealthy Impressionist artist, Caillebotte, whose collection became the Impressionist canon, to the people who have launched our social media blockbusters. He explores the backstory behind Game of Thrones and Mickey Mouse and the evolution of reading from books to the News Feed. He also raises profound questions about the transforming influence of the little plates of glass we carry about with us that connect us to the world, that both inform us, and constantly transmit information about us to those trying to shape the next ""hit.""It is here that I thought Thompson was at his most thought-provoking. He describes in the chapter ""Interlude: 828 Broadway"" visiting Chartbeat, that gave instantaneous feedback about reader behavior on websites. Downstairs from Chartbeat was the venerable Strand Bookstore. He asks ""Does great art begin with feedback, or does it start with the opposite--a quiet space, devoid of distractions, where creators can turn the spotlight inward and make something mostly for themselves?"" As both bibliophile and a new generation writer fluent with the online world, he wrestles with the implications for himself: ""I've come to see that I need the feedback loop, the standing ovation and devastating silences that can greet an online article. But when I circle a pile of books at the Strand, it's hard to avoid the conclusion that perhaps the best writers also knew to just do the work and forget, for a moment, that anyone would ever read their reverie. They mounted a stage production in their minds, but just for them, something palatial and private, like a daydream"" (pp. 280-281).The irony I'm struck with as I read Thompson's work is that excellence and originality in writing, art, music and innovation are not always what is rewarded. He observes the absence of good taste, and that the biggest hits are often re-boots of the familiar. The challenge today is that instantaneous nature of the feedback. Was it easier to practice artistic integrity when most likely you wouldn't be famous, a ""hit,"" until after you were dead? You might struggle with poverty as you ""did the work and forgot."" But were you tempted so greatly to bend the work to the feedback loop? Maybe this has always been the tension in which artists live. Perhaps it is a good thing that there is an element of randomness in all this or we might all be tempted too greatly, and all art and endeavor be reduced to pursuing the ""hit."""
4,110198032X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2711200-rose,1,"I am utterly confused why this book is so highly rated. My current hypothesis is that it falls for the trap of popularity driving familiarity (and driving distribution) and thus more popularity...this theory of familiarity is one which he spends a good deal of time discussing and rehashing. After 2/3 of the book, I have not found a single aha moment and it has been a slog to even get this far. I have enjoyed other books in this genre (Outliers, Give & Take, etc.) so I was surprised I couldn't find enjoyment in this one. I think there are two things that are making it impossible for me to finish this book: (1) the author's writing style feels particularly obtuse (he writes about his process of writing this book) (2) there is no analysis - since he is covering a smattering of topics within one book, it just boils down to a disjointed collection of anecdotes and high-level overviews"

9,110198032X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7009173-maddie,4,"I received an advance uncorrected proof of Hit Makers: The Science of Popularity in an Age of Distraction from a Goodreads giveaway. I haven't made a habit of reading much non-fiction in the past, because I've often found it either too dry, or, if interesting, poorly argued. Hit Makers didn't suffer from either of these issues, in my opinion. The book was both engaging and well-written (though it did have a handful of errors that I hope will be corrected before it hits shelves). The stories that Derek Thompson chose to include were compelling and served as strong support for his claims about popular culture and the genesis of hits. Ultimately, I wouldn't say that the book contained any earth-shattering revelations -- the conclusion seemed to be that hits are largely the result of luck and catching the right break at the right time -- but over all it was still a good read for the novel anecdotes and clear explanations of why popularity is so unpredictable.The advance copy that I received listed the release price at $28.00 USD, which is honestly much more than I would be willing to pay for it (or any other book of its type, really), especially because it's not the kind of book that I think anyone would be likely to read more than once. That said, it was entertaining and informative, which is what I think all books like it should strive to be. Hit Makers isn't a book that I probably would have picked up on my own, but I enjoyed reading it and would recommend it to anyone interested in pop culture and the ""science"" behind media trends. "
10,110198032X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/12162514-graeme-newell,5,"This was a delightful book. So many non-fiction reads are simply aggregations, rehashing old ideas. Thompson came at this book with some truly fresh thinking and new explanations for the baffling world of pop culture and buzz. Believe or not, there’s a lot of established scientific reasoning behind a top song, a popular politician or a bestselling book. I was deeply impressed with so many of his suppositions. Again and again, he came up with new ways to look at baffling patterns. His ideas made the crazy world of fickle human wants a lot less confusing.His writing style is casual and friendly. The book doesn’t spout theory, but uses fascinating stories about amazing people to illustrate very smart conclusions. He even narrated the audio book and did an impressive job. There’s nothing quite like when a smart author reads his own words. He brought a lot of life to the performance.I highly recommend this book. It tells fascinating human stories and provides real insight on the deeply human motivations and patterns that so often seem inexplicable. "
11,110198032X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/13774207-jordan-weissmann,5,"This is just a really excellent pop science book. Thompson is a talented story teller and lovely writer who breezily explains the psychological and economic forces that shape what we like. It's wide-ranging; he uses the making of Star Wars, impressionist art, ESPN, Disney, 50 Shades of Gray, early Rock n' Roll, and much more to illustrate the academic theories the book explores. It's full of wonderful little insights that explain things like why CNN went so overkill on Trump coverage during the primaries, or why catchy speeches mirror good song writing. At the same time, it resists oversimplification in a really satisfying way. If you're interested in the business of culture, or really culture period, I'd give it a read. "

What is the secret to making products that people will like-in music, movies, television, and more across the vast landscape of culture?2. Why do some products fail in the these marketplaces while similar ideas catch on and become massive hits? For the most part two questions were not definitively answered because, those are two very ambitious questions for anyone to answer. However, the data was well presented, engaging, thought-provoking and informative. As a digitial marketer, I learned a lot from this book. I recommend anyone who is in marketing and advertising to give this book a read. Also, if you are curious at heart, you will love this book. "
13,110198032X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/34262100-mike-zickar,3,"The book is a melange of interesting ideas and threads that, I felt, lacked a grand unifying structure. It was as if the author got excited about uncovering a new idea and left the thread that he was pursuing to go down another path. An interesting read despite this criticism. . ."
14,110198032X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/76105804-rick-wilson,2,"interesting stories with hot-stinky-garbage conclusions. Found myself wading through a lot of bad science for the rewards of great stories about Raymond Lowey, Gustave Caillebotte, and others. Funnily enough, about halfway through the author warns of trusting narratives too much, when it’s the cherry picked methodically unsound research in this book you should be wary of. For example, the discussion of ‭Gustave Caillebotte and the role he played in popularizing a specific set of impressionists was fascinating. But the authors attempt to back up to more globalized concepts failed. Quoting a badly thought out study with unconvincing results doesn’t help your core case. And when the whole books thesis rests on the “we like what is familiar” idea id hope that you would do better than to present garbage as your first supporting evidence. I don’t actually disagree with the thesis. I think a well done book on it would be interesting, but this book ain’t it chief. At one point the author breathlessly exclaims how “a study found 6 out of 10 people preferred art that was more popular when compared to art that was less popular.” Going on to describe how when presented with two paintings, people preferred the more familiar art. What? What kinda half baked study is that. How do you quantify any of it? How does that back your thesis? 6/10 sucks as a result unless you’re rocking some huge sample size. This continues throughout the book as the author has no regard for methodology or good research. Face, meet desk. desk, meet face. "
15,110198032X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/46716627-gerardo-leal,4,Very interesting book. Would definitely recommend it. Not because it provides the holy grail of hit-making (the book itself explains such a thing is de facto impossible) but for its anecdotes about controlled or completely random cultural hits across the modern history of the Western Hemisphere.
16,110198032X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/16508625-bobbie,4,"What makes something in our culture popular? Thompson takes the question and rolls it around in his palms, kneading and stretching it with a range of different examples and stories and ideas. Although he sometimes pulls the mixture too thin by adding extra characters (particularly in the second half) or fluffing out the page count (the Star Wars section feels overlong) this is an enjoyable pop science romp with an intellectual nod. Thompson does a great job of taking a question for which everybody wants an answer (""how can you manufacture popularity?""), and doing something hard: hinting at a complicated network of answers that reflects reality, not giving the simplistic solution that a pop-biz writer would dig out."

19,110198032X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2118933-leo-walsh,4,"""Hit Makers"" by Derek Thompson is an excellent, Malcolm Gawell-like book that examines what makes a hit. Using examples from many fields, from technology to ""Star Wars"" and pop music, Thompson settles on early 20th century Raymond Loey's formulation as best: We like things that are Most Advanced Yet Approachable: MAYA. He shows how George Lucas used MAYA, creating ""Star Wars,"" a mashup of western, ""Buck Rogers,"" WW II fighter film, pulp sci-fi and comic books. What's more, Lucas consciously took Joseph Campbell's idea of the 'monomyth,' that every myth is essentially a retelling of the same story, and used that to create the plot. Thompson goes on to apply the MAYA concept to dozens of other fields. What's more, unlike many writers of the self-help books like this, he also acknowledges the role of luck. For despite being great and a perfect example of MAYA, a work may fizzle due to a lack of network. He uses many examples garnered from the tech industry (Instagram and dating sites) to illustrate. Most intriguing, though, is how Thompson destroys the notion of ""viral marketing."" Since there are many marketing gurus who purport to teach the secret of creating a viral marketing campaign. They sell the idea that anyone can become viral. They sell the idea of the digital utopia where one person infects the people he or she knows, saying ""Dude, you have got to read this new book."" This is the one-to-one (or many-to-many) theory of virality. When in truth, research shows that things that become viral do so because an already popular figure tweets praise for a book, song, movie, post, etc. So despite the hype, web 2.0 is just like the pre-web. Marketing is still a one-to-many affair, with celebs with a huge following creating the ""virality.""All told, a fun and thought-provoking pop-science/ self-help/ marketing read. Four-stars. "
20,110198032X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/33275759-elena,5,"Derek Thompson narrated the audiobook himself. I enjoyed the content of the book and the delivery of it equally and inestimably. So that I immediately started the book again as soon as I finished it (practice I discovered just recently as a necessity to prepare for a presentation on a business book and found to be enjoyable when reaching places that I knew I supposed to remember but I did not at all or I when unearthing richer nuances, etc. … in a word, interesting (experience), recommend to try with a book one really liked. This book would be a good example. I will try to implement the formula to the delivery of my analytical output at the office and also when selling an idea/task to my family and friends.

21,110198032X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/732347-kelly,0,"What a fascinating book about what it is that makes some things succeed and reach ""hit"" status. At times a bit repetitive -- how many times can I hear about the sports channels really being the biggest money makers of television? -- but the takeaways are really worthwhile. Loved the idea of fluency and disfluency and how what people love is having something which changes one piece of a familiar story, rather than trying to change multiple pieces (or if you change all of them, you make a spoof). If you've ever wondered why 50 SHADES got hugely successful or how Lucas created such a successful franchise in STAR WARS, this is a book for you. Probably one that is better on audio than in print. Thompson reads it himself, and there's a section about how repetition of words can become musical, and he sings it, giving a life to his point that wouldn't come across the same way in print. Glad Janssen (everyday-reading.com) raved about this. Worth reading, for sure. "

Why we like some things and dislike others. How there are both external and internal factors. It's easy to see its relevance in today's society of Facebook and Twitter and Spotify and Tik Tok. It is intriguing to peer into why things become popular. Loved it even though it took me a while 😬"

25,110198032X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/41901229-gary-moreau,5,"I bought this book because it was already popular, a behavior predicted early in the book itself. Having said that, I thoroughly enjoyed it. It’s well written, witty, very energetic, and thoroughly researched. I’d share it on my Twitter feed if I had more than eight followers. (The good news from Thompson is that I’m not alone.)The question of what drives hitdom can be esoteric to the point of incomprehension when the psycho-sociologists wrestle with it, or dry as burnt toast when the statisticians do. Thompson, however, addresses the question anecdotally, using facts and figures to fill in the blanks. The result makes for very relatable reading.As a sexagenarian who lived in China for much of the last decade I have to admit that some of his cultural references were totally lost on me, but that’s certainly not the author’s fault. We learn at many levels concurrently and this book taught me a lot.I particularly liked the section devoted to the debunking of the myth that anything really goes viral on the Internet. It makes sense. Far better to be friends with Kim Kardashian, if you want to be famous, than it is to think you’re going to come up with the world’s cleverest meme.And someone finally gave us the full story on the historic success of Fifty Shades of Grey, although he kept to the marketing issues and wisely didn’t try to explore the deeper issue of why that content was so enthusiastically received. And, yes, I did read it. As a devout reader I felt I had to, given its incredible success. That, too, was predicted by Thompson.If you are trying to market yourself as an artist or author Hit Makers is a must read plus. It’s filled with money quotes. Here’s one: “Publicly, people often talk about issues. Privately, they talk about schedules. Publicly, they deploy strategic emotions. Privately, they tend to share small troubles. Publicly, they want to be interesting. Privately, they want to be understood.”Following the laws of Pareto, authors typically spend most of their time on the first and last paragraphs of a book. Between those bookends, some books start strong and lose steam. Others pick up momentum as they go. This one follows the latter trajectory and is well worth the reader’s investment and patience. "
26,110198032X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/29328847-michael-payne,5,"Content may be king, distribution is the kingdom. - Derek ThompsonQuality most certainly matters, but quality that never plays before an audience more certainly never matters in any real sense of mattering. Hits are by their nature good, but many other artists in any category may be similarly 'good'. The move from good to truly great has everything to do with the very human nature of herding.Derek looks at French impressionist art, the nature of literary hits, the radical change in the billboard top 100 all to reinforce that patterns of hits. Certainly there are patterns of repetition, there are proven tricks of many trades, and there are also patterns of not so viral distribution.If you are a creator, or would be creator, you should read this book and think not just about its content but also the 'context' of the hits you know and love.To answer the age old question: If a tree falls in a forest, with nobody around to hear, nobody will ever know if it truly makes a sound."
27,110198032X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1266077-stephen-gallup,4,"One question that has continued to puzzle me is why one creative product becomes enormously popular while another that's very similar, or even better, does not. Some time ago the question led me to read 
Contagious: Why Things Catch On
. That book is worthwhile, and has some overlap with this one, but I didn't put it down with the kind of new insight that might be put to practical use.Recently, I've grumbled more than usual about what seems to be a dearth of creativity both in new movies (most of which are sequels or prequels of hits, remakes of classics, or dramatizations of familiar cartoons) and in traditionally published books (mostly clones of recent bestsellers). I blamed gatekeepers who want to play it safe by continuing to milk ideas that have already paid off. This bothered me because, as far as new books are concerned at least, I see a fair amount of fresh, high-quality material, much of it in manuscript form, that goes nowhere while mediocre stuff is fasttracked to the top. I can remember crappy books from decades ago that also became fantastic commercial successes, so the phenomenon isn't new. But the path forward for creative people focused on originality and quality seems more elusive than ever.I read Hit Makers in hopes of understanding the rules for commercial success. Derek Thompson immediately acknowledged the truth of my concern. On the subject of pop music, he says for every hit there may be a hundred equally good songs that never take off. Those that succeed often do so because of unpredictable chains of events, which Thompson illustrates with stories. I like the one about ""Rock Around the Clock,"" as performed by Bill Haley and His Comets. Decca Records put it on the B side of a song Haley hadn't even wanted to record, and it did not sell well. But then a year later a movie producer needed an example of ""youth music"" for the soundtrack of a film he was making, and he asked a friend for suggestions. That friend's son happened to have the disk. The producer used it, and suddenly movie audiences everywhere were clamoring to buy that record. Wikipedia now calls it ""the song that, more than any other, brought rock and roll into mainstream culture around the world.""But how could anyone hope to engineer THAT kind of path to success?Well, the primary lesson seems to be that we miss the boat in trying to make something ""go viral"" via retweets, friend recommendations, and Facebook likes. Thompson points to research showing all that to be a waste of time, in comparison with a single vector such as the above movie. Likewise, if Justin Bieber tweets about your youtube video, you're likely to get a bunch of hits—but only because he has a vast following. So ""contagion"" in this sense is top-down. You have to get in front of an audience like Oprah's.(If like me you say ""Justin who?"" and have never once watched Oprah, it may be that you're so far outside the mainstream as to be a lost cause.)Another lesson is that the appeal of the thing being promoted depends on an interplay between its newness and its familiarity. Star Wars was ""the sum of a thousand stories."" George Lucas could not have created it without prior immersion in sources like Flash Gordon and tv Westerns. And audiences would not have responded to it without the same cultural background. Shakespeare too used old plot lines that were familiar to his audience.But a successful product is not just derivative. There has to be a new twist, which is the reason pitches to publishers and studio execs typically evoke multiple prior hits, each with its fan base (The Girl on the Train meets Jack Reacher?).Incidentally, much of Shakespeare's appeal is in the beauty of his language, and likewise clever word play is fundamental to many successful slogans for politicians (""the choice for change"") and products (""melts in your mouth, not in your hands""). I agree with Thompson that a real hazard exists when people substitute a memorable turn of phrase for critical thinking. The process that makes something widely popular does not necessarily bring forth something of real value. Nevertheless, he indulges in his own word play in saying ""hits familiarize the strange and estrange the familiar.""It's interesting that Thompson points to his own book as an example of a creation that repackages familiar material. Unfortunately from my perspective, in putting his personal stamp on the topic, he heavily favors areas of personal interest to him, such as pop music and tv shows, at the expense of the area I care about (books). Aside from marveling over the absurd popularity of Fifty Shades of Grey, he ignores the book world altogether. On the other hand, basic principles seem to apply across the board. I endeavored to pick them out. So here's another lesson: Rankings matter. People will buy something simply because they understand it to be popular. Many of the tens of millions(!) who bought Fifty Shades were not even readers; they just wanted to be in on a cultural phenomenon. (I've observed that issue previously regarding another title.) What's worse is that rankings can be manipulated to exploit this tendency. (I saw that happen as well, e.g., in the microcosm of a now-defunct forum once hosted by Harper-Collins.)And another: Success is largely dependent on ""the quality of the people around the artist,"" i.e., the artist's contacts and mentors. ""Your network is your power."" Typically, a major hit carries the mark not only of its creator but also of some enabler. In the case of Disney, to pick a particularly interesting example, that enabler was the guy who came up with the idea of merchandising the cartoons (creating Mickey Mouse watches, for example), which in turn funded Disney's first feature film, Snow White. Eventually, everything Disney produced (e.g., its tv show) served to generate enthusiasm for other Disney products (e.g., the theme park). At times it seems Thompson buries the basic principles in his anecdotes and other meanderings. The book feels almost like a vanity project. Still, there are insights to be gained, depressing though I found them. I should've read this in print rather than in audio format, because some passages deserve rereading whereas I wanted to skip others (and did impatiently eject one of the CDs)."
28,110198032X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/36143766-tikiri-herath,5,"Excellent read. I'm still digesting the lessons from this shrewdly insightful book. I found the information in here to be invaluable as I began to reflect on my own efforts to spread my message to my audience as both an artist and an entrepreneur. I will have to listen to this book again or read it with a highlighter in hand to fully grasp the concepts I can apply to my business.My biggest takeaway for now is how we, humans, yearn for the familiar, for what we are used to seeing or listening or reading, but we want it to come with a surprise that will bring novelty into our lives. This is not an easy balance to achieve, but it's certainly what I will be meditating on as I plot my next thriller series. What I loved most about this book was a few pages into the audio version, I realised the author doesn't just share his ideas but he demonstrates them within the structure, composition and narration of the book itself. Well done. Very well done indeed. Now back to page one to start re-reading. "

It was full of facts and statistics but always supremely readable with a surprisingly breezy style. There were plenty of anecdotes about companies we all know, like Facebook and Disney, but also a lot of less-familiar stories that will be new to almost everybody. I'm glad I took the time to read this book, and I'm going to apply some of what I've read to advancing my own brand as a writer.(Note: I received an advance uncorrected proof of this book through a Goodreads First Reads giveaway.)"

I read this book in small bits over a couple of months, but I think I would have gotten more out of it had I read it in one or two sittings. The writer seems young (I know he's young from the photo on the jacket cover, his writing doesn't sound young) and smart, so I took his theories and explanations at face value, but I think it would be fun to read this book in a book club and really explore the ideas in more depth. Also, I love the jacket design of this book."

34,110198032X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2092969-miriam,2,"I don't really know what I was expecting, but this book was not what I thought it was going to be. I think I thought, based on the TITLE, it would be more about MAKING hits--like the thought processes that go into the works that have become hits, not just the hits themselves, the things that are popular. There's some science. As for the ""Age of Distraction,"" also not so much. Did you know that screens have proliferated and that people have more entertainment, communication, and information options than ever? Yeah, so did I. This book doesn't cover the unique features of the age of distraction or what ""distraction"" even means--I doubt that word comes up even a handful of times.So he click-baited me with the title. Which brings me to my next point. When he explains terms like ""click bait"" or how Facebook's news feed works, or what Spotify is, I would guess that I'm not this book's target audience by about 15 years. I'm too young for something again! Yay! I found the book poorly organized--it's thematic, but only loosely. So he jumps around in time and space and medium--he covers impressionist art, movies, and recent music hits in a chapter. Then sometimes he recycles anecdotes in later chapters.This book could have used an edit. You don't have to say ""This earned only a tenth of 750,000, or 75,000."" I KNOW WHAT A TENTH IS. Or he introduces the concept of the ""aesthetic aha"" and then later introduces the woman who coined the term and then repeats his definition of what it is. IT'S NOT THAT COMPLICATED.While some of the scientific studies that he glosses in the first half of the book are interesting, for the most part, if you've been paying attention to entertainment patterns in the last ten years, you know a lot of this stuff. And some of the science itself, while the studies are useful for confirming assumptions, of course, is basic. Did you know that people want things that are familiar with just a hint of the new? Did you know that most of The Kids now get their news from Facebook? A lot of his anecdotes are tired. Did you know that George Lucas used a bunch of allusions to create Star Wars, or that it almost didn't get made? (Don't even get me started on his lengthy rehashing of Joseph Campbell's The Hero With a Thousand Faces) Oh, and hits are hits because of a lot of factors plus luck and timing.Then there are the bad jokes. Toward the end there's this lengthy passage about how radio didn't kill books and the internet didn't kill TV and a bunch of other media didn't kill a bunch of other, earlier media, and then...you guessed it: video didn't kill the radio star. And he stole the last line of Lolita for his last line, adding magic sprinkle dust. Phbbbbt. I think having the author narrate it was also irritating: he seemed to think that his work was deep and meaningful and resonant and deserving on emphasis and ponderous pauses. Blecch.This book doesn't know what it wants to be. Is it science writing for a mainstream audience? Is it a how-to book for would-be hitmakers? Is it a summary of hits? And analysis? It's least of all an analysis, if for no other reason than his conclusions are so banal. At one point he says, ""None of this is new,"" and I shouted out loud, alone in my car, ""I KNOW."" He might come back and tell me that people want repetition and very few new ideas, but I think he needs to remix his own formula for a hit. Disney is a media giant, and his admiration is clear. But there's never an attempt to wrestle with the dimensions of art: if self-proclaimed artists create it and the people lap it up, it's art. He mentions the intersection of art and commerce a few times, but not to define meaningfully either one or what might actually happen AT that intersection. His work concludes that words and ideas and hits have power and that if we were all a little more aware of structure (how repetition creates musicality that can be used to ""sell"" us all kinds of ideas) we'd be more immune to bad ideas. And for a book that was written and came out when it did, it's ridiculously apolitical and uncritical of all the machinery that manipulate the creation and selling of hits. This is not to say that a critical attitude is necessary in all cases or about all subjects. But if we're supposed to be more aware of advertising manipulation and crowd behavior, but are supposed to take him at his word that all these ""hits"" are also ""art,"" something is missing here.A final note that irritated me: he does that thing where instead of using the masculine pronoun for the general audience, he uses the feminine one. This I do not have a problem with. But he doesn't do it consistently. So, at one point he summarizes what a hypothetical artist might do, he used ""he."" Later, when discussing several average behaviors of people, some of which were presented in a negative but understandable light (like the TV viewer who mindlessly watches as much programming as SHE can), he used ""she."" So he's all enlightened and balanced, but his bias is showing. Shut up, book."
35,110198032X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4350143-stephanie,4,"Fascinating! Derek Thompson has done a great job of making this subject fun to read about without falling too hard into the unscientific pop-sci book traps. It sounds like the people he interviewed for the book were good choices, and they kept him from jumping to untrue conclusions. In a footnote, Thompson wrote: I've tried to be careful in my drafting to select stories that illustrate the most universally established and rested principles—like exposure effect—rather than go about things in the opposite way, by finding stories that are interesting and then hunting for theories to shoehorn inside them.I appreciate this approach tremendously. It makes the text more credible and useful without sacrificing readability.I learned a lot from this book. People like what they know, simply because they know it. That's the mere exposure effect. They also like what other people seem to like, which is how top-40 radio tends to work. ""This song is popular, so it must be good."" But people also love things that are new: the latest fashions and gadgets and tunes. The MAYA rule, ""Most Advanced Yet Acceptable"" is the idea that creators should come up with things that are unusual and yet familiar in order to push people out of their Goldilocks zone in a way that they'll go along with and enjoy.Thompson posits that we should try to create things that people will want to share with one another. Think about the audience of your audience. And yet, he demonstrates that the idea of ""viral hits"" is almost a myth. Things don't spread on the internet in the viral fashion we're meant to believe they do. Usually, they are featured by a few popular sources—celebrities, news sites, storefronts—and broadcast to a huge audience all at once. I loved the discussion of 50 Shades of Gray and how it became the most popular book of all time thanks to its built-in audience, the fact that people couldn't stop talking about it, and people's desire to be in the loop. I bought and read that book, myself, simply because I wanted to know what the fuss was about!I also found it extremely interesting to realize that the way Facebook, now the #1 source of news for most people, tailors users' news feeds to make them optimally pleasurable for each user, feeds into our tendency to seek confirmation of the biases we already hold. As we scroll Facebook, we see what we like to see—what we find cute and what makes us feel validated and certain of the things we believe in. Facebook helps us tune out all the rest, and I think they're doing us a huge disservice. They're widening divides between us and allowing our minds to narrow, even as we become more and more dependent on Facebook. Strange that even with all that custom tailoring, looking at Facebook tends to make people less happy. Something needs to change, and I think the responsibility falls squarely on Facebook itself.There were so many other interesting things in this book. I have so little time to re-read things, but I'd love to maybe listen to this one in audiobook form some day just to pick up a few more tidbits. Definitely recommended for anyone who has a hand in creating something that needs to find its audience."

Rarely is there a true overnight success.Really enjoyed the author's take on popularity and the case studies he presented as examples of each type of success story.Starting with Brahms Lullaby, which owes it's viral sensation not just to a catchy tune, but the emigration of German citizens to the United States in the latter part of the 1800's, Thompson drops some though bombs on you that make you pause and go . . . HUH! Beethovan's 9th symphony premiered in Germany and then took many years before being played for the first time in the American Colonies. Even longer to go be played in England--29 years-- to be played in England.Thompson breaks down the ""viral"" success of 50 shades of Gray, Rock Around the Clock and that infamous powerhouse of marketing--Disney.Hits have a few things in common--they are a little bit familiar (and we prefer it that way) but includes a surprise, a twist.Shakespeare knew this well. None of his plays were original plots--but his take on them created the twist on familiar, with surprises that delighted audiences for centuriesEven now, I like Hamlet, a LOT, but part of the reason I like it is because so many cliches and quotes are from that play. Listening to it is like navigating a library filled with old friends. And yet, there are the surprises. Shakespeare continues to surprise, even if it's through the vision of an edgy new director or producer.RECOMMEND"
37,110198032X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1982249-milka,4,"The synopsis for Derek Thompson's book instantly caught my attention -- not only does it point towards a phenomenon that I find extremely interesting (how certain books, movies, songs, etc. become popular while other just as good pieces of entertainment do not), it also is a book that deals with issues related closely to my studies. If you are like me, and find the idea of reading about how popularity is generated in contemporary society, and perhaps how it has been generated in the years part, Thompson's book is must-read!""The thesis of this book is that even though many number one songs, television shows, blockbuster films, Internet memes, and ubiquitous apps seem to come out of nowhere, this cultural chaos is governed by certain rules: the psychology of why people like what they like, the social networks through which ideas spread, and the economies of cultural markets. There is a way for people to engineer hits and, equally important, a way for other people to know when popularity is being engineered""  (quote from the review copy) The thesis of Thomson's research and the way he goes through what he mentions as the influencers of popularity, such as the psychology of why people like what they like and the process of engineering hits are done in an interesting, well-researched manner.Thompson makes use of stories, of famous events from the history, as well as some little less famous anecdotes, to highlight the critical arguments he is making. He never delves extremely deep into different media theories (which is something I would have liked to see once in a while) and this makes the book highly readable also for those who have no media studies/popular culture studies/etc. background. Importantly, Thompson spends quite a lot of time making arguments about consumer behavior and how certain behavioral patterns/practices have shaped the way in which producers of cultural products have acted. According to Thompson,""Most consumers are simultaneously neophilic -- curious to discover new things -- and deeply neophobic -- afraid of anything that's too new. The best hit makers are gifted at creating moments of meaning by marrying new and old, anxiety and understanding. They are architects of familiar surprises."" (quote from the review copy)The marriage of old and new, of familiar and unfamiliar, can be seen for example in the way previously loved movies and movie franchises are being adapted to a new generation of viewers. For example, the upcoming Beauty and the Beast adaptation will include elements of the old and loved movie (the songs, the story), but will also include something new, such as the live action element and a more independent, feminist Belle. Earlier in 2016, Ghostbusters was adapted to a new set of audiences but arguably failed to some degree (at least in the eyes of male viewers) by being too unfamiliar as a result of straining too far away from the original movie.According to Thompson, the story of how a product is distributed is just as important as a description of its features. Due to social media, the distribution of songs, images, written word, and so on, has become increasingly easier -- everyone with a computer/phone/tablet and an internet connection has a chance to start a blog and publish their thoughts online, but not everyone gains the kind of audiences that would turn those blogs popular. In fact, it is quite rare for an individual to actually become ""popular"".Videos of people singing covers of famous songs are in multitude on Youtube, but once in a while, megastars like Justin Bieber are plucked out of that multitude and turned into global phenomenons. While people often tend to have quite strong, either positive or negative, feelings towards Justin Bieber, I cannot help but to find the story of how he became popular fascinating, and how Youtube and other social media platforms really helped him in getting his name out there.I am writing my master's degree about television comedy narratives and their relationship with the evolution of television from broadcast to narrowcast and from broadcast to VOD. While Thompson does not discuss this topic extensively, it was nice to see it mentioned. The phenomenon of how television has evolved from a screen in the corner of a living room into something that people can carry with them in their pocket is extremely interesting, and one that will most likely be the topic of several books to be written in the future.Those interested in politics might want to check out Thompson's arguments about the relationship between Donald Trump and the press. While the rise of Trump will probably be analyzed by thousands of writers and academics in the months and years to come, I thought Thompson's decision to include a brief section of the topic to this book is very timely and will probably make a lot of readers think about the relationship between politics and media. Thompson writes about Trump and media in the following manner""The GOP candidate with the least elite support, Donald Trump, spent less than $20 million on advertising. But he still won the primary in a landslide, because his outrageous statements and improbable candidacy were such irresistible fodder for networks and publishers desperate for audiences. Through the summer of 2016, Trump had earned $3 billion in ""free media"", which was more than the rest of his rivals combined."" There is honestly so much in this book I could pick up and talk about in this review, but at the same time, I feel like I don't want to give too much away. Sure, this is a nonfiction book, so there are really no spoilers there, but at the same time, I would like potential readers to have the kind of interesting and exciting reading experience I had with this one. Due to my academic background, there was a lot here that I knew already, but I feel like that didn't really take anything away from the reading experience. After all, one of the best things about reading about something you already know is seeing how someone else presents their arguments and how some theories and so on can be understood in different ways.

38,110198032X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1054712-kent-winward,4,"Maybe the most interesting thing from this book is the fact that ""going viral"" is a myth. A post or video doesn't go viral, it is broadcast. This corresponded to my experience with a couple of personal brushes with so-called viral-ity. My brother became ground zero in the entire flower beard meme when Kirsten Dunst as the broadcaster re-posted his wife's instagram post. My wife wrote a campaign video  that went ""viral"" and had 125,000 hits in no time when it was shown on the Lawrence O'Donnell show. In each case, the burst in interest started with the broadcast.Certainly luck plays an important part in getting attention. Much of this book covered territory that is well worn in marketing books. The fact is predictability and replication are illusive."

(290)"
40,110198032X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/16212136-peter-pete-mcloughlin,4,"History of how ideas spread. Spends a lot of time on the idea of fluency. Things that are popular tend to be things we are familiar with. That is how certain artworks become iconic, certain ideas become widespread, and music that is catchy will have a hook repeated over and over. It also touches on habituation if things get too repetitive then we get bored or they become tedious. So we like familiar stuff and tend to remember it and we get bored with too much repetition. That is the heart of the book and how these traits of catchiness have upsides and serious downsides."
41,110198032X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2533305-rae,3,"Hit Makers is everything I wanted You May Also Like to be, a readable inquiry into why people like the things they do en masse. Where You May Also Like was dry and I ultimately abandoned it, Hit Makers did a good job of tying in interesting anecdotes and real life examples. There were several parts in this book that I either had to put it down so I could tell my husband some interesting fact I learned (there is a good chunk of Star Wars related info in this book, something my husband cares *deeply* about) or had to bookmark a page to remember to tell him about later. I love when a non-fiction book is giving you information so good you have to share it. It's only getting three stars because while I enjoyed it, I was still able to put it down for long stretches of time. The book also attempted to cover A LOT of material, sometimes at the expense of the content's continuity. It sometimes seemed a little scattered or jumped subjects in an incongruous way. Recommend to fans of pop sociology, anyone who wonders how Spotify chooses music for them, or who thinks they really have a chance of going viral (spoiler alert, you don't!)."
42,110198032X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/10923764-jim-elyot,5,"Need time to digest this. Derek Thompson uses stories to deliver his thesis about how nearly every overnight sensation, takes time, effort, luck, and above all else, great networking skills. I was happily surprised to find that his theories of virality closely echo what we in the Top 40 Radio Industry practised for years.I also learned a lot about unknown French Impressionists, Disney's secret weapon, and how MAGA kinda follows MAYA."
43,110198032X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/56813905-katie,4,"I really enjoyed this book. Though, I do feel like a lot of the chapters were framed as answering a distinct question, but actually came to the same conclusions that didn't always match the central question in multiple chapters. However, it was a really fun read with lots of quirky anecdotes. A fun book about popular culture and that what makes a product or content become popular hasn't really changed over centuries. "
44,110198032X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/27005339-michael-neno,3,"Derek Thompson's Hit Makers dissects various routes to popularity (and failure) with a promise the book ultimately doesn't fulfill. The first half features fascinating background history on George Lucas, Brahms and the canonization of impressionist painters. The more the collection delves into recent times, though, the more it traffics in cliches, insultingly obvious truths and vague contradictions. It's also repetitive. I plowed through to the end, but don't recommend you do so. "
45,110198032X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/51619403-danielle,4,A good dose of recurring anecdotes to drive home his points about our desire for more of the same with a tinge of difference (fluency and disfluency) which should motivate us to create MAYA(most advanced yet acceptable) products. The analysis of how things actually get viral reveals the importance of getting buy in from certain key networks and players when thinking about distribution plans. 
46,110198032X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/11130213-gigi-huynh,5,"If you work in communications or in the media industry, this book has many enlighting insights into the complex spectrum of human needs in the era of abundance of information.It also includes many compelling stories that explain concepts in an efficient way. Coming from a hardcore consumer of content, this book gave many healthy notions and useful new perspectives."
47,110198032X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/10441985-jonathan,4,"A light-hearted look at the modern process of how and why certain works of art become wildly popular, while other do not. The first half of the book is devoted to the applied psychology of what we really like and why we do so. The second closely examines the various technologies and platforms that support the hit-making. I recommend this book, if you like this sort of thing. "
48,110198032X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1170248-fadilah,3,"If you have no time to read, just flip to the last chapter, and the summary (plus some short stories) is there. Basically, I enjoyed reading this book, with lots of stories around hitmakers, including 50 Shades of Grey writer, and my favourite Disney. And I took many highlights as I found numerous sweet quotes. Hit, or something viral, unbelievably exist in this chaos market, especially in the cultural economy. And don't forget MAYA. "
49,110198032X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/15147508-geoff-orr,5,"A great cross-genre explanation of what it takes to make something popular, and how things sometimes become popular without the work. A really interesting look at some of the stories behind things that I never knew history of their popularity. "
50,110198032X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6829351-lance,4,"I've always considered trying to provide a formula for inducing popularity, on the whole, just about impossible. It seemed more of a lucky break scenario for someone who's busting butt, and someone else just like them might not go anywhere.This read was an excellent look at some of the specifics that help make or break an idea though. It does a fine job of details human attraction, attention, stated vs hidden desires, and more on the engineer-able level. Lessons exist here that could help produce stronger ideas in the first place. That alone would be worth the price of admission.Happily, Derek also addresses more of the difficult to control elements such as marketing, distribution, competition, and the like. It turns into a bit of a history and business book part way through with a splash of marketing. This information is useful, but a bit more commonly understood.What kept me from going 5 stars was the lack of information on things that did not succeed. Ideas that had all the right elements, but for one reason or another, just never made it. Analysis of those would seem the best possible close to me. For sheer giggles, have a look over the psychology of survivor bias in decision making.Bonus: Read by the author, and his intonations are fantastic."

56,110198032X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/612636-beth,4,"This was an interesting listen! I liked hearing the stories of Brahms' Lullaby, the impressionist painters, cable, Seinfeld, R&B, Star Wars, Facebook, Fifty Shades of Grey, Disney and more -- how they grew in popularity thanks to a few key factors and a lot of luck. The things we like are determined by just the right balance of the familiar and the novel, and every once in awhile something hits on that. But it's more than content; big hits also get big because of a network, and the way we network is changing in the information era. I really liked thinking about all of this; totally interesting.The audio book is narrated by the author, and I felt like that added a lot to the experience. Just a little bit of extra inflection."

Derek Thompson uses thorough research, intellectual language, and astute analysis as he looks at pop culture and traces for us the stories and trends that allowed certain things to become hits. If you like Malcolm Gladwell’s writing style this book will be right up your alley. If you do anything with young people or our in advertising/public relations/marketing you should read this book. "
