0,0871403773,http://goodreads.com/user/show/13365236-james-dittmar,3,"Wilson does an excellent job at summarizing some very important pieces of advice in science. He espouses the importance of the ""prepared mind"", the necessity of in depth and general knowledge of the subject area, and the benefits of being passionate about your area of interest. He provides some encouraging remarks for students who do not excel at math, and some observations about the importance of IQ in science (he actually argues that a high IQ may be harmful because it does not necessitate that the individual persevere).But his advice is not broadly applicable to all types of scientists. Wilson is a naturalist--he derives questions about the world based on observations in nature. He then thinks about possible ways in which those phenomena occurred. While this path worked for Wilson, I don't think it is the only possible meaningful path. Molecular biologists, as an example, spend very little time in the ""natural"" world, and instead focus on phenomena that are difficult to observe with our unaided senses. He also categorizes faculty as fitting into one of two categories: the insiders and the outsiders. He recommends that budding scientists opt for the latter, and eschew, as much as possible, teaching responsibilities and departmental obligations beyond serving on a thesis committee. He also advocates against so-called think-tanks, and instead recommends a more solitary approach, catering especially to the introvert.I don't think that his advice is wrong, but I also don't think it is balanced. This book is basically a case study of a successful scientist, and I think it should be viewed as such, rather than a general book of advice. And as a scientist, I wished he would have provided more reasoning as to why he makes specific recommendations or at least provide more examples that support his claims."
1,0871403773,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4110877-chrissy,2,"This books should more accurately be titled ""Letters to a very young field biologist,"" or ""Anecdotes from an entomologist that may only be of minimal interest if you have no interest in bugs.""Thankfully, it was a quick read.E. O. Wilson is clearly a successful and prolific scientist, but success in biology does not good-general-science-advice make. It's always interesting, to me, to hear about how researchers started their careers. Oftentimes it's encouraging to learn that some favourite minds fell into their fields by sheer chance, by randomly uncovered passion or talents, or by circuitous routes through esoteric areas of knowledge or counterculture. Wilson, on the other hand, wanted to be exactly what he become since childhood and followed a very standard route to get there: beginning as a boy scout and camp counsellor and ending up at Harvard. This is as straightforward an origin story as a scientist gets, and, while admirable, the story of a very precocious passion and intelligence followed linearly through to PhD has little to offer any student who didn't find their passion early on. Most scientists will not set their life trajectory by age 9, and most certainly will not go to an Ivy League school. Most, moreover, will not study biology. Some of us who consider ourselves scientists do not even study the ""natural"" sciences (gasp!).I was disappointed, as a young scientist, to find a book of this title written decidedly not for me."
2,0871403773,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6293108-daniel-mchugh,5,"""Letters to a Young Scientist"" might easily be mistaken as a call for young Americans to take up arms on the scientific battlefield in the fight to conquer the unknown. To be sure, Wilson pushes for a greater understanding of the scientific community by the youth of his homeland. He touches on how misunderstood the sciences have become to both our students and the institutions which teach them. However, the overarching argument in ""Letters to a Young Scientist"" is not actually directed at the privileged class of young people lucky enough to enter the wealthy institutions of higher learning in the richest country in the world. Actually, just like his work in biodiversity, Wilson casts a wide net, pleading to any and all who will listen about the dire need the human species is facing in the realm of science. Wilson appears to couch his argument in a finely tuned explanation of how science is not solely the realm of the extraordinary. In truth, argues the author, to be successful in science one must simply possess an inquisitive mind, the passion to persist and the discernment to know when to call on others for help. This argument will definitely bolster the courage of any B student to stay in the fight a bit longer, but beneath the facade lies the true genius of Wilson's book. Science is not done yet. Gazing around our wide world, many a young person might find little to conquer. Our standard of living has reached heights unimaginable to our ancestors. Outside of a few major diseases and the occasional flare up of emergencies, there is little left that a scientist might hope to conquer and leave a mark like Salk, Curie or Edison. That is where Wilson is his most persuasive. His descriptions of our ignorance concerning our own planet are profound let alone his descriptions of what little we know of the cosmos, particle science or the other major branches in the scientific tree. He cites example after example of mountains to be climbed in the scientific universe. In addition, Wilson heaps the threats of global warming, massive overpopulation, extinction, ecological devastation, and energy dependence on the fires of our need. These threats make our need for advancements in science even greater. In short, Wilson's ""Letters"" are a passionate plea for everyone to wake up, step from the numbing comfort of second half of the 20th century and forge ahead into the bright new future of science before the inventions of that comfortable period pull us past the point of no return.  "
3,0871403773,http://goodreads.com/user/show/82365956-veronica,2,"I wanted to like this. Unfortunately, Wilson's cavalier attitude about the life of insects is too typical of biologists and distressing to me. He recommends that a curious scientist crush a honeybee üêù to observe the alarm pheromone. Perhaps‚Äîto some‚Äîthe notion of crushing the head of a little bee and destroying its organs is commonplace. His defense that a worker bee has only the lifetime of a month does little to help‚Äîthe monarch butterflies live similarly brief lifestyles, and I do not think ephemerality implies insignificance. He is not a philosopher of ethics, so I suppose I cannot fully expect sophisticated moral reasoning (again, the fact that a worker bee is ""one of thousands"" is not a reason to kill it‚ÄîI, too, am one of many.)Maybe it is a flaw with systemizing thinkers at large. I have a deep respect for the systemizing impulse, but the existence of an immortal will certainly does not imply that the individual has no worth.

WilsonAn interesting book - not least for those of us doing and communicating science.Adding to it I have two long standing concerns:1) There is an important distinction between science and scientists. The former (science) is a collective outcome of a process that broadly swims towards an improved understanding of some abstract and probably unattainable truth. It's knocked sideways from time to time by a big wave - but mostly and soon the process of science puts it back on a more reasoned course.Periodically the wave overwhelms the earlier course and establishes a new and more robust direction from which the incremental process of day to day science again progresses."

Needless to say, as a young scientist myself I went to get it immediately. I couldn't read it until know, and boy, was I missing out!What's the book about?Edward Wilson is a renowned scientist, particularly in the fields of entomology and sociobiology. He has won several prizes, including a Pulitzer, and in this book he shares his views as how he ""made it"" in science. From making the decision to work in science through the difficulties of the scientific method, up to that inevitable moment when you doubt yourself, Wilson talks about how he felt, how he confronted different challenges, all while talking directly to the readerFinal thoughtsI took so much from this book. I realised half way through that I was taking a quote from almost every single mini chapter. There were moments when I put the book down and sight deeply because I identified with the struggle he was describing; moments were I felt like tears might be coming because I felt like a sweet grandfather was holding my hand and telling me everything would be ok. The book opens with this line: You made the right choice [...] the world needs you --badly.I'm telling you people, some days you really wonder if you did make the right choice, getting into science, because is so easy to get discouraged, with experiments that won't work, people that will doubt the very core of your ideas...but you have to go on, and this book is full of encouragement. I would highly recommend this book to everyone with a career in science, whether they are starting, in the middle or retiring; for these last ones, I'm sure it will bring you fond memories of when you were just beginning in this path. "
6,0871403773,http://goodreads.com/user/show/21942593-evan-kristiansen,3,"Letter's to a young scientist should be re-titled as ""Letters to a young person considering science"". This book has very little in the way of advice for someone who is already in a formational science program, let alone someone already in a PhD program. Wilson spends a lot of time reminiscing about his past, which makes the book very biology focused. Another consequence of his focus on his own career is that this book becomes unhelpful to someone who is unsure about their aspirations in science. I am currently deciding whether I want to pursue a PhD or not, this book seems to suggest that unless I have had a passion for the model system since high school, I will not be successful.He also includes a few ludicrous lines such as ""real scientists do not take vacation"" and ""a real scientist can talk to their spouse and think about work"". People cannot balance their private and work lives and still be successful scientists? But then, he is a very famous individual; he has seen a lot of success in his time.Overall the book was decently well written, paced well (if abruptly), and engaging. I took away the stars because I don't think it lives up to the promise of the back cover. "

Others would probably get a sense of what he's talking about, but the examples definitely come from his own experiences.The first third of the book and the last chapter, I think are the most relevant. If I were to write a similar set of letters, it would read quite differently, mostly because my background is different from Wilson's. (Of course, his opinions are many-fold more credible than mine given that he's a prof at Harvard and earned a Pulitzer.)p 32: For two centuries the global human population has been doubling every several generations.

Wilson, a biologist himself (in fact, he is the world's leading expert in myrmecology (study of ants)), he writes a ""practical"" and ""realistic"" book of advice for anyone considering a career in science.Some main points include: 1. Contrary to popular belief, you should stay in science because there is a great need for scientists!2. Do it out of love. Passion is what will get you through your career, not high IQ or math skills. 3. Maximize your marketability by choosing a field that is not overwhelmingly popular (less competition)So, before ruling out a career in science, read this book. Let an expert and a scientist show you what's ""realistic"", rather than a materialistic consumer culture."
11,0871403773,http://goodreads.com/user/show/19124904-charles-sheard,5,"Although I am not the target audience, I enjoyed this a great deal, though it just reinforced my regret in not being able to follow multiple life paths that called to me, such as science. Some chapters were more cohesive than others, and some of the ‚Äúlessons‚Äù seems more tacked on to what was otherwise just a story Wilson wanted to tell, but even so the stories are valuable in and of themselves to young scientists. My 14-year-old future marine biologist is already reading it, and indicated that she likes it so far, so it seems to have cross-generational appeal."
12,0871403773,http://goodreads.com/user/show/85617661-isabel,5,"I usually don't write reviews, but I saw a lot of negative reviews on this book. That really sucked because I absolutely loved it. Like the title suggests, this book is a collection of letters in which Wilson gives advice to young college-age students, backing up his points with anecdotes. The beginning of this book is more focused on straight-forward advice while toward the end, each letter is a personal anecdote with a central message/ lesson to be learned. Since Wilson is a biologist, not all of his advice will appeal to every aspiring scientist. Regardless, I believe everyone can take something away from this book.Wilson's style is very eloquent for a scientist. The stereotype seems to be that scientists are awkward and lack the ability to communicate with a more general audience. Even when the content of this book didn't interest me, I kept reading for the style. This book was very inspiring to me even though I'm 16 years old, so I can't put the vast majority of his advice into practice (yet, at least.) I think I've written more notes in this book than I ever have (even for school.) It was just motivational to me, especially the beginning. It made me want to pursue the same brand of science as Wilson and get started right away. Things slow down towards the end of the book as things get more anecdote heavy, but it's really not bad enough to take away a star. I strongly recommend this book for anyone interested in science. Even if you don't read the whole book, I'm sure it'll have something for you. "
13,0871403773,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1610514-nancy-lewis,3,"This didn't seem very useful as advice to a budding scientist, but I did learn some interesting things about ants, and about E.O. Wilson's career. "
14,0871403773,http://goodreads.com/user/show/113324-robin,2,"Disappointing.This is more of a disjointed memoir than ""letters"" to a scientist. A lot of this advice is either outdated or specific to biology. If I told my advisors I would only do research in a ""sparsely inhabited field"" as Wilson suggests, they would say, good luck finding one! Not to mention most advisors I know don't let their graduate students choose their own projects. You do work on the projects that are funded, end of story, usually.But perhaps the part of the book that made me really angry was the unnecessary dig at the humanities. Wilson says, and I quote, ""There is only one way to understand the universe and all within it, however imperfectly, and that is through science. ... Granted that many in the humanities, as if in a bunker, fiercely defend their isolation. ... Yet however much the humanities enrich our lives, however definitively they defend what it means to be human, they also limit thought to that which is human, and in this one important sense they are trapped within a box."" Look here, old dude. I don't know any one in the humanities who views their field as isolated from the science and technology in the world around us. If anything, the best parts of the humanities help us make moral, ethical, and spiritual sense of our ever changing reality which is increasingly based on science and technology. There are plenty of books and artworks that are from the perspective of non-humans, so that critique of being trapped in a human box rings hollow. This is the classic mistake of a scientist confusing the practice of science: science is a fact-discovering enterprise, with the value system based on science: science is a rationalist approach to life. The latter is not an integral part of the scientific community, it is a value judgment that society should make all decisions based on science because that is the 'best' approach to being human.He goes on to obliquely attack science fiction as being not based on science, and then writes his own ""science fiction"" paragraph about supertermites, which, if it was a book, would be the most terrible science fiction writing I've ever read. Blech."

Wilson, and as a Zoology major in school I had to learn all about his theory of island biogeography. I saw this book a couple months ago and decided to grab it because I'm attempting to get into graduate school as a lower GPA student. I've been very discouraged thus far and thought this book might give me the encouragement I needed. For the most part, it did. The book does a great job of rousing the inner scientist and dreamer in you. A lot of his advice was very useful, and he has a lot of examples to guide you along. The only thing keeping this from being a 5-star book, in my opinion, is the fact that some of his examples are dated. Wilson basically stumbled into a field where no one was doing anything and he was able to make great strides, create new departments, and went straight from backwoods Alabama to Harvard. That was fairly plausible in the 40s and 50s, but not anymore. Some of what he says is timeless: there really *are* new areas to stumble into, and there are plenty of opportunities to make novel discoveries, but the way academia is funded and the pure nature of the creature in the 2010s just make it very difficult. You're judged now, more than ever, on how much money you can bring and how good your grades were. I would love to have the ease of entering academia from the 1940s without all the blatant racism and with modern knowledge, but that's just the dreamer in me again. But that dreamer just finished the book and is going to use its lessons to continue on toward his goals."
16,0871403773,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1618357-jay,4,"The title is correct, this is a book aimed to convince a young person, probably in high school, to continue their studies as a scientist. The author really puts things in perspective of his own life as an ant researcher at Harvard. A few decades back when I was in high school, I was the target market for this book, a kid interested in science and interested in ants. I even had put together a game of different ant species warring with each other. Ends up I was more interested in building things, like that game, and in technology - I went down the engineering path. Had I read this book then, though, I may well have switched majors. He makes the case that science, and especially biology, can do good in the world. It is his closing argument, and he makes it strong. He pointed out some valuable benefits in science careers, like being able to research in labs or do work in the field, variety that I value more now. And he subtly points out that working for money shouldn't be the main reason to enter any career. So given that I think this could change minds, or at least provide comfort to those deciding to start on a science career, this is a very useful book. Won in Goodreads First Reads contest."
17,0871403773,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7855283-david,5,"Before going into this review I need to make one message crystal clear - this book is an essential read for anyone taking a Ph.D or considering a career in science regardless of their discipline. This is how profound a read this book is.This book takes the form of short to medium length letters by O.E. Wilson, a (mostly) retired biologist from Harvard who imparts his knowledge onto reader in the form of advice and often relates it to his own experience. The letters are easily read, and for the most part I could read one on a 15 minute bus journey to work.Although he is a biologist, he is openly respectful to other disciplines (including social scientists such as myself) and his wisdom and advice is useful to everyone. There is of course however an understandable bias towards biology. Near the end of the book the last few letters are a little dry as he related his points to very specific part of his career, but this is a comparatively minor criticism.This book features sound advice on the mission of science, the need for confidence and belief in ones work, and even the necessity of being wrong. Everyone in science needs a grand old master to help them as they tip toe into their field, and you will be hard pushed to find one better than O.E. Wilson."
18,0871403773,http://goodreads.com/user/show/12499-cass,2,"I was surprisingly disappointed with this book. As an aspiring scientist, ant-lover, and E.O.Wilson admirer, I thought it was all going for me, but I had to force myself through it. This book read as a series of badly strung anecdotes that offered vague guidance for a specific field (but not always entomology). It was unclear who the audience was throughout the whole book- if it was undergrads seeking a future in science like me, grad students hoping to become famous scientists, or young students like my 8th grade cousin who could use a little prompting to focus on science. This book was definitely not worth the $15 I paid for it. I wouldn't even pay $5. "

Wilson, a legend in the field of biology. I finally decided to pick up one of Wilson's own books and ""Letters to a Young Scientist"" is a pretty good place to start. The best parts of it read like you're listening to a grandfatherly man looking back on his career and imparting whatever lessons he's learned to help the next generation of scientists. I was honestly surprised that Wilson is still alive and kicking. He just seemed so revered in other books that I figured he was a titan from decades past. He's 88 now. The first few chapters were a look back at his own start - amateur explorations of nearby fields, stumps, trees and bays of Mobile, AL. This was the grandfatherly part and he seemed to honestly want to encourage the next generation of young scientists and thinkers to find a passion and stick with it through the inevitable challenges. ""First and foremost, I urge you to stay on the path you've chosen, and to travel on it as far as you can. The world needs you - badly"" he says right on the cover. Other parts really dig into the details of his career studying ants, which does make sense as he's the world's leading expert on the subject. Even in the most dense parts, though, you're never too far from a memorable anecdote. This was a good intro to E.O. Wilson and I may do some additional looking to see what else in his large bibliography may be worth a read. This book, published in 2013, lists 28 other books to chose from. ""From So Simple a Beginning: Darwin's Four Great Books"" and ""The Future of Life"" sound particularly interesting."

Yes, it seems that, as Richard Feynman said, every subject is extremely interesting if you go deep enough.

Speaking mostly from his experience as an evolutionary biologist specializing in ants, he dispels a lot of myths about who can be a scientist (you don't necessarily need to be good at math!) and shares how the work of science actually gets done. His passion for his own research leads him off into tangents occasionally, but those are also some of the most interesting chapters as he explains how he and his partners discovered rare ants in remote jungles or puzzled out the workings of pheromones. There are moments of tone-deafness, as when he dismisses faith, or all of the humanities, but those moments are brief. I think this book could be highly encouraging for young people in high school or beginning college who want to enter the sciences."

Letters to a Young Scientist - what a promising title! I really thought I was going to love this book, but I have to admit that it fell short in several areas for me. On the positive side, I appreciated Wilson‚Äôs discussion on how, when it comes to being a successful scientist, an individual‚Äôs drive and desire to solve problems can trump one‚Äôs mathematical abilities or theoretical knowledge, both of which can be supplemented over time with practice and serious reading. I also appreciated his emphasis on the importance of science in public affairs and the role of scientists as storytellers (of truth), which I found very compelling. He brings in several anecdotal examples that drive his points home as well. I‚Äôll say that as someone trained in the social sciences, I tended to gloss over some of the more technical/biology-specific text because I just couldn‚Äôt appreciate it, but I‚Äôm sure someone with a different ‚Äì more biological or ecological ‚Äì training might. I do think some of these field-specific parts could have been greatly reduced, however, or at the very least, generalized to be more relatable to other science fields. [They also tended to be redundant]. What was lacking in the book was a discussion of how the science and research environments have changed since he started out as a scientist (he started his PhD in 1951!). Wilson is very optimistic throughout the book, but there is no serious discussion about the crippling debt many young scientists find themselves in, or rapidly decreasing academic jobs, or the super competitive research funding environments, and the list goes on. It‚Äôs easy to say that young scientists should ‚Äòdream‚Äô about the possibilities in their area of research, but making those dreams come true requires a different set of sacrifices (perhaps more) than what Wilson encountered in his early career days. He also makes a comment that early career scientists don‚Äôt take vacations because they‚Äôre busy conducting original research, but again, this completely overlooks today‚Äôs reality. And how ridiculous! Also: why is there no discussion of work/life balance anywhere in the book?Perhaps my biggest issue with this book is Wilson‚Äôs treatment of the social sciences and humanities. On the one hand, he argues that scientists are storytellers and creative thinkers who are inspired by their imagination. And yet, he belittles the role of religions and systems of beliefs in human behavior, a massive area of scientific inquiry (i.e. the behavioral and cognitive sciences!). I wondered how Wilson could ignore how religious and spiritual beliefs influence conceptualizations of the world, for instance? The list goes on. Is this the product of an overly/exclusively empirical training as a naturalist and entomologist? Furthermore, he says: ‚ÄúThe social sciences are converging generation by generation of scholars with biology, by sharing methods and ideas, and THEREBY CONCEDING MORE AND MORE TO THE REALITIES OF THE ULTIMATELY BIOLOGICAL NATURE OF OUR SPECIES‚Äù [p. 169, emphasis added]. He then goes on to comment that the humanities are anthropocentric, which I find ironic given his characterization of science as partly humanities (‚Äúthe scientist as a storyteller,‚Äù etc.). I thought this book was just another example of how the social and behavioral sciences are overlooked and underestimated ‚Äì a total shame. My last comment has to do with the lack of discussion on ethics in science. In reading about some of the work he'd done, I wondered about how ethical some of the studies were, for instance, the complete displacement of flora and fauna on small islands to study recolonization. This may totally be my ignorance of ecological and biogeographical research or the different context we find ourselves in today (imagine getting that through a review board today!), but I was disturbed by comments such as: ""Don't feel bad about killing a worker bee"" (p.194). I would have liked to see a thorough discussion on ethics given that can be one of the factors inhibiting some people from pursing science careers, too. There were about 3-4 pages (i.e. the last chapter) that glosses over ethics, though dismissing ethical concerns about invasive research on nonhuman animals (or even cloning) and arguing that most ethical dilemmas tend be about your relationships with other scientists (talk about anthropocentric!). I really wanted to be 'swept off my feet' by this book..."

Most likely to succeedConventional wisdom holds that science of the future will be more and more the product of ‚Äòteamthink,‚Äô multiple minds put in close contact.....But is groupthink the best way to create really new science? Risking heresy, I hereby dissent. I believe the creative process usually unfolds in a very different way. It arises and for a while germinates in a solitary brain. It commences as an idea and, equally important, the ambition of a single person who is prepared and strongly motivated to make discoveries in one domain of science or another. The successful innovator is favored by a fortunate combination of talent and circumstance, and is socially conditioned by family, friends, teachers, and mentors, and by stories of great scientists and their discoveries. He (or she) is sometimes driven, I will dare to suggest, by a passive-aggressive nature, and sometimes an anger against some part of society or problem in the world. There is also an introversion in the innovator that keeps him from team sports and social events. He dislikes authority, or at least being told what to do. He is not a leader in high school or college, nor is he likely to be pledged by social clubs. From an early age he is a dreamer, not a doer. His attention wanders easily. He likes to probe, to collect, to tinker. He is prone to fantasize. He is not inclined to focus. He will not be voted by his classmates most likely to succeed. When prepared by education to conduct research, the most innovative scientists of my experience do so eagerly and with no prompting. They prefer to take first steps alone. They seek a problem to be solved, an important phenomenon previously overlooked, a cause-and-effect connection never imagined. An opportunity to be the first is their smell of blood.On the frontier of modern science, however, multiple skills are almost always needed to bring any new idea to fruition. An innovator may add a mathematician or statistician, a computer expert, a natural-products chemist, one or several laboratory or field assistants, a colleague or two in the same specialty‚Äîwhoever it takes for the project to succeed becomes a collaborator. The collaborator is often another innovator who has been toying with the same idea, and is prone to modify or add to it. A critical mass is achieved and discussion intensifies, perhaps among scientists in the same place, perhaps scattered around the world. The project moves forward until an original result is achieved. Group thought has brought it to fruition.Innovator, creative collaborator, or facilitator: in the course of your successful career, you may well fill each of these roles at one time or another.8. I never changed9. Archetypes of the scientific mindI told you earlier that during the earliest steps to discovery the ideal scientist thinks like a poet. Only later does he work at the bookkeeping expected of his profession. I spoke of passion and decent ambition as forces that drive us to creative work. The love of a subject, and I say it again for emphasis, is meritorious in itself. By pleasure drawn from discovery of new truths, the scientist is part poet, and by pleasure drawn from new ways to express old truths, the poet is part scientist. In this sense science and the creative arts are foundationally the same.10. Scientists as explorer of the universeIII. A life in science11. A mentor and the start of a career12.

34,0871403773,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6971753-robert,3,"This book was given to me as a gift by my research mentor toward the end of my stint as an undergraduate, which perhaps places me in E. O. Wilson's intended audience. Letters to a Young Scientist is an affirming book for someone already in love with the idea of a career in scientific research, and certainly has the potential to inspire such love in the uninitiated. I imagine it would be suitable for forward-thinking middle schoolers or high schoolers in addition to my 'about-to-apply-to-grad-school' crowd. The book is organized very well, with each 'letter' standing more-or-less alone. Along with a wealth of personal anecdotes and prosaic descriptions of biological phenomena, Wilson offers more general insights about the right attitude required to be a scientist and why it's worth pursuing. I especially appreciated his advice to avoid ""bandwagon"" subjects that are already filled up with successful senior researchers.My only reservation was the (completely understandable) limited scope of certain pieces of advice. The author is a biologist after all, so all of his experience comes from the field of biology. When he expounds upon the research programs deriving from a rotting stump, the non-biologist must stop to consider, ""What is my field's 'rotting stump'?"" And he risks alienating his readers when he intimates that the natural sciences -- physics, chemistry, biology -- are really the only worthwhile areas of study. This betrays a surprisingly reductionist scientific worldview, and certainly does not speak for the whole scientific community. If anything, though, this limited scope gives the reader a chance to make thoughtful comparisons between their field of interest and his. Less developed fields of study can aspire to the successes of biology, and young researchers can aspire to the be E. O. Wilson of their chosen field."
35,0871403773,http://goodreads.com/user/show/25338445-angie-reisetter,2,"This book should probably be more specifically titled, something like ""Letters to a Young Observational Biologist"". I'm a physics professor, and someone asked me if I would recommend this book as inspiration for my undergraduate students, so naturally I dove in to read it. The answer is no, definitely no, decidedly no. Not only is it full of arrogant generalizations, but most of his advice is just flat out wrong for even those in other areas of biology, let alone chemistry and physics. The focus on being passionate about your work? That's great. That applies to everyone in every field (not just science). But the specifics he gets into about what makes a great scientist... well, they're what made him a great scientist, but they're not generally applicable, especially not today. The most telling passage was when he explained that he does not trust memoirs or autobiographies by scientists, because if they were real scientists, they should be trained not to focus on the subjective experiences necessary for these things. So he definitely didn't write a memoir, just letters to a young scientist. Because real scientists do give advice.E.O. Wilson should just have written an autobiography/memoir. This comes close, but he's so bent on giving unambiguous advice that he comes off as conceited, not to mention just wrong.That's really too bad. Because his story is interesting, even inspiring in and of itself. This book clearly comes from a good place in his heart (yes, real scientists have hearts) with a good purpose: to inspire young people to go into science (or specifically observational biology, but that would be great, too). And there really are a few good gems in this book. I wish he had just set out to say those things, rather than everything else he tried to cram in here."

Wilson attempts to provide the wisdom of 60 years in science to people just starting out in the field. This book does an excellent job at portraying many aspects of life in science and has a lot of good advice for how to find a suitable path in academic science. I highly recommend this book to high school students, undergraduates, and new grad students ‚Äì it will help you make more informed decisions about your field of study and research projects. As someone who is fairly deep into a PhD program, I found that I had already gleaned most of Wilson‚Äôs insights from other sources. That being said, Wilson‚Äôs usual enthusiasm and love of science is on full display throughout. He highlights the points he‚Äôs making with anecdotes from his own research, including an exciting account of the search for the ancestor of modern social ant species and, in a letter about the formation of scientific theories, the story of how the theory of chemical communication between ants was derived. Overall, I found the book enjoyable, but better suited to people at earlier stages in their scientific careers."
37,0871403773,http://goodreads.com/user/show/36444173-hope-miller,5,"I thought that this book was really good. It doesn't have any characters or a plot, it is more of a letter. It gives you the basic knowledge that you need to enter college with a major in science, particularly in the branch of biology. It tells the most significant laws of all of the largest branches of science. It is written by a Harvard professor and he tells about his childhood, how he got interested in science, and why. It helps you decide which field of science would fit you best and how to get started on studying that particular field of study. It explains that when people say science is the hardest subject, that it actually one of the easier fields of study. He spends a lot of time explaining that you need to be creative and have an imagination. I thought that the book was really good because it will help me in science class in the future. The only downfall was that it is a REALLY hard book to read. You have to have background knowledge on the book, or be willing to look up a lot of stuff you don't know."

Many of which, felt as if they spoke straight to my younger self. I wanted to be a botanist but was afraid of the chemistry classes I would need to take. I chose a different route instead. It was one that I loved but had I read this book ten years ago, I may have ended up a botanist after all. Wilson addresses all the fears and trepidations of entering in to the field of science, pursuing your passions, and finding a way to become successful doing so. It was like sitting down with a much admired professor and having him tell you that the sky is the limit. I found the addition of his own personal experiences to be very entertaining and interesting. Although this book is geared toward students thinking of pursuing careers in science, much of the advice given could be helpful for any undergrad student looking for encouragement in their chosen path. I very much enjoyed this book."

Wilson, the ""Father of Sociobiology"" and the creator of the online Encyclopedia of Life reflects back on his childhood, education, and career to share valuable, applicable advice about cultivating a passion for science. I read this book aloud with my 10 and 12-year olds. I found some of his advice surprising and helpful, such as don't worry if you're not a math whiz - you can find a statistical collaborator when working on research. Most importantly, Wilson has a great ability to express the wonder, awe, and significance of scientific discovery. My daughters thought the book suffered from Wilson's overly-detailed descriptions of his research on ant biology, and I would have to agree. Nevertheless, a young person with a singular enthusiasm for the sciences will find lots of encouragement and direction in this work."

Then as he progresses, E.O. increasingly runs off on rambling tangents and talking about ants while failing to arrive at a point. He spends an entire chapter talking about field work he did on ants and wraps it up by concluding that by now we can see his point... except he didn't make one. I found myself disagreeing with him on a number of opinions he declared fact. I may not have decades of tenured professorship at Harvard behind me, but I already know enough about science to see that his perspective is out-dated and flat out wrong for most other fields that aren't evolutionary entomology. He asserts that huge, original, prize-winning discoveries are the only thing that matters. As a research scientist (not in evolutionary biology), I can't disagree more."
41,0871403773,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7920577-allison,3,"I think the first half of this book is as the title says, for a young scientist. His advice is great for all ages, it ranges from high school aged (me) to earning a PhD. He points out ways so that you can be successful and to have an enjoyable job. However, the second part is more about biology and why you should study taxonomy or biology. He talks about all the animals, especially bugs that are unknown. It is interesting, but it feels very different from the beginning of the book. It also focuses more on his adventures and how that helped him, which was the most helpful part if you took the time to convert to what that means for yourself and the career you're pursuing.Overall, it's a great read if you're pursuing a career in science, especially biology.

45,0871403773,http://goodreads.com/user/show/9161201-ricky,2,"This book is at its best when Wilson is writing interesting anecdotes about biology and similar fields, weak when he dispenses advice, and the worst when he ventures beyond those two.Even though I don't really have much interest in biology, much less entomology, his writing when it comes to anecdotes about those and related fields were alright, in my opinion, and were the most exciting parts of the book (mostly parts III and IV). His advice for young scientists is basically that entrepreneurship and drive is more important than brilliance, with a dose of ""hard work will get you what you want"" and Great Man nonsense. There are also some piping hot takes in here, like the intro paragraph to letter 15, ""Science as Universal Knowledge"":There is only one way to understand the universe and all within it, however imperfectly, and that is through science. You are likely to respond, Not true, there are also the social sciences and humanities. I know that, of course, I‚Äôve heard it a hundred times, and I‚Äôve always listened carefully. But how different at their foundations are the natural sciences, social sciences, and humanities? The social sciences are converging generation by generation of scholars with biology, by sharing methods and ideas, and thereby conceding more and more to the realities of the ultimately biological nature of our species. Granted that many in the humanities, as if in a bunker, fiercely defend their isolation. Moral reasoning, aesthetics, and especially the creative arts are forged independently from the scientific world view. The stories of human relationships in history and the creative arts are potentially infinite, like music played upon only a few musical instruments. Yet however much the humanities enrich our lives, however definitively they defend what it means to be human, they also limit thought to that which is human, and in this one important sense they are trapped within a box. Why else is it so difficult even to imagine the possible nature and content of extraterrestrial intelligence?Aside from the odd description of the social sciences and humanities becoming more like the natural sciences instead of, as it really seems and as David Harvey predicted, the other way around, he goes on in the letter to imagine a termite civilization that would ""have its termitities as our species has its humanities. Yet - their science would be closely similar; its principles and mathematics could be mapped unambiguously onto our own."" This is meant to show... something, apparently. Presumably the intellectual importance of natural science over social science and the humanities, which allegedly trap human thought ""within a box,"" but this is never explained or argued for, so the entire letter just reads as scientism. As a result, I really would've just preferred a book of anecdotes with a light sprinkling of advice, because this book can be cut down to that to be made drastically better."
46,0871403773,http://goodreads.com/user/show/41433998-mohamad-ahmad,4,"60 years of scientific experience condensed into letters to wanna be scientists and researchers to guide them through their journey. Edward Wilson is one of the leading entomologists/biologists of our time. In this book, he is targeting young people that wish to have a career in science through letters that comprise topics like scientific thinking_ following the scientific method essentially_choosing the right areas of research(passion for the topic+ keep away from places full of smart people and where all the attention is directed; choose less known areas where your work could lead you to big discoveries); how does a scientist come up with a theory; the thrill and pleasure of finding things out; the impact one discovery could have across several science disciplines(the author here proposes that science should not be limited to its various disciplines in its impact, but rather its beneficience should extend to the humanities and art...A scientist should choose an important problem and equip himself with the requited entreprenuerial spirit and ambition to make strides in his career, knowing that he is ""standing on the shoulders of giants"". A scientist should question everything, and be ready to aknowledge any fault in his or her previous research, or even be ready to discard all his previous research altogether should it turn out to be wrong. The scientific approach dosent't care about any ideologies or opinions. A scientist makes an observation or several observations. He then hypothesizes,tests his hypothesis, and if experiments confirm it, he then produces a theory. If the theory stood the test of time by not having any counter theories attack it, and by having numerous experiments confirm it,it becomes a fact. And this is how we get to understand the world. A lot of mind blowing facts about ants,taxonomy, and biology in general blew my mind,like for instance, how ants take out their corpses and bury them and how they know their dead by the chemicals they emanate. Or take pheromones for example, a certain chemical dispersed by insects to detect friends,enemies, and food. Or maybe you wanna know how deep our ignorance is of the biodiversity we have on this planet. We still haven't scatched the surface. Or maybe you'd like to be baffled by how very tiny creatures decide the fate of life on earth.The author does a great job getting readers excited about science and discovery. Reading his personal accounts of the times he spent being a scientist, discovering all sorts of new insect species, coming out with theories, asking questions and trying to answer them by either doing experiments,or going to the far end of the globe for closer inspection, is enough to pump any young person conidering a life of research and science."
47,0871403773,http://goodreads.com/user/show/41440301-jonathan-mayo,3,"It is difficult to give an opinion about this book. I must confess that I was very enthusiastic when I started to read it, but at the end the book did not reach my expectations. This does not mean that the book does not have a good value for young scientists, quite the contrary, however I believe this is not a book for everyone. I elaborate on this.I truly appreciate the efforts of Edward Wilson in bringing a piece of work that reflects his passion to science and his noble interest to motivate young people to get involved in science. I cannot agree more with the fact that considering the challenges that we are facing in this era, we need more scientists. However, at some point it is unfortunately difficult to follow the material about the Wilson's own experiences in Biology. It is an interesting subject, but although I continuously tried to invoke my scientific curiosity to concentrate on every detail, I am afraid that an ignoramus like me cannot simply get the best from such anecdotes. Moreover, at some point the book seems to be an autobiography that even though it would be a great idea, considering that Wilson is a remarkable scientist, this is not what I was looking for when I came up with this book. I would have also expected a longer chapter with a longer discussion about ethics, since this is in my opinion a very important issue that must be argued, especially from a senior researcher. There are very good parts of this book that deserve compliments such as the ""principles to do science"" that Edward Wilson gathered along his career. For example the principles regarding the role of mathematics in science, supported by two examples: Isaac Newton and Charles Darwin, both prominent scientists; the former had an extraordinary talent and inclination for mathematics while the latter was only semi-literate in mathematics. This example as well as the developments in many scientific communities suggest that although mathematics reflects our capability to think in a logical way, whatever level of mathematics skills that we have developed so far is enough to reach excellence in some scientific work. This is a good book that although I believe it could be mostly appreciated by people in Biology, an electrical engineer like me could enjoyed it at a moderate level."
48,0871403773,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3778271-zack,1,"I found this book to be fairly insufferable for a number of reasons:1) A bit of irony is present: at one point Wilson talks about how science is the only thing worth pursuing, that the liberal arts and humanities really don't matter, and yet earlier in the book he talked about how some scientist's memoirs simply weren't reading because they weren't very interesting. Essentially making an artistic judgement. But if those memoirs were composed of the rigorous rules of the English language in such a way that they made sense and communicated, isn't that arguably enough for Wilson's scientific mindset? That it isn't seemed a bit contradictory to me.2) Though ostensibly providing advice for how young scientists ought to enter the field, it seemed to me that Wilson was more interesting in talking about all of his accomplishments, and in some cases even mentions how some things were easier for him because the field wasn't as saturated as it is now, essentially making his recollections fairly useless for contemporary scientists.3) Wilson's clear worldview that champions science above all else just ends up feeling heartless and ruthless by the end of the book. His lists of scientific accomplishments don't feel like they add up to a whole person who matters, or who was very happy with anything but work in his life. For anyone who wishes to have a life outside of the lab, Wilson's book paints a bleak picture of what the life of a committed scientist ought to look like (in Wilson's mind). It leaves you sad, by the end, not inspired.4) I found it telling that he dedicates almost the whole book to scientific methods and questions and ""advice,"" and then dedicates only four pages to the ethics of those choices, and to the truth that is ostensibly being pursued in the work."

It has been three minutes since I opened Goodreads and I just cannot decide what to type about so I will just follow a random trail of thoughts.E.O Wilson has intended this book for a young scientist who's entering the scientific community, hopefully, with vigor and ambitions. Let me state right now: I am not a scientist, I am an engineer who just entered the workforce and that too in a non-engineering position so someone can say I barely read anything I could relate to or benefit from or could be interested in. All 3 situations are plainly wrong.The book can be segmented in a few parts:1. The parts where E.O Wilson narrates personal stories either from his childhood or from his academic tenure.2. The parts where E.O Wilson narrates stories about others: other scientists, students or maybe some species 3. The parts where he genuinely advises on how to succeed/survive in a scientific career.Reading the first part is amazing and surreal. I have never read about a boy who's interested in insects as a time-pass and who's still alive right now. In the second part, I got to know about people who are as simple and relatable as I am, and then by the virtue of their work, became someone the world's honored to have. Reading about these people while they make transition makes me hopeful and ambitious :) The advices in the third part, although, relate to careers in evolutionary biology and science, they are still very much applicable in other work fields and I, for one, am one who has definitely benefited.Finally, its a read I enjoyed, in fact, loved!! I was oblivious to the field of entomology and the fun there is in knowing all that I did. I could not have imagined that it was possible to contribute to the theories of evolution via a field like this.I am looking forward to reading Naturalist."

For example, over the past couple of months, I have been trying to find the right way to do science in my own area of physics. Although I knew that E.O Wilson was a naturalist before reading this book, I thought that he has done science enough that he can express his advice that can be taken in by scientists of all kinds. Unfortunately, he has failed me in those regards.However, I can not say that I hated the book. To some extent, I did found his stories to be quite interesting. There were several quotes throughout the book that I found to be quite inspiring. Furthermore, there was advice that I thought could be quite useful for my own research. This advice came at the beginning parts of the book and the ending parts of the book. So if you are an aspiring scientist in an area other than environmental biology, I suggest that read the beginning and ending of this book."

For anyone not in the biological sciences, I would still say this is worth a read, although go into it with an open mind. A lot of the chapters of this book are written from the perspective of a myrmecologist (the study of ants), and so you need to try and imagine how Wilson's arguments might apply to your field. In some cases he even explicitly states that the advice he is about to give is not valid for some other fields outside of biology. It seems that about two-thirds to one-half of the book are actually about ants and general taxonomy, which I didn't personally mind but which you might. I found this interesting because he described the chronology of his field, from being one of the first to enter it, to witnessing many join him, to seeing the advent of mainstream molecular biology and DNA sequencing technologies begin to threaten ""the old guard"" as he calls himself and his fellow older researchers. He uses this story to give advice to any scientists which might find themselves in such a position themselves.In summary, this book is short enough to read in an afternoon, and even if you aren't a huge fan of ants, you can still take something valuable from it."
52,0871403773,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5364077-connie-g,4,"Biologist Edward O. Wilson wrote a series of letters offering advice to students who were considering a career in science. The first few letters are geared to a high school or college student considering a career in biological science. Much of the rest of the book is a series of anecdotes from Wilson's own career as an entomologist. His stories illustrate the process of scientific research. Who knew that ants could be so interesting? Much of his research involved field studies so this is not the book for someone who is interested in physical science.Wilson wrote, ""In science every answer raises more questions."" In his stories, we see Wilson always moving to more complex research from entomology to ecology to evolutionary biology and studies in global diversity. His students at Harvard were lucky since he displays such enthusiasm for his subject.Government funding for the sciences has decreased in recent years. I've noticed how many partnerships have developed between private companies and university researchers in my state. I was surprised that there was not more mention about funding in the book. Perhaps that was not a problem at Harvard with its large endowments. "
53,0871403773,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4857466-victoria,3,"This book took me longer to read than I expected it to. I started it as part of a class that I was teaching. I thought we'd have more copies of the book and would be able to trek through it. Unfortunately that wasn't the case and we spent little time on it, mostly focusing on the first chapter, ""First Passion, Then Training"". My class then did an assignment related to that chapter and that's as far as we got with it together.Personally, reading through the rest of the book, I liked some of it and disliked the pacing. I read through two-thirds of the book fairly quickly. The short chapters helped. The last few chapters revolved heavily around entomology and biogeography, which I have no experience with and little interest in. I followed along at points but much of it dragged on. Would I recommend this book to a friend? Yes, particularly of they were a budding biologist or unusually interested in ants. I liked the short chapters (letters) and illustrations. That said, I wouldn't recommend it to many other folks because it gets too specifically into specific species of insects at the end."
54,0871403773,http://goodreads.com/user/show/46503768-elena,1,"As a young scientist I had really high hopes about this book. Admittedly, perhaps, too high hopes. There is definitely a gap in literature for ""So you're a young scientist, now what?"" kind of work, but his book does not fit in that gap, not for me. A lot of it reads like one of those self help books, full of tautologies and general statements with no proof to back them up. That is not what I expected if this book were aimed at scientists. He even goes on to describe the prototype of a  scientist and much of it reads like a horoscope. ""He [sic] dislikes authority"". Spot on, I dislike authority too. But, in fact, in this day and age, with a majority of people mistrusing politics, who doesn't. This is not the main problem I have with the book. It is clear that it is not addressed to me. My feeling is that it is not addressed to anyone but himself. I would have classified as a autobiography, and not a good one for that. And if advertised as such I would have never touched it."
55,0871403773,http://goodreads.com/user/show/906332-donald,3,"I believe a more accurate but less catchy title would be ""Letters from an Old Scientist"". While I certainly respect Wilson, I believe he tries too hard to extrapolate his 50+ years of experience forward to the next 50 years. In so doing, he overestimates the relevance of challenges he faced decades ago in the future and neglects the tremendous disruptions that are happening today. I would have liked to hear more about the relevance of technology going forward. Genetic mapping and computer modeling are changing the ways research is done, yet little is mentioned. Also, the tremendous shift away from publicly financed research (especially in universities) towards the financially motivated private sector is diluting any ""knowledge for knowledge's sake"" initiatives. If you can't monetize it, you probably can't fund it.While I did find the book an interesting read, I wouldn't pass it on to college students today as guidance for a career in science."
56,0871403773,http://goodreads.com/user/show/48998498-cody-barnett,5,I thought the book was good and inspiring. I hate writing reviews so I will keep this short and simple. If you are someone that likes biology and has a heart for the natural world and want to see a change in the world this is for you. This book will inspire you to want to do something about the loss of biodiversity of the planet and to help preserve the life that exists today. I highly recommend this book the only downfall is that some of the parts can get extremely technical and that's because your reading a book from an extremely intelligent man. I was and now inspired by this book to want to do something to save this planet from a potential anthropological doom. About all I want to say about this book and would recommend for a biology geek or science geek like myself and for someone that has a heart for the natural world.
57,0871403773,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6045256-anjalique,4,"‚ÄúThe ideal scientist thinks like a poet and only later works like a bookkeeper. Keep in mind that innovators in both literature and science are basically dreamers and storytellers.‚ÄùI enjoyed this short book--the author's example story of success and nuggets of wisdom. I agree with others that it feels at times like a thinly-veiled autobiography, though it's understandable that the author was trying to give advice by explaining what worked for him. (Be prepared for many stories about ants and butterflies.) A complaint I heard in other reviews was that the author uses the very general term ""scientist"" in the title, when his advice is most applicable to ""field scientists."" Some of his principles are broadly applicable, others maybe not. All that being said, this book is the proverbial arm-round-the-shoulder of someone a lot more experienced imparting some wise words. I enjoyed it."
58,0871403773,http://goodreads.com/user/show/33544563-mayra-flores,4,"Okay, he talks about ants, a lot (mostly at the halfway point). Not being an ecology or entomology enthusiast, I was uninterested in the topic. However, I appreciated the enthusiasm and the passion. At some point I realized that the way he spoke about his research and the world was the way the reader should be looking at those things. Find something they really like, innovate, and make cool things happen. So yeah, ants, not really my thing, but replace it with something you really like and now you have the same thinking process he was using to get things done. It felt a lot like listening to my ecology professor's stories, but that's not a bad thing. I think it would be more appealing to aspiring biologists (like myself), but, for what it's worth, he's using the same thought-process used for any scientific field using his own experience. "
59,0871403773,http://goodreads.com/user/show/40067341-aranya-iyer,3,"The first half of the book and the last chapter of the book are the only TRUE sections dedicated to young scientists at large. These chapters are incredibly inspirational and give true, honest insight about what it is like to be a scientist. The middle chapters are gentle propaganda for insects, above all ants. While these chapters start and end with some words directed to overall science at large, the message is very thoroughly lost among the information on ants. I mostly enjoyed it when I was reading it, but I couldn't find myself to be excited enough about it to pick up the book. A great moment was realizing that this author was the Wilson of the MacArthur-Wilson Island Biogeography Theory that I had been learning about for the past decade. SO, that was a lovely moment. I feel like I ""know"" a famous scientist on some level. "
