0,0062183591,http://goodreads.com/user/show/175635-trevor,4,"This might save you needing to read the book - https://www.thersa.org/discover/video...And this is the cartoon version - https://www.thersa.org/discover/video...A few years ago I read Predictably Irrational – a book that remains one of my favourite books on Behavioural Economics. The research reported in that book has just about everything going for it – it is amusing, fascinatingly interesting, clever and fundamentally undermines the core dogma of our age, that we are economically rational agents acting purely on the basis of our own enlightened self-interest.His next book, The Up-side of Irrationality wasn’t nearly as good, but it did report his 'outsourced research' conducted in India on the effects of providing large bonus pay for performance. Which is something that is better explained in Dan Pink’s book Drive. All the same, this research alone is worth the price of the book. It does much to explain the current mess we are in and even gives some indication of what we might want to do to get back out of that mess. His latest book, this one, is probably a better read than the last one, but suffers from the fact that I’ve now heard most of this research before. However, where this book really succeeds is in how it goes about explaining the consequences of this research - that is, in the story it tells. Essentially, we are all cheaters. The thing is that we do not cheat at every opportunity, as standard economic theory might have us predict, but rather, we cheat just enough so that we can go on considering ourselves to be overall ‘good people’. This is why we are less likely to cheat when reminded of the Ten Commandments or even other ethical frameworks that we don't even believe in. This is also why you might have more luck in retrieving money you left in a communal fridge than a can of coke you left there. People tend to be less ‘moral’ with the greater distance from money the thing they are ‘borrowing’ has. This also includes ‘cheating’ on tests and tax returns when the end result will be us being given money.But the most interesting research in this book, I thought, was that conducted with people who were told they were wearing fake or real designer sunglasses. Dan found that if you thought you were wearing fake sunglasses you were more likely to cheat on other tests they got you to take. The reason being that such sunglasses are purchased as a kind of display of status – meant to display of the wealth of the owner. Wearing fake sunglasses of this type – ridiculously expensive bits of plastic purely designed as status symbols – is a kind of lie, but unlike other lies we tell ourselves, it is a soul destroying one. If we take the can of coke from the fridge it is an act which is over in no time and we can probably rationalise our action – remembering back to the time we lost food from a communal fridge or something similar. But with fake designer sunglasses you are constantly reminded of the fact that you are a fraud, the crime never goes away, is always present to us and our sense of self, as the only point of the sun glasses is to display something we are not as if we were. And this has a bad effect on our likely attitude to other situations requiring some moral fortitude. We are much more likely to say, oh, bugger it, why not? Essentially, Ariely is arguing the slippery slope.Like I said, a lot of this book has been said before, but this does frame the research in very interesting ways and I think the narrative structure works well. This was a fun read – but Predictably Irrational is still his best book."

Not only it is very easy to read and understand, but it has study designs that are so witty, I feel I am getting smarter just by reading it. The information presented here is so important that anyone in a leadership position must be aware of this. It is very well in accord with the data from the book 'Pathological Altruism` by B. Oakley and points out some of the misinterpretations presented in `The Invisible Gorilla`. If you are interested in why people lie and cheat, how a bad apple can ruin the whole basket and how to prevent these, read this book. Also read this just to have some fun in human behaviors."
2,0062183591,http://goodreads.com/user/show/155663-david,5,"How can such a depressing book be so much fun to read? Dan Ariely is an excellent author; I've read two of his previous books, and I haven't been disappointed yet. Ariely combines a light-hearted writing style, a solid set of psychology studies (many of which he personally conducted), and a big dose of common sense. Many of Ariely's findings are not intuitive at first glance--but he is able to explain his findings and make them understandable to the reader.Ariely shows why we cheat--but with a limit. We do not cheat to the maximum extent possible, even when it is possible to get away with it. Instead, most people think of themselves as honest. We cheat somewhat, but not enough to call into question our self-image of being ""basically honest"". The book describes a bunch of psychology experiments where subjects are able to cheat without obvious consequences, and thereby earn some extra money. Ariely does an excellent job at showing the various factors that inhibit or encourage dishonesty. He discusses cheating on tests, politicians and bankers (bankers cheat more than politicians!), golf players (who tend to cheat a lot!), cheating by people of different nationalities (all nationalities and cultures tend to cheat about the same amount), cheating by people in groups, and by religious people (no different from non-religious).Ariely discusses plagiarism by students, and ordered an essay on the subject of cheating from an essay mill. He received an essay consisting of gibberish that wouldn't be satisfactory for any student. He concludes that essay mills are not a problem. But, I think that this single bit of anecdotal evidence is not exactly convincing.Ariely constantly looks for approaches that may help to reduce cheating on tax forms, insurance claim forms, and on college tests. He comes up with a number of good, practical suggestions, none of which is going to be used very much in the near term. This is a fun book, easy to read, and absolutely fascinating."
3,0062183591,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2531665-charlene,1,"METHODS, METHODS, METHODS. Just because someone says they did a study and here are the findings, it doesn't mean; a) those findings were robust or statically significant, or b) that you can generalize those findings to other phenomena. Not only were Ariely's studies extremely soft/subjective, but he actually took those extremely unreliable results and applied them to other social situations he had no business applying them too. I never know how to rate these books. The questions social scientists want to answer are so interesting, worth 5 stars. The methods they employ to try to answer those questions are often so lacking that it is grossly irresponsible to publish the “findings,"" making me want to give it one star. There were so many studies I could have taken issue with in this book. Here are just a sampling of what passed for actual science in Ariely's book: Ariely was attempting to understand ethics (a very subjective subject to begin with) and provided subjects with fashion (brand name) sunglasses and perceived knockoff sunglasses (even though all sunglasses were real). Subjects then underwent his matrices solving condition (which I do not believe tells us anything at all about the real world to begin with) and those who believed they were wearing knockoffs cheated more. If you gave me a knockoff pair of sunglasses, jeans, purse, ring and told me outright it was generic, which cost a few dollars, I would find it more ethical than spending hundreds or thousands of dollars to prove I am a superior human being by wearing the expensive name brand item you gave me. It could reasonably be argued that people who hoard money in order to walk around looking like a superior human being by branding themselves with labels other people could never afford are far less ethical than people wearing generic items. After providing his findings about the dubious ethical nature of people who wear knockoffs, Ariely suggested you should be weary of your date if s/he wear a knockoff. So, is the ""scientific"" message is that only very rich, self-important people are honest? Just as troubling, Ariely is fond of the type of studies made famous by Adrian Raine. A few years ago, Raine, who studies psychopaths but professes not to be one, was caught luring young Asian girls to hotel rooms with the promise of possible admission to Penn. How did he escape the #MeToo movement? I have no idea. His science is just about as bad as his behavior. Raine studied antisocial personalities by going to a temp agency because, as we all know, if you work at a temp agency, you are probably a psychopath. Not only that, but we know that a trait of all psychopaths is lying. However, Raine, who equated psychopaths with temp workers, gave the ""psychopaths"" a *self-report"" questionnaire. Self report is *never* scientifically robust, ever, but self report for people you hope are liars? Raine took the self report answers as truths. Think about that. Self report is bad to begin with. But giving self report to weed out the lairs, how is that going to provide any type of sample you can trust? Adrian decided they were liars AND that he would trust their self report. From the subjects identified through self-report, Raine imaged his little sample of antisocial folks and presented his ""neuroscientific findings"". People love it because they don't think about how he got those findings. Ariely included a study that makes this very claim, and he loved it! He did not think about it critically, at all. I could add to this sampling any and all matrix experiments carried out by Ariely. This book was supposed to be my downtime book, the book I read while falling asleep. I was so worked up that I had to change it to a non-downtime book. "
4,0062183591,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6415628-aryn,4,"When I was in college I learned a bit about the Simple Model of Rational Crime which basically states that people lie/cheat by rationally looking at the pros and cons and make a decision based on that. Needless to say, this never sat right with me. People don't make rational decisions, they just don't.In this book Ariely puts forth another theory, one that he calls the Fudge Factor. The theory goes that there are basically two opposing forces when we decide whether to lie or cheat. One of the forces is that we want to think of ourselves as good and righteous people. The other force is that we want to get more out of situations. So the question is: how much are we willing to ""fudge"" the truth and still think of ourselves as honest and good people?Through quite a few experiments, Ariely explores this, along with what may influence it in one way or another. Personally, these theories and experiments sat a lot better with me than the SMORC ever did. The author makes lying and cheating an incredibly interesting topic, and the experiments are novel and informative. The author is clearly an entertaining person and knows how to tell a good story. This book basically felt as though he wanted to show off his super-awesome experiments and findings, excitedly. It made it a fun read.My biggest complaint is that in all the experiments the reward far outweighed the consequences of being caught. What about in situations, like cheating on a spouse, where the consequences could possibly destroy lives? What about when the consequences outweigh the reward, and yet we lie/cheat anyway?Ariely, what would you make of this?: A few years back, my boyfriend at the time had a soft-top Jeep. One morning we came outside to find that someone had cut out the back window, and gotten into the car. The thief left all the expensive electronics (stereo, ipod, etc), but took all the change off the floor. It seemed like the guy had gone through quite a lot of effort for a fairly minuscule reward.(Book Received Through Giveaways)"
5,0062183591,http://goodreads.com/user/show/957634-daniel-clausen,4,"It's strange to say, but I never expected a book on dishonesty to be so tame...even small. The book is a look at dishonesty, especially cheating, and covers the author's own experiments and what they tell us about cheating. The most important points are these: (1) We're not purely rational cheaters; we usually don't cheat to the fullest extent possible, we typically just fudge things in our favor. Thus, we're also sensitive to self-image. (2) We cheat much less when we're given subtle reminders of our moral codes (or any moral codes). (3) We are more likely to take advantage of ""fuzzy"" reality to fudge in our favor. (4) Small acts such as wearing counterfeits makes larger forms of cheating more permissible. (5) Creative people tend to be more dishonest. (6) Witnessing certain types of dishonesty make us more likely to cheat (though we are less likely to cheat if we witness someone from a different group doing it)...And there are more main points. I like that the book draws conclusions from the author's own experiments. I've read many good books recently that tackle big questions. But most of them have had to tackle those big questions by drawing from a variety of research that is already available, usually with small additions from their own experiments. This book, on the other hand, is based almost entirely on experiments conducted and designed with colleagues. And the conclusion, the ""Fudge Theory of Cheating"", that people tend to cheat only to the extent that they are able to maintain their own image of virtue appears to be (provisionally) valid across a range of cultures. So...nicely done. And yet, I still think it's only the beginning of a useful theory. A next version of this book would have to answer pertinent questions: What is the difference between normal fudgers and full-on sociopaths; when do fudgers become full-on cheaters; what is the relationship between shared social norms and cheating (or culture); how does group competition influence cheating...if the author can tackle these questions, I believe he'll be closer to an actual theory of cheating. My criticisms may be somewhat unfair. After all, now we're talking more about norm creation and acceptance than cheating. (Think also about norms during war. Think about how rules governing the conduct of war become established, reinforced, relaxed, and abandoned...this might give you deeper insights into rules and cheating than what we see in the experiments in this book.)So, when I say the book is tame, I mean that there is no tackling big important questions about morality. There is no consideration of Hannah Arendt's ""Banality of Evil"" -- how normal people can come to perpetrate mass atrocities; or how good-intentioned individuals come to rationalize their way into evil. The book is also mute about larger questions of governance and social ontology. What happens when we live in places that are weakly governed or where there are fewer shared norms? How do well-governed places with shared understandings of the world break apart over time? As an International Relations scholar, I've had to consider issues of nation or organization-wide corruption, regime-building, nation-building, and cooperation within anarchy...the themes here seem small (sometimes artificially made so), and that is one of the problems of positivist science...you can only make these kind of judgments when the world is made small. Also, I feel like the book is incomplete without talking about prospect theory. In most of the experiments, cheaters cheated to get small gains, but prospect theory shows that people will take much higher chances to rectify perceived losses. Prospect theory should be an important part of this book because it could help to fill in an important theoretical puzzle -- why do we just cheat a little bit? If people are more sensitive to losses than gains, then this might explain why we only cheat a little. Perhaps something makes us cautious about punishment (even when we can't see it or we're not sure what the punishment is). But six years from the book's release there is an even bigger problem: What happens, as has happened now, when there is an utter nation-wide moral collapse...when no amount of honesty, lying, cheating is too absurd and a group wants to change the very definition of morality to fit their habitual cheating, lying, and deceit? What happens when -- by ideology -- cheating is something only your enemy can ever do?As someone who has myself written tame, small things...I will congratulate Mr. Ariely on writing an amusing book, with some minor practical insights. But I will also urge him to do what is most needed: Think big, think impactful! "
6,0062183591,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5647191-orsolya,3,"We all admit to telling ‘white lies’ or cheating/bending the truth and usually, several times a day. How often do we admit to (and even realize) that we also lie to ourselves to the point of believing our own dishonesty? Best-selling author, professor, and cognitive psychologist Dan Ariely explores the topic in, “The Honest Truth about Dishonesty: How We Lie to Everyone- Especially Ourselves”. Ariely instantly dives into thought-provoking and interesting dialogue regarding the topic of dishonesty combining cognitive psychology, behavioral psychology, and elements of neuroscience; while presenting this in an accessible way that is easy-to-understand for all pop-psych readers. The resulting product is a fast-paced text tinged with humor. The negative side of this is that “The Honest Truth about Dishonesty” is too basic and simplified; not elaborating or diving deep enough. Oftentimes, the information feels ‘obvious’ and abruptly cuts off before the true connections are made or theories are proven. This causes the facts revealed inside “The Honest Truth about Dishonesty” to be less than memorable and not mind-blowing. On the other hand, the most striking (and applauded) feature of “The Honest Truth about Dishonesty” is the fact that almost all of the experiments/tests described are first-hand conducted either by Ariely or his immediate peers. This is highly notable and makes the book stand out, as most other books nearby on the book shelf tend to be filled with secondary sources and experiments which aren’t related to the topic at hand (many psych books use the same experiments but describe them per their own theories making the arguments weak). Thus, Ariel’s research and expertise on the subject makes the text more credible. On a related note, Ariel stylistically includes some of the actual documents/tests/charts used in the experiments and even encourages the reader to try them personally again helping to put “The Honest Truth about Dishonesty” on a ‘fun’ and approachable level. Ariel’s writing weakness is a certain level of choppiness within the text bouncing around on the topic within chapters – sort of like a book that is ADHD. Although this doesn’t make “The Honest Truth about Dishonesty” confusing; it does break reader attention.Slightly past the halfway point, “The Honest Truth about Dishonesty” loses some steam as Ariely begins to cite more personal observational studies versus hard science having little backing and explanation. The text also becomes quite repetitive causing the entire reading to be somewhat slow and without any excitement or merit. The final chapter of “The Honest Truth about Dishonesty” sums up some of Ariel’s theories and offers tips concerning the battle with dishonesty. Sadly, these suggestions are bare-boned and thus the conclusion feels weak and forced. This flows into a unique compilation of mini biographies of Ariely’s fellow collaborators (including personal information about how the author knows each). These pages are unique as I have not seen this in other psychology books. Sadly, the notes and bibliography are shamefully thin and take away from the credibility and academic value of the text. Overall, “The Honest Truth about Dishonesty” is a relatively well-written work (flows smoothly and is entertaining) but some execution flaws are apparent. The text could have also been strengthened with more detail and elaboration but this makes it a strong introduction on the topic to the general reader. “The Honest Truth about Dishonesty” isn’t ‘bad’; it just isn’t a life-changer. Regardless, “The Honest Truth about Dishonesty” is suggested for those interested in the social sciences, behavioral economics, and psychology; seeking a quick but interesting read. "
7,0062183591,http://goodreads.com/user/show/8587828-grouchy-editor,2,"In all honesty, this book was a letdown. The human propensity for lying and cheating should be a juicy topic, but Ariely manages to squash reader interest by (mostly) confining his experiments to sterile classrooms, where one group of student volunteers after another pencil in answers to one dull test after another, usually involving dotted matrixes, one-dollar bills, and paper shredders. When Ariely and colleagues DO leave the artificial environment of the classroom –- sending a blind girl into a farmers’ market to buy tomatoes, for example –- their research yields some interesting results. But back to that classroom … our intrepid social scientist’s big discovery is this: We all cheat, but only a little bit. And if we can just get a few reminders that cheating is bad, maybe we won’t do it so much. That’s not exactly a scientific breakthrough; it’s simple common sense. And that’s the brutal truth."
8,0062183591,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1726198-christine-cavalier,3,"See this review on my blog: http://www.purplecar.net/2012/07/book...I “cheat” on crosswords. I don’t cheat, exactly. I don’t look at the answer key; THAT would be Cheating, with a capital C. Instead, I cheat with a lower case c; I Google or Wiki the subject of the difficult clues online. This only works for clues with keywords like an author’s name or a movie title, but the answers I find give me enough forward motion to continue solving the puzzle. If I get stumped again, I scan the clues for more keywords again.I don’t consider this letter-of-the-law Cheating, because I am working to find the solutions instead of just getting them from the answer key. You may be a crossword purist who is appalled at my lack of morals. You’d be making a mistake, though, to think my morals (when it comes to crosswords) are based on the same assumptions you hold.It all comes down to why I do crossword puzzles in the first place. You, M. Purist, may crave the challenge and the self-esteem boost when successfully completing a NYT Friday entry. I, on the other hand, find it relaxing to lazily Internet-search trivia and methodically fill in the tiny squares with the gems I find, while learning a bit in the process.Am I cheating myself? I don’t think so. After all, I’m learning things and relaxing. I’m not entering any crossword competitions. I’m not even going for bragging rights. For me, crosswords are a rote exercise. My methods work for me. In fact, M. Purist, I think your snobby morality about how crosswords should be done is elitist and exclusionary. Upon hearing my theories, one crossword-abandoning friend of mine lit up with discovery. She had stopped doing the puzzles because their difficulty proved unsurmountable, but when we talked she realized she’d been cheating herself out of a fun pasttime because of her overblown sense of “what’s right” in crossworddom. Call us cheater-mcgeeters if you must, but my friend and I are happily googling away our grids.Duke researcher and EBE (Economic Behaviorist Extraordinaire) Dan Ariely may side with the crossword purists on this one. In his latest book, The (Honest) Truth About Dishonesty: How We Lie to Everyone–Especially Ourselves (THTAD), Dr. Ariely cites his own research and research of close colleagues on the subject of cheating. From  “Fun with Fudging” and the “What the Hell Factor,” Ariely examines many different ways we cheat consciously and unconsciously. His clever experiments are great at catching unwitting people at the pervasive self-deception that none of us seem to be able to resist.The book is probably his toughest read yet. I found Predictably Irrational to be a fun and delightful read. The Upside of Irrationality was a tiny bit more challenging. THTAD is by far the most research and dilemma-heavy of the 3. Perhaps it is the subject matter and being faced with my own shortcomings, but it seems this book had the least amount of engaging anecdotal evidence of Ariely’s signature storytelling charm. While reading THTAD, many times I found myself fading, in that reading-college-textbooks-at-midnight way. I don’t recall this feeling with the other two books.My meandering could be the disgust factor at work. Ariely mentions Enron and Bernie Madoff, as well as Wall Street and the 2008 crash, then goes on to explain how cheating can be social and become contagious. It’s hardly light fare, despite Ariely’s attempts to soften the blow with his self-deprecating and at times mischievous humor.Nonetheless, I read the book carefully in its entirety, even though I’d have to backtrack often to where my mind checked out and begin again; Ariely’s insights into human behavior are useful in life and in business. In this book, I learned why I shouldn’t trust the car repair guy I’ve known forever, why I should draw pictures of eyes and hang them on the snack cabinet, why a stack of dollar bills are more likely to stay in tact than my lunch in the work fridge, and why, as a creative person, I may have less gray matter in my brain than you dull types out there.Where the book falls short, besides the lack of Ariely’s personal stories, is in the area of some needed philosophical talk about morals. Ariely hints at the possibility of varying moral codes when he talks briefly about the perception of cheating in different cultures, but he fails to lay down a common compass from which we all discern our moral directions. Ariely assumes we’re all following a letter-of-the-law approach to Cheating, and that his experiments’ subjects could only be following that same (supposedly Judeo-Christian) approach. But I think Ariely would’ve done well to take a paragraph or two to lay out his assumptions/biases. We can surely infer the basic Western moral sense, but if Ariely took some time to lay out what exactly he thinks is the official definition of “Cheating”, even if only within the confines of his own experiments, his assertions about how we all unconsciously cheat would hold all the more punch. Although his matrices experiment designs seem pretty rock solid, there is a possibility that Ariely may have missed two totally different motivations behind cheating: etiquette and convenience.In Chapter 9: Collaborative Cheating: Why Two Heads Aren’t Necessarily Better than One, Dr. Ariely presents some findings that suggest we cheat more with others and/or for others’ benefit (“altruistic cheating”). Earlier in the book, he also cites “karma” as a way we justify taking a few extra pens from work when they failed to give us our yearly bonus. But I think this is where Ariely missed an opportunity to explore the finer-tuned aspect of cultural etiquette and convenience. Sometimes certain behaviors are expected for reasons unknown to us, but we’re savvy enough to pick up on signals sent by those around us. For example, in Ariely’s bad-actor experiment (the actor David portrayed “bad” decisions, not that David was poorly skilled at theatrical arts). When David asked whether or not he should cheat, the researcher said, “You can do what you want.” David then obviously cheated and was not rebuked. This is such an odd occurrence in life, it’s possible that the real subjects in the experiment may have surmised that the researcher actually preferred (for whatever mysterious reason) that the subjects cheated. Perhaps it would get her the results she wanted. Who would deny her? It would be more polite, then, to do what is expected and cheat like David (or find a moral middle ground and cheat a little more than normal, which is what the subjects did).Another experiment Ariely cited was done in a coffee shop. Customers were handed too much change, and Ariely wanted to see how many people would return the excess, and how much of it they'd return. I’m deeply familiar with this very scenario, because I’ve experienced it more than once with my fanatically scrupulous father, who has been known to get into restaurant-silencing arguments over bills for being undercharged. Those cringe-worthy moments of my youth taught me that it’s better etiquette to leave a heftier tip in case the waitstaff notices the error later than to argue that we need to pay more. Perhaps Ariely would just call this ""picking-up-on-signals"" the collaborative effect, but I find it slightly different than what he describes as “group cheating” in the book.I run into a collaborative effect everyday here in the suburbs, but again, it isn’t group cheating as much as it is a cultural norm. Take the library loans of music, for example. I am under the impression that if I check out Nicki Minaj’s lastest CD, I am to listen to it but not download it. If I download it to be able to listen to it, I should delete the album when I return the CD to the library. My father and my brother (also a stickler) would delete the files. They would also argue (probably loudly) with people on the street about how everyone should delete any music not bought through legitimate outlets. But if word got out around my town that I was making my tween delete the music she borrowed from the library, I’d get the reputation of an overly strict, trifling and somewhat-crazy parent. Put simply, it would be just plain weird.Another example of this peer-pressure-to-accept-certain-rules is living in an organized-crime dominant area, which I did growing up. I dare not talk about it too much (for obvious reasons), but I will say that our views on the definitions of “crime” and “wrong” didn’t necessarily match up to say, a nice Midwestern Mayberry-type town’s views. We thought of ourselves as looking more at the big picture: The police? They weren’t the most “upstanding” group. Electronics companies? What, the ones with the child labor in Indonesia? Bankers? Don’t get me started! We were keeping a whole region of the state, thousands of families, afloat, mostly via legitimate means. What were all those people doing for anybody? Who wants a stickler around, anyway? Rule-followers, pencil-pushers, Miss Manners, they only see right in front of their own noses. Where I come from that’s a very immature (and definitely no-fun!) way to be.Ariely does mention the social aspect behind cheating, as I said. And I may just be lying to myself, as he would say. But I do believe there are subtle signals we send to each other that tell us how we are expected to behave, and I wonder if any of those signals came into play in Ariely’s experiments. This isn’t the strongest of criticisms, of course. It’s a trifling point, a fixation on minutiae, a party-pooper whine. But I guess, like my father, I’m set to be the one that messes up everyone’s good time.________________Tomorrow I’ll be sitting in on a conference with Dan Ariely. I’ll let you know how it goes. In the meantime, let me know if you have any questions for him.Any thoughts? Have you read the book? What did you think?"
9,0062183591,http://goodreads.com/user/show/13816920-malda-smadi,3,"The honest truth is, we are all dishonest.I want to share a real life scenario that happened with me just yesterday right after I finished reading Dan Ariely's new book The Honest Truth About Dishonesty.The situation: An anonymous person at our office refills the office refrigerator with a dozen small water bottles, everyday. They’re stacked in the top compartment on their own, unlocked, unmarked, un-anything. They’re just there. Sinister, isn't it? Next to that fridge are two water coolers that are obviously for everyone to use. So who are the bottles for?The reasoning: In terms of water consumption, I personally prefer having a bottle on my desk rather than walking back and forth to the kitchen for a glass of water. At other times, I either forget, or get too lazy to get my own supplies, and that’s when my dishonest behavior kicks in.The bad behaviour: I found that I was occasionally opening the fridge and helping myself to one water bottle knowing that they belonged to someone else. In the beginning it was discreet but after going unnoticed for so long, I gradually stopped putting effort in hiding and carried on believing that I was actually entitled to a free bottle of water from our shared office fridge. I’m not sure if I was the only one taking a bottle, but let’s just say I wasn’t.Yesterday, I confidently made my way to our lovely pantry, opened the fridge, and there it was! A warning note that read, “Please don’t touch!” *ominous music* I didn’t dare touch anything this time, even when there was no one around. I then spent the rest of the day hiding under my desk anticipating arrest and imprisonment.This is the general idea of the book (without going into spoilery details.) The author, Dan Ariely, whose previous bestsellers include Predictably Irrational and The Upside of Irrationality, conducts different experiments in similar situations to mine, low-risk, low-stakes scenarios where sometimes there are no consequences whatsoever to being dishonest, and then he uncovers some pretty shocking truths regarding just how far we would go as supposedly ""honest"" people.It’s a 10-chapter popular psychology book that covers various situations, contexts, and settings that affect human behavior and decision-making when it comes to being dishonest. Ariely is known for his cheerful writing style by which he usually includes his personal stories in between experiments and eases off scientific/psychological analyses for the light user looking for a good read.The analysis: Read the book. But pay for it first...."
10,0062183591,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1794273-jaylia3,5,"Entertaining, eye-opening, disturbingThis funny, fascinating, personal paradigm shattering book is in a genre I love, books that make me examine my thinking process, but this one caused me more soul searching than any other I’ve read. According to the Simple Model of Rational Crime (SMORC) we decide whether or not to be dishonest based on a logical, mathematically calibrated cost-benefit analysis, and we’d all be as dishonest as we could be as long as it brought us a benefit greater than the likely cost. Fortunately, author Dan Ariely discovered that people aren’t as cold-bloodedly calculating as that. Unfortunately, the news about human morality isn’t all good.Ariely is very skilled at conceiving, conducting and describing experiments that tease apart the tangle of human motivations. According to what he’s discovered, we’ll cheat, lie and steal, but only as much as we can rationalize because we want to be able to feel good about ourselves. We’re all capable of dishonesty, and being natural story tellers we’re extremely adept at creating perfectly logical seeming explanations justifying our less than moral actions, though we rarely understand exactly why we make the choices we do. We invariably underestimate how much we are influenced by a myriad of circumstances ranging from conflict of interest to how tired we are feeling.Since we want to see ourselves as good, most of us never stray far from the straight and narrow path, but small frequent transgressions can create bigger problems than the egregious acts of a few bad apples. Our collective peccadilloes can wreck havoc, but with an improved understanding of the situations that increase dishonest behavior Arliey hopes his book can be a guide for corrective actions and legislation.

On the one hand, because of some mistakes and the stories I told to myself, and on the another hand because it was a confirmation for the times I felt really bad, as I was aware of my action. First thoughts when trying to predict what is the book subject, were that it's most probably a book about cheating in relationships and cheating for becoming richer. Sorry to disappoint you, but it's not about cheating in relationships as you might have expected too. Instead, you get some conclusions based on experiments. I was always expecting numbers, but by the end of the book you get a sense that Dan is critic enough not to draw conclusions out of superficial experiments.Most interesting aspects found out:- we are more likely to cheat if we know that others will benefit from our dishonest action- the stories we tell to ourselves not to feel bad about ourselves when we are dishonest- that the cheating level is about the same in different countries (experimented in USA, Israel, Italy, Turkey, Canada and England).Two particular passages that I found particularly powerful are:""Most people cheat just enough to still feel good about themselves.""""This experience taught me that sometimes (perhaps often) wedon’t make choices based on our explicit preferences. Instead,we have a gut feeling about what we want, and we go through aprocess of mental gymnastics, applying all kinds of justificationsto manipulate the criteria. That way, we can get what we reallywant, but at the same time keep up the appearance—to ourselvesand to others—that we are acting in accordance with our rationaland well-reasoned preferences."""
12,0062183591,http://goodreads.com/user/show/13779-k,3,"I feel a little bad about the three stars. I enjoy Dan Ariely's entertaining and informative books about behavioral economics and the many ways in which we are far less rational than we want to believe. Exploring the topic of honesty from a variety of angles appeals to me as well, and true to form, Ariely highlighted many interesting aspects of honesty/dishonesty -- contagion of dishonesty, how a sense of altruism and collaboration can facilitate dishonesty, the relationship between creativity and lying, how a sense of depletion or deprivation can use up valuable will power so that we have fewer resources for self-control to do the right thing, etc., etc.So why only three stars? I think a lot of it was that audio was probably not the ideal venue for this book, at least for me. Although I can enjoy popular nonfiction on audio, it can also be a bit of a harder sell. Other goodreaders complained about Ariely's repeated use of a matrices test as a stimulus for measuring cheating. I can't really blame Ariely for reusing the same test if that's what worked, and the point wasn't the test itself but what he was exploring. So I don't think that was the problem, but I'm not sure why I occasionally felt overloaded and overwhelmed with research descriptions and data and wanted more narrative.Since I often found myself spacing out I can really only give this three stars, but don't let that put you off from trying the print version which I suspect was a more rewarding experience."
13,0062183591,http://goodreads.com/user/show/10547530-mark,5,"Fantastic book and very insightful. The research presented is compelling and surprising... and often concerning. To know about it is to be far better prepared to recognize why people do what they do. There are helpful suggestions to recognize when I am not being fully honest and to align my own actions better with the integrity that I perceive myself to have. VERY helpful and super insightful. Thanks yet again Dan, for an amazing book."
14,0062183591,http://goodreads.com/user/show/52763346-farhana,4,"Either 3.8/5 or 4.2/5 .This one is intriguing. Ariely's writing is easy to follow. It's so fluent, spontaneous and most importantly, he explained everything in simple words with examples & experiments avoidingcomplex theories & technical jargon. He discussed psychology behind dishonesty. And if you think about it you'll see that many fundamental cues behind dishonesty are accepted as normal behavior or treated as an open secret. For example, in lab experiments when the result seems to be incorrect, we do some back calculations, fudge the data to make the result look right or give proxy attendance for our friends or classmates who are absent in the class. And even in larger scale, nationwide cheating in public exams by leaking question papers before the exam! And so on.The book's simplicity will touch anyone. If you ponder over the ideas in it, it will be an eye opener."

16,0062183591,http://goodreads.com/user/show/223837-nicky,3,"The reasons why we lie and to what extent we’re willing to lie are pretty fascinating, and if you haven’t read anything else of the sort before, this might be pretty revelatory. Ariely explains the various studies and results pretty clearly, and it’s definitely not aimed at people who have actually dug into the academic publications: it’s accessible to a layperson, definitely, and to my mind pretty much aimed at the layperson. At any rate, I didn’t find any of it surprising, because I’ve read most of this before and know something of the way we’ve discovered our brains work. I’m not 100% positive there was nothing new, but there wasn’t much that didn’t sound familiar.So, a good read if you’re looking for something on the subject, but probably not much point if you’re already pretty aware of research into dishonesty and why we lie.Reviewed for the Bibliophibian."
17,0062183591,http://goodreads.com/user/show/35-michael-siliski,3,"An interesting topic, though pretty familiar ground if you have any exposure to behavioral economics and/or cognitive psychology. Feels a bit rote, lifeless overall. A straight survey of the material. Takeaways:* Standard classical model of dishonesty/cheating is SMORC – simple model of rational crime – which says we cheat when it's in our rational interest. EV is positive, or expected payoff is greater than the risk of getting caught and the associated punishment.* SMORC is false. Ariely calls his alternative the ""fudge factor"" theory, which basically says that cheating is rampant in all scenarios, whether the payoffs are big or small, but only by small amounts. People cheat just enough so they can still tell themselves they are still good people. Even when there is zero risk of getting caught.* Probably the most interesting thing is just how common cheating is by these small amounts. I think it conflicts with how most people think about it.* Points on self-deception are really interesting. For example, people overestimate their abilities on a test based on having just lied about their previous score, even though they should know that that's meaningless in terms of actual performance."

The (Honest) Truth About Dishonesty
 is a fun look at a serious topic - lying. Ariely, a professor of behavioral economics at Duke University, describes his simple experiments and details his results in a light, easy to understand way. His results are often surprising and counter-intuitive.For example, it is often considered that people are dishonest because they have calculated the risk of being caught and the reward if they get away with the dishonesty and act accordingly. Ariely demonstrates that this is incorrect and spends the rest of the book showing what conditions are more likely to cause dishonest behavior and what conditions decrease dishonesty.This could have been a stupefyingly dull book, but Ariely deft touch makes it a very fun and very quick read. http://dwdsreviews.blogspot.com/2012/..."
19,0062183591,http://goodreads.com/user/show/973558-shiloah,5,"Mind blown. I was amazed at how many ways we are dishonest with ourselves and others. My conscious was pricked a bit, honestly. The part about children, for me, really drove home the Biblical concept of “train up a child in the way he should go.” We have such a duty to our children to model honest and responsible behavior. I loved the author’s sense of humor, his clear and understandable writing, and the interesting content! Absolutely wonderful book."
20,0062183591,http://goodreads.com/user/show/9951372-shiri,5,"Loved the newest installation from Dan Ariely. I'm a huge fan so I'm already biased, but this book was a breezy read and very insightful. It was also disturbing and slightly distressing, as the main premise is that most harm to society comes from normal people each cheating just a little bit, then rationalizing it to fit in our personal ""fudge factor"". With connections to many great researchers, including Roy Baumeister of ""Willpower"" fame (among others), Ariely presents a delicate balance between wanting to conceive of ourselves as honest human beings and wanting to maximize gain. Ego depletion and the ""what-the-hell"" effect can induce us to cheat more. Even creativity is not safe, as Ariely's inventive experiments include one that shows a correlation between lying and creativity: the more creative we are, the more creative stories we can spin to justify our behavior.I will point out one issue that bothered me throughout the book, and which Ariely briefly mentions near the end of it: the ""matrix"" task on which a large portion of these experiments relies on, is not really a task that people perform on a regular basis. It's possible that cheating in laboratory conditions is higher (or lower! as in the cultural comparison Ariely discusses) depending on the context in which people are in. It would be fascinating to see if the conclusions would hold in more mundane, everyday tasks.All in all, a great book and highly recommended, especially for Ariely aficionados. If you're thirsty for more Ariely and have finished his other books, you should also check out his free Coursera class.Finally, a word of warning: If you're a normal human being who has ever in your life cut corners in some way, be prepared to painfully release the conception of yourself as a good and honest person. Ariely's no-bs approach that taking a pencil from the office is qualitatively identical to ripping off the public in Wall Street may well send you to your therapist's office -- or to the confessional -- in an urgent need to ""reset"" your perception of yourself as a decent person. And yes, Ariely talks about that too(!), including a brief discussion of Yom Kippur and other religious holidays as resetting rituals. As for me, I'm going to wash my filthy hands and go atone for my sins."
21,0062183591,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3639199-alain-burrese,5,"""The (Honest) Truth About Dishonesty: How We Lie to Everyone - Especially Ourselves"" by Dan Ariely is a fascinating look at cheating and dishonesty. Backed by research, Ariely provides explanations for the unethical behavior that seems to be endemic from Washington to Wall Street, the classroom to the workplace, and everywhere else you turn.It is interesting to see that irrational forces are often behind whether we behave ethically or not, and cheating and dishonesty are not merely derived from a cost-benefit analysis. The more engaging element of this book is Ariely's ability to make his research interesting, engaging, and relevant. It was not only an educational book, but a very engaging and entertaining one too. One of the many things I found interesting was the conclusion from an experiment that suggested that the probability of getting caught doesn't have a substantial influence on the amount of cheating. This is just the opposite that I thought would happen and that I suppose many others would believe too.The book explores why we cheat others and why we cheat ourselves. One especially interesting part were the findings of how people only cheat ""a little bit"" so they can still consider themselves honest and good. It was also interesting when some experiments showed people would cheat to help others more than themselves, and at other times how certain things such as reminding people about honesty could decrease the amount of cheating. The opposite is also true, with findings that wearing ""fakes"" can lead us to cheat more. Think having a stronger relationship with a professional will reduce the likelihood of the professional acting for a self-interest when faced with a conflict of interest? Think again! The chapter on conflicts of interest and being blinded by our own motivations sheds some interesting light on this topic as well.I thoroughly enjoyed reading this book, and it explained occurrences I've seen in others and myself. It provided information for me to use when maintaining my own honesty as I try to raise honest children and influence others with ethical behavior. As the author concludes, once we better understand what really causes our less-than-optimal behavior, we can start to discover ways to control our behavior and improve our outcomes. Ariely's ""The (Honest) Truth About Dishonesty"" is definitely a start to better understanding what really causes cheating and dishonesty, and it is a book I recommend highly to anyone interested in this field of study."
22,0062183591,http://goodreads.com/user/show/555289-arvin,5,"A really great look into the current research into how/why people cheat/lie to other people and even to themselves. The book is well written, well paced and I personally think the topics discussed are fascinating.I really like Dan Ariely's (Professor of Psychology and Behavioral Economics at Duke, formerly of MIT) books because:His writing is easy to understand and has a playful entertaining tone. His anecdotes always add to the topic being discussed - unlike Daniel Kahneman, Nobel prize winner and mentor to Dan Ariely, who drones on and on about himself and his co-researcher for no good reason in his book ""Think Fast and Slow"".All of the area he discusses are support by actual research that has been done, often himself - versus someone like Malcolm Gladwell who is more of a journalist looking to ""collect interesting stories."" Instead of just throwing unsupported conclusions at the end, he actually tries to apply the findings of his research in the real world(like getting people to not cheat on taxes or their insurance claim). There are some areas he is interested in, but admits he can't talk too much about them, because he hasn't been able to do any experiments to test his hypothesis (never stopped Malcolm Gladwell... or Steven Dubner on global warming in Superfreakomics, a disappointing followup to Freakonomics).He does a lot of followup studies to try and answer questions left open from his initial results. That is he doesn't take it for granted that you will automatically accept his finding as correct. On the flipside, he has often noted that some people have commented that the results of research as ""obvious."" So instead he had people predict what his findings before giving that actual results. It turns out if people are not ""forced"" to commit to position before finding the ""correct"" answers, they delude themselves that they ""knew it all along"" - he devotes an entire chapter to this. BTW, that's why you do so well on those magazine quizzes that have the answers on the back page."
23,0062183591,http://goodreads.com/user/show/46440888-jennifer-rivera,5,"I absolutely loved this book because of the author’s interesting findings, easy to read style, and outside applications.The findings of cheating/ being dishonest might surprise many of us mainly because some of the things we do is unconscious and not robotic. (I won't provide any spoilers here, but if you are interested in any social behavior of human beings, then this is a book I highly recommend for you, especially if you want to know more about human immorality.)Although many of the studies conducted by the author, Dan Ariely, are in a laboratory, many of his findings can be generalized to majority of the people in many countries (he proved this by explaining one of his experiments that he conducted internationally). Not only that, but he also includes past experiments from other researchers, and a field study that he conducted with the help of his friends to find out why people cheat/lie. This book is also very easy to read and because it is around 255 pages, you can quickly finish it and understand much of the content. This is very good, especially if you want to research more about the topic of human morality, dishonesty, cheating, and etc. If that's not enough, the author inputs many of his own dishonesty and shows the reader that he is also human and isn't immune to many temptations of cheating that we all face. He proves that we are all cheaters and liars in multiple situations. Although there are ways to decrease cheating and lying, there are also ways to increase it (and about 2 ways to neither decrease nor increase the amount of cheating/ lying, even though our intuitions claim these two ways have an effect to it).Since reading this book, I will actively try to become more moral, especially as I grow up, therefore I recommend this book to anyone and everyone so as a society we can grow from understanding ourselves better."
24,0062183591,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2617263-sara,5,"I read this book in one sitting. It is a fascinating look into the inherent dishonesty that lies in all of us. We all cheat. Just a little. White Lies, Pens from the office, travel expenses, etc. But what is interesting is what allows us to cheat; What factors are in place that let us choose to cheat and by how much we will cheat; And how we trick ourselves into rationalizing our cheating. It's a bit disheartening, and perhaps a bit relieving, to know it just apparently in our nature and that to control it we need to be monitored. The book is an easy, entertaining and quick read. Like many of these types of books, in order to fill up pages there is a small amount of repetitiveness. But not nearly so much as others I could name that fill up 40 to 50% of the book by repeating themselves. "
25,0062183591,http://goodreads.com/user/show/33878678-d-ng-nguy-n,5,"A must read on Behavioural Economics/Psychology. Dan Ariely explained how we cheat and how we find excuses for all our little lies. I was impressed by Dan's so-called ""Fudge Factor"", and other factors on his experiments that make us irrationally lie. This book is absolutely fun and yet still informative. "
26,0062183591,http://goodreads.com/user/show/22614612-caroline,3,"The main thesis of this book is that people are dishonest not (purely) based on a rational analysis of the costs and benefits, but based on a tension between wanting the benefits of dishonesty and wanting to see themselves as honest people. The book also discusses a bunch of ways our dishonesty plays out in practice. For example, we are less likely to cheat if reminded of our moral standards right beforehand, more likely to cheat when the results of our cheating are indirect, and more likely to cheat if we see our peers doing so. Intuitively, these main points seem clearly correct. Ariely also presents a variety of experiments and anecdotes to back up the thesis. Some of them are fairly large and realistic experiments, such as a car insurance company that randomly put a signature line at the top or bottom of a form where insured reported miles driven in the past year. (People reported more total miles, presumably more honestly, when the signature line was at the top.) Other experiments were quite artificial with unspecified sample sizes. One common metric of “cheating” Ariely used throughout the book was a task where people were shown images on a computer screen of dots and a line, and instructed to estimate whether more dots were on the left or right side of the line. However, participants were informed they would be paid more each time they guessed there were more dots on the right. Thus inaccurately reporting more dots on the right was interpreted as cheating. From this description of the setup, it was unclear to me if it was reasonable to interpret choosing “right” more often as cheating. If the experimenter is paying you more to choose “right”, doesn’t that imply they want you to choose “right”? And what would be the benefit (to anyone) of choosing accurately? I think my interpretation would depend on how exactly the task was presented, but this was not specified in either the book or the paper (which I looked up). Overall, I don’t think the book changed my mind on much because it was hard to know how seriously to take the studies when results disagreed with my intuitions. It was entertaining, though, so I didn’t really mind.I listened to the audiobook, and the narration was quite good. There was also a series of short interviews at the end between Ariely and various other people. Those were okay, but not as good as the book itself."
27,0062183591,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2340759-olivia,5,"Dan Ariely (so far) never ceases to impress me in his quest to unlock the secret of human irrationality. In his third book, he puts dishonesty on the centre stage. I read it, I am hooked, I love it.First, I admire his passion and ability to narrate researches using layman language in a way that makes readers feel as if they're involved in the journey. It makes me able to appreciate research more - you see something, no matter how trivial it is, that intrigues your interest, design the research creatively and voila you learn something new.Second, related to the content of the book. Through experiments he and his colleagues conducted, he takes readers to question what generally people assume to be the cause of dishonesty and what can curb it. Assumption A: Personality. People cheat because they are (pathologically) dishonest people to begin with. What research shows: Nice people can cheat given some circumstances.Assumption B: Simple rational model of crime. What causes nice people to cheat is the benefit of cheating outweighing the cost. The bigger the benefit is (e.g. the amount of money) and the more unlikely for them to be caught, the more they cheat.What research shows: The amount of money and probability of being caught are not significant forces that shape cheating or dishonesty. Interestingly if the benefit reaped from cheating is too big, people tend not to cheat. From this point, Dan Ariely shows why simple model of crime is not adequate to explain dishonesty - it neglects the point that people want to see themselves having a good moral and their 'ability' to cheat depends on how they can reconcile or rationalise cheating with this desired view of self. Then Dan Ariely opens our eyes on irrational forces which unconsciously drive people to cheat and rationalise their behaviour. Surprisingly simple everyday circumstances 'tempt' people to cheat, even as trivial as sporting counterfeit products. Even more surprising, sometimes, good values our society praise, such as altruism, creativity, can also drive people to cheat. Based on these learnings, Dan Ariely also gives suggestions on ways to curb dishonesty. Some of the suggestions, he already tested it. However there are complex situations where he admits he does not have the silver bullets that can solve everything.And that brings me to the third reason why I like this book so much: the author's honesty that stays true to the book's title ""The (Honest) Truth about Dishonesty. The author admits other factor such as cultural influences might play a big role on dishonesty and he realises readers might expect it to be given a big portion in this book. Apparently some experiments have been replicated in other countries yet it yields similar results. This 'honesty' reflects on the conclusion takes account of the limitation of tests he used:""Our matrix test exists outside any cultural context. That is, it's not an engrained part of any social or cultural environment. Therefore, it tests the basic human capacity to be morally flexible and reframe situations and actions in ways that reflect positively on ourselves. Our daily activities, on the other hand, are entwined in a complex cultural context.""On explanation on why there is no chapter about infidelity in this book:""With all of this complexity, nuance, and social importance, you might wonder why there isn't a chapter in this book about infidelity and why this rather fascinating topic is relegated to one small section. The problem is data. I generally like to stick to conclusions I can draw from experiments and data. Conducting experiments on infidelity would be nearly impossible, and the data by their very nature are difficult to estimate. This means that for now we are left to speculate - and only speculate - about infidelity.""Back to the silver bullets problem, one might ask, ""if there is no silver bullet, what's the use of knowing all of these?"" I think this book has served its purpose - widen our perspectives on dishonesty. ""... dishonesty is a prime example of our irrational tendencies. It's pervasive; we don't instinctively understand how it works its magic on us; and most important, we don't see it ourselves.The good news in all of this is that we are not helpless in the face of our human foibles (dishonesty included). Once we better understand what really causes our less-than-optimal behavior, we can't start to discover ways to control our behavior and improve our outcomes.""By understanding irrational forces that can drive us to cheat, it is now our task to start finding ways to control our behaviour. First, start from the man/woman in the mirror. Then, think critically whether as a citizen when reviewing policies or coming up with idea to solve social problems (e.g. how to prevent corruption, how to tackle institutionalised blackmail in law enforcement) or as an aspiring 'Of The People, By The People, For The People' policy makers when designing policies (e.g. how to stay loyal to the people instead of drifting to corruption and any practice that puts self-interest/elite's interest above all)"
28,0062183591,http://goodreads.com/user/show/61218073-cesar-diez-sanchez,4,"A practical book talking about how our honesty works in different scenarios. Very interesting, to be honest."
29,0062183591,http://goodreads.com/user/show/14966031-breakingviews,4,"By Martin LangfieldIt is said that the philosopher Diogenes the Cynic roamed ancient Athens with a lamp in daylight to search for an honest man. Dan Ariely, a professor of psychology and behavioral economics, uses more modern research techniques for a similar quest. He reports his findings in a new book, “The (Honest) Truth About Dishonesty.” Diogenes said he found nothing but scoundrels. Ariely is more nuanced: most people will cheat, given half a chance, but only to the point where they can still tell themselves they are honest. The limit is useful, but dishonesty is contagious, and can be fostered by anger, fatigue, self-regard and misguided altruism, among other sometimes unexpected factors the author lists. Even things people wear can encourage it. Yet oddly simple tricks can rein in the urge to lie. Ariely focuses less on grand-scale cheating than on the small-time ways people fudge the numbers, or massage the truth, to their advantage. He and his academic colleagues conducted behavioral experiments on thousands of subjects that involved the chance to earn small amounts of money for taking a standardized reasoning test under carefully varied conditions. Many of the set-ups gave participants the opportunity to cheat by inflating their self-reported scores. While the odd “bad apple” participant would misbehave in a big way, walking off with all the available money after grossly misrepresenting his or her test scores, the experimenters found much more cash ended up going cumulatively to people who just fudged things a little, reporting higher scores in the tests than control groups who had no chance to cheat. The extent of the cheating would vary, depending on whether, for example, an honor pledge was invoked before the tests (cheating was minimal then) or a participant was seen by everyone else to be grossly dishonest without repercussions (cheating was high in those experiments, which Ariely dubbed the “Madoff condition” after convicted Ponzi scheme fraudster Bernard Madoff). Dishonesty was also fostered if a person who was seen overtly cheating was a member of the test-takers’ own social group, but far less if the overt cheater was an outsider; dishonesty was higher if people were rewarded with tokens instead of real money; and dishonesty even was higher if test-takers wore designer sunglasses they believed to be counterfeit, compared to subjects wearing shades they believed to be authentic, and to subjects not knowing either way (all the sunglasses were in fact identical and authentic). Even the idea of fakeness can have a corrosive effect on behavior. Ariely finds the most powerful forces affecting how much people cheat are their susceptibility to social influence - which is far greater than most people allow - and their capacity for self-delusion. Most people involved in the collapse of Enron or in slapping investment-grade ratings on dodgy mortgage-backed securities before the financial crisis didn’t think of themselves as dishonest people, he posits. But a little wishful blindness can go a long way. “This is where our amazing cognitive flexibility comes into play,” he writes. “… As long as we cheat by only a little bit, we can benefit from cheating and still view ourselves as marvelous human beings.” A person might cheat in one area of life to take revenge for events in another, to claim a reward for self-denial, to avoid a confrontation, to help out another person or to burnish a reputation (think of corporate bosses or politicians exaggerating their academic credentials and military records). In each case the liar has a story which justifies the act as deserved, necessary, too small to matter or even noble. What can hold temptation in check? Even atheists will cheat less after swearing on a Bible, and even a drawing of a watching eye will make people behave better in the area it surveys. Ariely concludes that being regularly reminded of moral or ethical codes, feeling watched or supervised, signing or swearing undertakings to be honest and seeing others behave honorably are all conducive to greater honesty - though perhaps too much of all that could have the opposite effect. People are not all that bad, he writes. Most are fairly honest most of the time. But people are not all that good either."
30,0062183591,http://goodreads.com/user/show/13351647-jerrod-hansen,1,"The (Honest) Truth about Dishonesty by Ariely is terrible. It got good reviews and I was expecting something akin to Freakonomics, I suppose, but found it utterly worthless. The entire book is little more than descriptions of various college-level psychology experiments on ""honesty"" that are then overgeneralized to apply to all human behavior. A few other anecdotes were used, included the author's own experiences, as if they were authoritative or valid evidence in support of the larger arguments. The author never examines ""honesty"" and begins with unexamined and unjustified moral standards. I know that there is great value in college psych lab experiments. I spent a year and a half in a cultural psych lab on my path to my anthropology PhD. I'm always aware of the shortcomings of such experiments: they are artificial and contrived and the results we get from them are not necessarily the be all, end all on the human condition. Ariely, on the other hand, clearly believes that the behaviors of college students observed in the contrived circumstance he creates in the lab are absolutely innate to the species in all other circumstances. It wasn't a very interesting book (so college kids cheat at self-reporting the number of math problems they got right in order to get a couple bucks more from participating in an experiment, sure) and it's utter reliance on these experiments disappointed. The was very little rigor in the ""just so"" stories used to extrapolate the behavior seen in the experiments and the reliance on anecdotes for real world examples is just sloppy. As an example of the disgusting and pathetic quality of analysis, he talks about a overseas friend who noticed her domestic help was stealing small amounts of meat from the freezer. Instead of firing the person or locking her out of the freezer, the friend locked the freezer but gave the domestic one of two keys (while also giving the domestic more money for her added responsibility!). When the meat thefts disappeared, Ariely offers several explanations but failed to notice the obvious effect of the two keys (namely, it would be obvious who took the meat now). The additional money also may have reduced the domestic's reliance on her employer's food stash. Ariely wrapped himself up in explanations such as how the need to unlock the freezer who draw the domestic's attention to the moral nature of the theft, yadda yadda yadda. I'm pretty pissed off at this book because it wasted a couple hours of my time and should have been good, but it wasn't. Don't waste your time on it."

If given the opportunity to cheat and not get caught, the majority of people will do it. There are a few important factors that stimulate cheating (and unlike being funny, cheating is EXTREMELY contagious in groups of people):(1) The cheater does not feel the consequences of their actions. For example, killing a fox and skinning it is morally harder than (1) asking someone else to get the fur for you, and (2) in the process exchanging with the hunter some ""money"".(2) The cheater witnesses someone else in their peer group cheat and get away with it. For example, if John Smith didn't pay tax and still got elected CEO, then why should you pay tax?(3) The cheater is able to rationalize their action in a way in which they are actually the good guys. For example, people who steal from work think that they are actually paying themselves for their boss's injustices. It's even worse if one can justify destructive and selfish acts as being ""for the good of others"", in a full-blown messiah-asshole complex.Once cheating takes root in a group setting, it amplifies until it erodes all trust in the law of the group, and therefore destroys it. This is how bonus and promotion-seeking bankers cheated on their paperwork until the entire banking system collapsed in 1929 and in 2008. This is how bonus and promotion-seeking corporate executives at Enron cheated on their paperwork until the corporation was destroyed. This is also how almost every employee in communist Soviet Union cheated until the entire economy imploded.If you're ever in a situation in which almost everyone around you cheats and gets away with it, get away FAST-the entire structure will collapse soon."

I was also professionally interested given that a lot of my work involves fraud, bribery and corruption, and I'm always keen to understand the mindset better, whether for prevention, detection, or proof.It swiftly became apparent that it would largely comprise psychology experiments in which participants were (necessarily unwittingly) tested on their honesty. These were all very well, and allowed Ariely to infer a number of broad conclusions about human behaviour,. Enough of these were intuitive enough to seems credible (e.g. That declarations of honesty at the outset, or that independent supervision, increase honesty in the task), enough unexpected enough to seem like valid extrapolations (e.g. That creative rather than analytic mind sets tend to rationalise dishonesty more, or that reward and likelihood of detection matter far les than one would expect). All fine as far as they go.But the text is leavened with anecdotes and homilies which have practically no scientific value, and cut across the apparent rigour of the sociological experiments as to cast doubt on the mindset of the person drawing conclusions from them. The conclusion is that we want to construct a morally rational narrative for our lives, and dishonesty can be redefined to meet these ends, and that this is a more powerful motivator than a stark benefit / loss / risk of loss analysis. And Ariely is strong enough to put this forward in the introductory chapter, which is much appreciated. But by the end this all seems more of a premise, and the science analysed to fit it.I have examples, but they are going to be much too tedious to set out here. Available on request."
33,0062183591,http://goodreads.com/user/show/14012229-andrew-macfarlane,4,"Dan Ariely writes casually, informatively and convincingly on a topic that many of us will have pre-conceived opinions and hypotheses about. Dishonesty is part and parcel of being human, and as Ariely unravels, is often done for reasons other than being immoral/rebellious. As part of my own field, I have to read through academic psychology journals, and so it's a rewarding treat to have experimental methods told to me as if from a friend: you will find no 'x number of participants were recruited in a double-blind, counter-balanced, nested paradigm...etc..'. Instead, he'll tell you the bare minimum you need to know in order to follow him through his, and his collaborators, often ingenious experiments. If I had to express some qualms, it would be the idea that we should all be cheating more often as predicted by SMORC, and by implication, that the SMORC is useless. Agreed, the SMORC is much too simple, but to use one of Ariely's examples: if a lady in a coffee shop asks us to look after her laptop whilst she goes to the toilet, we should take the opportunity to walk away with the laptop. This ignores all sorts of catastrophic thoughts people can generate with worst case scenarios. Sure, if I liked the lady, I wouldn't take her laptop because I'm a decent person. But if she was rude to me, I still wouldn't take it, because I'd be worried that the law enforcement agencies might have clever ways of finding me, or because the laptop might be traceable, or because CCTV might have caught me. We don't always know the probability of getting caught, so in absence of this information, overestimating it seems the safe bet. I think Ariely misses this point.A very illuminating read, and one that will keep me thinking about these matters for some time to come. "
34,0062183591,http://goodreads.com/user/show/625444-diane,4,"Honestly, this is not my normal type of book, but it would be dishonest to say I didn’t like it. (ok, ha ha) I was surprised when this book arrived from the library (my wonderful library sends me books I request as they become available). Did I really request this? Oh, yes, I was impressed with Cheryl’s review and must have asked for it. I was a bit skeptical about reading it but I am glad that I did. A good advertisement for the benefit of GoodReads.Author Ariely defines honesty broadly, including cheating on a diet and the acts of those involved in Enron scandal. I enjoyed the way he broke down questions and set up experiments, letting tasks like counting dots or doing problems stand in for life events. I tend to see things rather intuitively and can have trouble breaking things down into small bits and his approach was insightful. I liked the way signing a document (such as your income tax form) BEFORE you fill it in seemed to induce honesty or reading the Ten Commandments before doing a task made you more honest even if you were an atheist. I could not swallow the information on cheating ourselves more if we wore “fake” name brands; he seems to have forgotten people like me (and other old hippies) who don’t even know what the name brands are. One of the most interesting revelations was that nearly everyone seems to be minimally dishonest; I consider myself mostly honest, but can point to lots of small dishonesties. The author takes a mostly amusing attitude toward life and toward his profession that I found fun; I don’t know how well it wears in reality.This is a quick and easy book to read and I found it worthwhile and thought it would be a fun book to talk about in a group. Thanks, Cheryl in CC"
35,0062183591,http://goodreads.com/user/show/43941005-yainely,4,"Out of all the books I read I think ""The Honest Truth About Dishonesty"" by Dan Ariely was the most interesting one. I learned many new things about myself with this book. Like the example from the book about the coke and the money.It proved to us that most humans would be willing to steal something that cost money, which in this case the coke then steal the amount of money that the coke was worth ($6) and buy it ourselves. I put myself in this situation and I probably would have done the same thing. Us humans see that stealing both things isn't right so we choose to still steal one but steal the less valuable one (in the way that we see it) even though its worth the same thing.One thing I liked about the book is that it used many studies to prove their point and showed diagrams so that readers can get a better understanding.The experiments and the results of those different studies were very entertaining to read and I really enjoyed it.Something I learned from this book was that everyone does cheat even if its on little things and sometimes people don't even realize it. In today's society some people even think its normal and don't see anything wrong about it because they are just used to seeing everyone doing it. Another thing I learned about this book was the things that motivate people to cheat. I wasn't expecting most of these things at all. One thing I didn't like about this book was that some things were mentioned more than once but in different ways and with different examples just to prove the same thing. I would definitely recommend this book to psychologists and adult readers that have always wondered why most people are dishonest. It gets you thinking and its very informative."
36,0062183591,http://goodreads.com/user/show/34591041-jie-hui,5,"Human beings cheat because we want to benefit from cheating, but at the same time still view ourselves as honest and respectable beings. That is why we cheat a little when we have the opportunity to do so, and tend to be comfortable with the behavior when the consequence is one step removed from monetary consequence. Moreover, we are good at justifying our behavior so that we can still be a honest being in our view. Other factors that influence our misbehavior and cheating: conflict of interest, depletion (as depicted in another book Thinking Fast and Slow by Daniel Kahneman, that's why we should not make decisions when we are tired), a single act of dishonesty (once we started, our morality level will be lower and... what the hell, I have already done it, so why not go all the way), others benefiting from our dishonesty, watching other people being dishonest (dishonesty is infectious) and culture that encourages cheating. By understanding how well we can tell stories to justify our misbehavior, this book provides us an opportunity to explore why and how we cheat, and how to prevent or reduce dishonest behaviors. One of the effective way, according to Dan Ariely, is to remind people of the misbehavior right before it happens. A famous example is the picture of watching eyes on a notice in pantry's honesty box, reminding people to at least deposit some money before helping themselves with the drinks. Direct monitoring from someone outside your social circle is useful too. A lot of thinking points to be explored so that we can improve ourselves and the society. If only people in government and other sectors will read this."
37,0062183591,http://goodreads.com/user/show/20023237-melissa-hurtado,5,"Book review Melissa HurtadoPeriod 2A Level PsychTo many, cognitive dissonance is a negative feeling, however few find it to be motivational. In this book, honesty reveals itself to the readers and stirs a little regret in them. I have always found me lying to myself whether it's telling myself that I'm okay or that I will eat fruits for breakfast. Men are born sinners and will sin out of innate behavior. Dishonesty is a behavior conjured up to be disliked and shunned ever since it was of a morale. Why do we shun it so much if we all do it? How do we get ride of it? How do we spot a liar? All of these questions are answered in the book. It explains that cheating or lying is not decided by a cost reward analysis. Studies in the book showed that people cheated less when they had more rewards. I enjoyed the accurate research and date put into the book. Multiple case studies allowed me to open my eyes to the truth about dishonesty. Something that I definitely did not enjoy is how most of the studies that showed the results from the book were in a lab. Therefore, most result could've been unreliable. What some people might not like about the book are the rough situations they are put in while reading the book. It exposes various truths about how we lie every day. There is also no such things as a white lie. The book itself is to help others search themselves and others for dishonesty and how to treat it. I've learned to apply some tips that I got from the book. I highly recommend the book to everyone."
38,0062183591,http://goodreads.com/user/show/308912-tucker,4,"Ariely's behavioral experiments about cheating are quite interesting. I sensed, however, that, in this book, he leapt to overly broad conclusions about cheating in general, and that some key ideas were oversimplified. Perhaps the motivation was to make the book readable by a wide audience, but I feel that something important was sacrificed. Cheating, especially including self-deception and post-hoc rationalization, is by its nature a complex behavior. And while Ariely's experiments mainly focused on permutations of one particular kind of cheating, it seems obvious that there are radically different kinds of cheating: some driven by emotion, some by sex, some by a desire to fit in, some by greed for a buck. (Ariely gives the briefest nod to these potential distinctions only at the end of the book, rather than defining up front the scope of the cheating he was interested in.) My overall impression is that his creative research approaches have resulted in a lot of interesting data and that he's authored some ""sticky"" images and metaphors, but that philosophically this book is a bit weak. This would be interesting in combination with a more philosophical book on different kinds of dishonesty and cheating."
39,0062183591,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2073876-jan,3,"I liked this book a lot. It's stuck with me since April. I frequently find myself telling people about it. I also see it happening in real life. In fact, there other day a friend posted on FB that his iPod had been stolen out of his car and he was very angry with himself because he'd forgotten to lock the car door. I thought to myself, ""That's exactly what Dan Ariely talked about in his book. The vast majority of people wouldn't walk around, bashing in car windows to steal iPods, but a lot of people would go around checking doors, and would steal an iPod if they found the door unlocked.""I've considered giving this book a 4 (I would put it in the 3.5 category) but, to me, both the experiments Ariely used and the chapters he wrote about them started to get a bit repetitive. I got a little bored. I also had some questions about some of the conclusions he came to. In particular, when he was talking about the ""altruistic"" aspect of dishonesty, the cynic in me wondered if there wasn't another, less magnanimous reason that people lie in such situations, and if Ariely and his cohorts had explored that.At any rate, I wouldn't say that those concerns detract from the book, and if you pick this one up, I think you'll find that it's extremely informative."

It is a little bit scarry and sad.We are pulled between our desire to gain (by cheating) and our image of ourselves as ""good"" people. The ""fudge factor"" helps us reconcile them through (obvious) rationalisations.We cheat for personal gain, but also to help others. Cheating is contagious, through changes in our perceived social norms. There are a few ""tricks"" to reduce cheating, moral reminders for example. But basically, it's pretty bad.Understanding what is going on is a first step, but there is no silver bullet...Good read. On a personal level, but also for managers, teachers and people in other professional settings."

I'd watched the TED talk from the author which I found interesting and entertaining, so had some high hopes for this book, which unfortunately weren't quite met. There were some fascinating anecdotes in this book, and the section on the impact of collaboration on cheating was really worthwhile. If this book was more concise it could be four or five stars, however as it really only has one point, that we all cheat a little bit, it just seems to take far too many pages to make it."
42,0062183591,http://goodreads.com/user/show/894917-angelina,4,The voice on this audiobook was AMAZING. I would highly recommend listening to something narrated by Simon Jones.The book itself was well-written and engaging. It covered a vast array of circumstances and variables that influence cheating in a logical and orderly fashion. In spots it felt just a touch repetitive: maybe because the ways people cheat and lie in various scenarios are eerily similar or because Dr. Ariely explained the set-up for his scientific experiments each time (which is valuable). Definitely worth the time to read.

44,0062183591,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1054712-kent-winward,4,"Honesty is much more tied to our social constructs than we would like to believe. Oddly, caring for other humans tends to carry more weight than actual honesty based on some of the studies Ariely discusses -- an altruistic dishonesty emerges. Our main goal seems to be to keep our self-perception in line with the outer social perception of ourselves. The biological and economic incentives drive us, but the real motivator is in how other people perceive us. We will believe lies, just so we can conform and belong to the group, which puts the historic problem of party politics into perspective. Both sides believe their own lies. "
45,0062183591,http://goodreads.com/user/show/13733795-stefanos,4,"Dan Ariely adds another excellent piece of work in his highly educational and delightful repertoire.Τhis time he examines human dishonesty towards ourselves and others.Context:The typical assumption about human dishonesty,and immoral acts in general, is that,under situation where cheating is possible,people perform a cost-benefit analysis of the possible scenarios and their consequences.Their chances of being caught and punished versus the gains - and then follow the most profitable decision.If i were,for example,alone in the nearby bookstore and all of the employees were busy - not minding me - i should reason that by stealing it i could save some money,the chances of being caught were extremely low - noone is looking plus there is no monitoring system - even if i got caught the consequences would be minimal - and since i really want this book so much it would be rational to take it.But as it turns out,this is not how most of us think.Hopefully!?I’ve been reading a lot about behavioral economics lately,a field - i have to admit - i’m very fond of.Instead of forming theoretical models from forsight,what behavioral science does,is to ignore all assumptions about decision making and empirically test how we actually behave in certain circumstances and how we make decisions.And once again,aspects of the rational-agent model of standard economics is falsified.What Dan and his team found,is that - given the change - we want to benefit from stealing but at the same time, maintain the belief that we are honest and moral people.Hence we steal just by a little and then justify our actions,in a way or the other,even if we have to totally ‘brainwash’ ourselves.I remember how as a kid,i would go with my friends to the local market with a simple plan - one would distract the owner,the other would steal one or two chocolates and then we shared the earnings.We quickly became experts at the task.It was easy since the owner was rather old with limited visual abilities, but we got even better at justifying our action.”He is profitizing by overcharging the chocolates and anyway it’s only one or two chocolates.He probably doesn’t even need the money anyway,he is surely getting an old-age pension” etc.You get the point.You’ve been there.But one day,my friend thought that we were not profiting as much as we could and suggested stealing more.We decided then to get the whole pack.Ten large chocolates.Performed the typical ritual,got the pack and we were off and running.The problem now was that we felt terrible,we felt bad for the guy and about ourselves - this time,we couldn’t justify such an action.This was our last business together. Of course,it’s nice to know that most of us are less dishonest than economics assumes us to be but there is still much to be overcomed.The prevailing assumption is that cheating is being done by the few and that most of us are moral and honest people.Both assumptions turn out to be wrong.As we see in these experiments,only an extremely small minority were big cheaters and instead,the overwelming majority were slight cheaters and the later costed much more money to the expiramenters in total than the former.For example,it’s not only the few corrupt politicians that causes financial deficiencies but also the vast population of citizens and companies that even slightly cheat in their tax report.But since the politician’s field of influence is larger they are the one’s being mostly blaimed,(of course) fairly blaimed but slight cheaters are as well part of the problem and have to be eliminated.Another case is our views on lying.Most people i talk with,believe that lying is in most cases a bad decision.Getting caught lying feels very uncomftable,people are most likely to trust us less,lies perplex our reality,many times we have to remember our made-up stories and cover up holes etc.But i find the very same people lying and justifying their lies far more often than they understand - i’m as well cathing myself lying more that i want to believe.The thing is that there are many different aspects and cases of dishonesty and this book touches most.Like:does the social environment affects people’s morality;what happens when we are many steps removed from directly committing a crime - when we don’t directly see the consequences;what happens when we face a conflict of interest;does cultural norms change people’s dishonesty and more.People were found to be much more dishonest when they were surrounded with dishonest people or when they were few steps removed from cheating, e.g when instead of money they were taking plastic tokens that could exchange for money later.Yet, Dan gives us a glimpse of hope and optimism when he answers the big question of ‘how to eliminate dishonesty'.He found in his experiments that when people are reminded of morality - when they are asked to remember the ten commandments or sign ‘not to break the moral code of their school’ - people do not cheat or at least,not as much.The finding are intriguing.The problem is of great significance.It all suggests,once again,that we have to rethink our social policies and education."
46,0062183591,http://goodreads.com/user/show/8660033-aaron-thibeault,4,"*A full executive-style summary of this book is now available here: http://newbooksinbrief.com/2012/07/02...There is certainly no shortage of lying, cheating and corruption in our society today. At their worst, these phenomena do substantial damage to our communities and the people in them. Picking on the corporate world for just a moment, consider a few high-profile examples from the last decade: the scandals at Enron, WorldCom, Bernard L. Madoff Investment Securities, Haliburton, Kmart, Tyco, Bristol-Myers Squibb, and a host of banks in the financial crisis of 2008.If you are a particularly pessimistic person, you may think that people are fundamentally self-interested, and will engage in dishonest and corrupt behavior so long as the potential benefits of this behavior outweigh the possibility of being caught multiplied by the punishment involved (known as the Simple Model of Rational Crime or SMORC). On the other hand, if you are a particularly optimistic person, you may think that the lying and cheating that we see in our society is largely the result of a few bad apples in the bunch.Given that the way we attempt to curb cheating and corruption depends largely on which view we think is correct, we would do well if we could come up with a proper understanding of these tendencies, and under what circumstances they are either heightened or diminished. Over the past several years, the behavioral economist Dan Ariely, together with a few colleagues, has attempted to do just this--by way of bringing dishonesty into the science lab. Ariely reveals his findings in his new book, The (Honest) Truth About Dishonesty: How We Lie to Everyone--Especially Ourselves.In order to get at the truth, Ariely invited subjects into his lab and gave them tasks with monetary rewards, where cheating was a very real and clear possibility. As you can tell from the title of the book, Ariely found that cheating was not confined to a few bad apples, but was in fact very widespread. On the bright side, though, Ariely also found that the vast majority of his subjects did not cheat nearly as much as they could have, but instead confined themselves to just a little bit of cheating.Given his findings, Ariely concludes that most of us are torn between two conflicting impulses. On the one hand is the desire to get ahead by way of dishonesty, and on the other hand is the desire to nevertheless think of ourselves as genuinely honest and good people. Getting the best of the both worlds can be tricky, but we manage to do so by way of resorting to our trusty capacities of rationalization and self-deception. Of course, different people show different powers of rationalization and self-deception, and also different circumstances can alter the terms of the negotiation significantly for each of us, thus leading to more or less cheating.For instance, Ariely found that those who are especially creative are particularly good at rationalization and self-deception, and therefore tend to cheat more so than others (in fact, Ariely found that even priming normal subjects with words related to creativity can increase their cheating behaviour). In addition, he also found that several factors influence the amount that people cheat in general. These factors included being reminded of one's morals; playing for tokens representing money, as opposed to money itself; having one's resolve broken down by will-power depletion; wearing counterfeit clothing and merchandise (as opposed to the genuine article); having one's self-confidence artificially inflated; witnessing other people cheating (either from one's own in-groups, or from out-groups); cheating to benefit others etc.While these findings are interesting in their own right, Ariely insists that they also have practical value, as he uses his findings to chart out suggestions with regards to how we can minimize cheating and corruption in our own lives, as well as in society at large.Ariely's clever lab experiments yield many interesting findings with regards to dishonesty, and he tells about them in a very easy and relatable way in his book. My only real criticism is that Ariely does not get into the evolutionary story about the conflicting desires that he identifies, and how and why they may have been laid down in our evolutionary past. Though such a story is not absolutely essential here (as the research does stand on its own), it would add substantially to our understanding of the subject (and is interesting in its own right), and would therefore by very worthwhile. A full executive summary of the book is available here: http://newbooksinbrief.com/2012/07/02...A podcast discussion of the book is also available."

49,0062183591,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5716589-shiela-chan,4,3.5 starsWe all cheat. Just a little. Not to the point where we feel bad about ourselves.Here are a few excerpts I find interesting:People are more likely to cheat more steps further to the value of money. That's why lunches get stolen but not your change on your office table.People are likely to cheat when they're stressed or depleted their willpower. Why its important to have a cheat day on a diet. So we can replenish and reduce the chances of falling out. Reminding people of the ten commandments even when they dont believe them (atheists) can improve their morality.Why does wearing fake gear can cause us to be more dishonest?There are many more situations in the book :) It isn't as good as predictably irrational but the first half was an easy read. Being aware of the little nuances that cause dishonesty hopefully can help keep ourselves in check from time to time.
50,0062183591,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1805086-carl,5,"Ariely is perhaps the most interesting social scientist writing today. This book is just as enthralling as his two others (and his engaging blog). (As I noted in my writeup about Jonah Lehrer's Imagine, I notice but am not troubled by what some may call self-plagiarism. Ariely does bring back notes he has made and experiments he has referenced in earlier texts. The context being different here, and the work being his own, I can't see any crime there -- even in a book about honesty and dishonesty -- especially because that work fits this different context perfectly. Of course, Lehrer's crimes in Imagine go far beyond and are much worse than self-plagiarism.)The material is fascinating, and his writing is very clear and often funny, as in the commentary about how college exam periods are dangerous to grandmothers, who seem to die at elevated rates during those times -- well, at least according to their grandchildren, Ariely's students, who ask for many extensions on papers and projects due to ""deaths in the family."" Each topic in this book bears obvious value for businesspeople, teachers, students, anybody who is interested in human interaction. Chapter titles clearly say it: ""Blinded by Our Own Motivations"", ""Why We Blow It When We're Tired"", ""Cheating as an Infection: How We Catch the Dishonesty Germ"", etc. The organization itself shows excellent understanding of the breadth and depth of the topic.Ariely deserves special commendation for the style and crispness of his writing voice. He conducts the analysis like an excellent lecture -- he's one of my favorite TED speakers, eminently worth checking out at TED.org -- that never forgets to involve the audience. In the context of discussing how people who have heard the answer rationalize that that was what they were thinking all along, he remarks on how he has changed his class style to elicit feedback/predictions from the audience before he gives results to experiments he poses...and then proceeds to do the same thing throughout the book. Very smart, and humble, too. In addition to explaining clearly and thoughtfully, he recaps each section and chapter with well-organized summaries of what was demonstrated in the chapter, and how all the pieces are fitting together more and more as the book develops.At the end, one of these summative graphics encapsulates key elements that increase, do not affect, and decrease dishonestly. Spoiler alert (but you will still want to read his explanations about each element even if you know this ""outcome"")!

Increase dishonesty: ability to rationalize, conflicts of interest, creativity, one immoral act, being depleted (""tired""), others benefitting from our dishonesty (""altruism?""), watching others behave dishonesty, culture that gives examples of dishonesty 
  
No effect: amount of money to be gained, probability of being caught 
  
Decrease dishonesty: pledge, signatures (and when/where they are requested), moral reminders (of secular and religious natures), supervision 
 Ariely analyzes prescriptions in many forms. As a reader who is interested in developing a culture of integrity at the school where I teach, I boil over with lists of people with whom I want to -- am desperate to -- share these thoughts.A closing thought: Ariely is decidedly non-partisan but there are many arguments in here about regulation, which are naturally applicable to government. We all know that one political party in the U.S. wants to reduce regulation, but that even that party doesn't want more cheating. As good as this book is for teachers and students, it may be even more useful for potential regulators. Pages 88, 94-95, 188, and 234 all touch on this crucial topic; I hope our legislators (and voters) are reading and thinking about it."
51,0062183591,http://goodreads.com/user/show/18622-doug,4,"Some interesting insights on why we cheat and the factors that make us more or less likely to cheat. I'm not totally sold on some of his ideas; the author hypothesizes that the further we distance ourselves from the act, the more we are likely to cheat, and uses as an example the fact that golfers are much more likely cheat by hitting the ball to improve their lie than kick it or pick it up and place it in a better spot, because using a club distances them from the act more than kicking it or picking it up and placing it. Sounds good, but it could just happen this way because it takes a lot more effort to bend over and pick up the ball (and it would be a lot more obvious to your playing partners) than it is to just hit it with a club, and if the ball is really buried in the grass, it's sometimes easier to hit it with a club than kick it out (not that I know this from experience, of course ;) ). A lot of his insights seem to bear out with actual experience - I do agree with his assertion, I've used Napster without thinking about it but would have a really hard time shoplifting a CD from a store - but not all the dots are solid. He could very well be falling into his own trap of looking for an outcome and looking at the data what confirms his initial biases or be subconsciously looking out for his own best self interest; research like this lead to speaking engagements, NYT-bestselling books, etc.The one chapter about how creating the 'what the hell' state of mind that occurs after we first cheat or observe someone cheating terrifies me. I remember this passage from So Damn Much Money: The Triumph of Lobbying and the Corrosion of American Government, where Senator John C Stennis has to make a choice whether or not to accept campaign donations from the defense industry:Strother broke the news to Stennis that he needed to raise $2 million. How, the old man, can he do that? . . . When Strother talked about this, he wrote later, Stennis would ‘just wring his hands. Finally, in desperation, I reminded the old senator that he was chairman of [the] Armed Services Committee . . . and had spent billions of dollars with the defense industry. What about LTV? I asked him. What about McDonnell Douglas [two giant defense contractors]?’ In other words, Strother was telling Stennis it was time to cash in some chits with the corporations that got rich on the Pentagon programs that Stennis had supported. ‘Would that be proper?’ Stennis asked.Then he answered the question himself, addressing Strother the way he addressed most grown men, as sir: ‘I hold life and death over those companies. I don’t think it would be proper for me to take money from them.' Personally, Strother agreed, but he told his client that this was ‘how all the other senators do it.’ His assurance ‘did not salve the feeling that it was wrong,’ Strother remembered.Stennis’s question ‘has bothered me for years,’ Strother said twenty-five years later. ‘I’ll never forget that conversation or the troubled look on his lined face. When I left his office he was looking at his folded hands on the table in his office that had once belonged to Harry Truman. It looked as though he was in prayer. I was very sad. I had just diminished something he held dear. Accepting campaign donations is such an essential part of election politics that I don't think current politicians take a moment's thought when taking money from special interests (boo SCOTUS), and a poll saying that 24% of US bankers feel that that they may need to engage in unethical behavior to be successful doesn't make me sleep easy at night either."

I often found myself reading a study, thinking ""but surely this could be caused by X"", then seeing a study to exclude X on the next page.It also contains one of the most British studies I have ever heard of:This experiment took place in the kitchen of the psychology department at the University of Newcastle where tea, coffee, and milk were available for the professors and staff. Over the tea-making area hung a sign saying that beverage drinkers should contribute some cash to the honesty box located nearby. For ten weeks the sign was decorated with images, but the type of image alternated every week. On five of the weeks the sign was decorated with images of flowers, and on the other five weeks the sign was decorated with images of eyes that stared directly at the beverage drinkers. At the end of every week, the researchers counted the money in the honesty box. What did they find? There was some money in the box at the end of the weeks when the image of flowers was hung, but when the glaring eyes were “watching,” the box contained almost three times more money.I'm sure there were many passive-aggressive emails sent on the subject of that ""honesty box"" every day.I liked the idea that ""Essentially, we cheat up to the level that allows us to retain our self-image as reasonably honest individuals."". The rest of the book does seem to back this up (showing how both making the immorality of the act more or less salient and harder to rationalize away, and changing our current view of ourselves as moral or not, could both change the amount of cheating), and it makes intuitive sense. A useful addition to the mental toolbox.In some cases, I still felt that the conclusions drawn from the studies seemed a stretch however. For example in one of the ego depletion studies, one group has a more difficult task to complete before the standard 'cheating' test, and it is found that they cheat more and get a higher payout. It is claimed thatWhat do these findings suggest? Generally speaking, if you wear down your willpower, you will have considerably more trouble regulating your desires, and that difficulty can wear down your honesty as well.But how do we know this is the case? Maybe they just feel that they 'deserve' more money due to difficulty of the task. In the same chapter it saysEgo depletion also helps explain why our evenings are particularly filled with failed attempts at self-control—after a long day of working hard to be good, we get tired of it all. And as night falls, we are particularly likely to succumb to our desires (think of late-night snacking as the culmination of a day’s worth of resisting temptation).But could this not just be tiredness? Maybe a day of zero temptations would also result in evening of low self control?Obviously this is a pop-science book and it may be that these points are covered in the studies themselves, but some parts felt very hand-wavey and imprecise. I think a deep look into one or two points would have been more convincing than this quick tour of many aspects of dishonesty.Overall, a quick fun read with some interesting ideas.Notes: https://maxjmartin.com/book-notes/the..."
53,0062183591,http://goodreads.com/user/show/46549395-nikita-morrison,5,"this book I would probably consider my second favorite book from how pleasure works. I think the main thing that I really appreciated about this book was the fact that he talked about things that actually related to me and relates to society and how society changes everyone and the way they want to lie and it goes to show that people are dishonest about themselves. I also enjoyed how he talks about how people rationalize their dishonest actions and going back to the nurture part being the factors that increase or decrease their chances of dishonesty to themselves or to others around them. However what I didn't enjoy about the book was the fact that the beginning was a little bit slow for me and I didn't really understand it so I had to go on a lot of sites to kind of understand the beginning, and parts of the middle. For example the social research paragraphs. although I struggled from reading and understanding certain parts of the book. I did get some help from a friend of mines to understand it because she's reading the same exact book. another joyful thing about this book was the fact that the author wasn't to scientific added in some jokes and it was little bit kind of sarcastic while being professional at the same time. his insights were very inspirational and I love the fact that he brought something such as crime and cheating to a simple measure. Dan's book is definitely the type of book that makes you want it kind of rethink your morals and the way you kind of view yourself and the way you lie to yourself even though you don't necessarily acknowledge it at the time. another inside note, the front cover of the book perfectly illustrates how the book is on point. because it definitely was like you were looking at yourself in a different way. but if I had to summarise this book I definitely would say that there's 2 different parts of the book the first part being the interesting part where it gets you on your feet and the second part would probably be the part that I didn't enjoy too much because it went really in depth with inferring (Dan's point of view)about human beings. but for the most I would definitely recommend this book for sure for those who might be in high school or in college or any part of their life. this book makes you want to change the way you look at the world ,the way you look at yourself, and the way you look at others. you can also become a better person by reading this book because it makes you more insightful and it makes your ethics go a little bit higher and you set values higher than your typical standards. this definitely applies to those in the psychological field, and might be able to possibly reference this in the later paper. I will say that this book is definitely a good recommendation especially for my friends because sometimes they are a little bit sketchy but that's fine. like Dan said everyone is dishonest and a cheater!"
54,0062183591,http://goodreads.com/user/show/14551209-dan-connors,5,"With all the debate about ""Alternative Facts"", this is a timely book that delves deep into studies about when people cheat, and how they rationalize it.Most of us cheat, if only a small amount, and most of it rationalize it in order to continue thinking of ourselves as decent, honorable people. This book discusses scientific studies performed by the author and his assistants in a variety of situations.The author devised a simple study in which students would get paid based on how many problems they solved. He then loosened the rules so that students could fudge up their answers without being caught. Here are some of the main findings that I took away, and they are scary The vast majority of us have a ""fudge factor"" that we're comfortable. Very few people reported their true scores, and most of them had a range of 2 out of 6 answers that they were willing to fudge on. We tend to lie and cheat more when the results are more distant. Stealing from a big company is more justified than stealing from a hot dog stand. Downloading free but illegal music is acceptable while stealing actual musical instruments is not. We tend to lie and cheat when we are depleted and tired, and creative people tend to cheat more than those who are no. People who work fake designer clothing and knew it was fake were more dishonest than those who wore the real thing and believed it to be real. The very validity of our outside environment influences our honor code. Cheating is infectious. When people see other people cheating, it makes them more likely to cheat themselves, even if they disapprove of what the other person did. Conflicts of interest are everywhere. When it is our own best interest to stretch the truth, falsify information or pressure people, we will often succumb, rationalizing away the costs and benefits. The author uses great examples from the worlds of medicine, finance and politics to bring this idea home. In the end, we often end up cheating ourselves. People who have cheated and know that their results are bogus start to believe the false information as true and act accordingly. Instead of punishment or the threat of punishment, the two things the author found to be most effective to discourage cheating before it ever starts are (1) monitoring by a neutral party who can verify cheating if it happens or (2) moral reminders before engaging in the activity, including such things a citing a pledge to be honest and honorable.This is a great book full of unbiased and scientific studies that looks into what we all know to be true. People all around us lie and cheat if given enough temptation and freedom. To be aware of this fact is half the battle. Be very careful to look for conflicts of interest in all areas of your life and you will be closer to seeing the truth of your situation."

Study was set up (solving math problems for $$), subjects did not cheat more when the payout (for cheating) was higher. It was actually less. Probability of getting caught? Study showed roughly the same amount of cheating as when there was NO chance of getting caught.The more distanced from actual money (tokens vs. actual $), people were more likely to cheat. People are more likely to steal $1 of pens (office supplies) than an actual $1 bill. Stealing $1 and then using it to buy a pen is somehow worse than stealing a $1 pen. Getting people to recite an honor code (thou shalt not steal) makes them less likely to steal. So does signing *before* they fill out a form (like a tax form). Filling out after does not have this effect.The more distanced you are from the act, the more likely you are to cheat. Golfers cheating by moving the ball are less likely to consider it cheating if they move the ball with their club or feet than by their hands. This also ties into cheating by stealing $$$ vs. stealing supplies.Resisting temptation somehow wears down our moral resistance, and after enough resistance we are apt to give up (run out of steam) and give in.Wearing (known) fake products (sunglasses, bags) makes us more likely to cheat on various tests.Cheating across cultures and nationalities, pretty much the same.Being supervised decreases dishonesty. Even a picture of somebody watching you decreased the likelihood that somebody would cheat on putting the correct change in a box to pay for a snack.Essay mills - people paying for essay papers? As of 2010 - a survey of the quality of these papers shows them to be so poor it's immediately apparent to professors that they are complete junk.People are more likely to cheat in an altruistic situation where they are helping somebody else.Forces that shape dishonesty:Ability to rationalize the situationConflicts of interestBeing creativeOne immoral act spawning anotherBeing tiredAltruistic benefitWatching others cheatingForces that have no effectAmount of money to gainProbability of being caughtForces that decrease dishonestyPledging honestySigning somethingReminding of the moral codeBeing supervised All in all, a good read, good studies back up the conclusions.

I really loved Predictably Irrational, so I had high hopes for this one. Thankfully, it lived up to my expectations.Like the title says, the book explores the reasons why people are dishonest. Basically, the Simple Model of Rational Crime (SMORC) doesn't work. If it does, we should be seeing a lot more cheating and crime taking place. So, what propels us to cheat? In a series of experiments, Dan Ariely shows that the truth is slightly more complex.Basically, there are four forces that decrease dishonest: Pledges, Signatures, Moral Reminders and Supervision. Use these and people will reduce the amount of cheating they do (though it might not be completely eliminated, and can probably be cancelled out).There are two neutral forces: Amount of money to be gained and the probability of being caught. Although you'd think that people would only cheat if it's worth it or if they wouldn't get caught, apparently, this doesn't make much of a difference.And there's a long, long list of factors that will actually increase dishonesty:1. If you can rationalise it2. If there's a conflict of interest (even if you think you're being impartial, the conflict will influence how you behave)3. How creative you are (more creative people cheat more, apparently)4. One immoral act (it's like breaking a diet. One small break can lead to binging on junk food)5. Being tired/having no energy = no energy to resist temptation6. If someone else will benefit (so we're being... nice?)7. Watching others behave dishonestly8. Culture that gives examples of dishonestyThe book is super readable and extremely easy to understand. If Dan Ariely was my econs teacher, and he teaches like the book, I would probably have chosen to major in behavioural economics. But he isn't, so I ended up doing corporate finance + Industry 4.0/Industrial Internet (technically ""Economics of the Telecom industry, but somehow my research for the year was this).I don't actually have much else to say about the book. It was interesting and informative, and I have no regrets reading it. If you're interested in human behaviour, and what affects it, you should definitely give this book a read. Plus his other book - Predictable Irrational; both books are really excellent. This review was first posted at Inside the mind of a Bibliophile"
57,0062183591,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1441594-charlotte,2,"Ariely's *Honest Truth* is neither inconvenient nor hurtful... but it is a little bland! The book's big ""discovery"" is that most people do not cheat in proportion to either the benefit they stand to derive from cheating or the risk associated with their behavior, but rather based on how much they can rationalize their cheating to themselves. Predictably, then, cheating increases with social cues that members of one's in-groups are cheating, and with distance between one's cheating and its concrete consequences. Moral self-worth reminders and cues that social others are cheaters, on the contrary, tend to decrease cheating.All of this is entertaining, clearly exposed, and rings true; in fact, almost too true... These conclusions are so excessively intuitive that Ariely and Co's astute experiments to come to them feel somewhat gratuitous. The goal, apparently, is to put to rest the economic theory that people cheat based on purely rational cost/benefit analyses: if such a theory still holds sway, then perhaps we should recommend our economist friends to read more novels! Or perhaps they should start with Martha Nussbaum's short defense of the humanities, *Poetic Justice*? Whatever the case, I surely hope that Ariely is setting up a strawman here, because the alternative is just too depressing to contemplate.The more fundamental flaw of this book, however, was its failure to define what ""cheating"" consists in. Any breaking of an explicit rule seems to constitute cheating for Ariely--never mind the fact that human beings often navigate contradictory moral codes and injunctions. Perhaps that oversight stems precisely from trying to engage with a rules-based (""rational"") theory, albeit to contest it: Ariely ends up playing by its rules, accepting a rather un-nuanced vision of morality. This may account for the dismal last chapter, with its eagerness to promote a religiously-based vision of ethical behavior.* If Ariely wants to go beyond behavioral economy to conclude his books, an ambition I would love to applaud, perhaps he should consider partnering with ethicists, philosophers, or cultural historians of moral systems.* least I give a wrong impression, Ariely doesn't straightforwardly promote a religious agenda, but again, he adopts the terms of his ""inspiration"" with a staggering lack of critical distance."

Written by a social scientist, it is like a condensed and resumed version of his past research about cheating and dishonesty. The conclusion? There are few people who are great cheaters, but most of us, if not all, cheat a bit. The interesting part, we cheat just enough to do the deed and feel honest anyway, by using some kind of justification.In the end, this is a book about human psychology, and the pitfalls of our intuition and rationalizations. Some of the conclusions, from the book:""As we have seen so far, we human beings are torn by a fundamental conflict - our deeply ingrained propensity to lie to ourselves and to others, and the desire to think of ourselves as good and honest people. So we justify our dishonesty by telling ourselves stories about why our actions are acceptable and sometimes even admirable.""""more generally, I learned - again - about the importance of establishing rules that can safeguard ourselves from ourselves.""""We generally believe that we have a privileged view of our own preferences and character, but in reality we don't know ourselves that well (and definitely not as well as we think we do).""""Based on these results, we could speculate that people who work for ideological organizations such as political groups and not-for-profits might actually feel more comfortable bending moral rules - because they are doing it for a good cause and to help others.""""When Nisbett and Wilson questioned each participant about the rationale behind her choice, not one cited the placement of the stockings on the table. Even when the researchers told the women that all the stockings were identical and that there was simply a preference for the right-hand pair, the women 'denied it [...]'. The moral of the story? We may not always know exactly why we do what we do, coose what we choose, or feel what we feel. But the obscurity of our real motivations doesn't stop us from creating perfectly logical-sounding reasons for our actions, decisions and feelings."""
59,0062183591,http://goodreads.com/user/show/46514206-anderson-diaz,4," The Honest Truth About Dishonesty, is to say in the least quite an enjoyable book. with not only a flowing entertaining way of writing but always finding a way to keep the Reader interested in its founding topic. The author Dan Ariely kept quite a good pace throughout the book, never really getting too complicated nor too simple it made for an easy book to use for those who might be looking for a little light reading on their spare time. Another aspect of the author's format that I liked was the sudden enjoyable change in mood that there would be whenever i was deeply engrossed with what i was reading. It was like one minute I would be reading about an example of a study conducted by Ariely paying close attention to the details and findings of the study and what that meant for the topic of dishonesty. Then all of a sudden i would find myself enjoying a lighthearted story that managed to entertain me, yet at the same time be able to tie it back to the topic at hand. Giving this book a four out of five does not necessarily mean there is an issue with it. In fact I really have no criticism to make. The only reason I don't give this book a perfect review is due to my personal bias and lack of experience when dealing with books pertaining to psychological topics and research. As I am a mainly Fiction enthusiast. I've gained quite a significant amount of knowledge from reading the book. and plan on applying it to my own life by maybe carrying out some of my own social experiments. In conclusion Dan Ariely presents an interesting topic of psychology, and presents it in a way that not only comes off as rich with information. But makes the material relatively simple in a way that even a light reader or an amateur psychology reader will understand and enjoy. This book is a definite recommendation for anyone even if they are unfamiliar with psychology or simply don't read all that often. "
60,0062183591,http://goodreads.com/user/show/901342-jacob,4,"The rating is close here between 4 and 5 but I will tip it into the 4-star bucket because it doesn't quite live up to the promise of the title. I think about it a lot and I suspect it will be even more useful than the author's previous two books, but it doesn't build any real model of _how_ we lie, or _why_, other than destroying the ""factor in the likelihood of getting caught and the severity of punishment"" model. I have to admit I was interested in this book as soon as I heard about it; I like thinking about the nature of honesty and how it's an absolutely fundamental element of civilization. I don't think his experiments support all of his conclusions and he makes assumptions about the model of why people cheat that he doesn't test, but overall the experiments are interesting and revealing.The focus of this book is to find factors that influence how much people cheat and figure out how much they influence our behavior. The factors that turn out to make a difference include whether we're reminded of our moral values beforehand, whether we have conflicts of interest, and whether other people around us are cheating. You might be surprised at how much, or how little, influence some things have over our decisions and how unaware we may be over some of the factors.The author has some wry humor that I appreciate, and I still like that he describes his experiments in enough detail that you can form your own idea of how well they do or don't support the conclusions he reaches. Each description, like the rest of his writing, is very readable."

I liked the writing style that the author used because it was very personal and humorous while still being educationa It is mostly about human immorality such as cheating and lying.Many of us never realize or think hard about how many small chances to cheat or temptations we face every day. The author tells us why we cheat, how likely we are to cheat, and how human we all are when it comes to being dishonest. That being said, it makes the reader realize how immoral he is and ways to become more moral. Even though it is an extremely hard decision when you want to be a good person and to benefit as much as possible (even if others don't benefit). You can't have both worlds, so you cheat a little or you justify your cheating some way or another. This book does include infidelity, but not as the main type of cheating. The type of cheating involved in this book is mostly white collar crimes like “fudging” numbers, or “petty” crimes like taking money, or cheating to gain more money than you would honestly get if you haven’t cheated in the first place. The author experimented on why individuals cheat, and expanded it to why groups cheat and then to “which country cheats the most”. In addition to looking for the ""why"". he also looked for how as a society we can decrease the amount of cheating we do. I recommend to some of my friends, family because it's very interesting"

I've got four of his titles on my List, but I haven't actually read anything by him yet. We'll see.***Ariely covers his research into cheating and lying, as well as the research of others in the field. As I noted in my update, House is right: everybody lies. The good news is that most people lie and cheat at a low level, just a little, not so much to destroy our vision of ourselves as good people. We're more likely to cheat when we know we can get away with it, and when people like us are cheating too. We're less likely to cheat when it would be taking advantage of a specific blind person, or when it would mean overt and obvious action.For people interested in improving the way their business or organization works (education and banking are mentioned, the Wall Street collapse is considered) there is some good advice about ways to decrease the incentives and remind people that we want to be good. Interesting stuff. I'm fascinated by the idea that we're none of us as good as we'd like to believe, but most of us aren't really that bad, either. Philosophically, I'm particularly drawn to the idea that secular resets can serve the same purpose as religious confession, allowing us to start over with a clean conscience. I wish there had been a larger section devoted to this idea. Ah, well, maybe the next book.Library copy"
63,0062183591,http://goodreads.com/user/show/40688856-paul-froehlich,5,"How much do we cheat, and what circumstances make us more or less likely to do so? This book is about the psychology of dishonesty. The author is Dan Ariely, a professor of psychology at Duke, who describes his research and that of his colleagues. His previous book, Predictably Irrational (2008) detailed consistent findings that most people cheat just a little when they aren’t held accountable and have plausible deniability. His thesis in The Honest Truth about Dishonesty is that our behavior is driven by conflicting motivations: our desire to see ourselves as honest, honorable people, and our desire to benefit from cheating. The way to get the benefits without ruining our self-image is by cheating a little bit, an amount we can rationalize with our “amazing cognitive flexibility.” To reduce cheating requires reducing our ability to rationalize our actions, while factors that increase our ability to justify our cheating increase dishonesty.Ariely’s experiments suggest what conditions influence how dishonest we are. In most of his experiments, participants were paid small amounts for solving simple matrix exercises. When they could cheat and get away with it, participants claimed to have solved 50 percent more matches than the control group who couldn’t cheat. This increase was not due to a few individuals who claimed high numbers, but from lots of people who cheated a little.As the amount of money rose, the amount of cheating remained the same as at lower amounts, and cheating declined slightly at the highest amount of $10 per correct answer. This result suggests that cheating isn’t simply a result of cost-benefit analysis; otherwise the amount of cheating would rise with the reward. Ariely explains that at $10 a question, it would be harder for the average person to cheat and still feel he or she has integrity.  Moral reminders lead to less cheating. Half the subjects on the matrix test were asked recall as many of the Ten Commandments as they could before doing the task, while the other half were asked to recall ten books they had read. In the latter group, cheating was at the usual level, widespread but moderate. The group that recalled the Ten Commandments committed no cheating at all. A group of atheists asked to swear on the Bible before the matrix task likewise did not cheat. Conflicts of interest exist in many areas of life, and influence behavior more than we realize. The research indicates that people with conflicts of interest are more likely to make decisions in their own self-interest at other people’s expense, while still considering themselves honorable. Sunshine and disclosure of conflicts do not work to benefit clients of conflicted professionals, and can make matters worse, resulting in worse advice. Our reasoning ability gets tired or depleted over a long day of resisting temptations and doing the right things; that’s why it’s at night that people fall off their diets. Ariely’s research found that the more depleting the task completed before doing the matrix test, the higher the cheating rate on the test. In one test, depleted subjects were paid almost 200 percent more due to cheating than non-depleted subjects who cheated much less. One incident of cheating can pave the way for more. An Ariely experiment found that subjects who had a financial incentive to cheat did so more frequently the longer the experiment lasted, which reinforces the notion that people who cheat a little may eventually give up resisting it and go all in.Creative individuals are more likely to cheat than less creative people, especially in more ambiguous situations. They were also better at justifying themselves; designers are more morally flexible than accountants. Creative minds help “us to develop original paths around rules” in a self-serving way. Unlike creativity, intelligence does not correlate with dishonesty.Revenge is a powerful justification for dishonesty. Participants in an experiment were far more likely to keep extra money paid them when the payer was a bit discourteous. Apparently it’s much easier to justify stealing the overpayment to someone who annoys us than from someone who doesn’t. Dishonesty can be contagious. Ariely found that participants cheated twice as much as usual after they had witnessed someone else cheating with impunity. When the open cheater was from a rival university than the other participants, however, their cheating dropped to solving 9 problems, instead of 15 when the open cheater was not wearing the rival’s shirt. When the cheater is seen as part of our social group, then we identify with him and feel that cheating is more acceptable, but when the cheater is an outsider, we become more ethical to distance ourselves from that immoral person and his out-group. These studies demonstrate “how crucial other people are in defining acceptable boundaries for our own behavior.”Collaboration leads to more cheating due to our altruistic tendencies. Participants cheated more on the matrix test under conditions where cheating was enabled and they worked with a teammate who shared in the reward than when they worked alone. When participants were watching each other, however, cheating was eliminated, even though they could otherwise cheat.I noticed one apparent conflict in his findings. On the one hand, he found that introducing some possibility of being detected did not reduce cheating. On the other hand, he found that when a partner was watching, subjects were less likely to cheat, even though the partners were not supervisors. It seems more research should be done on whether dishonesty is deterred by an increased perceived risk of detection.What works to help people behave more honestly? Ariely’s suggestions are based upon his findings. Moral reminders are useful in situations that tempt. To address the weakness that comes from depletion, it makes sense to periodically succumb to temptation - “rational self-indulgence” - so as not to deplete one’s will power. Avoid the slippery slope by policing ourselves in rationalizing one cheat, since one dishonest act may lead to a what-the-hell attitude. Reduce cheating that comes from group work by having independent rating of the group’s performance. On the individual level, once we understand what factors lead us astray, we can avoid them to better control our behavior. This easy-to-read book is most enlightening about human nature. Highly recommended. ###"

Often I heed those warnings or try to find the book in the library.However, I was so interested in the Wall Street Journal article which discussed this book from a few month ago, that I went ahead and took the leap. After all, I think I am an honest person. And I (think I) always strive to be more so - and especially to be a proper role model for my family.This book contains much more than the sound bites you may have heard about a study about some college students getting paid to tell how many answers they said they got right on some silly math test and determining that most people cheat, but only a little, only enough to convince themselves that they are still honorable people. The author discusses study after study which express variations on the theme of honesty in many situations. I appreciated how thorough he was.One complaint: his discussion on the societal effects of dishonesty was somewhat more superficial than it should have been.I think most of us want more than just to be known as honest, we want to fully believe ourselves to be honest. This book reminds us how we often delude ourselves and gives suggestions on how to help ourselves be that person we want to be.Highly recommended."

He makes some general hypotheses about human behavior, he briefly describes experiments conducted by him and his colleagues to test them, and then he adds a paragraph that (like clockwork) begins with, ""This result suggests... [some possible conclusion about human behavior in general]."" I always enjoy Professor Ariely's books because he does a good job of connecting the scientific takeaways to pop culture references, Shakespeare, poetry, current events and religious texts. I also admire Ariely's restraint in not overstating the implications of his research. As I said earlier, he carefully prefaces the takeaways by saying ""This result suggests"" as opposed to saying, ""This conclusively proves..."".I have argued with professors about the perils of allowing to students to grade their own work, even when they have previously signed a code of ethics. I usually cite Plato saying how men are not good judges of themselves. This easy-to-read volume really provides great evidence to strengthen my argument in such a conversation. We see the dangers of being dishonest ""just this once"", conflicts of interest, being tempted while tired or hungry, altruistic dishonesty, and watching others act dishonestly. We see some of the virtues of pledges, signatures, moral reminders and supervision."
66,0062183591,http://goodreads.com/user/show/15406725-mike-o-connell,5,"After reading Ariely's first book, Predictably Irrational, I was looking forward to this one. It does not disappoint.Airely is one of the nation’s top academics in the field of behavioral economics; he has taught and MIT and currently teaches at Duke. Sounds like what would make for boring reading, but in these books, designed for a wider audience, Airely brings humor, wit and fascinating overviews of experiments about dishonesty.Some captivating examples…-We are less likely to cheat if we sign a honor pledge or are read something with moral overtones like the ten commandments.-We will cheat more if we receive rude or poor service. As in the experiment where subjects were offered $5 to take a survey, but intentionally given $9. In the control condition just less than 50% of participants returned the extra cash. In the experimental condition, where the person administering the survey in a coffee shop rudely took a short social phone call with no apology in the middle of administering the survey, only 17% of people returned the extra money.These examples are less interesting out of context, but make for an interesting narrative in the course of the book. The audiobook, which I am listening to, is particularly well done."
67,0062183591,http://goodreads.com/user/show/548006-eric,5,"Another great book from Dan Ariely on how we do - or do not - act in accordance to logic and rationality. All of his books, which center on behavioral neurology and specifically the ""nonsensical"" or irrational angles of it, have been fast enjoyable reads for me and this was no exception. He describes a number of experiments and methods - namely the ""more dots on the right or left"" and ""how many matrixes did you fill out"" - without dragging you into the muck of scientific methodology, and the applies them to various conditions (the ""direct supervision"" condition, the ""can cheat/shredder"" condition, the ""altruistic cheating"" condition, etc) and then compares the results. While I'm sure that they didn't come out as actual whole numbers - another example of the scientific dilution - and the results are still interesting. NOT a great read if you are highly scientific and want to know hard numbers, but a fantastic armchair psychology / behavioral studies book. It dovetailed great with my recent reading of ""Willpower"" (Ariely investigates ""depletion"" as a factor in cheating) as well as the fact I'm taking Law and Ethics this semester :-) "
68,0062183591,http://goodreads.com/user/show/13052671-ved-gupta,4,"Dan Ariely, author of Predictably Irrational has returned with his original thinking and results of his experiments for educating people about the reasoning and rational that goes behind dishonesty (which is no different than cheating). Dan is completely against the SMORC (Simple Model of Rational Crime) and proves this model wrong initially with the help of an experiment and many other times in his book.The best thing about this book is that you will find yourself a part of this book many times and you will relate to it closely. If you think you have never cheated and you are an honest person, this book will surely show you a mirror. I really appreciated the various experimental set ups that were used by Dan to test various hypothesis and results were not only intuitive but also conclusive. Dan has made this book very interesting with a little bit of humor and research results and the way he relates with his readers. Policy makers should read such kind of research and take a clue that only harsher punishment cannot control crime and frauds in society and a completely new approach is the demand of time"
69,0062183591,http://goodreads.com/user/show/32360-john,4,"Didn't read it, listened to it on an audio book that included several interviews after the book ended. I found those interviews almost as good as the book itself. I'm not 100% convinced of the research in the book (because I'm not clear how many test samples and big the sample size for some of the assumptions in the book), but the test that were run seemed to be well-structured and some consideration of bias is considered. Trusting the findings, I did like hearing about how we fool ourselves into believing things, that the best deception is one we've pulled on ourselves. With several chapters focused on academics and the blindness of both professor and student, this is an important book for universities to read and understand the modern dynamics of cheating in the classroom. Ariely also orders papers from an academic paper mill to see if professors would be able to spot them and his experience shows that profs have nothing to fear from these mills but and should focus more attention on the overall atmosphere of the school."
70,0062183591,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5857480-eric-schreiber,4,"I've always enjoyed Dan Ariely's work - first as a regular contributor to NPR's Marketplace, and more recently as an author of multiple books. His relaxed and informal writing style combined with some really cool experiments makes for an easy and enlightening read. I particularly like how he points out that we can't necessarily fix ourselves (or others) outright but we can make things better by being aware of our issues. Through multiple versions of the ""matrix test"", Dan shows all the ways people can cheat and what can make that cheating more or less likely. My favorite was that an actor portraying a UPitt student blatantly cheating resulted in all the CMU students cheating much less. Each chapter covers a different twist on cheating, and each has its own interesting learnings, but there isn't a build-up to a climatic end or some final nugget of truth to make everything/everyone better. I can't say that I leave the book feeling rosy about our society's future with respect to honest, and I'm not sure I'll be trusting too many golfers in the future. "

And little did I know how this small act can lead to this whole topic of dishonesty!I enjoyed the book overall! It's easy to follow with interesting research and experiments on dishonesty. It also made me reflect my own behaviour. It made me imagine the possible things that are probably happening with high rank politicians and bankers.Ariely was hilarious in his writing, particularly the end part that made me chuckle a few times. The reason I gave it a 3 star is because I felt it was draggy somewhere in the middle. It took me a while to finish the book. It just felt like too many experiments altogether! I would enjoy more if there are some illustrations to help me visualise the experiments!Nonetheless, it is a great and important book for everyone to read. It is definitely not a book that condemns you or make you feel guilty, but it gives you a deeper insight and understanding of why we do what we do! It's so much more than just cost-benefit analysis!"
72,0062183591,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3187548-holly-cline,4,"I won this through first reads and really enjoyed it. Sure, it shows how all people will lie, cheat & steal when given the opportunity. But don't we sort of know this already even if we don't want to admit it? That's part of what's so fun about the research Dan Ariely does. As you read along, you realize, yes I believe all of this to be true. People are very dishonest. I totally see it! Is this depressing? I don't think so. As long as you're aware of what everyone is capable of, it's just a part of human nature. It's true that none of us knows exactly what we're capable of, for good OR bad, until we're placed in the situation. The real success of this book is how well Dan Ariely is able to speak with a voice that is perfectly suited to be read by non-academics. He is charming and relatable with words. He has a professor's humor, which is to say he'll never do stand up, but he can make you chuckle. I'd definitely read another book that he's written."

I was delightfully surprised that it wasn't farfetched or outlandish. I actually enjoyed this book more than any of his other books. There are plenty of tidbits here that a reader can try to use or experiment with. I liked the revelations towards the end, which made me more aware of how dishonesty can easily creep up on you. I didn't like the same experiment mentioned over and over again about the matrices (uggh!). I will try the technique of putting a pair of ""eyes"" on the tin can when charging coffee at the break room. It's hilarious that when given a chance a person would try to cheat if the situation makes it easy for them and if there is a small chance of getting caught. Worthy read. "
74,0062183591,http://goodreads.com/user/show/12702052-muhammad-arrabi,5,"Amazing book - very well documtned with most interesting psychological research. It's more concise and to the point than Dan's 2 earlier books.The book focuses on ""small-amount cheating"" type of behavior, what the author calls ""fudge-factor"". This is where people deviate from the accurate truth, but believe internally that they are honest. The book does not look at real criminals psychology - people who know they are stealing, and they do it anyways.As with most books written by University Professors, it's based mostly on ""lab-type"" experiments, measuring short-term reaction of people put in a short-term conditions. You cannot just take these results and apply them to business, because you don't know their long-term effect. This does not subtract from the importance of this book. This just means that we need a similar book but written by a business-history type of guy."

If you are into expanding your knowledge of human nature, this book is a must read. If you are wanting to improve yourself as a person, well, you get the idea.The one point I kept wanting to argue was with their assumption of moral depletion. The claim is that the more we resist temptation and/or do a good deed, the weaker our willpower becomes later in the day. For example, people who purchased organic food were more prone to cheat on a test (for financial gain). I'm sure there is a good amount of merit to their exhausted morality view, but, I might have offered up one further perspective. The person who purchased organic food may have thought, ""I'm a good boy, so now I deserve a reward."" I imagine there are times of moral depletion, but I'd wager there are also times of self justified compensation too."

Somewhere it was always there at the back of my mind that we justify our dishonesty to ourselves...i am talking about small lies here...but this book helped me think about it more deeply. Dan talks about some very interesting and powerful ideas to curb dishonesty through a better understanding of human psychology. This was the most interesting part.I wish he could add some pictures of his experiments because similar experiments were conducted for various concepts and after a while I wondered if most of the conclusions in the book were through the experiments, the reader could benefit a little with some more stats about the experiments, limitations of the experiment and a few pictures would have been great.Overall, it is a must read if you want to understand yourself better and if you want to run your business more honestly."
77,0062183591,http://goodreads.com/user/show/54467877-baris-balcioglu,3,"I was expecting more. There is one catch though. The author puts it nicely. He conducts social experiments and then presents his results in his seminars and the audience appears to be not surprised when they hear about the outcome. They look at him with the a look of ""We all knew that the result would be like this"". This is another proof of how we tend to cheat ourselves so easily. We hear something and in the blink of an eye we claim ownership. Maybe I also fell into the same trap in the beginning but later on I tried guessing the outcomes sometimes getting it right sometimes wrong. The problem is though the experiments conducted are still like our artificial engineering models. Life actually is more complex and these studies may fail to grasp it and are mostly fun to play with academically. The ending with religion was also a turn off."

I really liked reading about all those social experiments conducted and was fascinated by the number of academics involved it proving that aspects of the human nature itself such as creativity, conscience and social conformity are factors that attribute to dishonesty. It also offers insight into certain facts and events of recent history that spurred my interest and encouraged me to learn more.However, I have to admit that I was not fully committed to reading this novel. It felt like all those conclusions could not be based on solid results (they were social experiments after all). The variations of the experiments ware quite repetitive and after a while stopped holding my interest."

What he finds is that cheating is rampant and bounded; or to put it another way, we all cheat a little bit. Ariely then pushes the limits of that, to figure out under what conditions we are more or less likely to cheat, and further to see if there are particular individuals who are particularly prone to lying or cheating. The book is funny, easy to read, and extremely relevant to anyone interested in morality, law, finance, religion, administration, politics, or any other profession in which people find themselves tempted to bend the rules once in awhile."
80,0062183591,http://goodreads.com/user/show/13904904-rebekah,4,"Insightful. It's always helpful when the mind behind academic research see fit to write colloquially about their findings so that the general public can understand its meaning. Surprisingly, our tendency to be dishonest isn't increased by what we think it might be, and often isn't decreased by what we think it might be. I find studies on human nature very interesting, we're very complex creatures that operate beyond the instinct and cost vs benefit framework of the animal world at large. Maybe prepare yourself to be a little disheartened at how easy it is for humanity to engage in deception and still think of themselves as 'good people' but the first step to fixing a problem is acknowledging. And even if you don't give a damn, it's still pretty interesting. "

Sadly but also honestly this book does not deserve 5-stars. I would have enjoyed more analysis of the data that he presented. But I enjoyed it like a five star book. Somehow he's adorable. I don't know why and I don't think that's a normal reaction to this book lol. Finally I wonder what my fudge factor would be in the various matrices tests. And I wonder if I would overestimate my intelligence like so many of his subjects did when they had the answer key right below their work, lol. I'd really like to know! But now that I know the secret an all new test would need to be designed in order to find out. Sad!"

Even when our feeble explanations have little to do with reality. We’re storytelling creatures by nature, and we tell ourselves story after story until we come up with an explanation that we like and that sounds reasonable enough to believe. And when the story portrays us in a more glowing and positive light, so much the better.” Err, I did like reading it, but most of the experiments were kinda obvious and sometimes a bit boring.

One of our members is in the medical device business so she had some interesting insight into the process of selling to doctors which was a bit different than Ariely's report of big pharma sales to medical professionals.I enjoyed this but a lot of the material was already familiar to me because I took an online course from Ariely and have read a lot of his work.

I think about it a lot and I suspect it will be even more useful than the author's previous two books, but it doesn't build any real model of _how_ we lie, or _why_, other than destroying the ""factor in the likelihood of getting caught and the severity of punishment"" model. I have to admit I was interested in this book as soon as I heard about it; I like thinking about the nature of honesty and how it's an absolutely fundamental element of civilization. I don't think his experiments support all of his conclusions and he makes assumptions about the model of why people cheat that he doesn't test, but overall the experiments are interesting and revealing.The focus of this book is to find factors that influence how much people cheat and figure out how much they influence our behavior. The factors that turn out to make a difference include whether we're reminded of our moral values beforehand, whether we have conflicts of interest, and whether other people around us are cheating. You might be surprised at how much, or how little, influence some things have over our decisions and how unaware we may be over some of the factors.The author has some wry humor that I appreciate, and I still like that he describes his experiments in enough detail that you can form your own idea of how well they do or don't support the conclusions he reaches. Each description, like the rest of his writing, is very readable."

I liked the writing style that the author used because it was very personal and humorous while still being educationa It is mostly about human immorality such as cheating and lying.Many of us never realize or think hard about how many small chances to cheat or temptations we face every day. The author tells us why we cheat, how likely we are to cheat, and how human we all are when it comes to being dishonest. That being said, it makes the reader realize how immoral he is and ways to become more moral. Even though it is an extremely hard decision when you want to be a good person and to benefit as much as possible (even if others don't benefit). You can't have both worlds, so you cheat a little or you justify your cheating some way or another. This book does include infidelity, but not as the main type of cheating. The type of cheating involved in this book is mostly white collar crimes like “fudging” numbers, or “petty” crimes like taking money, or cheating to gain more money than you would honestly get if you haven’t cheated in the first place. The author experimented on why individuals cheat, and expanded it to why groups cheat and then to “which country cheats the most”. In addition to looking for the ""why"". he also looked for how as a society we can decrease the amount of cheating we do. I recommend to some of my friends, family because it's very interesting"

I've got four of his titles on my List, but I haven't actually read anything by him yet. We'll see.***Ariely covers his research into cheating and lying, as well as the research of others in the field. As I noted in my update, House is right: everybody lies. The good news is that most people lie and cheat at a low level, just a little, not so much to destroy our vision of ourselves as good people. We're more likely to cheat when we know we can get away with it, and when people like us are cheating too. We're less likely to cheat when it would be taking advantage of a specific blind person, or when it would mean overt and obvious action.For people interested in improving the way their business or organization works (education and banking are mentioned, the Wall Street collapse is considered) there is some good advice about ways to decrease the incentives and remind people that we want to be good. Interesting stuff. I'm fascinated by the idea that we're none of us as good as we'd like to believe, but most of us aren't really that bad, either. Philosophically, I'm particularly drawn to the idea that secular resets can serve the same purpose as religious confession, allowing us to start over with a clean conscience. I wish there had been a larger section devoted to this idea. Ah, well, maybe the next book.Library copy"
93,0062183591,http://goodreads.com/user/show/40688856-paul-froehlich,5,"How much do we cheat, and what circumstances make us more or less likely to do so? This book is about the psychology of dishonesty. The author is Dan Ariely, a professor of psychology at Duke, who describes his research and that of his colleagues. His previous book, Predictably Irrational (2008) detailed consistent findings that most people cheat just a little when they aren’t held accountable and have plausible deniability. His thesis in The Honest Truth about Dishonesty is that our behavior is driven by conflicting motivations: our desire to see ourselves as honest, honorable people, and our desire to benefit from cheating. The way to get the benefits without ruining our self-image is by cheating a little bit, an amount we can rationalize with our “amazing cognitive flexibility.” To reduce cheating requires reducing our ability to rationalize our actions, while factors that increase our ability to justify our cheating increase dishonesty.Ariely’s experiments suggest what conditions influence how dishonest we are. In most of his experiments, participants were paid small amounts for solving simple matrix exercises. When they could cheat and get away with it, participants claimed to have solved 50 percent more matches than the control group who couldn’t cheat. This increase was not due to a few individuals who claimed high numbers, but from lots of people who cheated a little.As the amount of money rose, the amount of cheating remained the same as at lower amounts, and cheating declined slightly at the highest amount of $10 per correct answer. This result suggests that cheating isn’t simply a result of cost-benefit analysis; otherwise the amount of cheating would rise with the reward. Ariely explains that at $10 a question, it would be harder for the average person to cheat and still feel he or she has integrity.  Moral reminders lead to less cheating. Half the subjects on the matrix test were asked recall as many of the Ten Commandments as they could before doing the task, while the other half were asked to recall ten books they had read. In the latter group, cheating was at the usual level, widespread but moderate. The group that recalled the Ten Commandments committed no cheating at all. A group of atheists asked to swear on the Bible before the matrix task likewise did not cheat. Conflicts of interest exist in many areas of life, and influence behavior more than we realize. The research indicates that people with conflicts of interest are more likely to make decisions in their own self-interest at other people’s expense, while still considering themselves honorable. Sunshine and disclosure of conflicts do not work to benefit clients of conflicted professionals, and can make matters worse, resulting in worse advice. Our reasoning ability gets tired or depleted over a long day of resisting temptations and doing the right things; that’s why it’s at night that people fall off their diets. Ariely’s research found that the more depleting the task completed before doing the matrix test, the higher the cheating rate on the test. In one test, depleted subjects were paid almost 200 percent more due to cheating than non-depleted subjects who cheated much less. One incident of cheating can pave the way for more. An Ariely experiment found that subjects who had a financial incentive to cheat did so more frequently the longer the experiment lasted, which reinforces the notion that people who cheat a little may eventually give up resisting it and go all in.Creative individuals are more likely to cheat than less creative people, especially in more ambiguous situations. They were also better at justifying themselves; designers are more morally flexible than accountants. Creative minds help “us to develop original paths around rules” in a self-serving way. Unlike creativity, intelligence does not correlate with dishonesty.Revenge is a powerful justification for dishonesty. Participants in an experiment were far more likely to keep extra money paid them when the payer was a bit discourteous. Apparently it’s much easier to justify stealing the overpayment to someone who annoys us than from someone who doesn’t. Dishonesty can be contagious. Ariely found that participants cheated twice as much as usual after they had witnessed someone else cheating with impunity. When the open cheater was from a rival university than the other participants, however, their cheating dropped to solving 9 problems, instead of 15 when the open cheater was not wearing the rival’s shirt. When the cheater is seen as part of our social group, then we identify with him and feel that cheating is more acceptable, but when the cheater is an outsider, we become more ethical to distance ourselves from that immoral person and his out-group. These studies demonstrate “how crucial other people are in defining acceptable boundaries for our own behavior.”Collaboration leads to more cheating due to our altruistic tendencies. Participants cheated more on the matrix test under conditions where cheating was enabled and they worked with a teammate who shared in the reward than when they worked alone. When participants were watching each other, however, cheating was eliminated, even though they could otherwise cheat.I noticed one apparent conflict in his findings. On the one hand, he found that introducing some possibility of being detected did not reduce cheating. On the other hand, he found that when a partner was watching, subjects were less likely to cheat, even though the partners were not supervisors. It seems more research should be done on whether dishonesty is deterred by an increased perceived risk of detection.What works to help people behave more honestly? Ariely’s suggestions are based upon his findings. Moral reminders are useful in situations that tempt. To address the weakness that comes from depletion, it makes sense to periodically succumb to temptation - “rational self-indulgence” - so as not to deplete one’s will power. Avoid the slippery slope by policing ourselves in rationalizing one cheat, since one dishonest act may lead to a what-the-hell attitude. Reduce cheating that comes from group work by having independent rating of the group’s performance. On the individual level, once we understand what factors lead us astray, we can avoid them to better control our behavior. This easy-to-read book is most enlightening about human nature. Highly recommended. ###"

Often I heed those warnings or try to find the book in the library.However, I was so interested in the Wall Street Journal article which discussed this book from a few month ago, that I went ahead and took the leap. After all, I think I am an honest person. And I (think I) always strive to be more so - and especially to be a proper role model for my family.This book contains much more than the sound bites you may have heard about a study about some college students getting paid to tell how many answers they said they got right on some silly math test and determining that most people cheat, but only a little, only enough to convince themselves that they are still honorable people. The author discusses study after study which express variations on the theme of honesty in many situations. I appreciated how thorough he was.One complaint: his discussion on the societal effects of dishonesty was somewhat more superficial than it should have been.I think most of us want more than just to be known as honest, we want to fully believe ourselves to be honest. This book reminds us how we often delude ourselves and gives suggestions on how to help ourselves be that person we want to be.Highly recommended."
95,0062183591,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5808354-joshua-guest,4,"Ariely's style doesn't vary much across his non-fiction books. He makes some general hypotheses about human behavior, he briefly describes experiments conducted by him and his colleagues to test them, and then he adds a paragraph that (like clockwork) begins with, ""This result suggests... [some possible conclusion about human behavior in general]."" I always enjoy Professor Ariely's books because he does a good job of connecting the scientific takeaways to pop culture references, Shakespeare, poetry, current events and religious texts. I also admire Ariely's restraint in not overstating the implications of his research. As I said earlier, he carefully prefaces the takeaways by saying ""This result suggests"" as opposed to saying, ""This conclusively proves..."".I have argued with professors about the perils of allowing to students to grade their own work, even when they have previously signed a code of ethics. I usually cite Plato saying how men are not good judges of themselves. This easy-to-read volume really provides great evidence to strengthen my argument in such a conversation. We see the dangers of being dishonest ""just this once"", conflicts of interest, being tempted while tired or hungry, altruistic dishonesty, and watching others act dishonestly. We see some of the virtues of pledges, signatures, moral reminders and supervision."
96,0062183591,http://goodreads.com/user/show/15406725-mike-o-connell,5,"After reading Ariely's first book, Predictably Irrational, I was looking forward to this one. It does not disappoint.Airely is one of the nation’s top academics in the field of behavioral economics; he has taught and MIT and currently teaches at Duke. Sounds like what would make for boring reading, but in these books, designed for a wider audience, Airely brings humor, wit and fascinating overviews of experiments about dishonesty.Some captivating examples…-We are less likely to cheat if we sign a honor pledge or are read something with moral overtones like the ten commandments.-We will cheat more if we receive rude or poor service. As in the experiment where subjects were offered $5 to take a survey, but intentionally given $9. In the control condition just less than 50% of participants returned the extra cash. In the experimental condition, where the person administering the survey in a coffee shop rudely took a short social phone call with no apology in the middle of administering the survey, only 17% of people returned the extra money.These examples are less interesting out of context, but make for an interesting narrative in the course of the book. The audiobook, which I am listening to, is particularly well done."
97,0062183591,http://goodreads.com/user/show/548006-eric,5,"Another great book from Dan Ariely on how we do - or do not - act in accordance to logic and rationality. All of his books, which center on behavioral neurology and specifically the ""nonsensical"" or irrational angles of it, have been fast enjoyable reads for me and this was no exception. He describes a number of experiments and methods - namely the ""more dots on the right or left"" and ""how many matrixes did you fill out"" - without dragging you into the muck of scientific methodology, and the applies them to various conditions (the ""direct supervision"" condition, the ""can cheat/shredder"" condition, the ""altruistic cheating"" condition, etc) and then compares the results. While I'm sure that they didn't come out as actual whole numbers - another example of the scientific dilution - and the results are still interesting. NOT a great read if you are highly scientific and want to know hard numbers, but a fantastic armchair psychology / behavioral studies book. It dovetailed great with my recent reading of ""Willpower"" (Ariely investigates ""depletion"" as a factor in cheating) as well as the fact I'm taking Law and Ethics this semester :-) "
98,0062183591,http://goodreads.com/user/show/13052671-ved-gupta,4,"Dan Ariely, author of Predictably Irrational has returned with his original thinking and results of his experiments for educating people about the reasoning and rational that goes behind dishonesty (which is no different than cheating). Dan is completely against the SMORC (Simple Model of Rational Crime) and proves this model wrong initially with the help of an experiment and many other times in his book.The best thing about this book is that you will find yourself a part of this book many times and you will relate to it closely. If you think you have never cheated and you are an honest person, this book will surely show you a mirror. I really appreciated the various experimental set ups that were used by Dan to test various hypothesis and results were not only intuitive but also conclusive. Dan has made this book very interesting with a little bit of humor and research results and the way he relates with his readers. Policy makers should read such kind of research and take a clue that only harsher punishment cannot control crime and frauds in society and a completely new approach is the demand of time"
99,0062183591,http://goodreads.com/user/show/32360-john,4,"Didn't read it, listened to it on an audio book that included several interviews after the book ended. I found those interviews almost as good as the book itself. I'm not 100% convinced of the research in the book (because I'm not clear how many test samples and big the sample size for some of the assumptions in the book), but the test that were run seemed to be well-structured and some consideration of bias is considered. Trusting the findings, I did like hearing about how we fool ourselves into believing things, that the best deception is one we've pulled on ourselves. With several chapters focused on academics and the blindness of both professor and student, this is an important book for universities to read and understand the modern dynamics of cheating in the classroom. Ariely also orders papers from an academic paper mill to see if professors would be able to spot them and his experience shows that profs have nothing to fear from these mills but and should focus more attention on the overall atmosphere of the school."

His relaxed and informal writing style combined with some really cool experiments makes for an easy and enlightening read. I particularly like how he points out that we can't necessarily fix ourselves (or others) outright but we can make things better by being aware of our issues. Through multiple versions of the ""matrix test"", Dan shows all the ways people can cheat and what can make that cheating more or less likely. My favorite was that an actor portraying a UPitt student blatantly cheating resulted in all the CMU students cheating much less. Each chapter covers a different twist on cheating, and each has its own interesting learnings, but there isn't a build-up to a climatic end or some final nugget of truth to make everything/everyone better. I can't say that I leave the book feeling rosy about our society's future with respect to honest, and I'm not sure I'll be trusting too many golfers in the future. "

And little did I know how this small act can lead to this whole topic of dishonesty!I enjoyed the book overall! It's easy to follow with interesting research and experiments on dishonesty. It also made me reflect my own behaviour. It made me imagine the possible things that are probably happening with high rank politicians and bankers.Ariely was hilarious in his writing, particularly the end part that made me chuckle a few times. The reason I gave it a 3 star is because I felt it was draggy somewhere in the middle. It took me a while to finish the book. It just felt like too many experiments altogether! I would enjoy more if there are some illustrations to help me visualise the experiments!Nonetheless, it is a great and important book for everyone to read. It is definitely not a book that condemns you or make you feel guilty, but it gives you a deeper insight and understanding of why we do what we do! It's so much more than just cost-benefit analysis!"
102,0062183591,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3187548-holly-cline,4,"I won this through first reads and really enjoyed it. Sure, it shows how all people will lie, cheat & steal when given the opportunity. But don't we sort of know this already even if we don't want to admit it? That's part of what's so fun about the research Dan Ariely does. As you read along, you realize, yes I believe all of this to be true. People are very dishonest. I totally see it! Is this depressing? I don't think so. As long as you're aware of what everyone is capable of, it's just a part of human nature. It's true that none of us knows exactly what we're capable of, for good OR bad, until we're placed in the situation. The real success of this book is how well Dan Ariely is able to speak with a voice that is perfectly suited to be read by non-academics. He is charming and relatable with words. He has a professor's humor, which is to say he'll never do stand up, but he can make you chuckle. I'd definitely read another book that he's written."

I was delightfully surprised that it wasn't farfetched or outlandish. I actually enjoyed this book more than any of his other books. There are plenty of tidbits here that a reader can try to use or experiment with. I liked the revelations towards the end, which made me more aware of how dishonesty can easily creep up on you. I didn't like the same experiment mentioned over and over again about the matrices (uggh!). I will try the technique of putting a pair of ""eyes"" on the tin can when charging coffee at the break room. It's hilarious that when given a chance a person would try to cheat if the situation makes it easy for them and if there is a small chance of getting caught. Worthy read. "
104,0062183591,http://goodreads.com/user/show/12702052-muhammad-arrabi,5,"Amazing book - very well documtned with most interesting psychological research. It's more concise and to the point than Dan's 2 earlier books.The book focuses on ""small-amount cheating"" type of behavior, what the author calls ""fudge-factor"". This is where people deviate from the accurate truth, but believe internally that they are honest. The book does not look at real criminals psychology - people who know they are stealing, and they do it anyways.As with most books written by University Professors, it's based mostly on ""lab-type"" experiments, measuring short-term reaction of people put in a short-term conditions. You cannot just take these results and apply them to business, because you don't know their long-term effect. This does not subtract from the importance of this book. This just means that we need a similar book but written by a business-history type of guy."

If you are into expanding your knowledge of human nature, this book is a must read. If you are wanting to improve yourself as a person, well, you get the idea.The one point I kept wanting to argue was with their assumption of moral depletion. The claim is that the more we resist temptation and/or do a good deed, the weaker our willpower becomes later in the day. For example, people who purchased organic food were more prone to cheat on a test (for financial gain). I'm sure there is a good amount of merit to their exhausted morality view, but, I might have offered up one further perspective. The person who purchased organic food may have thought, ""I'm a good boy, so now I deserve a reward."" I imagine there are times of moral depletion, but I'd wager there are also times of self justified compensation too."

Somewhere it was always there at the back of my mind that we justify our dishonesty to ourselves...i am talking about small lies here...but this book helped me think about it more deeply. Dan talks about some very interesting and powerful ideas to curb dishonesty through a better understanding of human psychology. This was the most interesting part.I wish he could add some pictures of his experiments because similar experiments were conducted for various concepts and after a while I wondered if most of the conclusions in the book were through the experiments, the reader could benefit a little with some more stats about the experiments, limitations of the experiment and a few pictures would have been great.Overall, it is a must read if you want to understand yourself better and if you want to run your business more honestly."

He conducts social experiments and then presents his results in his seminars and the audience appears to be not surprised when they hear about the outcome. They look at him with the a look of ""We all knew that the result would be like this"". This is another proof of how we tend to cheat ourselves so easily. We hear something and in the blink of an eye we claim ownership. Maybe I also fell into the same trap in the beginning but later on I tried guessing the outcomes sometimes getting it right sometimes wrong. The problem is though the experiments conducted are still like our artificial engineering models. Life actually is more complex and these studies may fail to grasp it and are mostly fun to play with academically. The ending with religion was also a turn off."

I really liked reading about all those social experiments conducted and was fascinated by the number of academics involved it proving that aspects of the human nature itself such as creativity, conscience and social conformity are factors that attribute to dishonesty. It also offers insight into certain facts and events of recent history that spurred my interest and encouraged me to learn more.However, I have to admit that I was not fully committed to reading this novel. It felt like all those conclusions could not be based on solid results (they were social experiments after all). The variations of the experiments ware quite repetitive and after a while stopped holding my interest."

What he finds is that cheating is rampant and bounded; or to put it another way, we all cheat a little bit. Ariely then pushes the limits of that, to figure out under what conditions we are more or less likely to cheat, and further to see if there are particular individuals who are particularly prone to lying or cheating. The book is funny, easy to read, and extremely relevant to anyone interested in morality, law, finance, religion, administration, politics, or any other profession in which people find themselves tempted to bend the rules once in awhile."
110,0062183591,http://goodreads.com/user/show/13904904-rebekah,4,"Insightful. It's always helpful when the mind behind academic research see fit to write colloquially about their findings so that the general public can understand its meaning. Surprisingly, our tendency to be dishonest isn't increased by what we think it might be, and often isn't decreased by what we think it might be. I find studies on human nature very interesting, we're very complex creatures that operate beyond the instinct and cost vs benefit framework of the animal world at large. Maybe prepare yourself to be a little disheartened at how easy it is for humanity to engage in deception and still think of themselves as 'good people' but the first step to fixing a problem is acknowledging. And even if you don't give a damn, it's still pretty interesting. "

Sadly but also honestly this book does not deserve 5-stars. I would have enjoyed more analysis of the data that he presented. But I enjoyed it like a five star book. Somehow he's adorable. I don't know why and I don't think that's a normal reaction to this book lol. Finally I wonder what my fudge factor would be in the various matrices tests. And I wonder if I would overestimate my intelligence like so many of his subjects did when they had the answer key right below their work, lol. I'd really like to know!

And when the story portrays us in a more glowing and positive light, so much the better.” Err, I did like reading it, but most of the experiments were kinda obvious and sometimes a bit boring.

I think about it a lot and I suspect it will be even more useful than the author's previous two books, but it doesn't build any real model of _how_ we lie, or _why_, other than destroying the ""factor in the likelihood of getting caught and the severity of punishment"" model. I have to admit I was interested in this book as soon as I heard about it; I like thinking about the nature of honesty and how it's an absolutely fundamental element of civilization. I don't think his experiments support all of his conclusions and he makes assumptions about the model of why people cheat that he doesn't test, but overall the experiments are interesting and revealing.The focus of this book is to find factors that influence how much people cheat and figure out how much they influence our behavior. The factors that turn out to make a difference include whether we're reminded of our moral values beforehand, whether we have conflicts of interest, and whether other people around us are cheating. You might be surprised at how much, or how little, influence some things have over our decisions and how unaware we may be over some of the factors.The author has some wry humor that I appreciate, and I still like that he describes his experiments in enough detail that you can form your own idea of how well they do or don't support the conclusions he reaches.

I liked the writing style that the author used because it was very personal and humorous while still being educationa It is mostly about human immorality such as cheating and lying.Many of us never realize or think hard about how many small chances to cheat or temptations we face every day. The author tells us why we cheat, how likely we are to cheat, and how human we all are when it comes to being dishonest. That being said, it makes the reader realize how immoral he is and ways to become more moral. Even though it is an extremely hard decision when you want to be a good person and to benefit as much as possible (even if others don't benefit). You can't have both worlds, so you cheat a little or you justify your cheating some way or another. This book does include infidelity, but not as the main type of cheating. The type of cheating involved in this book is mostly white collar crimes like “fudging” numbers, or “petty” crimes like taking money, or cheating to gain more money than you would honestly get if you haven’t cheated in the first place. The author experimented on why individuals cheat, and expanded it to why groups cheat and then to “which country cheats the most”. In addition to looking for the ""why"". he also looked for how as a society we can decrease the amount of cheating we do. I recommend to some of my friends, family because it's very interesting"

I've got four of his titles on my List, but I haven't actually read anything by him yet. We'll see.***Ariely covers his research into cheating and lying, as well as the research of others in the field. As I noted in my update, House is right: everybody lies. The good news is that most people lie and cheat at a low level, just a little, not so much to destroy our vision of ourselves as good people. We're more likely to cheat when we know we can get away with it, and when people like us are cheating too. We're less likely to cheat when it would be taking advantage of a specific blind person, or when it would mean overt and obvious action.For people interested in improving the way their business or organization works (education and banking are mentioned, the Wall Street collapse is considered) there is some good advice about ways to decrease the incentives and remind people that we want to be good. Interesting stuff. I'm fascinated by the idea that we're none of us as good as we'd like to believe, but most of us aren't really that bad, either. Philosophically, I'm particularly drawn to the idea that secular resets can serve the same purpose as religious confession, allowing us to start over with a clean conscience. I wish there had been a larger section devoted to this idea. Ah, well, maybe the next book.Library copy"
123,0062183591,http://goodreads.com/user/show/40688856-paul-froehlich,5,"How much do we cheat, and what circumstances make us more or less likely to do so? This book is about the psychology of dishonesty. The author is Dan Ariely, a professor of psychology at Duke, who describes his research and that of his colleagues. His previous book, Predictably Irrational (2008) detailed consistent findings that most people cheat just a little when they aren’t held accountable and have plausible deniability. His thesis in The Honest Truth about Dishonesty is that our behavior is driven by conflicting motivations: our desire to see ourselves as honest, honorable people, and our desire to benefit from cheating. The way to get the benefits without ruining our self-image is by cheating a little bit, an amount we can rationalize with our “amazing cognitive flexibility.” To reduce cheating requires reducing our ability to rationalize our actions, while factors that increase our ability to justify our cheating increase dishonesty.Ariely’s experiments suggest what conditions influence how dishonest we are. In most of his experiments, participants were paid small amounts for solving simple matrix exercises. When they could cheat and get away with it, participants claimed to have solved 50 percent more matches than the control group who couldn’t cheat. This increase was not due to a few individuals who claimed high numbers, but from lots of people who cheated a little.As the amount of money rose, the amount of cheating remained the same as at lower amounts, and cheating declined slightly at the highest amount of $10 per correct answer. This result suggests that cheating isn’t simply a result of cost-benefit analysis; otherwise the amount of cheating would rise with the reward. Ariely explains that at $10 a question, it would be harder for the average person to cheat and still feel he or she has integrity.  Moral reminders lead to less cheating. Half the subjects on the matrix test were asked recall as many of the Ten Commandments as they could before doing the task, while the other half were asked to recall ten books they had read. In the latter group, cheating was at the usual level, widespread but moderate. The group that recalled the Ten Commandments committed no cheating at all. A group of atheists asked to swear on the Bible before the matrix task likewise did not cheat. Conflicts of interest exist in many areas of life, and influence behavior more than we realize. The research indicates that people with conflicts of interest are more likely to make decisions in their own self-interest at other people’s expense, while still considering themselves honorable. Sunshine and disclosure of conflicts do not work to benefit clients of conflicted professionals, and can make matters worse, resulting in worse advice. Our reasoning ability gets tired or depleted over a long day of resisting temptations and doing the right things; that’s why it’s at night that people fall off their diets. Ariely’s research found that the more depleting the task completed before doing the matrix test, the higher the cheating rate on the test. In one test, depleted subjects were paid almost 200 percent more due to cheating than non-depleted subjects who cheated much less. One incident of cheating can pave the way for more. An Ariely experiment found that subjects who had a financial incentive to cheat did so more frequently the longer the experiment lasted, which reinforces the notion that people who cheat a little may eventually give up resisting it and go all in.Creative individuals are more likely to cheat than less creative people, especially in more ambiguous situations. They were also better at justifying themselves; designers are more morally flexible than accountants. Creative minds help “us to develop original paths around rules” in a self-serving way. Unlike creativity, intelligence does not correlate with dishonesty.Revenge is a powerful justification for dishonesty. Participants in an experiment were far more likely to keep extra money paid them when the payer was a bit discourteous. Apparently it’s much easier to justify stealing the overpayment to someone who annoys us than from someone who doesn’t. Dishonesty can be contagious. Ariely found that participants cheated twice as much as usual after they had witnessed someone else cheating with impunity. When the open cheater was from a rival university than the other participants, however, their cheating dropped to solving 9 problems, instead of 15 when the open cheater was not wearing the rival’s shirt. When the cheater is seen as part of our social group, then we identify with him and feel that cheating is more acceptable, but when the cheater is an outsider, we become more ethical to distance ourselves from that immoral person and his out-group. These studies demonstrate “how crucial other people are in defining acceptable boundaries for our own behavior.”Collaboration leads to more cheating due to our altruistic tendencies. Participants cheated more on the matrix test under conditions where cheating was enabled and they worked with a teammate who shared in the reward than when they worked alone. When participants were watching each other, however, cheating was eliminated, even though they could otherwise cheat.I noticed one apparent conflict in his findings. On the one hand, he found that introducing some possibility of being detected did not reduce cheating. On the other hand, he found that when a partner was watching, subjects were less likely to cheat, even though the partners were not supervisors. It seems more research should be done on whether dishonesty is deterred by an increased perceived risk of detection.What works to help people behave more honestly? Ariely’s suggestions are based upon his findings. Moral reminders are useful in situations that tempt. To address the weakness that comes from depletion, it makes sense to periodically succumb to temptation - “rational self-indulgence” - so as not to deplete one’s will power. Avoid the slippery slope by policing ourselves in rationalizing one cheat, since one dishonest act may lead to a what-the-hell attitude. Reduce cheating that comes from group work by having independent rating of the group’s performance. On the individual level, once we understand what factors lead us astray, we can avoid them to better control our behavior. This easy-to-read book is most enlightening about human nature. Highly recommended. ###"

Often I heed those warnings or try to find the book in the library.However, I was so interested in the Wall Street Journal article which discussed this book from a few month ago, that I went ahead and took the leap. After all, I think I am an honest person. And I (think I) always strive to be more so - and especially to be a proper role model for my family.This book contains much more than the sound bites you may have heard about a study about some college students getting paid to tell how many answers they said they got right on some silly math test and determining that most people cheat, but only a little, only enough to convince themselves that they are still honorable people. The author discusses study after study which express variations on the theme of honesty in many situations. I appreciated how thorough he was.One complaint: his discussion on the societal effects of dishonesty was somewhat more superficial than it should have been.I think most of us want more than just to be known as honest, we want to fully believe ourselves to be honest. This book reminds us how we often delude ourselves and gives suggestions on how to help ourselves be that person we want to be.Highly recommended."
125,0062183591,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5808354-joshua-guest,4,"Ariely's style doesn't vary much across his non-fiction books. He makes some general hypotheses about human behavior, he briefly describes experiments conducted by him and his colleagues to test them, and then he adds a paragraph that (like clockwork) begins with, ""This result suggests... [some possible conclusion about human behavior in general]."" I always enjoy Professor Ariely's books because he does a good job of connecting the scientific takeaways to pop culture references, Shakespeare, poetry, current events and religious texts. I also admire Ariely's restraint in not overstating the implications of his research. As I said earlier, he carefully prefaces the takeaways by saying ""This result suggests"" as opposed to saying, ""This conclusively proves..."".I have argued with professors about the perils of allowing to students to grade their own work, even when they have previously signed a code of ethics. I usually cite Plato saying how men are not good judges of themselves. This easy-to-read volume really provides great evidence to strengthen my argument in such a conversation. We see the dangers of being dishonest ""just this once"", conflicts of interest, being tempted while tired or hungry, altruistic dishonesty, and watching others act dishonestly. We see some of the virtues of pledges, signatures, moral reminders and supervision."
126,0062183591,http://goodreads.com/user/show/15406725-mike-o-connell,5,"After reading Ariely's first book, Predictably Irrational, I was looking forward to this one. It does not disappoint.Airely is one of the nation’s top academics in the field of behavioral economics; he has taught and MIT and currently teaches at Duke. Sounds like what would make for boring reading, but in these books, designed for a wider audience, Airely brings humor, wit and fascinating overviews of experiments about dishonesty.Some captivating examples…-We are less likely to cheat if we sign a honor pledge or are read something with moral overtones like the ten commandments.-We will cheat more if we receive rude or poor service. As in the experiment where subjects were offered $5 to take a survey, but intentionally given $9. In the control condition just less than 50% of participants returned the extra cash. In the experimental condition, where the person administering the survey in a coffee shop rudely took a short social phone call with no apology in the middle of administering the survey, only 17% of people returned the extra money.These examples are less interesting out of context, but make for an interesting narrative in the course of the book. The audiobook, which I am listening to, is particularly well done."
127,0062183591,http://goodreads.com/user/show/548006-eric,5,"Another great book from Dan Ariely on how we do - or do not - act in accordance to logic and rationality. All of his books, which center on behavioral neurology and specifically the ""nonsensical"" or irrational angles of it, have been fast enjoyable reads for me and this was no exception. He describes a number of experiments and methods - namely the ""more dots on the right or left"" and ""how many matrixes did you fill out"" - without dragging you into the muck of scientific methodology, and the applies them to various conditions (the ""direct supervision"" condition, the ""can cheat/shredder"" condition, the ""altruistic cheating"" condition, etc) and then compares the results. While I'm sure that they didn't come out as actual whole numbers - another example of the scientific dilution - and the results are still interesting. NOT a great read if you are highly scientific and want to know hard numbers, but a fantastic armchair psychology / behavioral studies book. It dovetailed great with my recent reading of ""Willpower"" (Ariely investigates ""depletion"" as a factor in cheating) as well as the fact I'm taking Law and Ethics this semester :-) "
128,0062183591,http://goodreads.com/user/show/13052671-ved-gupta,4,"Dan Ariely, author of Predictably Irrational has returned with his original thinking and results of his experiments for educating people about the reasoning and rational that goes behind dishonesty (which is no different than cheating). Dan is completely against the SMORC (Simple Model of Rational Crime) and proves this model wrong initially with the help of an experiment and many other times in his book.The best thing about this book is that you will find yourself a part of this book many times and you will relate to it closely. If you think you have never cheated and you are an honest person, this book will surely show you a mirror. I really appreciated the various experimental set ups that were used by Dan to test various hypothesis and results were not only intuitive but also conclusive. Dan has made this book very interesting with a little bit of humor and research results and the way he relates with his readers. Policy makers should read such kind of research and take a clue that only harsher punishment cannot control crime and frauds in society and a completely new approach is the demand of time"
129,0062183591,http://goodreads.com/user/show/32360-john,4,"Didn't read it, listened to it on an audio book that included several interviews after the book ended. I found those interviews almost as good as the book itself. I'm not 100% convinced of the research in the book (because I'm not clear how many test samples and big the sample size for some of the assumptions in the book), but the test that were run seemed to be well-structured and some consideration of bias is considered. Trusting the findings, I did like hearing about how we fool ourselves into believing things, that the best deception is one we've pulled on ourselves. With several chapters focused on academics and the blindness of both professor and student, this is an important book for universities to read and understand the modern dynamics of cheating in the classroom. Ariely also orders papers from an academic paper mill to see if professors would be able to spot them and his experience shows that profs have nothing to fear from these mills but and should focus more attention on the overall atmosphere of the school."
130,0062183591,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5857480-eric-schreiber,4,"I've always enjoyed Dan Ariely's work - first as a regular contributor to NPR's Marketplace, and more recently as an author of multiple books. His relaxed and informal writing style combined with some really cool experiments makes for an easy and enlightening read. I particularly like how he points out that we can't necessarily fix ourselves (or others) outright but we can make things better by being aware of our issues. Through multiple versions of the ""matrix test"", Dan shows all the ways people can cheat and what can make that cheating more or less likely. My favorite was that an actor portraying a UPitt student blatantly cheating resulted in all the CMU students cheating much less. Each chapter covers a different twist on cheating, and each has its own interesting learnings, but there isn't a build-up to a climatic end or some final nugget of truth to make everything/everyone better. I can't say that I leave the book feeling rosy about our society's future with respect to honest, and I'm not sure I'll be trusting too many golfers in the future. "

And little did I know how this small act can lead to this whole topic of dishonesty!I enjoyed the book overall! It's easy to follow with interesting research and experiments on dishonesty. It also made me reflect my own behaviour. It made me imagine the possible things that are probably happening with high rank politicians and bankers.Ariely was hilarious in his writing, particularly the end part that made me chuckle a few times. The reason I gave it a 3 star is because I felt it was draggy somewhere in the middle. It took me a while to finish the book. It just felt like too many experiments altogether! I would enjoy more if there are some illustrations to help me visualise the experiments!Nonetheless, it is a great and important book for everyone to read. It is definitely not a book that condemns you or make you feel guilty, but it gives you a deeper insight and understanding of why we do what we do! It's so much more than just cost-benefit analysis!"
132,0062183591,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3187548-holly-cline,4,"I won this through first reads and really enjoyed it. Sure, it shows how all people will lie, cheat & steal when given the opportunity. But don't we sort of know this already even if we don't want to admit it? That's part of what's so fun about the research Dan Ariely does. As you read along, you realize, yes I believe all of this to be true. People are very dishonest. I totally see it! Is this depressing? I don't think so. As long as you're aware of what everyone is capable of, it's just a part of human nature. It's true that none of us knows exactly what we're capable of, for good OR bad, until we're placed in the situation. The real success of this book is how well Dan Ariely is able to speak with a voice that is perfectly suited to be read by non-academics. He is charming and relatable with words. He has a professor's humor, which is to say he'll never do stand up, but he can make you chuckle. I'd definitely read another book that he's written."

I was delightfully surprised that it wasn't farfetched or outlandish. I actually enjoyed this book more than any of his other books. There are plenty of tidbits here that a reader can try to use or experiment with. I liked the revelations towards the end, which made me more aware of how dishonesty can easily creep up on you. I didn't like the same experiment mentioned over and over again about the matrices (uggh!). I will try the technique of putting a pair of ""eyes"" on the tin can when charging coffee at the break room. It's hilarious that when given a chance a person would try to cheat if the situation makes it easy for them and if there is a small chance of getting caught. Worthy read. "
134,0062183591,http://goodreads.com/user/show/12702052-muhammad-arrabi,5,"Amazing book - very well documtned with most interesting psychological research. It's more concise and to the point than Dan's 2 earlier books.The book focuses on ""small-amount cheating"" type of behavior, what the author calls ""fudge-factor"". This is where people deviate from the accurate truth, but believe internally that they are honest. The book does not look at real criminals psychology - people who know they are stealing, and they do it anyways.As with most books written by University Professors, it's based mostly on ""lab-type"" experiments, measuring short-term reaction of people put in a short-term conditions. You cannot just take these results and apply them to business, because you don't know their long-term effect. This does not subtract from the importance of this book. This just means that we need a similar book but written by a business-history type of guy."

If you are into expanding your knowledge of human nature, this book is a must read. If you are wanting to improve yourself as a person, well, you get the idea.The one point I kept wanting to argue was with their assumption of moral depletion. The claim is that the more we resist temptation and/or do a good deed, the weaker our willpower becomes later in the day. For example, people who purchased organic food were more prone to cheat on a test (for financial gain). I'm sure there is a good amount of merit to their exhausted morality view, but, I might have offered up one further perspective. The person who purchased organic food may have thought, ""I'm a good boy, so now I deserve a reward."" I imagine there are times of moral depletion, but I'd wager there are also times of self justified compensation too."

Somewhere it was always there at the back of my mind that we justify our dishonesty to ourselves...i am talking about small lies here...but this book helped me think about it more deeply. Dan talks about some very interesting and powerful ideas to curb dishonesty through a better understanding of human psychology. This was the most interesting part.I wish he could add some pictures of his experiments because similar experiments were conducted for various concepts and after a while I wondered if most of the conclusions in the book were through the experiments, the reader could benefit a little with some more stats about the experiments, limitations of the experiment and a few pictures would have been great.Overall, it is a must read if you want to understand yourself better and if you want to run your business more honestly."
137,0062183591,http://goodreads.com/user/show/54467877-baris-balcioglu,3,"I was expecting more. There is one catch though. The author puts it nicely. He conducts social experiments and then presents his results in his seminars and the audience appears to be not surprised when they hear about the outcome. They look at him with the a look of ""We all knew that the result would be like this"". This is another proof of how we tend to cheat ourselves so easily. We hear something and in the blink of an eye we claim ownership. Maybe I also fell into the same trap in the beginning but later on I tried guessing the outcomes sometimes getting it right sometimes wrong. The problem is though the experiments conducted are still like our artificial engineering models. Life actually is more complex and these studies may fail to grasp it and are mostly fun to play with academically. The ending with religion was also a turn off."

I really liked reading about all those social experiments conducted and was fascinated by the number of academics involved it proving that aspects of the human nature itself such as creativity, conscience and social conformity are factors that attribute to dishonesty. It also offers insight into certain facts and events of recent history that spurred my interest and encouraged me to learn more.However, I have to admit that I was not fully committed to reading this novel. It felt like all those conclusions could not be based on solid results (they were social experiments after all). The variations of the experiments ware quite repetitive and after a while stopped holding my interest."

What he finds is that cheating is rampant and bounded; or to put it another way, we all cheat a little bit. Ariely then pushes the limits of that, to figure out under what conditions we are more or less likely to cheat, and further to see if there are particular individuals who are particularly prone to lying or cheating. The book is funny, easy to read, and extremely relevant to anyone interested in morality, law, finance, religion, administration, politics, or any other profession in which people find themselves tempted to bend the rules once in awhile."
140,0062183591,http://goodreads.com/user/show/13904904-rebekah,4,"Insightful. It's always helpful when the mind behind academic research see fit to write colloquially about their findings so that the general public can understand its meaning. Surprisingly, our tendency to be dishonest isn't increased by what we think it might be, and often isn't decreased by what we think it might be. I find studies on human nature very interesting, we're very complex creatures that operate beyond the instinct and cost vs benefit framework of the animal world at large. Maybe prepare yourself to be a little disheartened at how easy it is for humanity to engage in deception and still think of themselves as 'good people' but the first step to fixing a problem is acknowledging. And even if you don't give a damn, it's still pretty interesting. "

Sadly but also honestly this book does not deserve 5-stars. I would have enjoyed more analysis of the data that he presented. But I enjoyed it like a five star book. Somehow he's adorable. I don't know why and I don't think that's a normal reaction to this book lol. Finally I wonder what my fudge factor would be in the various matrices tests. And I wonder if I would overestimate my intelligence like so many of his subjects did when they had the answer key right below their work, lol. I'd really like to know!

And when the story portrays us in a more glowing and positive light, so much the better.” Err, I did like reading it, but most of the experiments were kinda obvious and sometimes a bit boring.

I think about it a lot and I suspect it will be even more useful than the author's previous two books, but it doesn't build any real model of _how_ we lie, or _why_, other than destroying the ""factor in the likelihood of getting caught and the severity of punishment"" model. I have to admit I was interested in this book as soon as I heard about it; I like thinking about the nature of honesty and how it's an absolutely fundamental element of civilization. I don't think his experiments support all of his conclusions and he makes assumptions about the model of why people cheat that he doesn't test, but overall the experiments are interesting and revealing.The focus of this book is to find factors that influence how much people cheat and figure out how much they influence our behavior. The factors that turn out to make a difference include whether we're reminded of our moral values beforehand, whether we have conflicts of interest, and whether other people around us are cheating. You might be surprised at how much, or how little, influence some things have over our decisions and how unaware we may be over some of the factors.The author has some wry humor that I appreciate, and I still like that he describes his experiments in enough detail that you can form your own idea of how well they do or don't support the conclusions he reaches. Each description, like the rest of his writing, is very readable."

I liked the writing style that the author used because it was very personal and humorous while still being educationa It is mostly about human immorality such as cheating and lying.Many of us never realize or think hard about how many small chances to cheat or temptations we face every day. The author tells us why we cheat, how likely we are to cheat, and how human we all are when it comes to being dishonest. That being said, it makes the reader realize how immoral he is and ways to become more moral. Even though it is an extremely hard decision when you want to be a good person and to benefit as much as possible (even if others don't benefit). You can't have both worlds, so you cheat a little or you justify your cheating some way or another. This book does include infidelity, but not as the main type of cheating. The type of cheating involved in this book is mostly white collar crimes like “fudging” numbers, or “petty” crimes like taking money, or cheating to gain more money than you would honestly get if you haven’t cheated in the first place. The author experimented on why individuals cheat, and expanded it to why groups cheat and then to “which country cheats the most”. In addition to looking for the ""why"". he also looked for how as a society we can decrease the amount of cheating we do. I recommend to some of my friends, family because it's very interesting"

I've got four of his titles on my List, but I haven't actually read anything by him yet. We'll see.***Ariely covers his research into cheating and lying, as well as the research of others in the field. As I noted in my update, House is right: everybody lies. The good news is that most people lie and cheat at a low level, just a little, not so much to destroy our vision of ourselves as good people. We're more likely to cheat when we know we can get away with it, and when people like us are cheating too. We're less likely to cheat when it would be taking advantage of a specific blind person, or when it would mean overt and obvious action.For people interested in improving the way their business or organization works (education and banking are mentioned, the Wall Street collapse is considered) there is some good advice about ways to decrease the incentives and remind people that we want to be good. Interesting stuff. I'm fascinated by the idea that we're none of us as good as we'd like to believe, but most of us aren't really that bad, either. Philosophically, I'm particularly drawn to the idea that secular resets can serve the same purpose as religious confession, allowing us to start over with a clean conscience. I wish there had been a larger section devoted to this idea. Ah, well, maybe the next book.Library copy"
153,0062183591,http://goodreads.com/user/show/40688856-paul-froehlich,5,"How much do we cheat, and what circumstances make us more or less likely to do so? This book is about the psychology of dishonesty. The author is Dan Ariely, a professor of psychology at Duke, who describes his research and that of his colleagues. His previous book, Predictably Irrational (2008) detailed consistent findings that most people cheat just a little when they aren’t held accountable and have plausible deniability. His thesis in The Honest Truth about Dishonesty is that our behavior is driven by conflicting motivations: our desire to see ourselves as honest, honorable people, and our desire to benefit from cheating. The way to get the benefits without ruining our self-image is by cheating a little bit, an amount we can rationalize with our “amazing cognitive flexibility.” To reduce cheating requires reducing our ability to rationalize our actions, while factors that increase our ability to justify our cheating increase dishonesty.Ariely’s experiments suggest what conditions influence how dishonest we are. In most of his experiments, participants were paid small amounts for solving simple matrix exercises. When they could cheat and get away with it, participants claimed to have solved 50 percent more matches than the control group who couldn’t cheat. This increase was not due to a few individuals who claimed high numbers, but from lots of people who cheated a little.As the amount of money rose, the amount of cheating remained the same as at lower amounts, and cheating declined slightly at the highest amount of $10 per correct answer. This result suggests that cheating isn’t simply a result of cost-benefit analysis; otherwise the amount of cheating would rise with the reward. Ariely explains that at $10 a question, it would be harder for the average person to cheat and still feel he or she has integrity.  Moral reminders lead to less cheating. Half the subjects on the matrix test were asked recall as many of the Ten Commandments as they could before doing the task, while the other half were asked to recall ten books they had read. In the latter group, cheating was at the usual level, widespread but moderate. The group that recalled the Ten Commandments committed no cheating at all. A group of atheists asked to swear on the Bible before the matrix task likewise did not cheat. Conflicts of interest exist in many areas of life, and influence behavior more than we realize. The research indicates that people with conflicts of interest are more likely to make decisions in their own self-interest at other people’s expense, while still considering themselves honorable. Sunshine and disclosure of conflicts do not work to benefit clients of conflicted professionals, and can make matters worse, resulting in worse advice. Our reasoning ability gets tired or depleted over a long day of resisting temptations and doing the right things; that’s why it’s at night that people fall off their diets. Ariely’s research found that the more depleting the task completed before doing the matrix test, the higher the cheating rate on the test. In one test, depleted subjects were paid almost 200 percent more due to cheating than non-depleted subjects who cheated much less. One incident of cheating can pave the way for more. An Ariely experiment found that subjects who had a financial incentive to cheat did so more frequently the longer the experiment lasted, which reinforces the notion that people who cheat a little may eventually give up resisting it and go all in.Creative individuals are more likely to cheat than less creative people, especially in more ambiguous situations. They were also better at justifying themselves; designers are more morally flexible than accountants. Creative minds help “us to develop original paths around rules” in a self-serving way. Unlike creativity, intelligence does not correlate with dishonesty.Revenge is a powerful justification for dishonesty. Participants in an experiment were far more likely to keep extra money paid them when the payer was a bit discourteous. Apparently it’s much easier to justify stealing the overpayment to someone who annoys us than from someone who doesn’t. Dishonesty can be contagious. Ariely found that participants cheated twice as much as usual after they had witnessed someone else cheating with impunity. When the open cheater was from a rival university than the other participants, however, their cheating dropped to solving 9 problems, instead of 15 when the open cheater was not wearing the rival’s shirt. When the cheater is seen as part of our social group, then we identify with him and feel that cheating is more acceptable, but when the cheater is an outsider, we become more ethical to distance ourselves from that immoral person and his out-group. These studies demonstrate “how crucial other people are in defining acceptable boundaries for our own behavior.”Collaboration leads to more cheating due to our altruistic tendencies. Participants cheated more on the matrix test under conditions where cheating was enabled and they worked with a teammate who shared in the reward than when they worked alone. When participants were watching each other, however, cheating was eliminated, even though they could otherwise cheat.I noticed one apparent conflict in his findings. On the one hand, he found that introducing some possibility of being detected did not reduce cheating. On the other hand, he found that when a partner was watching, subjects were less likely to cheat, even though the partners were not supervisors. It seems more research should be done on whether dishonesty is deterred by an increased perceived risk of detection.What works to help people behave more honestly? Ariely’s suggestions are based upon his findings. Moral reminders are useful in situations that tempt. To address the weakness that comes from depletion, it makes sense to periodically succumb to temptation - “rational self-indulgence” - so as not to deplete one’s will power. Avoid the slippery slope by policing ourselves in rationalizing one cheat, since one dishonest act may lead to a what-the-hell attitude. Reduce cheating that comes from group work by having independent rating of the group’s performance. On the individual level, once we understand what factors lead us astray, we can avoid them to better control our behavior. This easy-to-read book is most enlightening about human nature. Highly recommended. ###"

And I (think I) always strive to be more so - and especially to be a proper role model for my family.This book contains much more than the sound bites you may have heard about a study about some college students getting paid to tell how many answers they said they got right on some silly math test and determining that most people cheat, but only a little, only enough to convince themselves that they are still honorable people. The author discusses study after study which express variations on the theme of honesty in many situations. I appreciated how thorough he was.One complaint: his discussion on the societal effects of dishonesty was somewhat more superficial than it should have been.I think most of us want more than just to be known as honest, we want to fully believe ourselves to be honest. This book reminds us how we often delude ourselves and gives suggestions on how to help ourselves be that person we want to be.Highly recommended."
155,0062183591,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5808354-joshua-guest,4,"Ariely's style doesn't vary much across his non-fiction books. He makes some general hypotheses about human behavior, he briefly describes experiments conducted by him and his colleagues to test them, and then he adds a paragraph that (like clockwork) begins with, ""This result suggests... [some possible conclusion about human behavior in general]."" I always enjoy Professor Ariely's books because he does a good job of connecting the scientific takeaways to pop culture references, Shakespeare, poetry, current events and religious texts. I also admire Ariely's restraint in not overstating the implications of his research. As I said earlier, he carefully prefaces the takeaways by saying ""This result suggests"" as opposed to saying, ""This conclusively proves..."".I have argued with professors about the perils of allowing to students to grade their own work, even when they have previously signed a code of ethics. I usually cite Plato saying how men are not good judges of themselves. This easy-to-read volume really provides great evidence to strengthen my argument in such a conversation. We see the dangers of being dishonest ""just this once"", conflicts of interest, being tempted while tired or hungry, altruistic dishonesty, and watching others act dishonestly. We see some of the virtues of pledges, signatures, moral reminders and supervision."
156,0062183591,http://goodreads.com/user/show/15406725-mike-o-connell,5,"After reading Ariely's first book, Predictably Irrational, I was looking forward to this one. It does not disappoint.Airely is one of the nation’s top academics in the field of behavioral economics; he has taught and MIT and currently teaches at Duke. Sounds like what would make for boring reading, but in these books, designed for a wider audience, Airely brings humor, wit and fascinating overviews of experiments about dishonesty.Some captivating examples…-We are less likely to cheat if we sign a honor pledge or are read something with moral overtones like the ten commandments.-We will cheat more if we receive rude or poor service. As in the experiment where subjects were offered $5 to take a survey, but intentionally given $9. In the control condition just less than 50% of participants returned the extra cash. In the experimental condition, where the person administering the survey in a coffee shop rudely took a short social phone call with no apology in the middle of administering the survey, only 17% of people returned the extra money.These examples are less interesting out of context, but make for an interesting narrative in the course of the book. The audiobook, which I am listening to, is particularly well done."
157,0062183591,http://goodreads.com/user/show/548006-eric,5,"Another great book from Dan Ariely on how we do - or do not - act in accordance to logic and rationality. All of his books, which center on behavioral neurology and specifically the ""nonsensical"" or irrational angles of it, have been fast enjoyable reads for me and this was no exception. He describes a number of experiments and methods - namely the ""more dots on the right or left"" and ""how many matrixes did you fill out"" - without dragging you into the muck of scientific methodology, and the applies them to various conditions (the ""direct supervision"" condition, the ""can cheat/shredder"" condition, the ""altruistic cheating"" condition, etc) and then compares the results. While I'm sure that they didn't come out as actual whole numbers - another example of the scientific dilution - and the results are still interesting. NOT a great read if you are highly scientific and want to know hard numbers, but a fantastic armchair psychology / behavioral studies book. It dovetailed great with my recent reading of ""Willpower"" (Ariely investigates ""depletion"" as a factor in cheating) as well as the fact I'm taking Law and Ethics this semester :-) "
158,0062183591,http://goodreads.com/user/show/13052671-ved-gupta,4,"Dan Ariely, author of Predictably Irrational has returned with his original thinking and results of his experiments for educating people about the reasoning and rational that goes behind dishonesty (which is no different than cheating). Dan is completely against the SMORC (Simple Model of Rational Crime) and proves this model wrong initially with the help of an experiment and many other times in his book.The best thing about this book is that you will find yourself a part of this book many times and you will relate to it closely. If you think you have never cheated and you are an honest person, this book will surely show you a mirror. I really appreciated the various experimental set ups that were used by Dan to test various hypothesis and results were not only intuitive but also conclusive. Dan has made this book very interesting with a little bit of humor and research results and the way he relates with his readers. Policy makers should read such kind of research and take a clue that only harsher punishment cannot control crime and frauds in society and a completely new approach is the demand of time"
159,0062183591,http://goodreads.com/user/show/32360-john,4,"Didn't read it, listened to it on an audio book that included several interviews after the book ended. I found those interviews almost as good as the book itself. I'm not 100% convinced of the research in the book (because I'm not clear how many test samples and big the sample size for some of the assumptions in the book), but the test that were run seemed to be well-structured and some consideration of bias is considered. Trusting the findings, I did like hearing about how we fool ourselves into believing things, that the best deception is one we've pulled on ourselves. With several chapters focused on academics and the blindness of both professor and student, this is an important book for universities to read and understand the modern dynamics of cheating in the classroom. Ariely also orders papers from an academic paper mill to see if professors would be able to spot them and his experience shows that profs have nothing to fear from these mills but and should focus more attention on the overall atmosphere of the school."

His relaxed and informal writing style combined with some really cool experiments makes for an easy and enlightening read. I particularly like how he points out that we can't necessarily fix ourselves (or others) outright but we can make things better by being aware of our issues. Through multiple versions of the ""matrix test"", Dan shows all the ways people can cheat and what can make that cheating more or less likely. My favorite was that an actor portraying a UPitt student blatantly cheating resulted in all the CMU students cheating much less. Each chapter covers a different twist on cheating, and each has its own interesting learnings, but there isn't a build-up to a climatic end or some final nugget of truth to make everything/everyone better. I can't say that I leave the book feeling rosy about our society's future with respect to honest, and I'm not sure I'll be trusting too many golfers in the future. "

And little did I know how this small act can lead to this whole topic of dishonesty!I enjoyed the book overall! It's easy to follow with interesting research and experiments on dishonesty. It also made me reflect my own behaviour. It made me imagine the possible things that are probably happening with high rank politicians and bankers.Ariely was hilarious in his writing, particularly the end part that made me chuckle a few times. The reason I gave it a 3 star is because I felt it was draggy somewhere in the middle. It took me a while to finish the book. It just felt like too many experiments altogether! I would enjoy more if there are some illustrations to help me visualise the experiments!Nonetheless, it is a great and important book for everyone to read. It is definitely not a book that condemns you or make you feel guilty, but it gives you a deeper insight and understanding of why we do what we do! It's so much more than just cost-benefit analysis!"
162,0062183591,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3187548-holly-cline,4,"I won this through first reads and really enjoyed it. Sure, it shows how all people will lie, cheat & steal when given the opportunity. But don't we sort of know this already even if we don't want to admit it? That's part of what's so fun about the research Dan Ariely does. As you read along, you realize, yes I believe all of this to be true. People are very dishonest. I totally see it! Is this depressing? I don't think so. As long as you're aware of what everyone is capable of, it's just a part of human nature. It's true that none of us knows exactly what we're capable of, for good OR bad, until we're placed in the situation. The real success of this book is how well Dan Ariely is able to speak with a voice that is perfectly suited to be read by non-academics. He is charming and relatable with words. He has a professor's humor, which is to say he'll never do stand up, but he can make you chuckle. I'd definitely read another book that he's written."

I was delightfully surprised that it wasn't farfetched or outlandish. I actually enjoyed this book more than any of his other books. There are plenty of tidbits here that a reader can try to use or experiment with. I liked the revelations towards the end, which made me more aware of how dishonesty can easily creep up on you. I didn't like the same experiment mentioned over and over again about the matrices (uggh!). I will try the technique of putting a pair of ""eyes"" on the tin can when charging coffee at the break room. It's hilarious that when given a chance a person would try to cheat if the situation makes it easy for them and if there is a small chance of getting caught. Worthy read. "
164,0062183591,http://goodreads.com/user/show/12702052-muhammad-arrabi,5,"Amazing book - very well documtned with most interesting psychological research. It's more concise and to the point than Dan's 2 earlier books.The book focuses on ""small-amount cheating"" type of behavior, what the author calls ""fudge-factor"". This is where people deviate from the accurate truth, but believe internally that they are honest. The book does not look at real criminals psychology - people who know they are stealing, and they do it anyways.As with most books written by University Professors, it's based mostly on ""lab-type"" experiments, measuring short-term reaction of people put in a short-term conditions. You cannot just take these results and apply them to business, because you don't know their long-term effect. This does not subtract from the importance of this book. This just means that we need a similar book but written by a business-history type of guy."

If you are into expanding your knowledge of human nature, this book is a must read. If you are wanting to improve yourself as a person, well, you get the idea.The one point I kept wanting to argue was with their assumption of moral depletion. The claim is that the more we resist temptation and/or do a good deed, the weaker our willpower becomes later in the day. For example, people who purchased organic food were more prone to cheat on a test (for financial gain). I'm sure there is a good amount of merit to their exhausted morality view, but, I might have offered up one further perspective. The person who purchased organic food may have thought, ""I'm a good boy, so now I deserve a reward."" I imagine there are times of moral depletion, but I'd wager there are also times of self justified compensation too."

Somewhere it was always there at the back of my mind that we justify our dishonesty to ourselves...i am talking about small lies here...but this book helped me think about it more deeply. Dan talks about some very interesting and powerful ideas to curb dishonesty through a better understanding of human psychology. This was the most interesting part.I wish he could add some pictures of his experiments because similar experiments were conducted for various concepts and after a while I wondered if most of the conclusions in the book were through the experiments, the reader could benefit a little with some more stats about the experiments, limitations of the experiment and a few pictures would have been great.Overall, it is a must read if you want to understand yourself better and if you want to run your business more honestly."

He conducts social experiments and then presents his results in his seminars and the audience appears to be not surprised when they hear about the outcome. They look at him with the a look of ""We all knew that the result would be like this"". This is another proof of how we tend to cheat ourselves so easily. We hear something and in the blink of an eye we claim ownership. Maybe I also fell into the same trap in the beginning but later on I tried guessing the outcomes sometimes getting it right sometimes wrong. The problem is though the experiments conducted are still like our artificial engineering models. Life actually is more complex and these studies may fail to grasp it and are mostly fun to play with academically. The ending with religion was also a turn off."

I really liked reading about all those social experiments conducted and was fascinated by the number of academics involved it proving that aspects of the human nature itself such as creativity, conscience and social conformity are factors that attribute to dishonesty. It also offers insight into certain facts and events of recent history that spurred my interest and encouraged me to learn more.However, I have to admit that I was not fully committed to reading this novel. It felt like all those conclusions could not be based on solid results (they were social experiments after all). The variations of the experiments ware quite repetitive and after a while stopped holding my interest."

What he finds is that cheating is rampant and bounded; or to put it another way, we all cheat a little bit. Ariely then pushes the limits of that, to figure out under what conditions we are more or less likely to cheat, and further to see if there are particular individuals who are particularly prone to lying or cheating. The book is funny, easy to read, and extremely relevant to anyone interested in morality, law, finance, religion, administration, politics, or any other profession in which people find themselves tempted to bend the rules once in awhile."
170,0062183591,http://goodreads.com/user/show/13904904-rebekah,4,"Insightful. It's always helpful when the mind behind academic research see fit to write colloquially about their findings so that the general public can understand its meaning. Surprisingly, our tendency to be dishonest isn't increased by what we think it might be, and often isn't decreased by what we think it might be. I find studies on human nature very interesting, we're very complex creatures that operate beyond the instinct and cost vs benefit framework of the animal world at large. Maybe prepare yourself to be a little disheartened at how easy it is for humanity to engage in deception and still think of themselves as 'good people' but the first step to fixing a problem is acknowledging. And even if you don't give a damn, it's still pretty interesting. "

Sadly but also honestly this book does not deserve 5-stars. I would have enjoyed more analysis of the data that he presented. But I enjoyed it like a five star book. Somehow he's adorable. I don't know why and I don't think that's a normal reaction to this book lol. Finally I wonder what my fudge factor would be in the various matrices tests. And I wonder if I would overestimate my intelligence like so many of his subjects did when they had the answer key right below their work, lol. I'd really like to know!

And when the story portrays us in a more glowing and positive light, so much the better.” Err, I did like reading it, but most of the experiments were kinda obvious and sometimes a bit boring.

I think about it a lot and I suspect it will be even more useful than the author's previous two books, but it doesn't build any real model of _how_ we lie, or _why_, other than destroying the ""factor in the likelihood of getting caught and the severity of punishment"" model. I have to admit I was interested in this book as soon as I heard about it; I like thinking about the nature of honesty and how it's an absolutely fundamental element of civilization. I don't think his experiments support all of his conclusions and he makes assumptions about the model of why people cheat that he doesn't test, but overall the experiments are interesting and revealing.The focus of this book is to find factors that influence how much people cheat and figure out how much they influence our behavior. The factors that turn out to make a difference include whether we're reminded of our moral values beforehand, whether we have conflicts of interest, and whether other people around us are cheating. You might be surprised at how much, or how little, influence some things have over our decisions and how unaware we may be over some of the factors.The author has some wry humor that I appreciate, and I still like that he describes his experiments in enough detail that you can form your own idea of how well they do or don't support the conclusions he reaches. Each description, like the rest of his writing, is very readable."

I liked the writing style that the author used because it was very personal and humorous while still being educationa It is mostly about human immorality such as cheating and lying.Many of us never realize or think hard about how many small chances to cheat or temptations we face every day. The author tells us why we cheat, how likely we are to cheat, and how human we all are when it comes to being dishonest. That being said, it makes the reader realize how immoral he is and ways to become more moral. Even though it is an extremely hard decision when you want to be a good person and to benefit as much as possible (even if others don't benefit). You can't have both worlds, so you cheat a little or you justify your cheating some way or another. This book does include infidelity, but not as the main type of cheating. The type of cheating involved in this book is mostly white collar crimes like “fudging” numbers, or “petty” crimes like taking money, or cheating to gain more money than you would honestly get if you haven’t cheated in the first place. The author experimented on why individuals cheat, and expanded it to why groups cheat and then to “which country cheats the most”. In addition to looking for the ""why"". he also looked for how as a society we can decrease the amount of cheating we do. I recommend to some of my friends, family because it's very interesting"

I've got four of his titles on my List, but I haven't actually read anything by him yet. We'll see.***Ariely covers his research into cheating and lying, as well as the research of others in the field. As I noted in my update, House is right: everybody lies. The good news is that most people lie and cheat at a low level, just a little, not so much to destroy our vision of ourselves as good people. We're more likely to cheat when we know we can get away with it, and when people like us are cheating too. We're less likely to cheat when it would be taking advantage of a specific blind person, or when it would mean overt and obvious action.For people interested in improving the way their business or organization works (education and banking are mentioned, the Wall Street collapse is considered) there is some good advice about ways to decrease the incentives and remind people that we want to be good. Interesting stuff. I'm fascinated by the idea that we're none of us as good as we'd like to believe, but most of us aren't really that bad, either. Philosophically, I'm particularly drawn to the idea that secular resets can serve the same purpose as religious confession, allowing us to start over with a clean conscience. I wish there had been a larger section devoted to this idea. Ah, well, maybe the next book.Library copy"
183,0062183591,http://goodreads.com/user/show/40688856-paul-froehlich,5,"How much do we cheat, and what circumstances make us more or less likely to do so? This book is about the psychology of dishonesty. The author is Dan Ariely, a professor of psychology at Duke, who describes his research and that of his colleagues. His previous book, Predictably Irrational (2008) detailed consistent findings that most people cheat just a little when they aren’t held accountable and have plausible deniability. His thesis in The Honest Truth about Dishonesty is that our behavior is driven by conflicting motivations: our desire to see ourselves as honest, honorable people, and our desire to benefit from cheating. The way to get the benefits without ruining our self-image is by cheating a little bit, an amount we can rationalize with our “amazing cognitive flexibility.” To reduce cheating requires reducing our ability to rationalize our actions, while factors that increase our ability to justify our cheating increase dishonesty.Ariely’s experiments suggest what conditions influence how dishonest we are. In most of his experiments, participants were paid small amounts for solving simple matrix exercises. When they could cheat and get away with it, participants claimed to have solved 50 percent more matches than the control group who couldn’t cheat. This increase was not due to a few individuals who claimed high numbers, but from lots of people who cheated a little.As the amount of money rose, the amount of cheating remained the same as at lower amounts, and cheating declined slightly at the highest amount of $10 per correct answer. This result suggests that cheating isn’t simply a result of cost-benefit analysis; otherwise the amount of cheating would rise with the reward. Ariely explains that at $10 a question, it would be harder for the average person to cheat and still feel he or she has integrity.  Moral reminders lead to less cheating. Half the subjects on the matrix test were asked recall as many of the Ten Commandments as they could before doing the task, while the other half were asked to recall ten books they had read. In the latter group, cheating was at the usual level, widespread but moderate. The group that recalled the Ten Commandments committed no cheating at all. A group of atheists asked to swear on the Bible before the matrix task likewise did not cheat. Conflicts of interest exist in many areas of life, and influence behavior more than we realize. The research indicates that people with conflicts of interest are more likely to make decisions in their own self-interest at other people’s expense, while still considering themselves honorable. Sunshine and disclosure of conflicts do not work to benefit clients of conflicted professionals, and can make matters worse, resulting in worse advice. Our reasoning ability gets tired or depleted over a long day of resisting temptations and doing the right things; that’s why it’s at night that people fall off their diets. Ariely’s research found that the more depleting the task completed before doing the matrix test, the higher the cheating rate on the test. In one test, depleted subjects were paid almost 200 percent more due to cheating than non-depleted subjects who cheated much less. One incident of cheating can pave the way for more. An Ariely experiment found that subjects who had a financial incentive to cheat did so more frequently the longer the experiment lasted, which reinforces the notion that people who cheat a little may eventually give up resisting it and go all in.Creative individuals are more likely to cheat than less creative people, especially in more ambiguous situations. They were also better at justifying themselves; designers are more morally flexible than accountants. Creative minds help “us to develop original paths around rules” in a self-serving way. Unlike creativity, intelligence does not correlate with dishonesty.Revenge is a powerful justification for dishonesty. Participants in an experiment were far more likely to keep extra money paid them when the payer was a bit discourteous. Apparently it’s much easier to justify stealing the overpayment to someone who annoys us than from someone who doesn’t. Dishonesty can be contagious. Ariely found that participants cheated twice as much as usual after they had witnessed someone else cheating with impunity. When the open cheater was from a rival university than the other participants, however, their cheating dropped to solving 9 problems, instead of 15 when the open cheater was not wearing the rival’s shirt. When the cheater is seen as part of our social group, then we identify with him and feel that cheating is more acceptable, but when the cheater is an outsider, we become more ethical to distance ourselves from that immoral person and his out-group. These studies demonstrate “how crucial other people are in defining acceptable boundaries for our own behavior.”Collaboration leads to more cheating due to our altruistic tendencies. Participants cheated more on the matrix test under conditions where cheating was enabled and they worked with a teammate who shared in the reward than when they worked alone. When participants were watching each other, however, cheating was eliminated, even though they could otherwise cheat.I noticed one apparent conflict in his findings. On the one hand, he found that introducing some possibility of being detected did not reduce cheating. On the other hand, he found that when a partner was watching, subjects were less likely to cheat, even though the partners were not supervisors. It seems more research should be done on whether dishonesty is deterred by an increased perceived risk of detection.What works to help people behave more honestly? Ariely’s suggestions are based upon his findings. Moral reminders are useful in situations that tempt. To address the weakness that comes from depletion, it makes sense to periodically succumb to temptation - “rational self-indulgence” - so as not to deplete one’s will power. Avoid the slippery slope by policing ourselves in rationalizing one cheat, since one dishonest act may lead to a what-the-hell attitude. Reduce cheating that comes from group work by having independent rating of the group’s performance. On the individual level, once we understand what factors lead us astray, we can avoid them to better control our behavior. This easy-to-read book is most enlightening about human nature.

Often I heed those warnings or try to find the book in the library.However, I was so interested in the Wall Street Journal article which discussed this book from a few month ago, that I went ahead and took the leap. After all, I think I am an honest person. And I (think I) always strive to be more so - and especially to be a proper role model for my family.This book contains much more than the sound bites you may have heard about a study about some college students getting paid to tell how many answers they said they got right on some silly math test and determining that most people cheat, but only a little, only enough to convince themselves that they are still honorable people. The author discusses study after study which express variations on the theme of honesty in many situations. I appreciated how thorough he was.One complaint: his discussion on the societal effects of dishonesty was somewhat more superficial than it should have been.I think most of us want more than just to be known as honest, we want to fully believe ourselves to be honest. This book reminds us how we often delude ourselves and gives suggestions on how to help ourselves be that person we want to be.Highly recommended."
185,0062183591,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5808354-joshua-guest,4,"Ariely's style doesn't vary much across his non-fiction books. He makes some general hypotheses about human behavior, he briefly describes experiments conducted by him and his colleagues to test them, and then he adds a paragraph that (like clockwork) begins with, ""This result suggests... [some possible conclusion about human behavior in general]."" I always enjoy Professor Ariely's books because he does a good job of connecting the scientific takeaways to pop culture references, Shakespeare, poetry, current events and religious texts. I also admire Ariely's restraint in not overstating the implications of his research. As I said earlier, he carefully prefaces the takeaways by saying ""This result suggests"" as opposed to saying, ""This conclusively proves..."".I have argued with professors about the perils of allowing to students to grade their own work, even when they have previously signed a code of ethics. I usually cite Plato saying how men are not good judges of themselves. This easy-to-read volume really provides great evidence to strengthen my argument in such a conversation. We see the dangers of being dishonest ""just this once"", conflicts of interest, being tempted while tired or hungry, altruistic dishonesty, and watching others act dishonestly. We see some of the virtues of pledges, signatures, moral reminders and supervision."
186,0062183591,http://goodreads.com/user/show/15406725-mike-o-connell,5,"After reading Ariely's first book, Predictably Irrational, I was looking forward to this one. It does not disappoint.Airely is one of the nation’s top academics in the field of behavioral economics; he has taught and MIT and currently teaches at Duke. Sounds like what would make for boring reading, but in these books, designed for a wider audience, Airely brings humor, wit and fascinating overviews of experiments about dishonesty.Some captivating examples…-We are less likely to cheat if we sign a honor pledge or are read something with moral overtones like the ten commandments.-We will cheat more if we receive rude or poor service. As in the experiment where subjects were offered $5 to take a survey, but intentionally given $9. In the control condition just less than 50% of participants returned the extra cash. In the experimental condition, where the person administering the survey in a coffee shop rudely took a short social phone call with no apology in the middle of administering the survey, only 17% of people returned the extra money.These examples are less interesting out of context, but make for an interesting narrative in the course of the book. The audiobook, which I am listening to, is particularly well done."
187,0062183591,http://goodreads.com/user/show/548006-eric,5,"Another great book from Dan Ariely on how we do - or do not - act in accordance to logic and rationality. All of his books, which center on behavioral neurology and specifically the ""nonsensical"" or irrational angles of it, have been fast enjoyable reads for me and this was no exception. He describes a number of experiments and methods - namely the ""more dots on the right or left"" and ""how many matrixes did you fill out"" - without dragging you into the muck of scientific methodology, and the applies them to various conditions (the ""direct supervision"" condition, the ""can cheat/shredder"" condition, the ""altruistic cheating"" condition, etc) and then compares the results. While I'm sure that they didn't come out as actual whole numbers - another example of the scientific dilution - and the results are still interesting. NOT a great read if you are highly scientific and want to know hard numbers, but a fantastic armchair psychology / behavioral studies book. It dovetailed great with my recent reading of ""Willpower"" (Ariely investigates ""depletion"" as a factor in cheating) as well as the fact I'm taking Law and Ethics this semester :-) "
188,0062183591,http://goodreads.com/user/show/13052671-ved-gupta,4,"Dan Ariely, author of Predictably Irrational has returned with his original thinking and results of his experiments for educating people about the reasoning and rational that goes behind dishonesty (which is no different than cheating). Dan is completely against the SMORC (Simple Model of Rational Crime) and proves this model wrong initially with the help of an experiment and many other times in his book.The best thing about this book is that you will find yourself a part of this book many times and you will relate to it closely. If you think you have never cheated and you are an honest person, this book will surely show you a mirror. I really appreciated the various experimental set ups that were used by Dan to test various hypothesis and results were not only intuitive but also conclusive. Dan has made this book very interesting with a little bit of humor and research results and the way he relates with his readers. Policy makers should read such kind of research and take a clue that only harsher punishment cannot control crime and frauds in society and a completely new approach is the demand of time"
189,0062183591,http://goodreads.com/user/show/32360-john,4,"Didn't read it, listened to it on an audio book that included several interviews after the book ended. I found those interviews almost as good as the book itself. I'm not 100% convinced of the research in the book (because I'm not clear how many test samples and big the sample size for some of the assumptions in the book), but the test that were run seemed to be well-structured and some consideration of bias is considered. Trusting the findings, I did like hearing about how we fool ourselves into believing things, that the best deception is one we've pulled on ourselves. With several chapters focused on academics and the blindness of both professor and student, this is an important book for universities to read and understand the modern dynamics of cheating in the classroom. Ariely also orders papers from an academic paper mill to see if professors would be able to spot them and his experience shows that profs have nothing to fear from these mills but and should focus more attention on the overall atmosphere of the school."
190,0062183591,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5857480-eric-schreiber,4,"I've always enjoyed Dan Ariely's work - first as a regular contributor to NPR's Marketplace, and more recently as an author of multiple books. His relaxed and informal writing style combined with some really cool experiments makes for an easy and enlightening read. I particularly like how he points out that we can't necessarily fix ourselves (or others) outright but we can make things better by being aware of our issues. Through multiple versions of the ""matrix test"", Dan shows all the ways people can cheat and what can make that cheating more or less likely. My favorite was that an actor portraying a UPitt student blatantly cheating resulted in all the CMU students cheating much less. Each chapter covers a different twist on cheating, and each has its own interesting learnings, but there isn't a build-up to a climatic end or some final nugget of truth to make everything/everyone better. I can't say that I leave the book feeling rosy about our society's future with respect to honest, and I'm not sure I'll be trusting too many golfers in the future. "
191,0062183591,http://goodreads.com/user/show/12030315-jacqueline,3,"Everyone has stole a pen before. At least I did, which could have been an 'accident'. And little did I know how this small act can lead to this whole topic of dishonesty!I enjoyed the book overall! It's easy to follow with interesting research and experiments on dishonesty. It also made me reflect my own behaviour. It made me imagine the possible things that are probably happening with high rank politicians and bankers.Ariely was hilarious in his writing, particularly the end part that made me chuckle a few times. The reason I gave it a 3 star is because I felt it was draggy somewhere in the middle. It took me a while to finish the book. It just felt like too many experiments altogether! I would enjoy more if there are some illustrations to help me visualise the experiments!Nonetheless, it is a great and important book for everyone to read. It is definitely not a book that condemns you or make you feel guilty, but it gives you a deeper insight and understanding of why we do what we do! It's so much more than just cost-benefit analysis!"
192,0062183591,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3187548-holly-cline,4,"I won this through first reads and really enjoyed it. Sure, it shows how all people will lie, cheat & steal when given the opportunity. But don't we sort of know this already even if we don't want to admit it? That's part of what's so fun about the research Dan Ariely does. As you read along, you realize, yes I believe all of this to be true. People are very dishonest. I totally see it! Is this depressing? I don't think so. As long as you're aware of what everyone is capable of, it's just a part of human nature. It's true that none of us knows exactly what we're capable of, for good OR bad, until we're placed in the situation. The real success of this book is how well Dan Ariely is able to speak with a voice that is perfectly suited to be read by non-academics. He is charming and relatable with words. He has a professor's humor, which is to say he'll never do stand up, but he can make you chuckle. I'd definitely read another book that he's written."

I was delightfully surprised that it wasn't farfetched or outlandish. I actually enjoyed this book more than any of his other books. There are plenty of tidbits here that a reader can try to use or experiment with. I liked the revelations towards the end, which made me more aware of how dishonesty can easily creep up on you. I didn't like the same experiment mentioned over and over again about the matrices (uggh!). I will try the technique of putting a pair of ""eyes"" on the tin can when charging coffee at the break room. It's hilarious that when given a chance a person would try to cheat if the situation makes it easy for them and if there is a small chance of getting caught. Worthy read. "
194,0062183591,http://goodreads.com/user/show/12702052-muhammad-arrabi,5,"Amazing book - very well documtned with most interesting psychological research. It's more concise and to the point than Dan's 2 earlier books.The book focuses on ""small-amount cheating"" type of behavior, what the author calls ""fudge-factor"". This is where people deviate from the accurate truth, but believe internally that they are honest. The book does not look at real criminals psychology - people who know they are stealing, and they do it anyways.As with most books written by University Professors, it's based mostly on ""lab-type"" experiments, measuring short-term reaction of people put in a short-term conditions. You cannot just take these results and apply them to business, because you don't know their long-term effect. This does not subtract from the importance of this book. This just means that we need a similar book but written by a business-history type of guy."
195,0062183591,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1998927-james-maxon,5,"Guilty! If you are into behavioral economics, this book is a must read. If you are into expanding your knowledge of human nature, this book is a must read. If you are wanting to improve yourself as a person, well, you get the idea.The one point I kept wanting to argue was with their assumption of moral depletion. The claim is that the more we resist temptation and/or do a good deed, the weaker our willpower becomes later in the day. For example, people who purchased organic food were more prone to cheat on a test (for financial gain). I'm sure there is a good amount of merit to their exhausted morality view, but, I might have offered up one further perspective. The person who purchased organic food may have thought, ""I'm a good boy, so now I deserve a reward."" I imagine there are times of moral depletion, but I'd wager there are also times of self justified compensation too."

Somewhere it was always there at the back of my mind that we justify our dishonesty to ourselves...i am talking about small lies here...but this book helped me think about it more deeply. Dan talks about some very interesting and powerful ideas to curb dishonesty through a better understanding of human psychology. This was the most interesting part.I wish he could add some pictures of his experiments because similar experiments were conducted for various concepts and after a while I wondered if most of the conclusions in the book were through the experiments, the reader could benefit a little with some more stats about the experiments, limitations of the experiment and a few pictures would have been great.Overall, it is a must read if you want to understand yourself better and if you want to run your business more honestly."
197,0062183591,http://goodreads.com/user/show/54467877-baris-balcioglu,3,"I was expecting more. There is one catch though. The author puts it nicely. He conducts social experiments and then presents his results in his seminars and the audience appears to be not surprised when they hear about the outcome. They look at him with the a look of ""We all knew that the result would be like this"". This is another proof of how we tend to cheat ourselves so easily. We hear something and in the blink of an eye we claim ownership. Maybe I also fell into the same trap in the beginning but later on I tried guessing the outcomes sometimes getting it right sometimes wrong. The problem is though the experiments conducted are still like our artificial engineering models. Life actually is more complex and these studies may fail to grasp it and are mostly fun to play with academically. The ending with religion was also a turn off."

I really liked reading about all those social experiments conducted and was fascinated by the number of academics involved it proving that aspects of the human nature itself such as creativity, conscience and social conformity are factors that attribute to dishonesty. It also offers insight into certain facts and events of recent history that spurred my interest and encouraged me to learn more.However, I have to admit that I was not fully committed to reading this novel. It felt like all those conclusions could not be based on solid results (they were social experiments after all). The variations of the experiments ware quite repetitive and after a while stopped holding my interest."

What he finds is that cheating is rampant and bounded; or to put it another way, we all cheat a little bit. Ariely then pushes the limits of that, to figure out under what conditions we are more or less likely to cheat, and further to see if there are particular individuals who are particularly prone to lying or cheating. The book is funny, easy to read, and extremely relevant to anyone interested in morality, law, finance, religion, administration, politics, or any other profession in which people find themselves tempted to bend the rules once in awhile."
200,0062183591,http://goodreads.com/user/show/13904904-rebekah,4,"Insightful. It's always helpful when the mind behind academic research see fit to write colloquially about their findings so that the general public can understand its meaning. Surprisingly, our tendency to be dishonest isn't increased by what we think it might be, and often isn't decreased by what we think it might be. I find studies on human nature very interesting, we're very complex creatures that operate beyond the instinct and cost vs benefit framework of the animal world at large. Maybe prepare yourself to be a little disheartened at how easy it is for humanity to engage in deception and still think of themselves as 'good people' but the first step to fixing a problem is acknowledging. And even if you don't give a damn, it's still pretty interesting. "
201,0062183591,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4940999-ariel,4,"I honestly enjoy Dan Ariely, his endless series of matrices tests, and his rigorous enjoyment of rather repetitive but necessary studies. Sadly but also honestly this book does not deserve 5-stars. I would have enjoyed more analysis of the data that he presented. But I enjoyed it like a five star book. Somehow he's adorable. I don't know why and I don't think that's a normal reaction to this book lol. Finally I wonder what my fudge factor would be in the various matrices tests. And I wonder if I would overestimate my intelligence like so many of his subjects did when they had the answer key right below their work, lol. I'd really like to know! But now that I know the secret an all new test would need to be designed in order to find out. Sad!"

We’re storytelling creatures by nature, and we tell ourselves story after story until we come up with an explanation that we like and that sounds reasonable enough to believe. And when the story portrays us in a more glowing and positive light, so much the better.” Err, I did like reading it, but most of the experiments were kinda obvious and sometimes a bit boring.

One of our members is in the medical device business so she had some interesting insight into the process of selling to doctors which was a bit different than Ariely's report of big pharma sales to medical professionals.I enjoyed this but a lot of the material was already familiar to me because I took an online course from Ariely and have read a lot of his work.

I feel like something happened when you are able to look at that without judgement or unassailable assumptions. This book offers a great example of how to start that conversation."

I think about it a lot and I suspect it will be even more useful than the author's previous two books, but it doesn't build any real model of _how_ we lie, or _why_, other than destroying the ""factor in the likelihood of getting caught and the severity of punishment"" model. I have to admit I was interested in this book as soon as I heard about it; I like thinking about the nature of honesty and how it's an absolutely fundamental element of civilization. I don't think his experiments support all of his conclusions and he makes assumptions about the model of why people cheat that he doesn't test, but overall the experiments are interesting and revealing.The focus of this book is to find factors that influence how much people cheat and figure out how much they influence our behavior. The factors that turn out to make a difference include whether we're reminded of our moral values beforehand, whether we have conflicts of interest, and whether other people around us are cheating. You might be surprised at how much, or how little, influence some things have over our decisions and how unaware we may be over some of the factors.The author has some wry humor that I appreciate, and I still like that he describes his experiments in enough detail that you can form your own idea of how well they do or don't support the conclusions he reaches. Each description, like the rest of his writing, is very readable."

I liked the writing style that the author used because it was very personal and humorous while still being educationa It is mostly about human immorality such as cheating and lying.Many of us never realize or think hard about how many small chances to cheat or temptations we face every day. The author tells us why we cheat, how likely we are to cheat, and how human we all are when it comes to being dishonest. That being said, it makes the reader realize how immoral he is and ways to become more moral. Even though it is an extremely hard decision when you want to be a good person and to benefit as much as possible (even if others don't benefit). You can't have both worlds, so you cheat a little or you justify your cheating some way or another. This book does include infidelity, but not as the main type of cheating. The type of cheating involved in this book is mostly white collar crimes like “fudging” numbers, or “petty” crimes like taking money, or cheating to gain more money than you would honestly get if you haven’t cheated in the first place. The author experimented on why individuals cheat, and expanded it to why groups cheat and then to “which country cheats the most”. In addition to looking for the ""why"". he also looked for how as a society we can decrease the amount of cheating we do. I recommend to some of my friends, family because it's very interesting"

I've got four of his titles on my List, but I haven't actually read anything by him yet. We'll see.***Ariely covers his research into cheating and lying, as well as the research of others in the field. As I noted in my update, House is right: everybody lies. The good news is that most people lie and cheat at a low level, just a little, not so much to destroy our vision of ourselves as good people. We're more likely to cheat when we know we can get away with it, and when people like us are cheating too. We're less likely to cheat when it would be taking advantage of a specific blind person, or when it would mean overt and obvious action.For people interested in improving the way their business or organization works (education and banking are mentioned, the Wall Street collapse is considered) there is some good advice about ways to decrease the incentives and remind people that we want to be good. Interesting stuff. I'm fascinated by the idea that we're none of us as good as we'd like to believe, but most of us aren't really that bad, either. Philosophically, I'm particularly drawn to the idea that secular resets can serve the same purpose as religious confession, allowing us to start over with a clean conscience. I wish there had been a larger section devoted to this idea. Ah, well, maybe the next book.Library copy"
213,0062183591,http://goodreads.com/user/show/40688856-paul-froehlich,5,"How much do we cheat, and what circumstances make us more or less likely to do so? This book is about the psychology of dishonesty. The author is Dan Ariely, a professor of psychology at Duke, who describes his research and that of his colleagues. His previous book, Predictably Irrational (2008) detailed consistent findings that most people cheat just a little when they aren’t held accountable and have plausible deniability. His thesis in The Honest Truth about Dishonesty is that our behavior is driven by conflicting motivations: our desire to see ourselves as honest, honorable people, and our desire to benefit from cheating. The way to get the benefits without ruining our self-image is by cheating a little bit, an amount we can rationalize with our “amazing cognitive flexibility.” To reduce cheating requires reducing our ability to rationalize our actions, while factors that increase our ability to justify our cheating increase dishonesty.Ariely’s experiments suggest what conditions influence how dishonest we are. In most of his experiments, participants were paid small amounts for solving simple matrix exercises. When they could cheat and get away with it, participants claimed to have solved 50 percent more matches than the control group who couldn’t cheat. This increase was not due to a few individuals who claimed high numbers, but from lots of people who cheated a little.As the amount of money rose, the amount of cheating remained the same as at lower amounts, and cheating declined slightly at the highest amount of $10 per correct answer. This result suggests that cheating isn’t simply a result of cost-benefit analysis; otherwise the amount of cheating would rise with the reward. Ariely explains that at $10 a question, it would be harder for the average person to cheat and still feel he or she has integrity.  Moral reminders lead to less cheating. Half the subjects on the matrix test were asked recall as many of the Ten Commandments as they could before doing the task, while the other half were asked to recall ten books they had read. In the latter group, cheating was at the usual level, widespread but moderate. The group that recalled the Ten Commandments committed no cheating at all. A group of atheists asked to swear on the Bible before the matrix task likewise did not cheat. Conflicts of interest exist in many areas of life, and influence behavior more than we realize. The research indicates that people with conflicts of interest are more likely to make decisions in their own self-interest at other people’s expense, while still considering themselves honorable. Sunshine and disclosure of conflicts do not work to benefit clients of conflicted professionals, and can make matters worse, resulting in worse advice. Our reasoning ability gets tired or depleted over a long day of resisting temptations and doing the right things; that’s why it’s at night that people fall off their diets. Ariely’s research found that the more depleting the task completed before doing the matrix test, the higher the cheating rate on the test. In one test, depleted subjects were paid almost 200 percent more due to cheating than non-depleted subjects who cheated much less. One incident of cheating can pave the way for more. An Ariely experiment found that subjects who had a financial incentive to cheat did so more frequently the longer the experiment lasted, which reinforces the notion that people who cheat a little may eventually give up resisting it and go all in.Creative individuals are more likely to cheat than less creative people, especially in more ambiguous situations. They were also better at justifying themselves; designers are more morally flexible than accountants. Creative minds help “us to develop original paths around rules” in a self-serving way. Unlike creativity, intelligence does not correlate with dishonesty.Revenge is a powerful justification for dishonesty. Participants in an experiment were far more likely to keep extra money paid them when the payer was a bit discourteous. Apparently it’s much easier to justify stealing the overpayment to someone who annoys us than from someone who doesn’t. Dishonesty can be contagious. Ariely found that participants cheated twice as much as usual after they had witnessed someone else cheating with impunity. When the open cheater was from a rival university than the other participants, however, their cheating dropped to solving 9 problems, instead of 15 when the open cheater was not wearing the rival’s shirt. When the cheater is seen as part of our social group, then we identify with him and feel that cheating is more acceptable, but when the cheater is an outsider, we become more ethical to distance ourselves from that immoral person and his out-group. These studies demonstrate “how crucial other people are in defining acceptable boundaries for our own behavior.”Collaboration leads to more cheating due to our altruistic tendencies. Participants cheated more on the matrix test under conditions where cheating was enabled and they worked with a teammate who shared in the reward than when they worked alone. When participants were watching each other, however, cheating was eliminated, even though they could otherwise cheat.I noticed one apparent conflict in his findings. On the one hand, he found that introducing some possibility of being detected did not reduce cheating. On the other hand, he found that when a partner was watching, subjects were less likely to cheat, even though the partners were not supervisors. It seems more research should be done on whether dishonesty is deterred by an increased perceived risk of detection.What works to help people behave more honestly? Ariely’s suggestions are based upon his findings. Moral reminders are useful in situations that tempt. To address the weakness that comes from depletion, it makes sense to periodically succumb to temptation - “rational self-indulgence” - so as not to deplete one’s will power. Avoid the slippery slope by policing ourselves in rationalizing one cheat, since one dishonest act may lead to a what-the-hell attitude. Reduce cheating that comes from group work by having independent rating of the group’s performance. On the individual level, once we understand what factors lead us astray, we can avoid them to better control our behavior. This easy-to-read book is most enlightening about human nature. Highly recommended. ###"

Often I heed those warnings or try to find the book in the library.However, I was so interested in the Wall Street Journal article which discussed this book from a few month ago, that I went ahead and took the leap. After all, I think I am an honest person. And I (think I) always strive to be more so - and especially to be a proper role model for my family.This book contains much more than the sound bites you may have heard about a study about some college students getting paid to tell how many answers they said they got right on some silly math test and determining that most people cheat, but only a little, only enough to convince themselves that they are still honorable people. The author discusses study after study which express variations on the theme of honesty in many situations. I appreciated how thorough he was.One complaint: his discussion on the societal effects of dishonesty was somewhat more superficial than it should have been.I think most of us want more than just to be known as honest, we want to fully believe ourselves to be honest. This book reminds us how we often delude ourselves and gives suggestions on how to help ourselves be that person we want to be.Highly recommended."
215,0062183591,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5808354-joshua-guest,4,"Ariely's style doesn't vary much across his non-fiction books. He makes some general hypotheses about human behavior, he briefly describes experiments conducted by him and his colleagues to test them, and then he adds a paragraph that (like clockwork) begins with, ""This result suggests... [some possible conclusion about human behavior in general]."" I always enjoy Professor Ariely's books because he does a good job of connecting the scientific takeaways to pop culture references, Shakespeare, poetry, current events and religious texts. I also admire Ariely's restraint in not overstating the implications of his research. As I said earlier, he carefully prefaces the takeaways by saying ""This result suggests"" as opposed to saying, ""This conclusively proves..."".I have argued with professors about the perils of allowing to students to grade their own work, even when they have previously signed a code of ethics. I usually cite Plato saying how men are not good judges of themselves. This easy-to-read volume really provides great evidence to strengthen my argument in such a conversation. We see the dangers of being dishonest ""just this once"", conflicts of interest, being tempted while tired or hungry, altruistic dishonesty, and watching others act dishonestly. We see some of the virtues of pledges, signatures, moral reminders and supervision."
216,0062183591,http://goodreads.com/user/show/15406725-mike-o-connell,5,"After reading Ariely's first book, Predictably Irrational, I was looking forward to this one. It does not disappoint.Airely is one of the nation’s top academics in the field of behavioral economics; he has taught and MIT and currently teaches at Duke. Sounds like what would make for boring reading, but in these books, designed for a wider audience, Airely brings humor, wit and fascinating overviews of experiments about dishonesty.Some captivating examples…-We are less likely to cheat if we sign a honor pledge or are read something with moral overtones like the ten commandments.-We will cheat more if we receive rude or poor service. As in the experiment where subjects were offered $5 to take a survey, but intentionally given $9. In the control condition just less than 50% of participants returned the extra cash. In the experimental condition, where the person administering the survey in a coffee shop rudely took a short social phone call with no apology in the middle of administering the survey, only 17% of people returned the extra money.These examples are less interesting out of context, but make for an interesting narrative in the course of the book. The audiobook, which I am listening to, is particularly well done."
217,0062183591,http://goodreads.com/user/show/548006-eric,5,"Another great book from Dan Ariely on how we do - or do not - act in accordance to logic and rationality. All of his books, which center on behavioral neurology and specifically the ""nonsensical"" or irrational angles of it, have been fast enjoyable reads for me and this was no exception. He describes a number of experiments and methods - namely the ""more dots on the right or left"" and ""how many matrixes did you fill out"" - without dragging you into the muck of scientific methodology, and the applies them to various conditions (the ""direct supervision"" condition, the ""can cheat/shredder"" condition, the ""altruistic cheating"" condition, etc) and then compares the results. While I'm sure that they didn't come out as actual whole numbers - another example of the scientific dilution - and the results are still interesting. NOT a great read if you are highly scientific and want to know hard numbers, but a fantastic armchair psychology / behavioral studies book. It dovetailed great with my recent reading of ""Willpower"" (Ariely investigates ""depletion"" as a factor in cheating) as well as the fact I'm taking Law and Ethics this semester :-) "
218,0062183591,http://goodreads.com/user/show/13052671-ved-gupta,4,"Dan Ariely, author of Predictably Irrational has returned with his original thinking and results of his experiments for educating people about the reasoning and rational that goes behind dishonesty (which is no different than cheating). Dan is completely against the SMORC (Simple Model of Rational Crime) and proves this model wrong initially with the help of an experiment and many other times in his book.The best thing about this book is that you will find yourself a part of this book many times and you will relate to it closely. If you think you have never cheated and you are an honest person, this book will surely show you a mirror. I really appreciated the various experimental set ups that were used by Dan to test various hypothesis and results were not only intuitive but also conclusive. Dan has made this book very interesting with a little bit of humor and research results and the way he relates with his readers. Policy makers should read such kind of research and take a clue that only harsher punishment cannot control crime and frauds in society and a completely new approach is the demand of time"
219,0062183591,http://goodreads.com/user/show/32360-john,4,"Didn't read it, listened to it on an audio book that included several interviews after the book ended. I found those interviews almost as good as the book itself. I'm not 100% convinced of the research in the book (because I'm not clear how many test samples and big the sample size for some of the assumptions in the book), but the test that were run seemed to be well-structured and some consideration of bias is considered. Trusting the findings, I did like hearing about how we fool ourselves into believing things, that the best deception is one we've pulled on ourselves. With several chapters focused on academics and the blindness of both professor and student, this is an important book for universities to read and understand the modern dynamics of cheating in the classroom. Ariely also orders papers from an academic paper mill to see if professors would be able to spot them and his experience shows that profs have nothing to fear from these mills but and should focus more attention on the overall atmosphere of the school."
220,0062183591,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5857480-eric-schreiber,4,"I've always enjoyed Dan Ariely's work - first as a regular contributor to NPR's Marketplace, and more recently as an author of multiple books. His relaxed and informal writing style combined with some really cool experiments makes for an easy and enlightening read. I particularly like how he points out that we can't necessarily fix ourselves (or others) outright but we can make things better by being aware of our issues. Through multiple versions of the ""matrix test"", Dan shows all the ways people can cheat and what can make that cheating more or less likely. My favorite was that an actor portraying a UPitt student blatantly cheating resulted in all the CMU students cheating much less. Each chapter covers a different twist on cheating, and each has its own interesting learnings, but there isn't a build-up to a climatic end or some final nugget of truth to make everything/everyone better. I can't say that I leave the book feeling rosy about our society's future with respect to honest, and I'm not sure I'll be trusting too many golfers in the future. "
221,0062183591,http://goodreads.com/user/show/12030315-jacqueline,3,"Everyone has stole a pen before. At least I did, which could have been an 'accident'. And little did I know how this small act can lead to this whole topic of dishonesty!I enjoyed the book overall! It's easy to follow with interesting research and experiments on dishonesty. It also made me reflect my own behaviour. It made me imagine the possible things that are probably happening with high rank politicians and bankers.Ariely was hilarious in his writing, particularly the end part that made me chuckle a few times. The reason I gave it a 3 star is because I felt it was draggy somewhere in the middle. It took me a while to finish the book. It just felt like too many experiments altogether! I would enjoy more if there are some illustrations to help me visualise the experiments!Nonetheless, it is a great and important book for everyone to read. It is definitely not a book that condemns you or make you feel guilty, but it gives you a deeper insight and understanding of why we do what we do! It's so much more than just cost-benefit analysis!"
222,0062183591,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3187548-holly-cline,4,"I won this through first reads and really enjoyed it. Sure, it shows how all people will lie, cheat & steal when given the opportunity. But don't we sort of know this already even if we don't want to admit it? That's part of what's so fun about the research Dan Ariely does. As you read along, you realize, yes I believe all of this to be true. People are very dishonest. I totally see it! Is this depressing? I don't think so. As long as you're aware of what everyone is capable of, it's just a part of human nature. It's true that none of us knows exactly what we're capable of, for good OR bad, until we're placed in the situation. The real success of this book is how well Dan Ariely is able to speak with a voice that is perfectly suited to be read by non-academics. He is charming and relatable with words. He has a professor's humor, which is to say he'll never do stand up, but he can make you chuckle. I'd definitely read another book that he's written."

I was delightfully surprised that it wasn't farfetched or outlandish. I actually enjoyed this book more than any of his other books. There are plenty of tidbits here that a reader can try to use or experiment with. I liked the revelations towards the end, which made me more aware of how dishonesty can easily creep up on you. I didn't like the same experiment mentioned over and over again about the matrices (uggh!). I will try the technique of putting a pair of ""eyes"" on the tin can when charging coffee at the break room. It's hilarious that when given a chance a person would try to cheat if the situation makes it easy for them and if there is a small chance of getting caught. Worthy read. "
224,0062183591,http://goodreads.com/user/show/12702052-muhammad-arrabi,5,"Amazing book - very well documtned with most interesting psychological research. It's more concise and to the point than Dan's 2 earlier books.The book focuses on ""small-amount cheating"" type of behavior, what the author calls ""fudge-factor"". This is where people deviate from the accurate truth, but believe internally that they are honest. The book does not look at real criminals psychology - people who know they are stealing, and they do it anyways.As with most books written by University Professors, it's based mostly on ""lab-type"" experiments, measuring short-term reaction of people put in a short-term conditions. You cannot just take these results and apply them to business, because you don't know their long-term effect. This does not subtract from the importance of this book. This just means that we need a similar book but written by a business-history type of guy."

If you are into expanding your knowledge of human nature, this book is a must read. If you are wanting to improve yourself as a person, well, you get the idea.The one point I kept wanting to argue was with their assumption of moral depletion. The claim is that the more we resist temptation and/or do a good deed, the weaker our willpower becomes later in the day. For example, people who purchased organic food were more prone to cheat on a test (for financial gain). I'm sure there is a good amount of merit to their exhausted morality view, but, I might have offered up one further perspective. The person who purchased organic food may have thought, ""I'm a good boy, so now I deserve a reward."" I imagine there are times of moral depletion, but I'd wager there are also times of self justified compensation too."

Somewhere it was always there at the back of my mind that we justify our dishonesty to ourselves...i am talking about small lies here...but this book helped me think about it more deeply. Dan talks about some very interesting and powerful ideas to curb dishonesty through a better understanding of human psychology. This was the most interesting part.I wish he could add some pictures of his experiments because similar experiments were conducted for various concepts and after a while I wondered if most of the conclusions in the book were through the experiments, the reader could benefit a little with some more stats about the experiments, limitations of the experiment and a few pictures would have been great.Overall, it is a must read if you want to understand yourself better and if you want to run your business more honestly."
227,0062183591,http://goodreads.com/user/show/54467877-baris-balcioglu,3,"I was expecting more. There is one catch though. The author puts it nicely. He conducts social experiments and then presents his results in his seminars and the audience appears to be not surprised when they hear about the outcome. They look at him with the a look of ""We all knew that the result would be like this"". This is another proof of how we tend to cheat ourselves so easily. We hear something and in the blink of an eye we claim ownership. Maybe I also fell into the same trap in the beginning but later on I tried guessing the outcomes sometimes getting it right sometimes wrong. The problem is though the experiments conducted are still like our artificial engineering models. Life actually is more complex and these studies may fail to grasp it and are mostly fun to play with academically. The ending with religion was also a turn off."

I really liked reading about all those social experiments conducted and was fascinated by the number of academics involved it proving that aspects of the human nature itself such as creativity, conscience and social conformity are factors that attribute to dishonesty. It also offers insight into certain facts and events of recent history that spurred my interest and encouraged me to learn more.However, I have to admit that I was not fully committed to reading this novel. It felt like all those conclusions could not be based on solid results (they were social experiments after all). The variations of the experiments ware quite repetitive and after a while stopped holding my interest."

What he finds is that cheating is rampant and bounded; or to put it another way, we all cheat a little bit. Ariely then pushes the limits of that, to figure out under what conditions we are more or less likely to cheat, and further to see if there are particular individuals who are particularly prone to lying or cheating. The book is funny, easy to read, and extremely relevant to anyone interested in morality, law, finance, religion, administration, politics, or any other profession in which people find themselves tempted to bend the rules once in awhile."
230,0062183591,http://goodreads.com/user/show/13904904-rebekah,4,"Insightful. It's always helpful when the mind behind academic research see fit to write colloquially about their findings so that the general public can understand its meaning. Surprisingly, our tendency to be dishonest isn't increased by what we think it might be, and often isn't decreased by what we think it might be. I find studies on human nature very interesting, we're very complex creatures that operate beyond the instinct and cost vs benefit framework of the animal world at large. Maybe prepare yourself to be a little disheartened at how easy it is for humanity to engage in deception and still think of themselves as 'good people' but the first step to fixing a problem is acknowledging. And even if you don't give a damn, it's still pretty interesting. "

Sadly but also honestly this book does not deserve 5-stars. I would have enjoyed more analysis of the data that he presented. But I enjoyed it like a five star book. Somehow he's adorable. I don't know why and I don't think that's a normal reaction to this book lol. Finally I wonder what my fudge factor would be in the various matrices tests. And I wonder if I would overestimate my intelligence like so many of his subjects did when they had the answer key right below their work, lol. I'd really like to know!

And when the story portrays us in a more glowing and positive light, so much the better.” Err, I did like reading it, but most of the experiments were kinda obvious and sometimes a bit boring.

I think about it a lot and I suspect it will be even more useful than the author's previous two books, but it doesn't build any real model of _how_ we lie, or _why_, other than destroying the ""factor in the likelihood of getting caught and the severity of punishment"" model. I have to admit I was interested in this book as soon as I heard about it; I like thinking about the nature of honesty and how it's an absolutely fundamental element of civilization. I don't think his experiments support all of his conclusions and he makes assumptions about the model of why people cheat that he doesn't test, but overall the experiments are interesting and revealing.The focus of this book is to find factors that influence how much people cheat and figure out how much they influence our behavior. The factors that turn out to make a difference include whether we're reminded of our moral values beforehand, whether we have conflicts of interest, and whether other people around us are cheating. You might be surprised at how much, or how little, influence some things have over our decisions and how unaware we may be over some of the factors.The author has some wry humor that I appreciate, and I still like that he describes his experiments in enough detail that you can form your own idea of how well they do or don't support the conclusions he reaches. Each description, like the rest of his writing, is very readable."

I liked the writing style that the author used because it was very personal and humorous while still being educationa It is mostly about human immorality such as cheating and lying.Many of us never realize or think hard about how many small chances to cheat or temptations we face every day. The author tells us why we cheat, how likely we are to cheat, and how human we all are when it comes to being dishonest. That being said, it makes the reader realize how immoral he is and ways to become more moral. Even though it is an extremely hard decision when you want to be a good person and to benefit as much as possible (even if others don't benefit). You can't have both worlds, so you cheat a little or you justify your cheating some way or another. This book does include infidelity, but not as the main type of cheating. The type of cheating involved in this book is mostly white collar crimes like “fudging” numbers, or “petty” crimes like taking money, or cheating to gain more money than you would honestly get if you haven’t cheated in the first place. The author experimented on why individuals cheat, and expanded it to why groups cheat and then to “which country cheats the most”. In addition to looking for the ""why"". he also looked for how as a society we can decrease the amount of cheating we do. I recommend to some of my friends, family because it's very interesting"

I've got four of his titles on my List, but I haven't actually read anything by him yet. We'll see.***Ariely covers his research into cheating and lying, as well as the research of others in the field. As I noted in my update, House is right: everybody lies. The good news is that most people lie and cheat at a low level, just a little, not so much to destroy our vision of ourselves as good people. We're more likely to cheat when we know we can get away with it, and when people like us are cheating too. We're less likely to cheat when it would be taking advantage of a specific blind person, or when it would mean overt and obvious action.For people interested in improving the way their business or organization works (education and banking are mentioned, the Wall Street collapse is considered) there is some good advice about ways to decrease the incentives and remind people that we want to be good. Interesting stuff. I'm fascinated by the idea that we're none of us as good as we'd like to believe, but most of us aren't really that bad, either. Philosophically, I'm particularly drawn to the idea that secular resets can serve the same purpose as religious confession, allowing us to start over with a clean conscience. I wish there had been a larger section devoted to this idea. Ah, well, maybe the next book.Library copy"
243,0062183591,http://goodreads.com/user/show/40688856-paul-froehlich,5,"How much do we cheat, and what circumstances make us more or less likely to do so? This book is about the psychology of dishonesty. The author is Dan Ariely, a professor of psychology at Duke, who describes his research and that of his colleagues. His previous book, Predictably Irrational (2008) detailed consistent findings that most people cheat just a little when they aren’t held accountable and have plausible deniability. His thesis in The Honest Truth about Dishonesty is that our behavior is driven by conflicting motivations: our desire to see ourselves as honest, honorable people, and our desire to benefit from cheating. The way to get the benefits without ruining our self-image is by cheating a little bit, an amount we can rationalize with our “amazing cognitive flexibility.” To reduce cheating requires reducing our ability to rationalize our actions, while factors that increase our ability to justify our cheating increase dishonesty.Ariely’s experiments suggest what conditions influence how dishonest we are. In most of his experiments, participants were paid small amounts for solving simple matrix exercises. When they could cheat and get away with it, participants claimed to have solved 50 percent more matches than the control group who couldn’t cheat. This increase was not due to a few individuals who claimed high numbers, but from lots of people who cheated a little.As the amount of money rose, the amount of cheating remained the same as at lower amounts, and cheating declined slightly at the highest amount of $10 per correct answer. This result suggests that cheating isn’t simply a result of cost-benefit analysis; otherwise the amount of cheating would rise with the reward. Ariely explains that at $10 a question, it would be harder for the average person to cheat and still feel he or she has integrity.  Moral reminders lead to less cheating. Half the subjects on the matrix test were asked recall as many of the Ten Commandments as they could before doing the task, while the other half were asked to recall ten books they had read. In the latter group, cheating was at the usual level, widespread but moderate. The group that recalled the Ten Commandments committed no cheating at all. A group of atheists asked to swear on the Bible before the matrix task likewise did not cheat. Conflicts of interest exist in many areas of life, and influence behavior more than we realize. The research indicates that people with conflicts of interest are more likely to make decisions in their own self-interest at other people’s expense, while still considering themselves honorable. Sunshine and disclosure of conflicts do not work to benefit clients of conflicted professionals, and can make matters worse, resulting in worse advice. Our reasoning ability gets tired or depleted over a long day of resisting temptations and doing the right things; that’s why it’s at night that people fall off their diets. Ariely’s research found that the more depleting the task completed before doing the matrix test, the higher the cheating rate on the test. In one test, depleted subjects were paid almost 200 percent more due to cheating than non-depleted subjects who cheated much less. One incident of cheating can pave the way for more. An Ariely experiment found that subjects who had a financial incentive to cheat did so more frequently the longer the experiment lasted, which reinforces the notion that people who cheat a little may eventually give up resisting it and go all in.Creative individuals are more likely to cheat than less creative people, especially in more ambiguous situations. They were also better at justifying themselves; designers are more morally flexible than accountants. Creative minds help “us to develop original paths around rules” in a self-serving way. Unlike creativity, intelligence does not correlate with dishonesty.Revenge is a powerful justification for dishonesty. Participants in an experiment were far more likely to keep extra money paid them when the payer was a bit discourteous. Apparently it’s much easier to justify stealing the overpayment to someone who annoys us than from someone who doesn’t. Dishonesty can be contagious. Ariely found that participants cheated twice as much as usual after they had witnessed someone else cheating with impunity. When the open cheater was from a rival university than the other participants, however, their cheating dropped to solving 9 problems, instead of 15 when the open cheater was not wearing the rival’s shirt. When the cheater is seen as part of our social group, then we identify with him and feel that cheating is more acceptable, but when the cheater is an outsider, we become more ethical to distance ourselves from that immoral person and his out-group. These studies demonstrate “how crucial other people are in defining acceptable boundaries for our own behavior.”Collaboration leads to more cheating due to our altruistic tendencies. Participants cheated more on the matrix test under conditions where cheating was enabled and they worked with a teammate who shared in the reward than when they worked alone. When participants were watching each other, however, cheating was eliminated, even though they could otherwise cheat.I noticed one apparent conflict in his findings. On the one hand, he found that introducing some possibility of being detected did not reduce cheating. On the other hand, he found that when a partner was watching, subjects were less likely to cheat, even though the partners were not supervisors. It seems more research should be done on whether dishonesty is deterred by an increased perceived risk of detection.What works to help people behave more honestly? Ariely’s suggestions are based upon his findings. Moral reminders are useful in situations that tempt. To address the weakness that comes from depletion, it makes sense to periodically succumb to temptation - “rational self-indulgence” - so as not to deplete one’s will power. Avoid the slippery slope by policing ourselves in rationalizing one cheat, since one dishonest act may lead to a what-the-hell attitude. Reduce cheating that comes from group work by having independent rating of the group’s performance. On the individual level, once we understand what factors lead us astray, we can avoid them to better control our behavior. This easy-to-read book is most enlightening about human nature. Highly recommended. ###"

Often I heed those warnings or try to find the book in the library.However, I was so interested in the Wall Street Journal article which discussed this book from a few month ago, that I went ahead and took the leap. After all, I think I am an honest person. And I (think I) always strive to be more so - and especially to be a proper role model for my family.This book contains much more than the sound bites you may have heard about a study about some college students getting paid to tell how many answers they said they got right on some silly math test and determining that most people cheat, but only a little, only enough to convince themselves that they are still honorable people. The author discusses study after study which express variations on the theme of honesty in many situations. I appreciated how thorough he was.One complaint: his discussion on the societal effects of dishonesty was somewhat more superficial than it should have been.I think most of us want more than just to be known as honest, we want to fully believe ourselves to be honest. This book reminds us how we often delude ourselves and gives suggestions on how to help ourselves be that person we want to be.Highly recommended."
245,0062183591,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5808354-joshua-guest,4,"Ariely's style doesn't vary much across his non-fiction books. He makes some general hypotheses about human behavior, he briefly describes experiments conducted by him and his colleagues to test them, and then he adds a paragraph that (like clockwork) begins with, ""This result suggests... [some possible conclusion about human behavior in general]."" I always enjoy Professor Ariely's books because he does a good job of connecting the scientific takeaways to pop culture references, Shakespeare, poetry, current events and religious texts. I also admire Ariely's restraint in not overstating the implications of his research. As I said earlier, he carefully prefaces the takeaways by saying ""This result suggests"" as opposed to saying, ""This conclusively proves..."".I have argued with professors about the perils of allowing to students to grade their own work, even when they have previously signed a code of ethics. I usually cite Plato saying how men are not good judges of themselves. This easy-to-read volume really provides great evidence to strengthen my argument in such a conversation. We see the dangers of being dishonest ""just this once"", conflicts of interest, being tempted while tired or hungry, altruistic dishonesty, and watching others act dishonestly. We see some of the virtues of pledges, signatures, moral reminders and supervision."
246,0062183591,http://goodreads.com/user/show/15406725-mike-o-connell,5,"After reading Ariely's first book, Predictably Irrational, I was looking forward to this one. It does not disappoint.Airely is one of the nation’s top academics in the field of behavioral economics; he has taught and MIT and currently teaches at Duke. Sounds like what would make for boring reading, but in these books, designed for a wider audience, Airely brings humor, wit and fascinating overviews of experiments about dishonesty.Some captivating examples…-We are less likely to cheat if we sign a honor pledge or are read something with moral overtones like the ten commandments.-We will cheat more if we receive rude or poor service. As in the experiment where subjects were offered $5 to take a survey, but intentionally given $9. In the control condition just less than 50% of participants returned the extra cash. In the experimental condition, where the person administering the survey in a coffee shop rudely took a short social phone call with no apology in the middle of administering the survey, only 17% of people returned the extra money.These examples are less interesting out of context, but make for an interesting narrative in the course of the book. The audiobook, which I am listening to, is particularly well done."
247,0062183591,http://goodreads.com/user/show/548006-eric,5,"Another great book from Dan Ariely on how we do - or do not - act in accordance to logic and rationality. All of his books, which center on behavioral neurology and specifically the ""nonsensical"" or irrational angles of it, have been fast enjoyable reads for me and this was no exception. He describes a number of experiments and methods - namely the ""more dots on the right or left"" and ""how many matrixes did you fill out"" - without dragging you into the muck of scientific methodology, and the applies them to various conditions (the ""direct supervision"" condition, the ""can cheat/shredder"" condition, the ""altruistic cheating"" condition, etc) and then compares the results. While I'm sure that they didn't come out as actual whole numbers - another example of the scientific dilution - and the results are still interesting. NOT a great read if you are highly scientific and want to know hard numbers, but a fantastic armchair psychology / behavioral studies book. It dovetailed great with my recent reading of ""Willpower"" (Ariely investigates ""depletion"" as a factor in cheating) as well as the fact I'm taking Law and Ethics this semester :-) "
248,0062183591,http://goodreads.com/user/show/13052671-ved-gupta,4,"Dan Ariely, author of Predictably Irrational has returned with his original thinking and results of his experiments for educating people about the reasoning and rational that goes behind dishonesty (which is no different than cheating). Dan is completely against the SMORC (Simple Model of Rational Crime) and proves this model wrong initially with the help of an experiment and many other times in his book.The best thing about this book is that you will find yourself a part of this book many times and you will relate to it closely. If you think you have never cheated and you are an honest person, this book will surely show you a mirror. I really appreciated the various experimental set ups that were used by Dan to test various hypothesis and results were not only intuitive but also conclusive. Dan has made this book very interesting with a little bit of humor and research results and the way he relates with his readers. Policy makers should read such kind of research and take a clue that only harsher punishment cannot control crime and frauds in society and a completely new approach is the demand of time"
249,0062183591,http://goodreads.com/user/show/32360-john,4,"Didn't read it, listened to it on an audio book that included several interviews after the book ended. I found those interviews almost as good as the book itself. I'm not 100% convinced of the research in the book (because I'm not clear how many test samples and big the sample size for some of the assumptions in the book), but the test that were run seemed to be well-structured and some consideration of bias is considered. Trusting the findings, I did like hearing about how we fool ourselves into believing things, that the best deception is one we've pulled on ourselves. With several chapters focused on academics and the blindness of both professor and student, this is an important book for universities to read and understand the modern dynamics of cheating in the classroom. Ariely also orders papers from an academic paper mill to see if professors would be able to spot them and his experience shows that profs have nothing to fear from these mills but and should focus more attention on the overall atmosphere of the school."

His relaxed and informal writing style combined with some really cool experiments makes for an easy and enlightening read. I particularly like how he points out that we can't necessarily fix ourselves (or others) outright but we can make things better by being aware of our issues. Through multiple versions of the ""matrix test"", Dan shows all the ways people can cheat and what can make that cheating more or less likely. My favorite was that an actor portraying a UPitt student blatantly cheating resulted in all the CMU students cheating much less. Each chapter covers a different twist on cheating, and each has its own interesting learnings, but there isn't a build-up to a climatic end or some final nugget of truth to make everything/everyone better. I can't say that I leave the book feeling rosy about our society's future with respect to honest, and I'm not sure I'll be trusting too many golfers in the future. "

And little did I know how this small act can lead to this whole topic of dishonesty!I enjoyed the book overall! It's easy to follow with interesting research and experiments on dishonesty. It also made me reflect my own behaviour. It made me imagine the possible things that are probably happening with high rank politicians and bankers.Ariely was hilarious in his writing, particularly the end part that made me chuckle a few times. The reason I gave it a 3 star is because I felt it was draggy somewhere in the middle. It took me a while to finish the book. It just felt like too many experiments altogether! I would enjoy more if there are some illustrations to help me visualise the experiments!Nonetheless, it is a great and important book for everyone to read. It is definitely not a book that condemns you or make you feel guilty, but it gives you a deeper insight and understanding of why we do what we do! It's so much more than just cost-benefit analysis!"
252,0062183591,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3187548-holly-cline,4,"I won this through first reads and really enjoyed it. Sure, it shows how all people will lie, cheat & steal when given the opportunity. But don't we sort of know this already even if we don't want to admit it? That's part of what's so fun about the research Dan Ariely does. As you read along, you realize, yes I believe all of this to be true. People are very dishonest. I totally see it! Is this depressing? I don't think so. As long as you're aware of what everyone is capable of, it's just a part of human nature. It's true that none of us knows exactly what we're capable of, for good OR bad, until we're placed in the situation. The real success of this book is how well Dan Ariely is able to speak with a voice that is perfectly suited to be read by non-academics. He is charming and relatable with words. He has a professor's humor, which is to say he'll never do stand up, but he can make you chuckle. I'd definitely read another book that he's written."

I was delightfully surprised that it wasn't farfetched or outlandish. I actually enjoyed this book more than any of his other books. There are plenty of tidbits here that a reader can try to use or experiment with. I liked the revelations towards the end, which made me more aware of how dishonesty can easily creep up on you. I didn't like the same experiment mentioned over and over again about the matrices (uggh!). I will try the technique of putting a pair of ""eyes"" on the tin can when charging coffee at the break room. It's hilarious that when given a chance a person would try to cheat if the situation makes it easy for them and if there is a small chance of getting caught. Worthy read. "
254,0062183591,http://goodreads.com/user/show/12702052-muhammad-arrabi,5,"Amazing book - very well documtned with most interesting psychological research. It's more concise and to the point than Dan's 2 earlier books.The book focuses on ""small-amount cheating"" type of behavior, what the author calls ""fudge-factor"". This is where people deviate from the accurate truth, but believe internally that they are honest. The book does not look at real criminals psychology - people who know they are stealing, and they do it anyways.As with most books written by University Professors, it's based mostly on ""lab-type"" experiments, measuring short-term reaction of people put in a short-term conditions. You cannot just take these results and apply them to business, because you don't know their long-term effect. This does not subtract from the importance of this book. This just means that we need a similar book but written by a business-history type of guy."

If you are into expanding your knowledge of human nature, this book is a must read. If you are wanting to improve yourself as a person, well, you get the idea.The one point I kept wanting to argue was with their assumption of moral depletion. The claim is that the more we resist temptation and/or do a good deed, the weaker our willpower becomes later in the day. For example, people who purchased organic food were more prone to cheat on a test (for financial gain). I'm sure there is a good amount of merit to their exhausted morality view, but, I might have offered up one further perspective. The person who purchased organic food may have thought, ""I'm a good boy, so now I deserve a reward."" I imagine there are times of moral depletion, but I'd wager there are also times of self justified compensation too."

Somewhere it was always there at the back of my mind that we justify our dishonesty to ourselves...i am talking about small lies here...but this book helped me think about it more deeply. Dan talks about some very interesting and powerful ideas to curb dishonesty through a better understanding of human psychology. This was the most interesting part.I wish he could add some pictures of his experiments because similar experiments were conducted for various concepts and after a while I wondered if most of the conclusions in the book were through the experiments, the reader could benefit a little with some more stats about the experiments, limitations of the experiment and a few pictures would have been great.Overall, it is a must read if you want to understand yourself better and if you want to run your business more honestly."
257,0062183591,http://goodreads.com/user/show/54467877-baris-balcioglu,3,"I was expecting more. There is one catch though. The author puts it nicely. He conducts social experiments and then presents his results in his seminars and the audience appears to be not surprised when they hear about the outcome. They look at him with the a look of ""We all knew that the result would be like this"". This is another proof of how we tend to cheat ourselves so easily. We hear something and in the blink of an eye we claim ownership. Maybe I also fell into the same trap in the beginning but later on I tried guessing the outcomes sometimes getting it right sometimes wrong. The problem is though the experiments conducted are still like our artificial engineering models. Life actually is more complex and these studies may fail to grasp it and are mostly fun to play with academically. The ending with religion was also a turn off."

I really liked reading about all those social experiments conducted and was fascinated by the number of academics involved it proving that aspects of the human nature itself such as creativity, conscience and social conformity are factors that attribute to dishonesty. It also offers insight into certain facts and events of recent history that spurred my interest and encouraged me to learn more.However, I have to admit that I was not fully committed to reading this novel. It felt like all those conclusions could not be based on solid results (they were social experiments after all). The variations of the experiments ware quite repetitive and after a while stopped holding my interest."

What he finds is that cheating is rampant and bounded; or to put it another way, we all cheat a little bit. Ariely then pushes the limits of that, to figure out under what conditions we are more or less likely to cheat, and further to see if there are particular individuals who are particularly prone to lying or cheating. The book is funny, easy to read, and extremely relevant to anyone interested in morality, law, finance, religion, administration, politics, or any other profession in which people find themselves tempted to bend the rules once in awhile."
260,0062183591,http://goodreads.com/user/show/13904904-rebekah,4,"Insightful. It's always helpful when the mind behind academic research see fit to write colloquially about their findings so that the general public can understand its meaning. Surprisingly, our tendency to be dishonest isn't increased by what we think it might be, and often isn't decreased by what we think it might be. I find studies on human nature very interesting, we're very complex creatures that operate beyond the instinct and cost vs benefit framework of the animal world at large. Maybe prepare yourself to be a little disheartened at how easy it is for humanity to engage in deception and still think of themselves as 'good people' but the first step to fixing a problem is acknowledging. And even if you don't give a damn, it's still pretty interesting. "

Sadly but also honestly this book does not deserve 5-stars. I would have enjoyed more analysis of the data that he presented. But I enjoyed it like a five star book. Somehow he's adorable. I don't know why and I don't think that's a normal reaction to this book lol. Finally I wonder what my fudge factor would be in the various matrices tests. And I wonder if I would overestimate my intelligence like so many of his subjects did when they had the answer key right below their work, lol. I'd really like to know!

And when the story portrays us in a more glowing and positive light, so much the better.” Err, I did like reading it, but most of the experiments were kinda obvious and sometimes a bit boring.

I think about it a lot and I suspect it will be even more useful than the author's previous two books, but it doesn't build any real model of _how_ we lie, or _why_, other than destroying the ""factor in the likelihood of getting caught and the severity of punishment"" model. I have to admit I was interested in this book as soon as I heard about it; I like thinking about the nature of honesty and how it's an absolutely fundamental element of civilization. I don't think his experiments support all of his conclusions and he makes assumptions about the model of why people cheat that he doesn't test, but overall the experiments are interesting and revealing.The focus of this book is to find factors that influence how much people cheat and figure out how much they influence our behavior. The factors that turn out to make a difference include whether we're reminded of our moral values beforehand, whether we have conflicts of interest, and whether other people around us are cheating. You might be surprised at how much, or how little, influence some things have over our decisions and how unaware we may be over some of the factors.The author has some wry humor that I appreciate, and I still like that he describes his experiments in enough detail that you can form your own idea of how well they do or don't support the conclusions he reaches. Each description, like the rest of his writing, is very readable."

I liked the writing style that the author used because it was very personal and humorous while still being educationa It is mostly about human immorality such as cheating and lying.Many of us never realize or think hard about how many small chances to cheat or temptations we face every day. The author tells us why we cheat, how likely we are to cheat, and how human we all are when it comes to being dishonest. That being said, it makes the reader realize how immoral he is and ways to become more moral. Even though it is an extremely hard decision when you want to be a good person and to benefit as much as possible (even if others don't benefit). You can't have both worlds, so you cheat a little or you justify your cheating some way or another. This book does include infidelity, but not as the main type of cheating. The type of cheating involved in this book is mostly white collar crimes like “fudging” numbers, or “petty” crimes like taking money, or cheating to gain more money than you would honestly get if you haven’t cheated in the first place. The author experimented on why individuals cheat, and expanded it to why groups cheat and then to “which country cheats the most”. In addition to looking for the ""why"". he also looked for how as a society we can decrease the amount of cheating we do. I recommend to some of my friends, family because it's very interesting"

I've got four of his titles on my List, but I haven't actually read anything by him yet. We'll see.***Ariely covers his research into cheating and lying, as well as the research of others in the field. As I noted in my update, House is right: everybody lies. The good news is that most people lie and cheat at a low level, just a little, not so much to destroy our vision of ourselves as good people. We're more likely to cheat when we know we can get away with it, and when people like us are cheating too. We're less likely to cheat when it would be taking advantage of a specific blind person, or when it would mean overt and obvious action.For people interested in improving the way their business or organization works (education and banking are mentioned, the Wall Street collapse is considered) there is some good advice about ways to decrease the incentives and remind people that we want to be good. Interesting stuff. I'm fascinated by the idea that we're none of us as good as we'd like to believe, but most of us aren't really that bad, either. Philosophically, I'm particularly drawn to the idea that secular resets can serve the same purpose as religious confession, allowing us to start over with a clean conscience. I wish there had been a larger section devoted to this idea. Ah, well, maybe the next book.Library copy"
273,0062183591,http://goodreads.com/user/show/40688856-paul-froehlich,5,"How much do we cheat, and what circumstances make us more or less likely to do so? This book is about the psychology of dishonesty. The author is Dan Ariely, a professor of psychology at Duke, who describes his research and that of his colleagues. His previous book, Predictably Irrational (2008) detailed consistent findings that most people cheat just a little when they aren’t held accountable and have plausible deniability. His thesis in The Honest Truth about Dishonesty is that our behavior is driven by conflicting motivations: our desire to see ourselves as honest, honorable people, and our desire to benefit from cheating. The way to get the benefits without ruining our self-image is by cheating a little bit, an amount we can rationalize with our “amazing cognitive flexibility.” To reduce cheating requires reducing our ability to rationalize our actions, while factors that increase our ability to justify our cheating increase dishonesty.Ariely’s experiments suggest what conditions influence how dishonest we are. In most of his experiments, participants were paid small amounts for solving simple matrix exercises. When they could cheat and get away with it, participants claimed to have solved 50 percent more matches than the control group who couldn’t cheat. This increase was not due to a few individuals who claimed high numbers, but from lots of people who cheated a little.As the amount of money rose, the amount of cheating remained the same as at lower amounts, and cheating declined slightly at the highest amount of $10 per correct answer. This result suggests that cheating isn’t simply a result of cost-benefit analysis; otherwise the amount of cheating would rise with the reward. Ariely explains that at $10 a question, it would be harder for the average person to cheat and still feel he or she has integrity.  Moral reminders lead to less cheating. Half the subjects on the matrix test were asked recall as many of the Ten Commandments as they could before doing the task, while the other half were asked to recall ten books they had read. In the latter group, cheating was at the usual level, widespread but moderate. The group that recalled the Ten Commandments committed no cheating at all. A group of atheists asked to swear on the Bible before the matrix task likewise did not cheat. Conflicts of interest exist in many areas of life, and influence behavior more than we realize. The research indicates that people with conflicts of interest are more likely to make decisions in their own self-interest at other people’s expense, while still considering themselves honorable. Sunshine and disclosure of conflicts do not work to benefit clients of conflicted professionals, and can make matters worse, resulting in worse advice. Our reasoning ability gets tired or depleted over a long day of resisting temptations and doing the right things; that’s why it’s at night that people fall off their diets. Ariely’s research found that the more depleting the task completed before doing the matrix test, the higher the cheating rate on the test. In one test, depleted subjects were paid almost 200 percent more due to cheating than non-depleted subjects who cheated much less. One incident of cheating can pave the way for more. An Ariely experiment found that subjects who had a financial incentive to cheat did so more frequently the longer the experiment lasted, which reinforces the notion that people who cheat a little may eventually give up resisting it and go all in.Creative individuals are more likely to cheat than less creative people, especially in more ambiguous situations. They were also better at justifying themselves; designers are more morally flexible than accountants. Creative minds help “us to develop original paths around rules” in a self-serving way. Unlike creativity, intelligence does not correlate with dishonesty.Revenge is a powerful justification for dishonesty. Participants in an experiment were far more likely to keep extra money paid them when the payer was a bit discourteous. Apparently it’s much easier to justify stealing the overpayment to someone who annoys us than from someone who doesn’t. Dishonesty can be contagious. Ariely found that participants cheated twice as much as usual after they had witnessed someone else cheating with impunity. When the open cheater was from a rival university than the other participants, however, their cheating dropped to solving 9 problems, instead of 15 when the open cheater was not wearing the rival’s shirt. When the cheater is seen as part of our social group, then we identify with him and feel that cheating is more acceptable, but when the cheater is an outsider, we become more ethical to distance ourselves from that immoral person and his out-group. These studies demonstrate “how crucial other people are in defining acceptable boundaries for our own behavior.”Collaboration leads to more cheating due to our altruistic tendencies. Participants cheated more on the matrix test under conditions where cheating was enabled and they worked with a teammate who shared in the reward than when they worked alone. When participants were watching each other, however, cheating was eliminated, even though they could otherwise cheat.I noticed one apparent conflict in his findings. On the one hand, he found that introducing some possibility of being detected did not reduce cheating. On the other hand, he found that when a partner was watching, subjects were less likely to cheat, even though the partners were not supervisors. It seems more research should be done on whether dishonesty is deterred by an increased perceived risk of detection.What works to help people behave more honestly? Ariely’s suggestions are based upon his findings. Moral reminders are useful in situations that tempt. To address the weakness that comes from depletion, it makes sense to periodically succumb to temptation - “rational self-indulgence” - so as not to deplete one’s will power. Avoid the slippery slope by policing ourselves in rationalizing one cheat, since one dishonest act may lead to a what-the-hell attitude. Reduce cheating that comes from group work by having independent rating of the group’s performance. On the individual level, once we understand what factors lead us astray, we can avoid them to better control our behavior. This easy-to-read book is most enlightening about human nature. Highly recommended. ###"

Often I heed those warnings or try to find the book in the library.However, I was so interested in the Wall Street Journal article which discussed this book from a few month ago, that I went ahead and took the leap. After all, I think I am an honest person. And I (think I) always strive to be more so - and especially to be a proper role model for my family.This book contains much more than the sound bites you may have heard about a study about some college students getting paid to tell how many answers they said they got right on some silly math test and determining that most people cheat, but only a little, only enough to convince themselves that they are still honorable people. The author discusses study after study which express variations on the theme of honesty in many situations. I appreciated how thorough he was.One complaint: his discussion on the societal effects of dishonesty was somewhat more superficial than it should have been.I think most of us want more than just to be known as honest, we want to fully believe ourselves to be honest. This book reminds us how we often delude ourselves and gives suggestions on how to help ourselves be that person we want to be.Highly recommended."
275,0062183591,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5808354-joshua-guest,4,"Ariely's style doesn't vary much across his non-fiction books. He makes some general hypotheses about human behavior, he briefly describes experiments conducted by him and his colleagues to test them, and then he adds a paragraph that (like clockwork) begins with, ""This result suggests... [some possible conclusion about human behavior in general]."" I always enjoy Professor Ariely's books because he does a good job of connecting the scientific takeaways to pop culture references, Shakespeare, poetry, current events and religious texts. I also admire Ariely's restraint in not overstating the implications of his research. As I said earlier, he carefully prefaces the takeaways by saying ""This result suggests"" as opposed to saying, ""This conclusively proves..."".I have argued with professors about the perils of allowing to students to grade their own work, even when they have previously signed a code of ethics. I usually cite Plato saying how men are not good judges of themselves. This easy-to-read volume really provides great evidence to strengthen my argument in such a conversation. We see the dangers of being dishonest ""just this once"", conflicts of interest, being tempted while tired or hungry, altruistic dishonesty, and watching others act dishonestly. We see some of the virtues of pledges, signatures, moral reminders and supervision."
276,0062183591,http://goodreads.com/user/show/15406725-mike-o-connell,5,"After reading Ariely's first book, Predictably Irrational, I was looking forward to this one. It does not disappoint.Airely is one of the nation’s top academics in the field of behavioral economics; he has taught and MIT and currently teaches at Duke. Sounds like what would make for boring reading, but in these books, designed for a wider audience, Airely brings humor, wit and fascinating overviews of experiments about dishonesty.Some captivating examples…-We are less likely to cheat if we sign a honor pledge or are read something with moral overtones like the ten commandments.-We will cheat more if we receive rude or poor service. As in the experiment where subjects were offered $5 to take a survey, but intentionally given $9. In the control condition just less than 50% of participants returned the extra cash. In the experimental condition, where the person administering the survey in a coffee shop rudely took a short social phone call with no apology in the middle of administering the survey, only 17% of people returned the extra money.These examples are less interesting out of context, but make for an interesting narrative in the course of the book. The audiobook, which I am listening to, is particularly well done."
277,0062183591,http://goodreads.com/user/show/548006-eric,5,"Another great book from Dan Ariely on how we do - or do not - act in accordance to logic and rationality. All of his books, which center on behavioral neurology and specifically the ""nonsensical"" or irrational angles of it, have been fast enjoyable reads for me and this was no exception. He describes a number of experiments and methods - namely the ""more dots on the right or left"" and ""how many matrixes did you fill out"" - without dragging you into the muck of scientific methodology, and the applies them to various conditions (the ""direct supervision"" condition, the ""can cheat/shredder"" condition, the ""altruistic cheating"" condition, etc) and then compares the results. While I'm sure that they didn't come out as actual whole numbers - another example of the scientific dilution - and the results are still interesting. NOT a great read if you are highly scientific and want to know hard numbers, but a fantastic armchair psychology / behavioral studies book. It dovetailed great with my recent reading of ""Willpower"" (Ariely investigates ""depletion"" as a factor in cheating) as well as the fact I'm taking Law and Ethics this semester :-) "
278,0062183591,http://goodreads.com/user/show/13052671-ved-gupta,4,"Dan Ariely, author of Predictably Irrational has returned with his original thinking and results of his experiments for educating people about the reasoning and rational that goes behind dishonesty (which is no different than cheating). Dan is completely against the SMORC (Simple Model of Rational Crime) and proves this model wrong initially with the help of an experiment and many other times in his book.The best thing about this book is that you will find yourself a part of this book many times and you will relate to it closely. If you think you have never cheated and you are an honest person, this book will surely show you a mirror. I really appreciated the various experimental set ups that were used by Dan to test various hypothesis and results were not only intuitive but also conclusive. Dan has made this book very interesting with a little bit of humor and research results and the way he relates with his readers. Policy makers should read such kind of research and take a clue that only harsher punishment cannot control crime and frauds in society and a completely new approach is the demand of time"
279,0062183591,http://goodreads.com/user/show/32360-john,4,"Didn't read it, listened to it on an audio book that included several interviews after the book ended. I found those interviews almost as good as the book itself. I'm not 100% convinced of the research in the book (because I'm not clear how many test samples and big the sample size for some of the assumptions in the book), but the test that were run seemed to be well-structured and some consideration of bias is considered. Trusting the findings, I did like hearing about how we fool ourselves into believing things, that the best deception is one we've pulled on ourselves. With several chapters focused on academics and the blindness of both professor and student, this is an important book for universities to read and understand the modern dynamics of cheating in the classroom. Ariely also orders papers from an academic paper mill to see if professors would be able to spot them and his experience shows that profs have nothing to fear from these mills but and should focus more attention on the overall atmosphere of the school."
280,0062183591,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5857480-eric-schreiber,4,"I've always enjoyed Dan Ariely's work - first as a regular contributor to NPR's Marketplace, and more recently as an author of multiple books. His relaxed and informal writing style combined with some really cool experiments makes for an easy and enlightening read. I particularly like how he points out that we can't necessarily fix ourselves (or others) outright but we can make things better by being aware of our issues. Through multiple versions of the ""matrix test"", Dan shows all the ways people can cheat and what can make that cheating more or less likely. My favorite was that an actor portraying a UPitt student blatantly cheating resulted in all the CMU students cheating much less. Each chapter covers a different twist on cheating, and each has its own interesting learnings, but there isn't a build-up to a climatic end or some final nugget of truth to make everything/everyone better. I can't say that I leave the book feeling rosy about our society's future with respect to honest, and I'm not sure I'll be trusting too many golfers in the future. "
281,0062183591,http://goodreads.com/user/show/12030315-jacqueline,3,"Everyone has stole a pen before. At least I did, which could have been an 'accident'. And little did I know how this small act can lead to this whole topic of dishonesty!I enjoyed the book overall! It's easy to follow with interesting research and experiments on dishonesty. It also made me reflect my own behaviour. It made me imagine the possible things that are probably happening with high rank politicians and bankers.Ariely was hilarious in his writing, particularly the end part that made me chuckle a few times. The reason I gave it a 3 star is because I felt it was draggy somewhere in the middle. It took me a while to finish the book. It just felt like too many experiments altogether! I would enjoy more if there are some illustrations to help me visualise the experiments!Nonetheless, it is a great and important book for everyone to read. It is definitely not a book that condemns you or make you feel guilty, but it gives you a deeper insight and understanding of why we do what we do! It's so much more than just cost-benefit analysis!"
282,0062183591,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3187548-holly-cline,4,"I won this through first reads and really enjoyed it. Sure, it shows how all people will lie, cheat & steal when given the opportunity. But don't we sort of know this already even if we don't want to admit it? That's part of what's so fun about the research Dan Ariely does. As you read along, you realize, yes I believe all of this to be true. People are very dishonest. I totally see it! Is this depressing? I don't think so. As long as you're aware of what everyone is capable of, it's just a part of human nature. It's true that none of us knows exactly what we're capable of, for good OR bad, until we're placed in the situation. The real success of this book is how well Dan Ariely is able to speak with a voice that is perfectly suited to be read by non-academics. He is charming and relatable with words. He has a professor's humor, which is to say he'll never do stand up, but he can make you chuckle. I'd definitely read another book that he's written."
283,0062183591,http://goodreads.com/user/show/318754-andrienne,4,"I didn't have high hopes about this book since reading an EW article on popular nonfiction books being too wishy washy. I was delightfully surprised that it wasn't farfetched or outlandish. I actually enjoyed this book more than any of his other books. There are plenty of tidbits here that a reader can try to use or experiment with. I liked the revelations towards the end, which made me more aware of how dishonesty can easily creep up on you. I didn't like the same experiment mentioned over and over again about the matrices (uggh!). I will try the technique of putting a pair of ""eyes"" on the tin can when charging coffee at the break room. It's hilarious that when given a chance a person would try to cheat if the situation makes it easy for them and if there is a small chance of getting caught. Worthy read. "
284,0062183591,http://goodreads.com/user/show/12702052-muhammad-arrabi,5,"Amazing book - very well documtned with most interesting psychological research. It's more concise and to the point than Dan's 2 earlier books.The book focuses on ""small-amount cheating"" type of behavior, what the author calls ""fudge-factor"". This is where people deviate from the accurate truth, but believe internally that they are honest. The book does not look at real criminals psychology - people who know they are stealing, and they do it anyways.As with most books written by University Professors, it's based mostly on ""lab-type"" experiments, measuring short-term reaction of people put in a short-term conditions. You cannot just take these results and apply them to business, because you don't know their long-term effect. This does not subtract from the importance of this book. This just means that we need a similar book but written by a business-history type of guy."
285,0062183591,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1998927-james-maxon,5,"Guilty! If you are into behavioral economics, this book is a must read. If you are into expanding your knowledge of human nature, this book is a must read. If you are wanting to improve yourself as a person, well, you get the idea.The one point I kept wanting to argue was with their assumption of moral depletion. The claim is that the more we resist temptation and/or do a good deed, the weaker our willpower becomes later in the day. For example, people who purchased organic food were more prone to cheat on a test (for financial gain). I'm sure there is a good amount of merit to their exhausted morality view, but, I might have offered up one further perspective. The person who purchased organic food may have thought, ""I'm a good boy, so now I deserve a reward."" I imagine there are times of moral depletion, but I'd wager there are also times of self justified compensation too."
286,0062183591,http://goodreads.com/user/show/151890-khyati-gupta-babbar,4,"The book was quite an eye opener for me. Somewhere it was always there at the back of my mind that we justify our dishonesty to ourselves...i am talking about small lies here...but this book helped me think about it more deeply. Dan talks about some very interesting and powerful ideas to curb dishonesty through a better understanding of human psychology. This was the most interesting part.I wish he could add some pictures of his experiments because similar experiments were conducted for various concepts and after a while I wondered if most of the conclusions in the book were through the experiments, the reader could benefit a little with some more stats about the experiments, limitations of the experiment and a few pictures would have been great.Overall, it is a must read if you want to understand yourself better and if you want to run your business more honestly."
287,0062183591,http://goodreads.com/user/show/54467877-baris-balcioglu,3,"I was expecting more. There is one catch though. The author puts it nicely. He conducts social experiments and then presents his results in his seminars and the audience appears to be not surprised when they hear about the outcome. They look at him with the a look of ""We all knew that the result would be like this"". This is another proof of how we tend to cheat ourselves so easily. We hear something and in the blink of an eye we claim ownership. Maybe I also fell into the same trap in the beginning but later on I tried guessing the outcomes sometimes getting it right sometimes wrong. The problem is though the experiments conducted are still like our artificial engineering models. Life actually is more complex and these studies may fail to grasp it and are mostly fun to play with academically. The ending with religion was also a turn off."
288,0062183591,http://goodreads.com/user/show/70805244-bookellenic,3,"I enjoyed this book, but it took me quite a bit of time to finish it because it throws a lot on information your way. I really liked reading about all those social experiments conducted and was fascinated by the number of academics involved it proving that aspects of the human nature itself such as creativity, conscience and social conformity are factors that attribute to dishonesty. It also offers insight into certain facts and events of recent history that spurred my interest and encouraged me to learn more.However, I have to admit that I was not fully committed to reading this novel. It felt like all those conclusions could not be based on solid results (they were social experiments after all). The variations of the experiments ware quite repetitive and after a while stopped holding my interest."
289,0062183591,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6909775-mike-edwards,5,"This book looks at a number of studies, mostly by Ariely himself, all of which examine the circumstances under which people lie and cheat. What he finds is that cheating is rampant and bounded; or to put it another way, we all cheat a little bit. Ariely then pushes the limits of that, to figure out under what conditions we are more or less likely to cheat, and further to see if there are particular individuals who are particularly prone to lying or cheating. The book is funny, easy to read, and extremely relevant to anyone interested in morality, law, finance, religion, administration, politics, or any other profession in which people find themselves tempted to bend the rules once in awhile."
290,0062183591,http://goodreads.com/user/show/13904904-rebekah,4,"Insightful. It's always helpful when the mind behind academic research see fit to write colloquially about their findings so that the general public can understand its meaning. Surprisingly, our tendency to be dishonest isn't increased by what we think it might be, and often isn't decreased by what we think it might be. I find studies on human nature very interesting, we're very complex creatures that operate beyond the instinct and cost vs benefit framework of the animal world at large. Maybe prepare yourself to be a little disheartened at how easy it is for humanity to engage in deception and still think of themselves as 'good people' but the first step to fixing a problem is acknowledging. And even if you don't give a damn, it's still pretty interesting. "
291,0062183591,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4940999-ariel,4,"I honestly enjoy Dan Ariely, his endless series of matrices tests, and his rigorous enjoyment of rather repetitive but necessary studies. Sadly but also honestly this book does not deserve 5-stars. I would have enjoyed more analysis of the data that he presented. But I enjoyed it like a five star book. Somehow he's adorable. I don't know why and I don't think that's a normal reaction to this book lol. Finally I wonder what my fudge factor would be in the various matrices tests. And I wonder if I would overestimate my intelligence like so many of his subjects did when they had the answer key right below their work, lol. I'd really like to know! But now that I know the secret an all new test would need to be designed in order to find out. Sad!"
292,0062183591,http://goodreads.com/user/show/51535999-lotje-mak,3," “We all want explanations for why we behave as we do and for the ways the world around us functions. Even when our feeble explanations have little to do with reality. We’re storytelling creatures by nature, and we tell ourselves story after story until we come up with an explanation that we like and that sounds reasonable enough to believe. And when the story portrays us in a more glowing and positive light, so much the better.” Err, I did like reading it, but most of the experiments were kinda obvious and sometimes a bit boring. However, some things I read were very surprising and got me really thinking, so that's nice. (3.5)"
293,0062183591,http://goodreads.com/user/show/522647-kathy,3,I picked this as our monthly book club selection because I wanted to share my fascination with the irrationality that is human behavior. I think everyone enjoyed t. We had a good discussion on how much we would cheat and when. One of our members is in the medical device business so she had some interesting insight into the process of selling to doctors which was a bit different than Ariely's report of big pharma sales to medical professionals.I enjoyed this but a lot of the material was already familiar to me because I took an online course from Ariely and have read a lot of his work. 
294,0062183591,http://goodreads.com/user/show/69317606-micke-goteman,5,"A fascinating book with great insights and thoughts about human behavior and especially dishonestly. Ariely does a fantastic job and everything he talks about is well-researched. I wish we were able to have discourse like this in our society today that was based on data and genuine curiosity about what makes us tick, and what we could do about it. I feel like something happened when you are able to look at that without judgement or unassailable assumptions. This book offers a great example of how to start that conversation."
295,0062183591,http://goodreads.com/user/show/709910-g-bor,4,"Great ideas as always, and long-winded explanation as always. Here is the short version:+ we all cheat a little (but not so much that we start feeling like a dishonest person)+ this above does not apply to the psychopaths amongst us ...+ cheating can be increased by environmental influences+ but we can also make some easy adjustments to keep participants honest Does it really take 250 pages to say this?"
296,0062183591,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4765489-matthew,4,"Ariely has a wonderful writing style and makes the reasearch and findings quite interesting. This book about honesty, or a lack thereof, paints an accurate and detailed picture of human nature. I think what's most on point are his findings relative to our ability to justify and rationalize our own cheating and shortcuts. "

This may not be the case in reality, perhaps to condense the information into a book some things were left out. But, the impression I got was that the writer was trying to prove a predetermined point rather than exploring all possibilities on the road to a conclusion."
