0,1847240089,http://goodreads.com/user/show/614650-kent,3,"Grabbed this on sale at Borders, and it was worth the discount price. Written by a Brit, it does a good job of highlighting the many mathematical ideas that each of us has probably been exposed over the years, while adding some very interesting history into the mathematicians studying the problem.Each Idea is exactly four pages long, so they are given equal stature and rank. Some are more obvious than others. Some Ideas are easy, some incredibly advanced. I enjoyed the time line for each Idea.I would retitle the book ""50 Mathematical Ideas You Probably Knew About, but You Don't Really Need to Get By in Real Life."" Sending it to the family mathematician Prof. T. Watterson."
1,1847240089,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3023041-carlex,5,An excellent tool to remember mathematical concepts and to know new ones.
2,1847240089,http://goodreads.com/user/show/909939-brian-sison,2,"This book should really be titled ""An Introduction to 50 Mathematical Ideas..."" Limiting oneself to four pages is very difficult to do even with simple concepts like Zero and fractions. It is downright impossible with broader concepts like Calculus, Game Theory, or Relativity. Even worse is the fact that these broad introductions to complex ideas contain multiple small, but drastic, errors. This book would be fine for a complete math novice who has no intention of ever using these concepts or thinking about them again in the future. For anyone mathematically inclined, I would skip this for any of the multitude of other books out there with a more focused, refined scope."
3,1847240089,http://goodreads.com/user/show/18701430-celia,5,as a math gal this isn't really anything i would put forth for serious math heads...but if you're looking for a book that will introduce a mathophobe to some of the more fascinating mathematical concepts this is the stuff. that's why it got the stars it did.
4,1847240089,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5944462-john-schneider,3,"When my family saw me reading a math book for fun, they thought I was crazy. I think they are crazy for not wanting to learn more about mathematics. Although far from an advanced course on math, this book is fun and informative for the most part. Every so often it covers a math problem that only a mathematician could love, but such quirkiness make the book. Since mathematics covers so many different topics, this book should enable even the most bitter hater of math to find some part of math to love."
5,1847240089,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2176074-alan,3,I learned more about Roman numerals - idea 1 was all about Zero - and how the Romans didn't have nothing.QED has been replaced with a solid square - how disappointing!Many of the other ideas I had already come across but I did find them well explained and I liked the style - neither too heavy nor too trivial.I picked this one for the cover for Summer09 Challenge 30.09 but I thoroughly enjoyed it.
6,1847240089,http://goodreads.com/user/show/24121318-bj-rn-bengtsson,4,"This book contains trivia about mathematics. It contains 50 topics of general interest, and each topic can be read by itself. There is no need to read the book from cover to cover, so it is a great coffee book, or for breakfast reading, etc.Each topic is explained in an easy and relaxed way, requiring no prior mathematical knowledge, which makes it easy to grasp.Anyone with the slightest interest in mathematics would enjoy this book."
7,1847240089,http://goodreads.com/user/show/42669310-jonathan-gnagy,4,Great descriptions of some of very interesting ideas. I read 1 idea a day for 50 days and found all the ideas interesting and explained well enough that I understood (and I learned a bit about their history at times too). A great way to keep the mental juices flowing when not in college or just not taking any serious math.
8,1847240089,http://goodreads.com/user/show/74193679-dustin-east,4,"<3 Math <3If you're interested in math beyond Arithmetic, worth a read or at least a skim of the topics that interest you. Talks a lot more about the history and development of various topics than you'd normally get even in most Undergraduate level courses."
9,1847240089,http://goodreads.com/user/show/13777179-zhelana,2,"While some of the concepts in this book were explained at a level that I could understand them, many more were not. I found myself confused more often than not. It seemed like it could be some interesting information, but it was not written to a beginner level, which is what I would expect from a book by this title. "
10,1847240089,http://goodreads.com/user/show/19054809-sarah,4,Good clear summary of the ideas. Gets a bit confusing when you reach the last few which are the most complicated ones but not surprising given each idea is given four pages.
11,1847240089,http://goodreads.com/user/show/42662691-sadia-mansoor,4," RECOMMEND TO ALL MATHS RELATED STUDENTS & TEACHERS  Having problems in solving that mathematical formula? Do you feel the need to revise your mathematical equations again? Do you face problems with remembering definitions & find no way to look for? Are you tired of mixing all the theories together?Worry no more.. because  Tony Crilly  has brought a basic maths book which teaches you the concepts of mathematical problems, ranging from the simplest fractions to the most complicated lengthy equations. It's a reader friendly book, which gives you the understanding of how every formula or problem is formed & solved. It's not at all boring for anyone. Not only teachers but students can read it easily as well. Also, there are lots of examples with the descriptions of how numbers can be simplified & many different graphs, tables, shapes & charts are available to help you further in getting the idea of your problem.I wish I had found this book before in my school days. It's a lot easier & helpful to understand..Have a look at this book.. https://sangu.ge/images/50mathematica..."
12,1847240089,http://goodreads.com/user/show/377051-jason-edwards,3,"I would have told you that I’ve always been “good” at math, but now I’m more inclined to tell you that I’ve always been “comfortable” with math. I’ve enjoyed playing around with numbers and shapes and equations and all that. So when I saw 50 Mathematical Ideas on a friend’s shelf it was an easy one to grab and browse.Which is what you can do with this book: browse. I read it in order, one through fifty and there are overlapping concepts that might have you go read a previous chapter if you haven’t already. But not too often, and Crilly is consistently “light but thorough” in his treatment of each idea, whether it’s The Zero, Infinity, Relativity, or Fractions.For folks familiar with the concepts, it’s a nice little review, and for those who are new to the ideas, the chapters provide a tidy introduction. But I don’t know if people who aren’t comfortable with math should even bother."
13,1847240089,http://goodreads.com/user/show/68490046-sammie-mcgurl,1,"I had to read this book for school, and I can honestly say that it is possibly THE WORST book I have ever read. Don't get me wrong; I love math. This book; however, KILLED me. It spent four pages per topic talking about some things that should have been learned in kindergarten and some other things that are irrelevant and confusing. DON'T read this book unless you absolutely have to. You don't have to agree with me; I'm just sharing MY honest opinion. "
14,1847240089,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5935582-dan-cohen,2,It's not a bad book and would be worth reading by someone with a very deficient mathematical education. I found it inaccurate in parts and badly explained in others. I also felt that the selection of ideas was not great (why do writers of books on mathematics for non-mathematicians so often include a section on relativity theory?)
15,1847240089,http://goodreads.com/user/show/58938063-ha-vu,2,"Written nicely, basic and accessible. The book contains interesting historical facts about different math concepts. This actually could be a nice History of Math textbook - I wish this was my textbook when I was in college!However, personally I found it really hard to finish the book in a fair period of time, and I gradually lost interest in finishing it. Same thing happened to my professor who lended me the book... So at least for me, it's not a book I would normally reach for.If you are interested, I recommend reading one or two concepts per day and try being consistent for two weeks, before they all slip off your mind."
16,1847240089,http://goodreads.com/user/show/70111841-viljami-kuosmanen,3,A good introduction to a few basic mathematical ideas. Not quite what I expected from the title. Would have loved a bit more in depth historical viewpoint. I guess 50 was just too many subjects to cram into such a tight package for me. 
17,1847240089,http://goodreads.com/user/show/51290679-eric,4,"A very inspiring and entertaining short read with bite-sized chapters ideal for a bedtime read. Overall, I would recommend the book to everybody familiar with basic mathematics who is curious to learn about further concepts, even experts can still learn from it."
18,1847240089,http://goodreads.com/user/show/65133977-stefan-shirley,5,"Such a fun book reminding me of people, theorems, problems, and ideas from my undergraduate days."
19,1847240089,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2175967-kristina,4,Not sure I have much use for some of these ideas but i do like to stretch my brain on different books sometimes.
20,1847240089,http://goodreads.com/user/show/100903269-y,4,Very nice book. I really enjoyed it :) 
21,1847240089,http://goodreads.com/user/show/108131736-ben,4,Good topics:ZeroInfinity DimensionRelativity 
22,1847240089,http://goodreads.com/user/show/102424584-osman-ceylan,4,Short articles with important mathematical ideas. I recommend everybody who has a basic mathematical education to understand and evaluate the most important findings in Math.
23,1847240089,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7873241-douglas-larson,3,"A nice collection of mathematical concepts, disciplines and problems. Each is explained well but concisely. The variety of ideas presented is wide and include a discussion of zero, number systems, Pi, e, infinity, prime numbers, algebra, logic, probability, fractions, geometry, and matrices to name some of the 50. I regard this as more of a reference, not a book I would read cover to cover, though each topic is so well written and so easy to understand that I find myself wanting to read other topics that have never interested me. My actual rating for this is 3.5 stars, rounded down to 3. The only drawback I found is that the author is English and so all of the occasional references to money use pounds sterling instead of dollars but this isn't much of an objection. But more germane to the point, I don't think I agree that all 50 topics fall into the category of I really need to know. I would nominate some of them as need to know - zero, number systems, probability, algebra, infinity, and prime numbers to name a few. But several of the topics, while interesting and certainly valuable in the right situation, are not what I would call need to know. All in all, author Crilly has written a valuable and clear explanation of these mathematical concepts. "
24,1847240089,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4711032-john-boettcher,4,"This is a well-written book about mathematics, it's essentials, history, and application. It is pretty tough to say that ANY math book is 'well-written', but Tony does a great job in explaining the concepts and history of math, its progression along the ages, and the discoveries that were made, and put it into a very short, approachable form. As the title indicates, there are 50 ideas, most of the chapters dedicate 2 pages to each topic, sometimes 4, but there is never any lingering around on any one thing. You get WAY more than just the basics, but not enough to bore you or overwhelm you. Honestly, I put this book on my night stand to have it be the book that would put me to sleep at night instead of reading a thriller or something, but I found that it was keeping me up as much as a novel. lol So either I'm a huge dork, or Crilly did a pretty good job with that book. Probably a little bit of both!This book is a GREAT refresher and learning tool for any of us who have been out of school and math theory for a number of years. So much more fun learning about math once it isn't forced down your throat! So thank you Crilly, you made math interesting again for me!"
25,1847240089,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5925863-bastian-greshake-tzovaras,4,I'm not much of a math-expert although I find it interesting what crazy stuff can be done with it. So I gave this book a try. The examples which are presented are well chosen (as far as a non-mathematician can say this) and for the most ideas everything is well explained. But at least for some ideas a bit more background-information and some more examples would have helped me to get it easier. If you need some refreshing of school-math and want to learn a bit new this might be a good read. 
26,1847240089,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7073947-bego-a,1,"This is a review of the Spanish translation, which is AWFUL, I wouldn't say unreadable but it's taken me FOREVER to read this because I dreaded opening it again. That said, the bite-sized chunks of math trivia are somewhat easy to digest, and I'm still hungry for more (maybe from a different author?), so not much harm done. FINISHED it this YEAR which was one of my challenges for 2013. It was hard."
27,1847240089,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2706455-chad,3,"""50 Mathematics Ideas You Really Need To Know"" by Tony Crilly is an interesting overview of key topics in mathematics, some of which you may have studied in the past. Some of the concepts are complex, some less so. In some cases, I was surprised that the ideas were even included in the study of mathematics. Although this was my least favorite book in the ""50 Ideas You Need to Know"" series, it is worth reading."
28,1847240089,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7316828-david-stoots,5,"I've been reading on of these concepts a night. I then find my self thinking about the concepts, the history of the idea and theorectical, and philosophical implication of the concept of zero for example. I like reading books like Schroedingers Cat and Beyond Eistein, then to sit back and let these concepts take root."
29,1847240089,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6967213-andr-rodrigues,2,"The chosen topics were adequate, but many of them didn't add much more than what you should know by the end of high-school.What really brings the book down are its numerous typos in the mathematical deductions, which defeats the purpose of having them in the first place (although the approach deserves some recognition, since many popular science books just 'tell' instead of 'showing')."
30,1847240089,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7647742-andrew,4,"For the price I paid, and how quickly one can read this book to get a better insight into the development and history of mathematics, it gets the rating I gave. Some of the simpler ideas or chapters could be omitted, but the timeline for them and how much earlier some of the beginnings arose for some of the ideas well worth it."

The book's biggest strength lies in its narratives on the historical origins and developments of different mathematical concepts and puzzles, which weaves an engaging context that helps readers grasp the fundamentals behind those seemingly esoteric, abstract notions more intuitively. Additional kudos for emphasis on the concepts' applicational value and their relevance to readers' everyday lives, which in turn make them more accessible to math-averse laymen like most of us. Admittedly I still don't quite understand nearly half the 50 concepts introduced in the book, but at least now I can better appreciate how they relate to the amazingly complex intricacies of this world around us."

75,1847240089,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5034852-shelly,5,These books are really good. They're basically referencing books but it's so interesting. I haven't finished it but so far so good.
76,1847240089,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1266160-martin,2,I really did not enjoy this book. It probably didn't help that the Kindle version is full of bugs and unreadable fuzzy images of the equations. 
77,1847240089,http://goodreads.com/user/show/10888595-eric-schabell,3,Good stuff for those fascinated by mathematics and like to be amazed at the foundations of our world.

86,1847240089,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5963979-jim-razinha,4,Good coverage. Spoiler alert...British author using some British terms.
87,1847240089,http://goodreads.com/user/show/16615635-hitessh-panchal,3,Good for revision :D !!!
88,1847240089,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4494692-akmurat,3,"Well-written but if you are already a math guy, you won't find anything new here. However, it can be a good starting point for your child, probably around late secondary school years."
89,1847240089,http://goodreads.com/user/show/58019001-roy-wang,4,"Not trying to pin all the blame for my long-standing lukewarm interest in math on my previous math teachers, but this book is rather close to the math classes I wished I had in high school. The book's biggest strength lies in its narratives on the historical origins and developments of different mathematical concepts and puzzles, which weaves an engaging context that helps readers grasp the fundamentals behind those seemingly esoteric, abstract notions more intuitively. Additional kudos for emphasis on the concepts' applicational value and their relevance to readers' everyday lives, which in turn make them more accessible to math-averse laymen like most of us. Admittedly I still don't quite understand nearly half the 50 concepts introduced in the book, but at least now I can better appreciate how they relate to the amazingly complex intricacies of this world around us."

92,1847240089,http://goodreads.com/user/show/53335757-bernhard,2,"Far too superficial - should be ""10 ideas you need to know"", but know these well! Fractals are covered quite nicely - e.g. I didn't know why they were called such, and it is due to the dimensionality (cf. area vs. circumference).

93,1847240089,http://goodreads.com/user/show/769895-steven,3,I got this book on a whim (and on sale). It was helpful in clarifying certain mathematical ideas and provided good reasons as to why each idea was important.

179,1847240089,http://goodreads.com/user/show/58019001-roy-wang,4,"Not trying to pin all the blame for my long-standing lukewarm interest in math on my previous math teachers, but this book is rather close to the math classes I wished I had in high school. The book's biggest strength lies in its narratives on the historical origins and developments of different mathematical concepts and puzzles, which weaves an engaging context that helps readers grasp the fundamentals behind those seemingly esoteric, abstract notions more intuitively. Additional kudos for emphasis on the concepts' applicational value and their relevance to readers' everyday lives, which in turn make them more accessible to math-averse laymen like most of us. Admittedly I still don't quite understand nearly half the 50 concepts introduced in the book, but at least now I can better appreciate how they relate to the amazingly complex intricacies of this world around us."

182,1847240089,http://goodreads.com/user/show/53335757-bernhard,2,"Far too superficial - should be ""10 ideas you need to know"", but know these well! Fractals are covered quite nicely - e.g. I didn't know why they were called such, and it is due to the dimensionality (cf. area vs. circumference).

183,1847240089,http://goodreads.com/user/show/769895-steven,3,I got this book on a whim (and on sale). It was helpful in clarifying certain mathematical ideas and provided good reasons as to why each idea was important.

264,1847240089,http://goodreads.com/user/show/51672015-john-edward,0,"This book challenged what I remembered from high school and college math, including algerbra, geometry, trigonometry, calculus and statistics."
265,1847240089,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2844727-tieta,5,AWESOME!!
266,1847240089,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5963979-jim-razinha,4,Good coverage. Spoiler alert...British author using some British terms.
267,1847240089,http://goodreads.com/user/show/16615635-hitessh-panchal,3,Good for revision :D !!!
268,1847240089,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4494692-akmurat,3,"Well-written but if you are already a math guy, you won't find anything new here. However, it can be a good starting point for your child, probably around late secondary school years."
269,1847240089,http://goodreads.com/user/show/58019001-roy-wang,4,"Not trying to pin all the blame for my long-standing lukewarm interest in math on my previous math teachers, but this book is rather close to the math classes I wished I had in high school. The book's biggest strength lies in its narratives on the historical origins and developments of different mathematical concepts and puzzles, which weaves an engaging context that helps readers grasp the fundamentals behind those seemingly esoteric, abstract notions more intuitively. Additional kudos for emphasis on the concepts' applicational value and their relevance to readers' everyday lives, which in turn make them more accessible to math-averse laymen like most of us. Admittedly I still don't quite understand nearly half the 50 concepts introduced in the book, but at least now I can better appreciate how they relate to the amazingly complex intricacies of this world around us."
270,1847240089,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7647742-andrew,4,"For the price I paid, and how quickly one can read this book to get a better insight into the development and history of mathematics, it gets the rating I gave. Some of the simpler ideas or chapters could be omitted, but the timeline for them and how much earlier some of the beginnings arose for some of the ideas well worth it."
271,1847240089,http://goodreads.com/user/show/49311671-kauther-a,5,"It won't take you long to get from learning what fractions are, to adding all of them up with different powers. The book travels from the basics of arithmetic, to the Reimann hypothesis, through many thought provoking and mind blowing ideas in mathematics.This book goes hand in hand with the YouTube channel, Numberphile; if you enjoy one, you must enjoy the other."
272,1847240089,http://goodreads.com/user/show/53335757-bernhard,2,"Far too superficial - should be ""10 ideas you need to know"", but know these well! Fractals are covered quite nicely - e.g. I didn't know why they were called such, and it is due to the dimensionality (cf. area vs. circumference). But complex numbers are not really explained at all, especially not why they are important in electro-physics, etc."
273,1847240089,http://goodreads.com/user/show/769895-steven,3,I got this book on a whim (and on sale). It was helpful in clarifying certain mathematical ideas and provided good reasons as to why each idea was important. Crilly gave not only each idea's theoretical importance but also its practical applications in the world.
274,1847240089,http://goodreads.com/user/show/714136-liz,0,"I was never a math person, but I always told myself that when the pressure of school was off I'd go back and take a math class and see if I could learn to love the ""M"" word. Found this book for $5 at Borders and plan on tackling it this year (2009)."
275,1847240089,http://goodreads.com/user/show/60270-khalid,3,"This books describes 50 different interesting mathematical ideas, and gives entertaining and interesting facts about each of them. It actually serves as a nice light reminder of a lot of math ideas, and some of these ideas were really interesting to read about."
276,1847240089,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2794644-nathan-glenn,5,"I enjoyed this book- it doesn't require the read to do any complicated math. Instead, it presents a variety of interesting problems, along with their history, significance, and application. I feel like I understand the actual field of mathematics better after reading it."
277,1847240089,http://goodreads.com/user/show/12399516-matthew,5,"This was a really good book for people who like math and want to learn about it. It's a basic primer for math, but explores a lot of complicated concepts like, e.g. Fermat's last theorem. I recommend it to everyone who's a little bit interested in math."
278,1847240089,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5930131-dawn,4,"I wish I had this when I was in school. It's great at explaining the basic ideas behind mathematical theories, the histories of them, and in many cases, gives practical examples of how they're put to use outside of math labs. "
279,1847240089,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4176715-mckinley,4,"Yes, even if you give this a cursory read. (As I did when the math started to get a bit beyond me. I still got an unclouded idea of the concept.) Clear, short descriptions of key mathematical concepts starting with zero and ending with Riemann's Hypothesis (not yet solved). "
280,1847240089,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5921214-electric-guitar,4,Very enjoyable read for me. I don't claim to understand all the concepts nor do I claim that the mathematical ideas are sound. This is one book I think about often. More than likely would read it again.
281,1847240089,http://goodreads.com/user/show/41912303-vil-m-zouhar,4,"Even though it's very similar to other popular science books dealing with mathematics, I found some topics that surprised me and I was glad that I got a brief (and sometimes funny) 4 page explanation."
282,1847240089,http://goodreads.com/user/show/12712763-matt-sautman,3,"My mind was not necessarily blown by Tony Crilly's addition to the 50 Ideas series, but I did find myself learning and engaged. That being said, I don't feel much more of an authority on math having read the book."
283,1847240089,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1888925-jarin,5,Alyson you will need to read this book it is good. I'll let you borrow when I am finished.
284,1847240089,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3505427-thomas-costello,0,Simple to understand in laymans terms as well as involving algebraic proofs
285,1847240089,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5034852-shelly,5,These books are really good. They're basically referencing books but it's so interesting. I haven't finished it but so far so good.
286,1847240089,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1266160-martin,2,I really did not enjoy this book. It probably didn't help that the Kindle version is full of bugs and unreadable fuzzy images of the equations. 
287,1847240089,http://goodreads.com/user/show/10888595-eric-schabell,3,Good stuff for those fascinated by mathematics and like to be amazed at the foundations of our world. 
288,1847240089,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5276193-kushnuma,5,Some interesting stuff... Really glad my school library has it!
289,1847240089,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2726875-filipe-dias,4,Quite good and fun to read.
290,1847240089,http://goodreads.com/user/show/24083341-andrei,5,"I wish some ideas were described in more detail, then again I guess some ideas would need a whole book on their own. Definitely worth the read."
291,1847240089,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4690592-jay,4,"It started off as a bathroom read, but now I am deeply interested in the topic. The idea that ""math has nothing to do with numbers"", finally makes sense..."
