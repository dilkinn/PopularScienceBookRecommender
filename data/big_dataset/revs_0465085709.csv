0,0465085709,http://goodreads.com/user/show/635936-jeremy,5,"if numbers, statistics, facts, figures, averages, charts, graphs, and notions of risk, chance, and probability are your thing, the norm chronicles: stories and numbers about danger and death may well be the most intriguing book you'll encounter in some time. authors michael blastland and david spiegelhalter explore nearly every aspect of human life, parsing out the likelihoods that any number of occurrences will come to pass over the course of a human lifetime (from infancy to old age).creatively and craftily constructed, each chapter of the the norm chronicles begins with a demonstrative short story about different approaches and reactions an individual may have to a particular situation. with aptly named characters (norm, prudence, and the kevlin brothers), these brief stories preface each subject with a real-world scenario - some mundane and others extraordinary. 27 chapters cover a wealth of potentialities, considering the likes of infancy, violence, accidents, vaccination, coincidence, sex, drugs, gambling, transportation, extreme sports, lifestyle, health, radiation, crime, unemployment, surgery, and money, amongst many others.with abundant humor, philosophical musings, and lucid explanations, blastland and spiegelhalter do a remarkable job of exploring and conveying the risks of modern living (and dying). exhaustively researched (with over 20 pages of notes and sources), the norm chronicles will be endlessly fascinating to some and utterly terrifying to others. as no two lives could possibly be the same, the book doesn't seek to codify life's myriad risks, but instead interprets the data points and encourages more analytical and critical thinking.accessible, entertaining, and endlessly absorbing, the norm chronicles might allay your fears or lead you to greater worry. what it will almost certainly do is reframe the way you reflect upon risk, chance, danger, and opportunity. the math, as its always wont to do, reveals some truly startling insights: not the least of which being the fact that eating a single banana offers a does of radiation equivalent to going through an airport security scanner one time. with their book, blastland and spiegelhalter have created a work that is truly both exceptional and engrossing. numbers and probabilities tend to show the final account, the risks to humans en masse, chance in aggregate summarized for whole populations. these numbers reveal hypnotic patterns and rich information. but they are indifferent to fate and its drama. numbers can't care and don't care; life and death are percentages, unafraid of danger, shrugging at survival, stating only what's risky, what's not, or to what degree, on average. they are silent about how much any of this, right down to a love or fear of sausages or ski slopes, matters...danger is the the shark in shallow waters, the pills in the cupboard, or a grand piano teetering on a window ledge while children skip below. it is the diet too rich in cream, the base-jump, the booze, the pedestrian and the double-decker, driving a car fast, or the threat of weirder weather. it is the spills and the thrills. in other words, danger is everywhere and always. and in all cases we find those same two faces: one impassive, formal, calculating, the other full of human hopes and fears.the unusual aim of this book is to see both at once. we hope to show people and their stories and the numbers, together. we set out to do this mainly to explore how these two perspectives compare, but along the way we found that this aim raised an awkward question: are the two faces of risk compatible? can risk claim to be true to the numbers and to you at the same time? we will present both sides as we try to find out, but we will tell you our conclusion now.it can't. for people, probability doesn't exist."
1,0465085709,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6022914-james,2,"Not really my cup of tea. It seems like a clever idea, each chapter takes a different class of risk and starts out with a story of Norm, Prudence and Kelvin - and their radically different approaches to life's risks and hazards - then follows with a more detailed discussion of the numbers and the data. Charts and tables abound, but ... the detail just never seemed to get detailed enough for me, and the Norm chronicles themselves felt more like a distraction that kept breaking the flow of the rest of the book. It seemed to take me ages to finish, a d I heaved a big sigh of relief when I closed it for the final time - a real shame as so many other people seem to have really enjoyed it."
2,0465085709,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1429082-daniel-solera,4,"This book is about quantifying risk, plain and simple. While those two buzzwords may induce a high-flying eye roll, I can't think of a better way to explain what Blastland's and Spiegelhalter's book attempts to do. Let's put it this way: as a parent, do you fear that your children will get kidnapped? Do you think skydiving is dangerous? How much does your diet truly affect how long you will live? The Norm Chronicles attempts to answer these questions by using two statistical units: the MicroMort and the MicroLife. The Micromort is a neat little tool that symbolizes the inherent risk in an activity or behavior. If you do nothing in a day, simply wake up, eat and sleep, then your chance of dying is 1 in a million, or 1 MicroMort. With each activity, behavior or incident, that probability increases by varying degrees. If your breakfast is nothing but bacon, then you add a few MicroMorts; if you drive recklessly then you add several more; if you have a stressful job, decide to bungee jump or spend a bibulous night at the bar, you add more and more.Each chapter deals with a different part of our daily lives and frames it through the lens of three different characters. There's Norm, who is perfectly average in almost every way. He doesn't try outlandish activities nor does he stay at home still. There's Prudence, who constantly worries about every possible danger, choosing safety and caution in every instance. Lastly there's Kelvin, who is a licentious daredevil, womanizer and ne'er-do-well. Each looks at risk differently, but the authors ultimately take their experiences and crunch the numbers.The second tool, the MicroLife, is a 30-minute span of time. Statistically, we have a finite amount of MicroLives and we can do whatever we want with them. However, each activity we do can either add or subtract MicroLives. In a 24-hour day, eating healthily and exercising can mean we only used up 23 MicroLives, in essence ""banking"" more time. If we eat only red meat, sugar-charged soda and sit at home all day, we may have used up 25 MicroLives, thus borrowing from our twilight years.If you're at all interested in statistics, the dangers of everyday life (or lack thereof), and more insight into the cliché that you are more likely to die on the way to the airport than flying, this book is a must read."
3,0465085709,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1248980-ruth,5,"This is a fascinating book about risk, the probability of risk in given situations, and how humans react to the idea of risk. It takes as it’s basis three characters: Norm, a man who is average in every sense of the word, and calculates risk according to the statistics; Prudence, who worries incessantly and excessively about everything – for her, the worst case scenario is also the likeliest; and Kelvin, who is arrogant and irresponsible and seems happy to take risks in all aspects of his life. These characters are placed in different settings, as the book explores the statistical chance of something bad happening, in relation to the public perception of risk. For example, scary headlines that declare things like ‘Eating such-and-such every day leads to a 20% increase in your likelihood of getting cancer.’ Scary indeed, but the book shows what that 20% risk actually works out at.The book is written in easy to understand language, and is often amusing. It acknowledges that it’s all very well saying there’s a one in a million chance of a specific something bad happening, but that’s little comfort to the person that is that one in a million. Nonetheless, I found it oddly reassuring to be able to understand why certain situations are so scary, yet when looked at objectively, they actually pose little real danger.It explains how probability is calculated (and discusses the reliability – or not – of the numbers), and is full of interesting anecdotes. All in all, a thoroughly enjoyable book, on a fascinating subject. Recommended."
4,0465085709,http://goodreads.com/user/show/19054809-sarah,4,Not at all whatI expected. I assumed this was one of those books that tells you to stop worrying about certain things happening eg plane crash as they’re really unlikely and start worrying about others eg car crash. Actually it was a much more philosophical book about how we think about risks and how statistics might or might not help that thinking. I would have given it five stars but I wasn’t that keen on the stories about the characters that started each chapter.

 Danger is the shark in shallow waters, the pills in the cupboard or a grand piano teetering on a window ledge while children skip below. It is the diet too rich in cream, the base-jump, the booze, the pedestrian and the double-decker, driving a car fast or the threat of weirder weather. It is the spills and the thrills. In other words, danger is everywhere and always. And in all cases we find those same two faces: one impassive, formal, calculating, the other full of human hopes and fears. The unusual aim of this book is to see both at once. We hope to show people and their stories and the numbers, together. We set out to do this mainly to explore how these two perspectives compare, but along the way we found that this raised an awkward question: are the two faces of risk compatible? Can risk claim to be true to the numbers and to you at the same time? We will present both sides as we try to find out, but we will tell you our conclusion now. It can’t. For people, probability doesn’t exist. 
 There's a Pratchettian lightness and gravity to it (it's a lot like the best of The Science of Discworld, in fact - fiction and nonfiction, tragic comedy, grandeur and quotidian life). 
 Norm's habits are ordinary, he likes a nice cup of tea but not too many, wears M&S trousers and invites little risk from hot passion or daring. Even so, someone or something wants him dead. Norm’s entire, blameless life is a story of mortal danger, as to some extent is yours, and ours.
One of the most important genres is the romance of technology, the emotional translation of rational truths, e.g. the Law of Large Numbers:
 from above, the course of human destiny is often clear. To individuals below, it is a maze of stories. It is as if there are two forces at the same time: one at the big scale pulling towards certainty, the other pushing individuals towards uncertainty. There’s a word to describe this balance between the patterns of populations and the stumbling of a single soul, a word first used in its modern sense only a few hundred years ago: probability. 
The micromort and microlife concepts (the latter invented herein) could seriously improve people's lives. by allowing precise prioritisation. Without them, without the help of reason in general, we are doomed to have the wrong emotions, or the right emotions with the wrong strength, or the right emotions for bad reasons."
6,0465085709,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7309374-romanas,3,"Useful facts and new insights, struggle with story-writingThis book brings along many important aspects about how risk should be adressed in common life situations. The author chose to use a cast of fictional characters as story vehicles in attempt to make the subject of statistics less boring. Unfortunately, this part was less successful. If you are not new to the topic, you will find many useful insights in almost each chapter, otherwise start with something more catchy. The book provides quite a lot of numbers and situations described seems to be extensively researched making the work very credible."
7,0465085709,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1717479-terry,3,"There may be some bias in an actuary reviewing a book on mortality statistics but I will partly tackle that by putting my cards on the table. I am pretty strong with statistics and don't shy away from them. This book tries the novel tactic of beginning each chapter with a kind of narrative element walking through the lives of a risk averse, neutral, and risk disposed character. This was neat in the first chapter but I quickly got either bored or confused with the ensuing uses. These vignettes take up a full quarter to third of the book and are only semi-skippable as the chapter after each sometimes refers to them. I found them bothersome.Where the book really shines is in comparing risks. Concise tables and choice gems transmit interesting facts like that horseback riding and ecstasy clock in at similar levels of danger. A year of marijuana usage is about as dangerous as a single weekend road trip and lumberjacks should receive an incredible amount of hazard pay.The book also slices morbidity statistics (things that may influence life span but not quite kill you) in a compelling way, comparing each action to how much time it'll shave off your life. It was sobering to see that my current weight level will knock some 15 years off my life. I have some work to do.The periodic digressions into the nature of chance and probability were uninteresting to me as they raised little new and seemed to show a fumbling attempt by the authors to either be philosophical or thorough.The book is fine. Borrow it from someone, thumb through it, or just google for a table of micromorts."
8,0465085709,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1849937-yofish,3,"Really 3.5I wanted to like this book better than I did. The explicit purpose of this book was to combine storytelling and risk assessment. The writing is quite good. But I found too much philosophy and not enough hard-headed probability. Each chapter tries to address a different aspect of life. And each chapter starts with a little story about one of their stock characters: Norm (who craves, tries to understand, and believes in all the probabilities), Prudence (who is extremely risk-averse), and Kelvin (who gets a rush from risky behavior). I liked the use of ""micoromorts"" to allow comparisons to show us (for example) that a day of scuba diving is about as dangerous as 500 miles (or whatever) of riding a motorcycle. The data was great, but there was too much wheel-spinning ""analysis."""
9,0465085709,http://goodreads.com/user/show/26851939-jasmine,2,"I really do admire the authors' attempt to make facts and figures accessible to the modern reader via a narrative of sorts, which is what drew me to start reading this book in the first place. However, after a while, it just felt like a whole bunch of statistics and numbers, with only a few accounts and narratives thrown in. Maybe that in itself reveals something about the non-statistician in me (though I will say that I have a soft spot for mathematics), but I have a feeling I'm not the only one. I found myself skipping the later sections of the book, stopping to only read the anecdotes. Also, I thought that Kevin's thoughts (the risky antagonist of the book) were quite poorly done. The short abrupt sentences that made his thought processes made it incredibly hard to read. Overall, a commendable effort, but I don't think I would recommend it to anyone."
10,0465085709,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7429811-mark-crouch,4,"A pretty enjoyable book that looks at inherent risks and dangers in every aspect of life through the sometimes absurd lens of it's fictional characters (Norm, Prudence, and the Kelvin bros) and evaluated using MicroMorts, a measurement which means a 1 in a million chance of dying. Manages to be both entertaining with its structure and fairly enlightening with it's study of chance, probability and statistics. Can be easily recommended to almost anyone."
11,0465085709,http://goodreads.com/user/show/18411924-bill-hill,4,As much a book on psychology as statistics. Why do we consider two equal risks such as the radiation dose from a CT scan and standing 2.4km from the explosion of the Hiroshima atomic bomb so differently? A very informative and entertaining book. Should be required reading for all politicians.

13,0465085709,http://goodreads.com/user/show/10945257-outdoors-nerd,3,Unfortunately but not surprisingly the stats get a little dry. However it's a great wake up call to stop making risk judgments based upon what is available in the media. 
14,0465085709,http://goodreads.com/user/show/58530751-james,3,"I felt this book was ultimately a disappointment, not as the authors feared, through statistical boredom and fatigue, but because of the wackier elements of Norm, Kelvin and Prudence which seemed to get in the way of the more interesting stuff.Slightly unusually for a popular science book, this consisted of nearly 30 chapters of ten pages, and it did feel brief at times, with some topics covered so thinly you wondered why they had their own chapter. As many of the chapters had a sort of sketch at the start, it left a few of them a bit thin of content. As for the sketches themselves, they were not to my taste. The idea was to suggest that we can't separate mathematical probabilities of risks from the more emotional scenarios that influence our decisions, and this was well argued, but rather than the three characters adding the context, their caricatures just seemed like a repetitive, unfunny joke.And I didn't feel there was a need for it, as most chapters were not lists of mortality risks, but a considered discussion. There was more personality than in similar books, in quite an informal style, with anecdotes about doctors as well as personal experience. Some of the psychological aspects were really interesting to me and I'd like to explore them further, though I think there was scope to expand on many topics in this book. Perhaps the authors wanted to produce their own work rather than writing another retelling of famous findings, and I liked their use of microlives and micromorts and their explanations of certain concepts. And while the authors did say this was intended for short bursts, this was not something you'd dip in an out of, as the chapters weren't standalone and referenced previous concepts, as well as having a timeline for the characters.A book that should have been right up my alley, based on subject and writer in the case of Spiegelhalter, just didn't work for me. It was worth reading for some of its more interesting elements, but it didn't go into enough detail for me to have really enjoyed it, and there was too much of the comedy."
15,0465085709,http://goodreads.com/user/show/9857155-ron,4,"It is a sort of oddball book about how to more intelligently conceive of and react to statistical probabilities, in this case, statistics relating to the possibility of accidental death or maiming from going about doing normal things, like riding in a car to the airport and taking a flight across the country. Having sex. Getting your kid–or yourself–vaccinated. Dying from radiation exposure. Undergoing surgery. Undergoing screening tests for diseases. And so on. The authors are very clever about all this, and go through their explanations of what the study of the numbers–how many deaths per year out of so many in the population–really suggests about how we assess risks to ourselves.The structural premise overall of the book was to posit three characters, who represent three common attitudes to awareness of risk of an activity. Norm looks for the practical interpretations of ""dangerous"" events, and thinks carefully about where he stands in the spectrum of possibility. Prudence is sure that any possible harm that could come to her or hers, from horseback riding to being killed in a car accident, to getting fired, will indeed happen to her; she seeks to protect herself, despite how small the chances are that she will indeed be affected. Kelvin is heedless, and if he even is exposed to the statistical odds of a risky activity, if it seems to be fun, he'll try it at least once.On one hand, the information offered here is pretty dry, numerical and often in need of a statistics course to fully understand. But the authors are aware of the dangers of writing about such material, and do a fine job of making jokes, phrasing concepts wittily and using his three characters to characterize and humanize responses to such dry material."
16,0465085709,http://goodreads.com/user/show/27513524-john-igo,3,"Last book in a 2019 summer book club.Usually these kinds of books are very dry, however the authors get around this by following the lives of three friends Norm, Kelvin and Prudence who provide short vignettes that mainly serve as a human face to the topic the chapter intends to discuss. It's an interesting way to do it, and I think it works pretty well. Norm is average, Kelvin* is risky, Prudence is prudent. Even though the book proceeds linearly through the lives of the three friends, most of the chapters can be read independently, since they're about say 'the risk of obesity' or 'the dangers inherent in driving' rather than part of an overarching narrative. Most of the chapters are interesting on their own, but the lack of a narrative makes this a hard book to read in one go - and the numbers heavy content means none of it would stick with you if you read it that way. The authors conclude with an interpretation of probability that I really liked. When you get a forecast, say 12% chance of heart attack, you should interpret that just as saying that given the information the doctor had, 12% is the odds a bookie would give of a heart attack. Converting %'s into betting odds is a really cool trick to recast probabilities. P.S. this book had one of my favorite lines ever, ""I would have tried harder but for the effort."" * cool nod to the temperature scale, which is a scale of increasing random vibrations"
17,0465085709,http://goodreads.com/user/show/14515345-erin-britton,4,"With The Norm Chronicles, Michael Blastland and David Spiegelhalter have set out to discover whether numbers can help the [fictional] infant Norm avoid the many pitfalls of the average life. They analyse the risks and probabilities inherent in many of the situations and questions that occur throughout life – whether to have a baby, whether to eat processed foods, whether to ride a motorbike, etc – in order to provide mathematical guidance in avoiding/mitigating risk. In order to consider as wide a spectrum of humanity as possible, in additional to guiding Norm, Blastland and Spiegelhalter also offer advice to the risk averse Prudence (the clue’s in the name with this one) and to the daring Kelvin. The Norm Chronicles is an interesting exposé of what the statistics on risk, chance and choice really mean. I might not be better prepared for dangers after reading it, but I’m certainly better informed."
18,0465085709,http://goodreads.com/user/show/38740555-john-holmes,3,"There is lots of interesting statistical information in here and also some interesting anecdotes. However, it is let down by two problems. First, the framing device, which uses some characters, Norm, Prudence and the Kelvins, to tell intruding stories is riddled with lazy stereotypes and bad writing. As a result it becomes tiresome and ineffective. Second, the big scientific concept of micromorts and microlives doesn't really do the job it's meant to of making risk easier to understand. As someone with a high level of statistical literacy, I still found myself having to think about what it meant every time it was mentioned. The authors already seemed unconvinced by their own idea as it faded in and out of the book without every really feeling like they had committed to it. Ultimately, the standard statistical approaches were usually easier to grasp."
19,0465085709,http://goodreads.com/user/show/100860715-samuel-zackrisson,3,"Fun read! A captivating parade of statistics and stories. The micromorts and microlives made it possible to connect all the types of risks throughout the book, turning each chapter from isolated islands of data to pieces of a larger puzzle.The book points out how our way of objectively quantifying risks does not match our subjective feelings about risks. Unfortunately, I feel the book only scratches the surface of how to understand or handle these psychological or philosophical inconsistencies. What makes us feel what we feel when we think about different dangers or chances?"

26,0465085709,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5325549-glenn-myers,3,"Fascinating book about risk and chance and our responses to it, from one of its leading popularizers. It isn't wonderfully written (tries a bit too hard to be popular) but it's full of un-missable nuggets and insights. For example:-Year after year, among us 21 million male Britons, we manage to fall off ladders at the same rate. In the five years to 2010, the number of men killed falling from ladders was 42, 54, 56, 53, 47. All that randomness, yet it all comes out the same. --Spikes and peaks in things like bike accidents and knife crime are not examples of a society going wrong, but of journalists and politicians not understanding maths. This is the curse of thinking a history degree constitutes an education. The recent news items about 11 cyclists killed in London in two weeks is not a news item at all. It is a normal feature of thing called a Poisson distribution. Over a period of years, the maths predicts you will have a the odd bad week, The annual number of cyclist deaths, meanwhile, stays eerily the same. --Relentlessly, crime falls, fewer babies die, health improves, fewer people get killed on the roads, yet we frequently worry more about the few hazards that are left. --There are as many deaths, and rather more serious injuries, from horse-riding than from Ecstasy/MDMA.--Scarily, research shows that whatever our (personality-based) gut instinct is about an issue (climate change, nanotechnology, GM food), subsequent education only serves to reinforce our pre-held beliefs (see p 112).--The likelihood of two youngish people conceiving a child when having random, unprotected sex is about 1 in 20, though this varies hugely through the woman's cycle, peaking at about 1 in 5 on the best nights, -Bad news frequently isn't. The authors give a true example of a Daily Express (yes, it would be) news item: eating a full English breakfast each day increases your risk of pancreatic cancer by 20%. This sounds alarming, until they unpick it. Only a small percentage of people ever get pancreatic cancer. So if 400 people have a full English breakfast every day for the rest of their lives, 5 of them will die of pancreatic cancer. Among a control group of 400 muesli eaters, only 4 would snuff it: not so bad. (Though of course the full English diet does other things also, to heart disease and obesity presumably.)Finally, two helpful appendices in the back show the most effective-life-span altering daily habits:* five fruit and veg every day: add four years* twenty minutes light/moderate exercise: add two years* two cups of coffee: add one year* one small alcoholic drink: add one year.*smoke 14-24 ciggies: take off seven years* be obese: take off 2.5 years*eat one portion of red meat: take off one year*every alcoholic drink after the first: take off 0.7 years.* watch TV for two hours: take off 0.7 years.Unique book, a little overwritten. Great fun."
27,0465085709,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1927018-patricia,4,"This is a book about taking risks, and why we rate some risks as much more likely than others to occur despite statistical evidence that that may not necessarily be the case (they just stick better in our minds because they are recorded in our minds in 'story form'--via first person accounts or the media--and we all know that stories stick better than plain-vanilla facts). For instance, I worried a lot when my children were small walking to school that they would be hit by a car. Statistically, that was actually less dangerous than had I driven them to school. So this is a fun book to read, and a good book to read if you've grown up parented into believing that the world is a very dangerous place. Actually, the most dangerous time in a woman's life is childbirth (which somehow I never really considered as dangerous, but it still is, even in 2015). For men, it's those testosterone-drenched years of the 20's and early 30's. The first year of life is still dangerous. Doing drugs, driving drunk, unprotected sex within certain communities, also still is.So this is a very interesting book to dip in and out of (if you liked Freakanomics you should like this book); I wouldn't necessarily recommend reading it cover-to-cover as I did as the statistics of each chapter do tend to glaze over after a while, but if you read a few chapters at a time in order of your own insecurities, you'll find it hard to put down. Twenty-seven chapters cover such topics as accidents, vaccinations, gambling, chance, transportation, infancy, extreme sports, crime, unemployment, money, surgery. All have their fascinating oddities. Yes, unemployment strikes more frequently than one realises because of the oddity of the way the statistics are kept--30,000 people lose their jobs; 30,000 are hired; the result is 0 change on the unemployment scale. Tell that to the 30,000 who wake up shocked to hear they are being laid off that day--obviously an underestimated risk. In the gambling chapter you learn that the least chance you have of winning is a big government lottery, a bit better is the race track, and even better is a roulette wheel (American with only one zero, as opposed to European wheels that have two zeros). My only negative with this work was its approach using three fictional characters--Norm (described by the authors as ""a fool if you like""), Kelvin (""an offensive slug"") and Prudence (""a pain in the arse"") used in little scenarios at the beginning of each chapter to set the stage. I could have done without them but they were inoffensive really, and the little insights I learned not only amused me but just may make me fear some possibilities a little less than I have in the past (like an asteroid hitting earth)...which would be just fine."
28,0465085709,http://goodreads.com/user/show/22648121-bruce-gargoyle,4,"Ten Second Synopsis:Using an average bloke, an anxious mother and a danger-seeking guy, The Norm Chronicles crunches the numbers of risk and danger alongside stories that illustrate consequences of various risk-defying behaviours.What The Norm Chronicles does brilliantly (and with plenty of humour) is demystify the numbers and rhetoric and cut through to the likelihood of various unpleasant events happening to you, while deconstructing the fear that can run rampant through a populace.Each chapter deals with a particular event or category of risk using Norm (the average guy), Prudence (the anxious, overprotective mother) and Kelvin (the danger-loving, risk-dismissing, wild man) as examples. The great thing about the format of the book is that while the assertions are based on statistics and measurable data, the authors never discount the potency of our almost unavoidable tendency to imagine worst-case scenarios as they apply to our own lives. The “what-ifs” that cripple our rational minds are neatly placed beside the statistical likelihood of these things actually happening.Strangely enough, this almost made the “what-ifs” worse for me because, as the authors note in one chapter, it is impossible to “beat the odds” – even if the odds are 1 in 20 million that something tragic could occur to you, there is still a chance that you could be the one!Overall, I found this to be a fascinating and funny read and one that would be a great conversation starter for a book club. This is the kind of book that works just as well for dipping in and out as it does as a read-from-cover-to-cover. If you’ve ever wondered about the actual risks associated with train travel, using drugs or having a baby (or indeed, any combination of those three and more!) then this book is essential reading.I’d have to say that Norm turned out to be better than average in this instance."
29,0465085709,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6945307-damaskcat,4,"I am interested in the different ways in which individuals assess risk and found this book fascinating reading. The risks in various everyday situations are illustrated by imaginary scenarios featuring Norm – Mr Average; Prudence – ultra cautious and Kevin/Kelvin and variations who see no risk in anything or choose to ignore the risks which others would take seriously.My perception is that many people overestimate the risks of many things and underestimate the risks of things which they regard as safe. Health screening is a typical example of the latter and there are some interesting charts and diagrams in this book which appear to show that health screening may expose you to greater risks than not being screened. If you want to know whether there is a risk of being hit by an asteroid, having something, or someone fall on you out of an aeroplane, dying in a plane crash, receiving a fatal dose of radiation, being killed or injured in a road accident, developing cancer or being adversely affected by the mobile phone mast at the end of the road then this is the book for you. But you might end up surprised and disturbed by many of the figures.The book shows how human beings can incorrectly assess risk because of the fear factor. We find it difficult to separate our emotions from the real facts and figures. Headline news of four stabbings in a small area on the same day provoke alarm and fear and the perception that violent crime is increasing when in fact it is falling and the four cases are a statistical anomaly. The book is written in an amusing and light hearted way but it does have a serious message to convey – that we need to look at the real figures behind the headline scare stories before we pack our bags and move into a nuclear bunker. The book has notes on each chapter and an index."

You might think this sounds morbid. Think again. These guys find fun ways to play with numbers. Who has not wondered how their life will end? Everyone is mortal, and Michael and David delight in the subject. They examine a wide variety of terminal situations. Since you are reading this, it's obvious that you did not die while emerging from the birth canal. That happens to be one of the many ways of dying that they examine. Since death while your mother was delivering you didn't happen, you may want to guess your lifespan by considering the biblical allotment of three scores and ten. That might not work for you though. Our lives are becoming longer on average. The book deals with murder and suicide. Chances of facing terminal situations because of breast cancer for women, or prostate cancer for men are covered. Skydiving and flying are looked at. You name the possible causes of death. They are probably covered in some way in the course of the book. There's surprisingly well-balanced and detailed statistical data from both the United States and the United Kingdom.If you are wondering why the book is called The Norm Chronicles, here is your answer. Norm is a guy named Norman. Of course since he is Norm, he has to be normal. He is talked about from his time in childhood all the way well into his adulthood. He is just your average sort of guy. You will meet other characters who are not so normal. Their names are just as intriguing as Norm's. See what I mean when I allude to this being a fun book?This is something worth your time, and you will learn things you never knew before. I got my copy through Goodreads First Reads, and found every minute with it to be highly enjoyable. "

Risk is extremely hard to explain to people, but through the use of the startlingly clear concepts of MicroMorts and MicroLives, I think they've got it. The weak point was, in my opinion, the stories that opened each chapter about Prudence, Norm and Kelvin. They felt a bit off and like they obscured the issues rather than illuminated them.

Blastland is one of the creators of the wonderful More or Less radio program and Spiegelhalter is a statistician. The book has three characters, Norm, an average person in as many ways as possible, Prudence, who is always cautious and Kelvin who is a big risk taker. The three of them appear in each chapter and then the risks they are encountering are assessed. The book uses the MicroMort, which is a one in a million chance of death to compare risks. Later on the MicroLife is introduced, which is an extension or reduction of life expectancy due to some activity.The three characters and the comprehensible standard units provide a framework for calmly looking at the risks of cancer, transport, extreme sports, drinking and other activities that we all engage in. Risks are also compared through time and for different ages. The book is excellent non-fiction.

Prudence leads a careful life, worried about remote possibilities, while Kelvin takes every risk imaginable. Norm, as his name implies, represents the average person. Although the two authors are based in the UK, the majority of the data has been pulled from both US and UK sources, often making for interesting comparisons. Risky activities are compared to a one-in-a-million chance of death, termed a MicroMort. Lifestyle choices that have long term consequences (e.g., having 2 alcoholic drinks a day) are measured in terms of MicroLives, one millionth of the average lifespan. Statistically, the first alcoholic drink will add slightly to your lifespan, but the second takes away from it. Far and away the most humorous book about statistics I have ever seen.

Look at this little gem:""Suppose you’ve rounded up a thousand of the usual terrorist suspects...someone claims to have a lie detector that is 90 per cent accurate...the machine declares that 108 are probably lying. These are taken away, given orange suits and not seen again for years.But this means, believe it or not, that there were most likely to have been just 10 terrorists in the 1,000, even with ‘90 per cent accuracy’. The sums are fairly basic: the test would pick up 9 out of 10 of the real terrorists, letting one go free. But there were 990 innocent people, and the test would incorrectly classify 10 per cent of them – that’s 99 – as ‘terrorists’. That makes 9 + 99 = 108 people sent off to a remote prison, 99 of them wholly innocent – that’s 91 per cent of the accused wrongly incarcerated by a ‘90 per cent accurate’ test."""
39,0465085709,http://goodreads.com/user/show/213772-taylor,4,"This is an engaging non-fiction exploration about risk and how we feel about risk. I enjoyed this book on two levels: 1) lots and lots of information about risk itself, including some cool tools to compare risk (micro-morts and -lives) and 2) the exploration that the statistics don't really matter if we have a panic attack about how we feel about the risk and then lay down on the floor and don't live our lives. I was expecting the information, but was delightfully surprised by the acknowledgement of the role of emotions.If you're feeling stressed for time, you can dip in and out of this book -- typical strategies of reading the beginning and end, and any other interesting chapters will probably get you there. I also didn't agree with some of the conclusions in the middle chapters about some social science studies, but not so much to throw the book across the room in disgust.

I am delighted to say that it is one of the best “science” books that I have ever read. Full of fascinating facts, statistics, and probabilities, The Norm Chronicles is a revelation of the actual, quantifiable, and statistical risks of various human activities and exposures and of natural (and cosmic) disasters. Every chapter is a fascinating ride examining big risks (e.g., “extreme sports”) and small (“space”). I am particularly intrigued (and horrified) by the real risks posed by hospitals and doctors throughout human history. Likewise, I am surprised (and edified) by the real, quantifiable benefits of moderate coffee consumption! I heartily recommend this book; the “probability” is that you will enjoy it as much as I."

The two main thrusts of the book being, one, that life is probably not as scary as you think (at least if you live in the UK or USA), and, two, that all these risk and probability numbers are, finally, pretty limited, at least in terms of their ability to predict life events. (The authors attempt to make this second point mostly through the stories of three fictional characters... these sections of the book have heart, but are pretty hit and miss in terms of entertainment value.) Still, it's a fun book, yes yes, very fun. There's gotta be a ""tell your friend(s)"" anecdote/statistic on every other page.

You hardly need any math skills.

These are taken away, given orange suits and not seen again for years.But this means, believe it or not, that there were most likely to have been just 10 terrorists in the 1,000, even with ‘90 per cent accuracy’. The sums are fairly basic: the test would pick up 9 out of 10 of the real terrorists, letting one go free. But there were 990 innocent people, and the test would incorrectly classify 10 per cent of them – that’s 99 – as ‘terrorists’. That makes 9 + 99 = 108 people sent off to a remote prison, 99 of them wholly innocent – that’s 91 per cent of the accused wrongly incarcerated by a ‘90 per cent accurate’ test."""

I enjoyed this book on two levels: 1) lots and lots of information about risk itself, including some cool tools to compare risk (micro-morts and -lives) and 2) the exploration that the statistics don't really matter if we have a panic attack about how we feel about the risk and then lay down on the floor and don't live our lives. I was expecting the information, but was delightfully surprised by the acknowledgement of the role of emotions.If you're feeling stressed for time, you can dip in and out of this book -- typical strategies of reading the beginning and end, and any other interesting chapters will probably get you there.

I am particularly intrigued (and horrified) by the real risks posed by hospitals and doctors throughout human history.

You might think this sounds morbid. Think again. These guys find fun ways to play with numbers. Who has not wondered how their life will end? Everyone is mortal, and Michael and David delight in the subject. They examine a wide variety of terminal situations. Since you are reading this, it's obvious that you did not die while emerging from the birth canal. That happens to be one of the many ways of dying that they examine. Since death while your mother was delivering you didn't happen, you may want to guess your lifespan by considering the biblical allotment of three scores and ten. That might not work for you though. Our lives are becoming longer on average. The book deals with murder and suicide. Chances of facing terminal situations because of breast cancer for women, or prostate cancer for men are covered. Skydiving and flying are looked at. You name the possible causes of death. They are probably covered in some way in the course of the book. There's surprisingly well-balanced and detailed statistical data from both the United States and the United Kingdom.If you are wondering why the book is called The Norm Chronicles, here is your answer. Norm is a guy named Norman. Of course since he is Norm, he has to be normal. He is talked about from his time in childhood all the way well into his adulthood. He is just your average sort of guy. You will meet other characters who are not so normal. Their names are just as intriguing as Norm's. See what I mean when I allude to this being a fun book?This is something worth your time, and you will learn things you never knew before.

He talks good sense and is very clear and accessible, so I was glad to see he'd written a book with Michael Blastland, who makes some excellent programmes on Radio 4 (More or Less is a particular favourite, stats nerd that I am). The book was good, I thought. The subtitle is ""Stories and Numbers About Danger"" and you pretty much get what it says on the tin. Starting with stories about prudent Prudence, average Norm and reckless Kelvin, they look at a number of different areas and explore both how people react to the risks involved and what the risks really are. The last point is the strongest element of the book. Risk is extremely hard to explain to people, but through the use of the startlingly clear concepts of MicroMorts and MicroLives, I think they've got it. The weak point was, in my opinion, the stories that opened each chapter about Prudence, Norm and Kelvin. They felt a bit off and like they obscured the issues rather than illuminated them. My reaction to them was more ""WTF?"" than ""a-ha!"".Nothing new here for someone with a background in the issues, but as a primer, I think this would work really well.MY GRADE: A B. "
92,0465085709,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3677821-pete,4,"The Norm Chronicles (2013) by Michael Blastland and David Spiegelhalter is an excellent look at risk in everyday life. Blastland is one of the creators of the wonderful More or Less radio program and Spiegelhalter is a statistician. The book has three characters, Norm, an average person in as many ways as possible, Prudence, who is always cautious and Kelvin who is a big risk taker. The three of them appear in each chapter and then the risks they are encountering are assessed. The book uses the MicroMort, which is a one in a million chance of death to compare risks. Later on the MicroLife is introduced, which is an extension or reduction of life expectancy due to some activity.The three characters and the comprehensible standard units provide a framework for calmly looking at the risks of cancer, transport, extreme sports, drinking and other activities that we all engage in. Risks are also compared through time and for different ages. The book is excellent non-fiction. The main characters provide anchor points and the discussions, facts and figures provide the substance of the book. It’s easy and fun to read and very much worth getting hold of. "
93,0465085709,http://goodreads.com/user/show/12534347-phil-smith,5,"The Norm Chronicles had me laughing from the front matter on. This book covers statistical risks in everyday life with fictional vignettes starring three characters: Prudence, Norm, and Kelvin. Prudence leads a careful life, worried about remote possibilities, while Kelvin takes every risk imaginable. Norm, as his name implies, represents the average person. Although the two authors are based in the UK, the majority of the data has been pulled from both US and UK sources, often making for interesting comparisons. Risky activities are compared to a one-in-a-million chance of death, termed a MicroMort. Lifestyle choices that have long term consequences (e.g., having 2 alcoholic drinks a day) are measured in terms of MicroLives, one millionth of the average lifespan. Statistically, the first alcoholic drink will add slightly to your lifespan, but the second takes away from it. Far and away the most humorous book about statistics I have ever seen. Full of fascinating data and clearly rigorously thought through, but accessible to the lay reader. I received this book through the First Reads program. "

How dangerous is it to be at different ages? How dangerous are drugs or skydiving, really? This book is a statistical analysis. In order to make the subject less dry, the authors introduce three characters: “Prudence,” the safety addict,“Kelvin,” the risk-taker, and“Norm,” the statistically-average man.The beginning of each chapter is the three of them going about their lives in their typical fashion. It focuses on whatever topic is to follow. Each of their approaches yields a different result. Then the numbers enter. The issue with this structure is that Prudence, Kelvin, and Norm’s sections are insufferable. They’re an odd mix of confusing and boring. They never add anything to the subsequent chapter. The book is called “The Norm Chronicles,” but Norm is so loathsome I couldn’t be bothered to finish the book. (Also, I ran out of time before I had to give it back to my brother. But I probably would not have finished it anyway.)"
95,0465085709,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1058994-ryan-mishap,3,"Stating at the outset that they seek to prove probability does not truly exist, the authors then state their goal: to fuse the numbers that indicate risks related to various activities with the stories people tell themselves and others. In essence, they argue, calculating risk involves not just means and averages but the experiences we've had, society's general outlook, and the stories we tell ourselves and each other. Very good, but they attempt to accomplish this by creating three (or more) fictional characters to represent various types (cautious, normal, and risk-taking) and this fictional device annoys more than it illuminates. For every funny story involving our archetypes (in the coincidence chapter, for instance) we get more that are distasteful or too cheeky for serious consideration.They try to have fun, and the goal is a worthy one, but the aim is thrown off by the number of examples. A shorter book with fewer topics would have hit home harder, I think."

On any expedition, good guides are essential Michael Blastland is a journalist and co-author, but his content understanding is superficial and he doesn't write that well. This book could have been half its size, and it has a tedious, tongue-in-cheek, ""we're British, you know"" tone that wears early in the volume. Sir David John Spiegelhalter has all the statistical and mathematical creds, but I suspect that he was busy and leaned on his co-author too much.A reader interested in learning about how to understand and interpret statistics in every day life will still be searching for the one volume solution: this is not it.

(The range, by the way, is 500 million down to 0.50.)The book is full of dry British humor, but the discussions cover the globe and side-by-side comparisons of British and U.S. data are offered on every topic.Definitely a worthwhile read.

The book was good, I thought. The subtitle is ""Stories and Numbers About Danger"" and you pretty much get what it says on the tin.

The weak point was, in my opinion, the stories that opened each chapter about Prudence, Norm and Kelvin. They felt a bit off and like they obscured the issues rather than illuminated them.

Blastland is one of the creators of the wonderful More or Less radio program and Spiegelhalter is a statistician. The book has three characters, Norm, an average person in as many ways as possible, Prudence, who is always cautious and Kelvin who is a big risk taker. The three of them appear in each chapter and then the risks they are encountering are assessed. The book uses the MicroMort, which is a one in a million chance of death to compare risks. Later on the MicroLife is introduced, which is an extension or reduction of life expectancy due to some activity.The three characters and the comprehensible standard units provide a framework for calmly looking at the risks of cancer, transport, extreme sports, drinking and other activities that we all engage in. Risks are also compared through time and for different ages. The book is excellent non-fiction.

This book covers statistical risks in everyday life with fictional vignettes starring three characters: Prudence, Norm, and Kelvin. Prudence leads a careful life, worried about remote possibilities, while Kelvin takes every risk imaginable. Norm, as his name implies, represents the average person. Although the two authors are based in the UK, the majority of the data has been pulled from both US and UK sources, often making for interesting comparisons. Risky activities are compared to a one-in-a-million chance of death, termed a MicroMort. Lifestyle choices that have long term consequences (e.g., having 2 alcoholic drinks a day) are measured in terms of MicroLives, one millionth of the average lifespan. Statistically, the first alcoholic drink will add slightly to your lifespan, but the second takes away from it. Far and away the most humorous book about statistics I have ever seen.

You might think this sounds morbid. Think again. These guys find fun ways to play with numbers. Who has not wondered how their life will end? Everyone is mortal, and Michael and David delight in the subject. They examine a wide variety of terminal situations. Since you are reading this, it's obvious that you did not die while emerging from the birth canal. That happens to be one of the many ways of dying that they examine. Since death while your mother was delivering you didn't happen, you may want to guess your lifespan by considering the biblical allotment of three scores and ten. That might not work for you though. Our lives are becoming longer on average. The book deals with murder and suicide. Chances of facing terminal situations because of breast cancer for women, or prostate cancer for men are covered. Skydiving and flying are looked at. You name the possible causes of death. They are probably covered in some way in the course of the book. There's surprisingly well-balanced and detailed statistical data from both the United States and the United Kingdom.If you are wondering why the book is called The Norm Chronicles, here is your answer. Norm is a guy named Norman. Of course since he is Norm, he has to be normal. He is talked about from his time in childhood all the way well into his adulthood. He is just your average sort of guy. You will meet other characters who are not so normal. Their names are just as intriguing as Norm's.

You might think this sounds morbid. Think again. These guys find fun ways to play with numbers. Who has not wondered how their life will end? Everyone is mortal, and Michael and David delight in the subject. They examine a wide variety of terminal situations. Since you are reading this, it's obvious that you did not die while emerging from the birth canal. That happens to be one of the many ways of dying that they examine. Since death while your mother was delivering you didn't happen, you may want to guess your lifespan by considering the biblical allotment of three scores and ten. That might not work for you though. Our lives are becoming longer on average. The book deals with murder and suicide. Chances of facing terminal situations because of breast cancer for women, or prostate cancer for men are covered. Skydiving and flying are looked at. You name the possible causes of death. They are probably covered in some way in the course of the book. There's surprisingly well-balanced and detailed statistical data from both the United States and the United Kingdom.If you are wondering why the book is called The Norm Chronicles, here is your answer. Norm is a guy named Norman. Of course since he is Norm, he has to be normal. He is talked about from his time in childhood all the way well into his adulthood. He is just your average sort of guy. You will meet other characters who are not so normal. Their names are just as intriguing as Norm's. See what I mean when I allude to this being a fun book?This is something worth your time, and you will learn things you never knew before. I got my copy through Goodreads First Reads, and found every minute with it to be highly enjoyable. "

He talks good sense and is very clear and accessible, so I was glad to see he'd written a book with Michael Blastland, who makes some excellent programmes on Radio 4 (More or Less is a particular favourite, stats nerd that I am). The book was good, I thought. The subtitle is ""Stories and Numbers About Danger"" and you pretty much get what it says on the tin. Starting with stories about prudent Prudence, average Norm and reckless Kelvin, they look at a number of different areas and explore both how people react to the risks involved and what the risks really are. The last point is the strongest element of the book. Risk is extremely hard to explain to people, but through the use of the startlingly clear concepts of MicroMorts and MicroLives, I think they've got it. The weak point was, in my opinion, the stories that opened each chapter about Prudence, Norm and Kelvin. They felt a bit off and like they obscured the issues rather than illuminated them.

The book has three characters, Norm, an average person in as many ways as possible, Prudence, who is always cautious and Kelvin who is a big risk taker. The three of them appear in each chapter and then the risks they are encountering are assessed. The book uses the MicroMort, which is a one in a million chance of death to compare risks. Later on the MicroLife is introduced, which is an extension or reduction of life expectancy due to some activity.The three characters and the comprehensible standard units provide a framework for calmly looking at the risks of cancer, transport, extreme sports, drinking and other activities that we all engage in. Risks are also compared through time and for different ages. The book is excellent non-fiction. The main characters provide anchor points and the discussions, facts and figures provide the substance of the book. It’s easy and fun to read and very much worth getting hold of. "

Although the two authors are based in the UK, the majority of the data has been pulled from both US and UK sources, often making for interesting comparisons. Risky activities are compared to a one-in-a-million chance of death, termed a MicroMort.

It focuses on whatever topic is to follow. Each of their approaches yields a different result. Then the numbers enter. The issue with this structure is that Prudence, Kelvin, and Norm’s sections are insufferable. They’re an odd mix of confusing and boring. They never add anything to the subsequent chapter. The book is called “The Norm Chronicles,” but Norm is so loathsome I couldn’t be bothered to finish the book. (Also, I ran out of time before I had to give it back to my brother.

185,0465085709,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1058994-ryan-mishap,3,"Stating at the outset that they seek to prove probability does not truly exist, the authors then state their goal: to fuse the numbers that indicate risks related to various activities with the stories people tell themselves and others. In essence, they argue, calculating risk involves not just means and averages but the experiences we've had, society's general outlook, and the stories we tell ourselves and each other. Very good, but they attempt to accomplish this by creating three (or more) fictional characters to represent various types (cautious, normal, and risk-taking) and this fictional device annoys more than it illuminates. For every funny story involving our archetypes (in the coincidence chapter, for instance) we get more that are distasteful or too cheeky for serious consideration.They try to have fun, and the goal is a worthy one, but the aim is thrown off by the number of examples. A shorter book with fewer topics would have hit home harder, I think."

On any expedition, good guides are essential Michael Blastland is a journalist and co-author, but his content understanding is superficial and he doesn't write that well. This book could have been half its size, and it has a tedious, tongue-in-cheek, ""we're British, you know"" tone that wears early in the volume. Sir David John Spiegelhalter has all the statistical and mathematical creds, but I suspect that he was busy and leaned on his co-author too much.A reader interested in learning about how to understand and interpret statistics in every day life will still be searching for the one volume solution: this is not it.

187,0465085709,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1966542-rick,3,"The Norm Chronicles offers an interesting and amusing discussion of the risks inherent in a wide range of activities. Introducing the reader to three characters -- Norm, Prudence and Kelvin (aka, Average, Risk Averse and Thrill Seeker) -- the book then chronicles their lives from birth to old age through a series of vignettes that lead into a deeper discussion of risk.One of my favorites was the Banana-equivalency table, which converts radiation exposure of various sources -- all the way from 10 minutes standing next to the Chernobyl reactor after meltdown, to sleeping with someone -- into the number of bananas a person would need to consume in order to achieve a similar level of exposure. (The range, by the way, is 500 million down to 0.50.)The book is full of dry British humor, but the discussions cover the globe and side-by-side comparisons of British and U.S. data are offered on every topic.Definitely a worthwhile read. "
188,0465085709,http://goodreads.com/user/show/34578450-anil,3,"Fun to read, a bit too short. Blastland is good at outlining just how counter intuitive good statistical thinking is. Look at this little gem:""Suppose you’ve rounded up a thousand of the usual terrorist suspects...someone claims to have a lie detector that is 90 per cent accurate...the machine declares that 108 are probably lying. These are taken away, given orange suits and not seen again for years.But this means, believe it or not, that there were most likely to have been just 10 terrorists in the 1,000, even with ‘90 per cent accuracy’. The sums are fairly basic: the test would pick up 9 out of 10 of the real terrorists, letting one go free. But there were 990 innocent people, and the test would incorrectly classify 10 per cent of them – that’s 99 – as ‘terrorists’. That makes 9 + 99 = 108 people sent off to a remote prison, 99 of them wholly innocent – that’s 91 per cent of the accused wrongly incarcerated by a ‘90 per cent accurate’ test."""
189,0465085709,http://goodreads.com/user/show/213772-taylor,4,"This is an engaging non-fiction exploration about risk and how we feel about risk. I enjoyed this book on two levels: 1) lots and lots of information about risk itself, including some cool tools to compare risk (micro-morts and -lives) and 2) the exploration that the statistics don't really matter if we have a panic attack about how we feel about the risk and then lay down on the floor and don't live our lives. I was expecting the information, but was delightfully surprised by the acknowledgement of the role of emotions.If you're feeling stressed for time, you can dip in and out of this book -- typical strategies of reading the beginning and end, and any other interesting chapters will probably get you there. I also didn't agree with some of the conclusions in the middle chapters about some social science studies, but not so much to throw the book across the room in disgust. And apparently no enough to even remember the details now that I'm writing this up."

I am delighted to say that it is one of the best “science” books that I have ever read. Full of fascinating facts, statistics, and probabilities, The Norm Chronicles is a revelation of the actual, quantifiable, and statistical risks of various human activities and exposures and of natural (and cosmic) disasters. Every chapter is a fascinating ride examining big risks (e.g., “extreme sports”) and small (“space”). I am particularly intrigued (and horrified) by the real risks posed by hospitals and doctors throughout human history.

The two main thrusts of the book being, one, that life is probably not as scary as you think (at least if you live in the UK or USA), and, two, that all these risk and probability numbers are, finally, pretty limited, at least in terms of their ability to predict life events. (The authors attempt to make this second point mostly through the stories of three fictional characters... these sections of the book have heart, but are pretty hit and miss in terms of entertainment value.) Still, it's a fun book, yes yes, very fun. There's gotta be a ""tell your friend(s)"" anecdote/statistic on every other page.

The issue with this structure is that Prudence, Kelvin, and Norm’s sections are insufferable. They’re an odd mix of confusing and boring. They never add anything to the subsequent chapter. The book is called “The Norm Chronicles,” but Norm is so loathsome I couldn’t be bothered to finish the book. (Also, I ran out of time before I had to give it back to my brother.

In essence, they argue, calculating risk involves not just means and averages but the experiences we've had, society's general outlook, and the stories we tell ourselves and each other. Very good, but they attempt to accomplish this by creating three (or more) fictional characters to represent various types (cautious, normal, and risk-taking) and this fictional device annoys more than it illuminates. For every funny story involving our archetypes (in the coincidence chapter, for instance) we get more that are distasteful or too cheeky for serious consideration.They try to have fun, and the goal is a worthy one, but the aim is thrown off by the number of examples.

(The range, by the way, is 500 million down to 0.50.)The book is full of dry British humor, but the discussions cover the globe and side-by-side comparisons of British and U.S. data are offered on every topic.Definitely a worthwhile read.

These are taken away, given orange suits and not seen again for years.But this means, believe it or not, that there were most likely to have been just 10 terrorists in the 1,000, even with ‘90 per cent accuracy’. The sums are fairly basic: the test would pick up 9 out of 10 of the real terrorists, letting one go free. But there were 990 innocent people, and the test would incorrectly classify 10 per cent of them – that’s 99 – as ‘terrorists’. That makes 9 + 99 = 108 people sent off to a remote prison, 99 of them wholly innocent – that’s 91 per cent of the accused wrongly incarcerated by a ‘90 per cent accurate’ test."""

You might think this sounds morbid. Think again. These guys find fun ways to play with numbers. Who has not wondered how their life will end? Everyone is mortal, and Michael and David delight in the subject. They examine a wide variety of terminal situations. Since you are reading this, it's obvious that you did not die while emerging from the birth canal. That happens to be one of the many ways of dying that they examine. Since death while your mother was delivering you didn't happen, you may want to guess your lifespan by considering the biblical allotment of three scores and ten. That might not work for you though. Our lives are becoming longer on average. The book deals with murder and suicide. Chances of facing terminal situations because of breast cancer for women, or prostate cancer for men are covered. Skydiving and flying are looked at. You name the possible causes of death. They are probably covered in some way in the course of the book. There's surprisingly well-balanced and detailed statistical data from both the United States and the United Kingdom.If you are wondering why the book is called The Norm Chronicles, here is your answer. Norm is a guy named Norman. Of course since he is Norm, he has to be normal. He is talked about from his time in childhood all the way well into his adulthood. He is just your average sort of guy. You will meet other characters who are not so normal. Their names are just as intriguing as Norm's. See what I mean when I allude to this being a fun book?This is something worth your time, and you will learn things you never knew before. I got my copy through Goodreads First Reads, and found every minute with it to be highly enjoyable. "

He talks good sense and is very clear and accessible, so I was glad to see he'd written a book with Michael Blastland, who makes some excellent programmes on Radio 4 (More or Less is a particular favourite, stats nerd that I am). The book was good, I thought. The subtitle is ""Stories and Numbers About Danger"" and you pretty much get what it says on the tin. Starting with stories about prudent Prudence, average Norm and reckless Kelvin, they look at a number of different areas and explore both how people react to the risks involved and what the risks really are. The last point is the strongest element of the book. Risk is extremely hard to explain to people, but through the use of the startlingly clear concepts of MicroMorts and MicroLives, I think they've got it. The weak point was, in my opinion, the stories that opened each chapter about Prudence, Norm and Kelvin. They felt a bit off and like they obscured the issues rather than illuminated them. My reaction to them was more ""WTF?"" than ""a-ha!"".Nothing new here for someone with a background in the issues, but as a primer, I think this would work really well.MY GRADE: A B. "
242,0465085709,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3677821-pete,4,"The Norm Chronicles (2013) by Michael Blastland and David Spiegelhalter is an excellent look at risk in everyday life. Blastland is one of the creators of the wonderful More or Less radio program and Spiegelhalter is a statistician. The book has three characters, Norm, an average person in as many ways as possible, Prudence, who is always cautious and Kelvin who is a big risk taker. The three of them appear in each chapter and then the risks they are encountering are assessed. The book uses the MicroMort, which is a one in a million chance of death to compare risks. Later on the MicroLife is introduced, which is an extension or reduction of life expectancy due to some activity.The three characters and the comprehensible standard units provide a framework for calmly looking at the risks of cancer, transport, extreme sports, drinking and other activities that we all engage in. Risks are also compared through time and for different ages. The book is excellent non-fiction. The main characters provide anchor points and the discussions, facts and figures provide the substance of the book. It’s easy and fun to read and very much worth getting hold of. "

This book covers statistical risks in everyday life with fictional vignettes starring three characters: Prudence, Norm, and Kelvin. Prudence leads a careful life, worried about remote possibilities, while Kelvin takes every risk imaginable. Norm, as his name implies, represents the average person. Although the two authors are based in the UK, the majority of the data has been pulled from both US and UK sources, often making for interesting comparisons. Risky activities are compared to a one-in-a-million chance of death, termed a MicroMort. Lifestyle choices that have long term consequences (e.g., having 2 alcoholic drinks a day) are measured in terms of MicroLives, one millionth of the average lifespan. Statistically, the first alcoholic drink will add slightly to your lifespan, but the second takes away from it. Far and away the most humorous book about statistics I have ever seen. Full of fascinating data and clearly rigorously thought through, but accessible to the lay reader. I received this book through the First Reads program. "

270,0465085709,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7910615-james-banzer,5,"Authors Michael Blastland and David Spiegelhalter examine the chances of dying from a wide variety of causes. You might think this sounds morbid. Think again. These guys find fun ways to play with numbers. Who has not wondered how their life will end? Everyone is mortal, and Michael and David delight in the subject. They examine a wide variety of terminal situations. Since you are reading this, it's obvious that you did not die while emerging from the birth canal. That happens to be one of the many ways of dying that they examine. Since death while your mother was delivering you didn't happen, you may want to guess your lifespan by considering the biblical allotment of three scores and ten. That might not work for you though. Our lives are becoming longer on average. The book deals with murder and suicide. Chances of facing terminal situations because of breast cancer for women, or prostate cancer for men are covered. Skydiving and flying are looked at. You name the possible causes of death. They are probably covered in some way in the course of the book. There's surprisingly well-balanced and detailed statistical data from both the United States and the United Kingdom.If you are wondering why the book is called The Norm Chronicles, here is your answer. Norm is a guy named Norman. Of course since he is Norm, he has to be normal. He is talked about from his time in childhood all the way well into his adulthood. He is just your average sort of guy. You will meet other characters who are not so normal. Their names are just as intriguing as Norm's. See what I mean when I allude to this being a fun book?This is something worth your time, and you will learn things you never knew before. I got my copy through Goodreads First Reads, and found every minute with it to be highly enjoyable. "
271,0465085709,http://goodreads.com/user/show/13656797-rosario-http-rosario-blogspot-com,4,"Risk and how people understand it, process it and react to it is a big part of my job, and I've often had the occassion to hear David Spiegelhalter speak about the issue (he's Winton Professor for the Public Understanding of Risk at Cambridge). He talks good sense and is very clear and accessible, so I was glad to see he'd written a book with Michael Blastland, who makes some excellent programmes on Radio 4 (More or Less is a particular favourite, stats nerd that I am). The book was good, I thought. The subtitle is ""Stories and Numbers About Danger"" and you pretty much get what it says on the tin. Starting with stories about prudent Prudence, average Norm and reckless Kelvin, they look at a number of different areas and explore both how people react to the risks involved and what the risks really are. The last point is the strongest element of the book. Risk is extremely hard to explain to people, but through the use of the startlingly clear concepts of MicroMorts and MicroLives, I think they've got it. The weak point was, in my opinion, the stories that opened each chapter about Prudence, Norm and Kelvin. They felt a bit off and like they obscured the issues rather than illuminated them. My reaction to them was more ""WTF?"" than ""a-ha!"".Nothing new here for someone with a background in the issues, but as a primer, I think this would work really well.MY GRADE: A B. "
272,0465085709,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3677821-pete,4,"The Norm Chronicles (2013) by Michael Blastland and David Spiegelhalter is an excellent look at risk in everyday life. Blastland is one of the creators of the wonderful More or Less radio program and Spiegelhalter is a statistician. The book has three characters, Norm, an average person in as many ways as possible, Prudence, who is always cautious and Kelvin who is a big risk taker. The three of them appear in each chapter and then the risks they are encountering are assessed. The book uses the MicroMort, which is a one in a million chance of death to compare risks. Later on the MicroLife is introduced, which is an extension or reduction of life expectancy due to some activity.The three characters and the comprehensible standard units provide a framework for calmly looking at the risks of cancer, transport, extreme sports, drinking and other activities that we all engage in. Risks are also compared through time and for different ages. The book is excellent non-fiction. The main characters provide anchor points and the discussions, facts and figures provide the substance of the book. It’s easy and fun to read and very much worth getting hold of. "
273,0465085709,http://goodreads.com/user/show/12534347-phil-smith,5,"The Norm Chronicles had me laughing from the front matter on. This book covers statistical risks in everyday life with fictional vignettes starring three characters: Prudence, Norm, and Kelvin. Prudence leads a careful life, worried about remote possibilities, while Kelvin takes every risk imaginable. Norm, as his name implies, represents the average person. Although the two authors are based in the UK, the majority of the data has been pulled from both US and UK sources, often making for interesting comparisons. Risky activities are compared to a one-in-a-million chance of death, termed a MicroMort. Lifestyle choices that have long term consequences (e.g., having 2 alcoholic drinks a day) are measured in terms of MicroLives, one millionth of the average lifespan. Statistically, the first alcoholic drink will add slightly to your lifespan, but the second takes away from it. Far and away the most humorous book about statistics I have ever seen. Full of fascinating data and clearly rigorously thought through, but accessible to the lay reader. I received this book through the First Reads program. "
274,0465085709,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1398269-leah-lucci,2,"What’s actually going to kill you? What are the chances you’ll die going about your day? What about the day you give birth? How dangerous is it to be at different ages? How dangerous are drugs or skydiving, really? This book is a statistical analysis. In order to make the subject less dry, the authors introduce three characters: “Prudence,” the safety addict,“Kelvin,” the risk-taker, and“Norm,” the statistically-average man.The beginning of each chapter is the three of them going about their lives in their typical fashion. It focuses on whatever topic is to follow. Each of their approaches yields a different result. Then the numbers enter. The issue with this structure is that Prudence, Kelvin, and Norm’s sections are insufferable. They’re an odd mix of confusing and boring. They never add anything to the subsequent chapter. The book is called “The Norm Chronicles,” but Norm is so loathsome I couldn’t be bothered to finish the book. (Also, I ran out of time before I had to give it back to my brother. But I probably would not have finished it anyway.)"
275,0465085709,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1058994-ryan-mishap,3,"Stating at the outset that they seek to prove probability does not truly exist, the authors then state their goal: to fuse the numbers that indicate risks related to various activities with the stories people tell themselves and others. In essence, they argue, calculating risk involves not just means and averages but the experiences we've had, society's general outlook, and the stories we tell ourselves and each other. Very good, but they attempt to accomplish this by creating three (or more) fictional characters to represent various types (cautious, normal, and risk-taking) and this fictional device annoys more than it illuminates. For every funny story involving our archetypes (in the coincidence chapter, for instance) we get more that are distasteful or too cheeky for serious consideration.They try to have fun, and the goal is a worthy one, but the aim is thrown off by the number of examples. A shorter book with fewer topics would have hit home harder, I think."
276,0465085709,http://goodreads.com/user/show/21906129-eapen-chacko,1,"This is a book that needed to be written, viz. an easy to read, clear tour of statistics in everyday fields like medicine, insurance, education, heath care, politics and finance. On any expedition, good guides are essential Michael Blastland is a journalist and co-author, but his content understanding is superficial and he doesn't write that well. This book could have been half its size, and it has a tedious, tongue-in-cheek, ""we're British, you know"" tone that wears early in the volume. Sir David John Spiegelhalter has all the statistical and mathematical creds, but I suspect that he was busy and leaned on his co-author too much.A reader interested in learning about how to understand and interpret statistics in every day life will still be searching for the one volume solution: this is not it. Much better to browse individual items at SDJS's website: http://www.statslab.cam.ac.uk/Dept/Pe..."
277,0465085709,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1966542-rick,3,"The Norm Chronicles offers an interesting and amusing discussion of the risks inherent in a wide range of activities. Introducing the reader to three characters -- Norm, Prudence and Kelvin (aka, Average, Risk Averse and Thrill Seeker) -- the book then chronicles their lives from birth to old age through a series of vignettes that lead into a deeper discussion of risk.One of my favorites was the Banana-equivalency table, which converts radiation exposure of various sources -- all the way from 10 minutes standing next to the Chernobyl reactor after meltdown, to sleeping with someone -- into the number of bananas a person would need to consume in order to achieve a similar level of exposure. (The range, by the way, is 500 million down to 0.50.)The book is full of dry British humor, but the discussions cover the globe and side-by-side comparisons of British and U.S. data are offered on every topic.Definitely a worthwhile read. "
278,0465085709,http://goodreads.com/user/show/34578450-anil,3,"Fun to read, a bit too short. Blastland is good at outlining just how counter intuitive good statistical thinking is. Look at this little gem:""Suppose you’ve rounded up a thousand of the usual terrorist suspects...someone claims to have a lie detector that is 90 per cent accurate...the machine declares that 108 are probably lying. These are taken away, given orange suits and not seen again for years.But this means, believe it or not, that there were most likely to have been just 10 terrorists in the 1,000, even with ‘90 per cent accuracy’. The sums are fairly basic: the test would pick up 9 out of 10 of the real terrorists, letting one go free. But there were 990 innocent people, and the test would incorrectly classify 10 per cent of them – that’s 99 – as ‘terrorists’. That makes 9 + 99 = 108 people sent off to a remote prison, 99 of them wholly innocent – that’s 91 per cent of the accused wrongly incarcerated by a ‘90 per cent accurate’ test."""
279,0465085709,http://goodreads.com/user/show/213772-taylor,4,"This is an engaging non-fiction exploration about risk and how we feel about risk. I enjoyed this book on two levels: 1) lots and lots of information about risk itself, including some cool tools to compare risk (micro-morts and -lives) and 2) the exploration that the statistics don't really matter if we have a panic attack about how we feel about the risk and then lay down on the floor and don't live our lives. I was expecting the information, but was delightfully surprised by the acknowledgement of the role of emotions.If you're feeling stressed for time, you can dip in and out of this book -- typical strategies of reading the beginning and end, and any other interesting chapters will probably get you there. I also didn't agree with some of the conclusions in the middle chapters about some social science studies, but not so much to throw the book across the room in disgust. And apparently no enough to even remember the details now that I'm writing this up."

I am delighted to say that it is one of the best “science” books that I have ever read. Full of fascinating facts, statistics, and probabilities, The Norm Chronicles is a revelation of the actual, quantifiable, and statistical risks of various human activities and exposures and of natural (and cosmic) disasters. Every chapter is a fascinating ride examining big risks (e.g., “extreme sports”) and small (“space”). I am particularly intrigued (and horrified) by the real risks posed by hospitals and doctors throughout human history. Likewise, I am surprised (and edified) by the real, quantifiable benefits of moderate coffee consumption! I heartily recommend this book; the “probability” is that you will enjoy it as much as I."

The two main thrusts of the book being, one, that life is probably not as scary as you think (at least if you live in the UK or USA), and, two, that all these risk and probability numbers are, finally, pretty limited, at least in terms of their ability to predict life events. (The authors attempt to make this second point mostly through the stories of three fictional characters... these sections of the book have heart, but are pretty hit and miss in terms of entertainment value.) Still, it's a fun book, yes yes, very fun. There's gotta be a ""tell your friend(s)"" anecdote/statistic on every other page. Especially mind-bending for me was the chapter on space, cuz, you know, space."

Especially in terms of media coverage, it's almost impossible to understand what me mean when we talk about risk. Reading ""The Norm Chronicles"" will help. I'd even go so far as to recommend this book as the basis for a mandatory high school class to improve risk probability literacy, since so many life decisions are informed by this kind of data.Highly recommended, I'm willing to loan this out locally (and to anyone who is likely to return it elsewhere) since it's a UK publication and (as far as I can tell) not yet commercially available in the U.S."

The short stories are written in a fast informal style. I did have some trouble reading the stories I think because I'm not a native English speaker. But in the en I could understand everything. You hardly need any math skills. It does make you look more closely at the numbers you read in the papers and at the we you yourself assess risk. f you like this subject you should try and listen to the BBC podcast ""More Or Less""."
