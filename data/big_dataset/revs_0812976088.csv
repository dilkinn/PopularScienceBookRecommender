0,0812976088,http://goodreads.com/user/show/269235-david-schaafsma,4,"I read parts of this book in 1989 when it came out, excerpted in various liberal and environmental magazines and in the NY Times. McKibben, one of the leading environmental writers of our time, wrote in The End of Nature a groundbreaking and powerful and angry book which I have now re-read in its entirety. Well, as you can guess from the title, it is not a hopeful little book about what you can do to contribute to saving the planet; it is, rather, a story documenting everything that happened because, having been warned of the coming environmental crisis already in the seventies, we have done almost nothing over twenty years to respond to what scientists continue to scream about. Who is this ""we"" that I McKibben refers to? By ""we"" he means the West, and primarily the United States, corporations, the oil industry, politicians, who have taken the lead, of all the ""developed"" countries, in most resembling an ostrich (or is some more predatory and self-seeking animal?) on climate change. Things may in the last year seem to be slowly beginning to change, many countries are moving boldly to act, but in 1989 McKibben was already saying it was too late to retain any hope for continuing to embrace an idea resembling what we had thought was ""nature"" in, say, the early twentieth century. The dead bird on the cover says it all. Earth as we know it is dead, or soon will be, McKibben makes clear.This is a newer edition of the book, produced 17 years later in 20o6, with a new preface to say things had--ten years ago now--only gotten worse, of course. I only read it to prepare to read one of his more recent books, Eaarth, which I have been told includes some hopeful pronouncements about the greater and louder global movement to save the planet, helped a little by the Obama administration. We'll see. I'm not optimistic about seeing a lot of McKibben optimism.We know that the majority of Republicans in this country--the US--seem to believe (as if ""belief"" were something like a fact in the face of scientific evidence) that climate change is some kind of liberal, anti-business hoax. Almost no other country in the world has millions of people who (seem to?) think that everything is basically just fine, and science be damned. And how does this come about? Politicians--including most democratic politicians, are bought by the coal industry, and by Big Oil, just as they have been bought by Big Pharm and once were bought by Big Tobacco, and so on. I recall one of Reagan's first acts as President was dismantling Carter's solar panels: Solar panels, Reagan ""reasoned,"" sends a bad message to the Oil Industry, on which we are so (suicidally) dependent, and still are. Mid ""review"" rant alert: As I drove up to backpack over Labor Day weekend with my family on the south shore of Lake Superior, on the 43 miles of uninhabited Pictured Rocks National Lakeshore, I heard Rush Limbaugh on the radio pontificate about the Hoax of Climate Change for an hour. It's just sunspots, a mild aberration, Rush says. Green house gases and the Ozone layer are just bull hockey the libtards have made up. Man did and does nothing bad, ever, to the planet, unless of course it's those commies, the Chinese, unless of course we need to borrow money from them then even they are okay; the point is that we need to Stay the Rapacious Course and continue to do as we have always done, using the planet's resources with wild abandon and no fear for the future. Progress, Bigger is Better, as always. Small is Beautiful by E. F. Schumacher was just a dream some of us had.Because I listened to Rush, I also spent a couple hours doing something I never do, watching some Faux News, or State TV, the US's most watched source of television ""news"" which has, bought by Big Oil, that has never acknowledged there is any environmental crisis whatsoever. Both Fox News and Rush LOVE to hate Bill McKibben, no surprise. They excoriated him for this book and everything he has written since.Trump has said he does not believe in climate change and he now appears the growing favorite to win the presidential election. When he wins, he says he will pull back on any (of the already tepid) commitments Obama made to finally work against climate change, pull out of the tepid Paris accords, and most of Trump's almost unanimous Republican supporters agree with that move, natch. Liberals and their anti-American, anti-progress conspiracies, haha. But even if Hillary wins, she is no environmental leader.We are so screwed. But I will read one more McKibben book in search of any hope to report here. If I can make a list of ten hopeful things I find there, I promise to share them.McKibben did write this other book in 1995, which I haven't read, in response to the outcry that he hadn't been chipper enough, so if you wanna read only hopeful environmental books, here ya go:https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/1...As for me, I choose the narrow path of depressing realism. :)"

But is it right?Predicting a Chaotic System is BY DEFINITION impossible. Climate is a Chaotic System. Ensembles are used to try to mitigate the nature of a Chaotic System by extending how far out one might be able to present probabilities for different scenarios. This is done with weather forecasts all the time. They use ensembles which is why they present the possibility of rain next Thursday as a probability. But as you know, these are often wrong. So if they are right, there is an element of luck involved as the conditions that will (or will not), cause it to rain in five days are changing by the minute. The calculation of climate variables (that is long term averages) is much easier than weather forecasting, since weather is ruled by vagaries of stochastic fluctuations, while climate is not. We can demonstrate this sort of climate response clearly in the Lorenz model, or any more complex climate model. Perturbing the initial conditions gives a completely different trajectory (weather), but this averages out over time, and the statistics of different long-term runs are indistinguishable. However a steady perturbation to the system can generate a significant change to the long-term statistics. This disproves the common but misguided claim that chaotic weather prevents meaningful climate prediction. In fact, all climate models do predict that the change in globally-averaged steady state temperature, at least, is almost exactly proportional to the change in the net radioactive forcing, indicating a near-linear response of the climate, at least on the broadest scales."
2,0812976088,http://goodreads.com/user/show/83445-lisa-vegan,5,"This book presents the sobering idea that there is no longer such as thing as nature, because humans have caused such massive changes by their presence and behaviors; that humans have altered everything (including all forms of plant and animal life) on earth. I read the book when it was first published in hardback form, and it made immediate sense to me, unfortunately. I’ll never be able to look at “nature” in exactly the same way as I did, although I can still enjoy what there is of it, and feel even more motivated to protect what remains."
3,0812976088,http://goodreads.com/user/show/127248-anna,2,The great problem with this book was the way it approaches nature--namely that he wants to leave humans out of it. He seems more angry that we exist as a part of the world than interested in thinking of productive ways of dealing with the the concerns regarding the environment that we are facing.
4,0812976088,http://goodreads.com/user/show/454028-kate,4,"Dragged myself through this puppy. It was a tough go, but I somehow felt it was the environmentally responsible thing to do. Basically he makes the point very forcefully that we really have paved paradise. Damn. I recommend putting away all sharp objects and hiding anything that can be used to hang yourself before reading this book. Dead bird on cover says it all."
5,0812976088,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3506592-michael,5,"Read this one several years ago, but it's been much on my mind lately so I thought I'd put up my review. In 1988, a 19 year old me was living quite happily in a cloud of pot smoke in Orono, Maine. My roommate, a great guy we called Woody (because that's what he was) was waving a copy of this book around and explaining to me an idea he'd just learned about in one of his tree-hugger classes (he was a Forestry major) called 'the green house effect.' Apparently, Woody told me, mankind was releasing all of this CO2 into the atmosphere, which served to trap heat and would raise global temperatures enough to cause unpleasantness upon our planet. Twenty-six years ago, Woody told me I should read this book. Woody now lives off the grid in Vermont with his wife and three kids. They use solar panels, they homeschool, and they pretty much live the Little House on the Prairie lifestyle that I so admire. About three years ago, I went to Vermont for the weekend and brought a copy of this book, which served as both an introduction to the work of Bill McKibben and a hat tip to my woodsy friend from long ago. I was reminded of this book, and of McKibben's rumination on the idea of nature (vs. actual nature) as I've been reading another book by Wendell Berry. In any event, all of this was gelling together in my head this morning: Maine, greenhouse gases, nature, Woody, Bill McKibben, and Wendell Berry. So there you have it. It is a great book. I wish I had read it when I first saw it. I wish I had paid more attention to environmentalism when I had the time to get myself arrested at a protest, or live in a burrow with my hippy friends. Sadly, I am now firmly ensconced in the machine. Ah, youth. It truly is wasted on the young. "
6,0812976088,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5032322-carol-storm,4,"Makes a lot of important points, but I could do without the holier-than-thou attitude and the constant undercurrent of hysteria. Oh, and this guy name drops the wild animals he runs into in the woods the way Donald Trump name drops the lingerie models he slept with in the Eighties. "
7,0812976088,http://goodreads.com/user/show/9636719-jessica,2,"Firstly, I have to remark that I am an admirer of McKibben and his environmentalist work, particularly his participation as of late in stopping the Keystone XL pipeline. And the End of Nature does have some useful information and thought-provoking moments. I stand by and relate to McKibben's discussion of the inevitable hypocrisy of any modern-day environmentalist, the urgency of global warming, the disturbing possibilities that bio-engineering makes possible, the unfortunate dilemma of whether or not to bring a child into the world we live in, etc. However, I find the main premise of this book, ""the end of nature,"" to be feeble and often contradicted within the very text of the book, particularly in his discussion of deep ecology. McKibbon's declaration of the end of nature relies on three assumptions that I find to be incorrect. Firstly, it is based on the assumption that man is separate from nature. McKibben suggests that anyone who claims otherwise does not really believe it. I wholeheartedly disagree. The environmental mess that we find ourselves in today has been caused by this attitude; a denial that we are in fact just like any other animal, a part of nature. McKibben, in my opinion, places too much power in the hands of humanity. Humanity may think it can tame nature, but it can't, no matter how much scientific, techno-junk and theory we produce. McKibben's insistence on this point seems to stem largely from his Christian background which peppers the text and to which I hold no loyalty.Secondly, (a point that it is tied to the first) McKibbon is working with a definition of wilderness that equates it to only that which has been untouched by the human hand. This definition of wilderness is illusory and not based in reality. One must look to nature everywhere, as Cronon discusses in Uncommon Ground: Rethinking the Human Place in Nature. McKibben too easily casts aside the importance of the changes that humanity has been bringing upon the earth for thousands of years. To him, the only environmental change that has truly mattered is global warming, a change which he directly relates to white, western culture. He makes no reference to the changes that Native Americans and other similar populations around the world have been making to the environment for generations(such as Native Americans creating the Great Plains through the use of fire). However, to admit that these changes are significant would debunk McKibben's argument, because they would demonstrate that separating man from nature is impossible because man is a part of nature. Lastly, McKibben seems to be working with a conception of nature as a static entity, something that has remained unchanged for as long as humanity can remember. Nature has ended, according to McKibben, because this static nature no longer exists. This, I would argue, is failed logic because nature is, has and always will be dynamic. McKibbon claims that ""old nature"" was ""utterly dependable"" and that ""new nature"" is unpredictable. This claim is ridiculous, nature has always been unpredictable. Nature is continuously evolving. McKibben's most important piece of evidence for his argument is the unpredictability and violence of weather under the influence of global warming. I, personally find this piece of evidence to be the strongest argument against McKibbon's ""end of nature."" Surely the violence of today's weather is a sign that nature is alive and reacting against man's actions, not bowing down and succumbing to man's supposed scientific superiority. Although the Gaia theory may not be entirely correct, I don't think it should be knocked down so readily. Nature will continue on in ways we cannot foresee long after humanity no longer exists. "
8,0812976088,http://goodreads.com/user/show/76450-camille,3,"This book holds a lot of truth and McKibben's argument is convincing and strong, and thus it may be the most depressing book I've ever read."
9,0812976088,http://goodreads.com/user/show/879420-jonathan,2,"This book was a let-down. I know that Mckiben is an important thinker and leader when it comes to getting folks to acknowledge climate change and in moving folks to attempt to take action to address the causes of climate change. I am not sure what I would have thought about it had I read it twenty years ago, but reading it today, while I found the descriptions of the problems of climate change and certainly the idea of an “end of nature” compelling, I found McKibbin’s construction of the ways we might respond to climate change obnoxious and tiresome. (Actually, I think I do know what I would have thought twenty years ago… I would have loved it. As a fifteen year old I was completely taken with the mainstream environmental movement. I was very susceptible to any well-written position about the environment: liberal, corporate green washed, or “militant,” and I would have been excited to read McKibbin’s analysis and his explanation of the futurist response to climate change I know I would have been completely taken by his description of deep ecology. When I entered college a few years later and met young people involved in EarthFirst!, I would have engaged in some kind of hero worship, would have felt like I had finally found “my people” and probably plunged head first into the kind of vision of environmental activism that they held out. Instead having never read McKibbin's flowing endorsement of a deep ecology approach to activism I found them on the one hand dangerously exciting but on the other wondered how they reconciled a position of “earth first” with issues of social justice.)I actually found McKibbin’s proclamation of the “end of nature” interesting. While his sense of personal loss that nature no longer existed, didn’t quite resonate with me, the idea raises all kinds of existential and, I guess, ‘spiritual’ questions. In all honesty, even though McKibbin’s thinking has been available to me the past twenty years, the idea that “nature” as we have traditionally thought about it no longer exists was new to me. His argument is a good and shocking one.It was when McKibbon turned to how we might respond to climate change that the book became tiresome to me. Admittedly McKibbon gives an interesting treatment to the, bio-engineered man over nature, futurist response. Twenty years ago the grotesque description of this response that McKibbon lays out would have been really helpful to me, because I at the time I was pretty ready to uncritically accept any number of claims by industry or science that we could invent/innovate our way out of ecological crisis. Having this Frankenstein version of our future laid before me would have helped me be more critical of green washing and technocratic solutions to ecological and environmental justice issues. McKibbon’s championing of deep ecology was really where I felt let down. Yes, he did write about some of the social and economic injustices related to climate change. Particularly he did a good job explaining why uneven patterns of “development” make western capitalist “core” communities’ talk about the need to get by with less, have a smaller ecological impact, etc so hypocritical. But he ignored the reality that there have been and continue to be voices from those “less developed” poorer more peripheral more recently colonized communities that have something to say about the relationship between people and our environment, about the causes of environmental, about what humane and ecological ways of organizing our societies in response to climate change and the end of nature might look like. One might feel it is unfair to fault McKibbon for ignoring these voices in 1989 – the environmental justice movement would not even be labeled and given wide recognition until 1991. But the voices of the communities organizing against environmental racism in the US, the voices of communities directly impacted by every step of the C02 cycle,* the voices of radical third world ecologists, the voices of indigenous peoples all of the world were out there. McKibbon was just another in a long line of folks like Muir, Hoffeman, and Foreman as well as the big mainstream environmental groups and the militants of EarthFirst who didn’t take the time to listen to, learn from and then amplify those voices. I don’t give the big environmental groups a pass on ignoring the environmental justice movement back in the late 80’s and early 90’s, and I just can’t give McKibbon a pass either. It is ironic because in a way McKibbon is trying to ‘unpack’ our understanding of nature as this independent force and our assumptions about how humans relate to nature, and it is in part these mainstream understandings and assumptions about nature that minimized or devalued the voices of folks other than western white males in determining how societies might respond to ecological crisis. Looking more deeply at how we’ve constructed “nature,” as McKibbon leads us to do, forces us to think about how our understanding of the environment and our impact on it is as much about social and economic organization as it is anything inherent in humans or our environment.I just wish McKibbon had acknowledged that there is another choice between human’s engineering every aspect of the earth so that it meets our needs and wilderness = earth and earth uber alis position of deep ecology: and that is that while humans are not inherently more valuable than other life, we as humans we do have a responsibility to other humans and thus trying to our vision of social and economic relationships between has to be part of our understanding ecology. It just does not make sense to organize around an vision for social and economic change that does not prioritize the voices, understandings, and hopes of peoples that have been most directly impacted by environmental destruction, social injustice, economic exploitation, colonization, and domination. "
10,0812976088,http://goodreads.com/user/show/63674657-gemma-field,2,Starts off strong but quickly degenerates into reactionary hysteria. One extra star to Bill McKibben for making global climate change all about him
11,0812976088,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5836830-ian-robertson,4,"Bill McKibben has become a force in the environmental movement through his writing and his leadership at the climate change advocacy and activism organization ‘350.org’. His first book, The End of Nature, is an important call to action to combat climate change, and a natural successor to Rachel Carson’s seminal book, Silent Spring, which focused more narrowly on the impact of pesticides on the environment. McKibben’s book is, given the additional twenty years of environmental impact studies and the emerging understanding of human caused climate change, appropriately broader in scope than is Carson’s. It is also, given its broad scope based upon emerging science, a less focused and more aspirational call to action than Carson’s pesticide-based alarm bell.For example, when the book was first published there still existed scientific debate about whether the climate was warming or cooling, and though McKibben gives space to both points of view, distilling the key points from reputable scientific bodies (NASA, NOAA, various universities) he leans towards the warming trend. We know now that climate change is a more apt description than global warming, because the latter implies to most that it will be a gradual increase with similar impact everywhere - consistent with McKibben's linear examples - and not the unpredictable and variable impact we are currently experiencing.  (For example, due to oceanic and atmospheric patterns, sea level increases have been shown to be localized and much larger around Florida and the Carolinas than in many other areas).Despite his caution that the subject is complex, and that the outcomes are wildly uncertain, McKibben nonetheless resorts often to simple cause and effect examples, such as ""The ocean rises; I build a wall; the marsh dies, and, with it, the fish.""  In fact, McKibben does this so often that The End of Nature at times almost verges on speculative fiction, something better left to Margaret Atwood (see for example, The Handmaid’s Tale). Written 30 years ago, the book is also a bit dated in its examples, and in its repeated references to nuclear weapons - a threat which hasn't diminished (perhaps even increased with the rise of certain rogue states), but which has generally shifted from an awestruck horror to a grudging acceptance within society.  Still, though they are dated, the nuclear references are natural and appropriate comparators to our potential destruction of nature.  And on another front McKibben is ahead of the curve warning that our prolific genetic engineering is a looming, additional End of Nature.There are many biblical references in book, which is a bit surprising for a secular subject and a pluralistic audience, though perhaps that's just a sign of the book's age.  The effect is a subtle yearning for a lost era – not just for when our environmental footprint didn’t loom so large, but also for when a Western European ethos ruled in America.The quibbles noted above are minor, though, and can be forgiven as the message McKibben delivers has only become more important over the past 30 years. The End of Nature is an important call to action from an important environmental figure. It should be read today by all with an interest in the environmental movement and the signature works that have helped advance the cause. "
12,0812976088,http://goodreads.com/user/show/93990-ashley,4,"This is not an easy book to read. It's not that it's dense or overly technical. In fact, it's admirably brief and succinct. Closer to a long essay than a full-fledged nonfiction book. It's the experience of reading it that's so tough. The context of McKibben's classic is key--it was written in 1989 by a young man (28). So it was both prophetic and ahead of its time, while also being the work of a writer who had not yet reached maturity. (This latter point is acknowledged by McKibben in the introduction to this edition.) The first section of this book (The Present, containing ""The New Atmosphere"" and ""The End of Nature"") is probably the most emotionally difficult to read for anyone who thinks about climate, nature, and the future of this planet. It is stark in outlining what we've done, as carbon users, to the natural world around us. Along with climate change, McKibben spend a great deal of time on the ozone hole (remember that!?). At the time this book was published, this was of grave concern: like climate change, it had been a disaster caused by humans, and like climate change, it could have adverse effects. However, we know, reading this, that humans acted and these disasters were averted. But what sits with you is knowing that climate change cannot be solved in the same way. Its complexity, its maturity as a problem, its touches-every-living-thing character, and the unlikeliness that we will change any of the habits that created it makes is distressingly different from a hole in the ozone. So there's a weird irony to reading the book, along with the way it stimulates climate grief, shame, and hopelessness. Know this going in: there's little to no hope in this book. And if McKibben had no hope in 1989, you can imagine how that reads now. Yes, some of the worst of the predictions have not yet come true by the time he thought they might, but as you look around you now, you can see that being off by a matter of a couple decades really matters little. Another area he explores is genetic engineering, something that I feel is a bit of a red herring, though we only recognize that now, all these years later. So McKibben's fear that we'll have robot rabbits in the forest or chicken farms consisting only of living chicken torsos were not realized and seem a little silly in retrospect. I give this book four stars because of its importance in terms of being the first work of popular nonfiction to address climate change frankly. But in terms of the argument, I have many quibbles. I don't like the premise of ""the end of Nature."" I don't think it works. McKibben argues that because we have altered Nature, via many means but mainly through things like climate change, insidious chemicals in our air and soil, and (I'm adding this because it wasn't an issue in 1989 bus now) microplastics in our oceans, fish, the bodies of animals, Nature is dead. Because it has interfaced with humanity and been altered by it, it no longer exists. And the reason it no longer exists, according to McKibben, is because it can no longer be separate. That is the premise of Nature to him--something wholly apart from us. I disagree with this idea entirely and consider it weirdly hubristic. That's because Nature cannot end. Nature can end us, and at the moment, it certainly looks like that's what it is justly trying to do. But at the same time, our strengths as a species also makes us uniquely poised to aid and help Nature. McKibben takes a very dark view of the efforts to set aside vast tracts of wilderness in the U.S.--in this book he says that it's a selfish motive, because the tracts were set aside so humans could enter them and experience solitude. I think that's reductionist and wrongheaded. There are countless people who agree with him that Nature should exist for its own sake, not just for what it can offer human beings in terms of resources (physical or emotional). But what I see in that is the possibilities in the human mind and in human hands to correct, to heal, to help. One example of this is in the efforts of a former Texas businessman to restore a degraded landscape (David Bamberger , video here ). Here is someone who took a natural environment that had been nearly killed by human beings, and restored it using the human ingenuity that caused its destruction in the first place. McKibben quotes Walter Truett Anderson: ""We find now that the human predicament is not quite so devoid of inherent purpose after all. To be caretakers of a planet, custodians of all its life forms and shapers of its (and our own) future is certainly purpose enough."" McKibben ridicules this idea, saying it ""depresses me more deeply than I can say."" His argument is that by being custodians of what he calls a ""managed world"" we strip the mystery from the natural world. Yes, if we do this on some sort of sci-fi global scale, sure. But is this how he would characterize what David Bamberger is doing? What I'm doing with my own forest, growing trees from pinecones and seedlings and then transplanting them around my property in order to create shelter for my animal neighbors? Picking up a pinecone on a walk and then bringing it back to your yard and planting it--how is that any different than what a squirrel does with an acorn? What a bee does with pollen. Are squirrels and bees ""custodians""? Yes, they are. Just like the many different animals that work within their ecosystem to propagate other species. That is management--that is custodianship. And I think that idea is a key to getting people to act. I found it interesting that McKibben, a religious man, found this idea so odious, when the Bible instructs human beings to be custodians of their world.More and more I realize that it is that feeling of separateness from Nature that McKibben extols in this book that keeps people from doing anything about this looming catastrophe. If we could figure out a way to get people to understand that they are part of Nature, that we owe it to the natural world to try to restore it, to protect it, to love it so that we don't harm it, then maybe people would act. Maybe they wouldn't build drain the marsh and build the enormous megamansion. Maybe they'd consider the electric car when their old car breaks down. So when McKibben says it would be better to adhere to Sartre's ""neutral purposeless"" than to caretake the planet, it falls flat for me. And that is what I mean when I say that this is not the work of a totally mature writer. And frankly, it made me angry because it felt like a very privileged world view. That all being said, I suspect much of his ire about caretaking came from his concern about genetic engineering, a subject that distresses him and which did not seem to unfold in the ways he feared. I don't consider that caretaking Nature. And it's not a great fit in this book. I found it to be a distraction. Whew. So anyway--this is written by someone who admires McKibben greatly, considers him a prophet of sorts, an important science communicator. I admire his willingness to tell us the uncomfortable truth. I've followed the way he's changed over time. One thing that hasn't changed is in the dire threat climate change poses to the world and the fact that we seem to be unwilling to change. We're going to follow this ship all the way down, aren't we? We'll take some of the natural world with us. But the natural world will survive us, even if we won't. It will shake us off, like the parasites we've become, and it will reinvent itself. There is the end of species, perhaps us, but there is no end of nature."
13,0812976088,http://goodreads.com/user/show/19341029-aur-lien-thomas,3,"We have by now pumped out so much toxic gases into the atmosphere that a significant increase in temperature and its effect upon 'Nature' is inevitable. And?Published in 1990, this book is interesting for more than a reason. First, written at a time when climate change and its expected dramatic consequences were not as mediatised as now, you have to salute the author for its foresight: he here predicts all the toxic effects to come of our industrial societies; effects that we can clearly see all around (unpredictable and dangerous weather, natural catastrophes not only multiplying themselves but being more and more intense, increase in some medical conditions -allergies, asthmas, cancers...). Then, and most importantly, because he advances here an original and striking theory: we have in fact affected our environment in such a dramatic way, that the concept of 'nature' itself as we knew it will be on its way out. Indeed, if our ancestor defined nature as 'savage', 'wild', 'virgin', in a word free from the interferences of human civilisation, for younger generations and the ones that will follow such concepts will be meaningless and anything but true. Echoing Rachel Carson who had made the point before him, he is here stating the now well-acknowledged fact that even in the most remote corners of the globe the impact of human activities can be deeply felt - you don't need to have human beings actually living in those parts for their ecosystems to be out of balance. So much, then, for 'wild' and 'virgin'!Now, being of a different generation, he, of course, regrets such redefining and loss. Well... I personally confess, though, to have found him here uselessly dabbling with rampant sentimentalism (maybe readers of my generation or being younger will have the same attitude as mine?). Who cares indeed for a Walden-type of life? I don't.I don't, yet it doesn't mean his argument is irrelevant to me. In fact, as always when concepts are being redefined, the consequences can be massive, and in that case they talk to us all. 'Nature' is indeed more than a word, and as a metamorphosing idea it brings to the fore a few questions we will all have to face. Natural 'cycles' becoming more and more meaningless, then how are we are going to cope? What will be the impact of a weather now being so deregulated that it has turned unreliable; for example on agriculture? The author strikes here another chord: like it or not, most of the solutions will be brought about by science and technologies... and it thus close his point very nicely by nailing it even further! Our reliance on science and technologies will indeed makes what is perceived as 'natural' even more obsolete too (don't we see this increasingly happening with our food?). Here's a fascinating read. Yes, I was a tat annoyed by his over-sentimentalism and nostalgic outlook towards a past now way gone. He certainly is right about climate change and the fact that nature has been affected beyond repair, but then it's time to get on with it! Being sorrowful should no longer be on the agendas. Yet, and this is what makes it such a necessary read, this is not a condemnation or an indictment. Here's just a statement of fact: as a result of climate change, the concept of 'nature' itself is changing, and such a change has consequences on how we should deal with our environment. You could be excused to have questioned him thirty years ago; but, now, such rethinking has become quite urgent and necessary.Here's an interesting and insightful argument."
14,0812976088,http://goodreads.com/user/show/45447490-guy-barnhart,3,"Be prepared for an incredibly depressing read. This book was originally published in 1989, which was when I was a toddler. While many of the predictions in this book have come true, we're still finding out how much of an impact climate change will have on our planet, from increasing ocean acidity, to mega droughts and powerful hurricanes which are already exacerbating other issues. Obviously, this book will feel dated in some sections if you've been keeping up with the growing body of knowledge surrounding climate change, but it is helpful seeing how these issues were understood nearly 3 decades ago.The depressing parts? Well, the fact that in the last 30 years since this book was published, we've barely changed our behavior or our consumption of petroleum-based products, despite growing awareness of how severe the effects of climate change will be on the economy and the environment. Even though McKibben was already preaching the ""end of nature"", wider society has seemed to not care. Animal species continue to go extinct, plastics pollute everything and ice continues to melt at both poles. Why read books like this? I haven't really uncovered an answer yet. These types of book are always incredibly depressing, especially as an American who looks around and sees how utterly beholden I am to the mega industries destroying our planet. I guess it helps keep me aware of the future that is rapidly approaching, this knowledge helps me reevaluate my behavior as a consumer, to do with less. It informs the kinds of politicians I vote for. And maybe when the conversation comes up with climate change skeptics, I can present some type of non-controversial evidence to let them know, it's about to get a lot worse on this blue planet we call home."
15,0812976088,http://goodreads.com/user/show/43087013-rachel,5,"I follow Bill McKibben on twitter and much of what he says there is also said in this book. Except now it's 30 years later and almost nothing has changed. He says near the end: ""The choice of doing nothing - of continuing to burn ever more oil and coal - is not a choice, in other words. It will lead us, if not straight to hell, then straight to a place with a similar temperature."" That was published in 1989 and yet I still feel like that's true today. We're continuing to burn oil and coal and somehow people are still fighting about IF climate change is real (it is) or IF they ""believe"" in it (except science isn't a belief system). Which is all absurd to me. It's long past the time where action should have begun yet we're still bickering over if we should do something, or the cost of doing something. The cost of NOT doing something outweighs it all. We do nothing and like Bill McKibben says - we go ""if not straight to hell, then straight to a place with a similar temperature"". As in, a future where the climate has changed and the earth is warmer and hotter and it's a future we've built for ourselves and are somehow slow to repair. I'm rambling a bit but the point is I think Bill McKibben laid out everything cleanly and with imperative in 1989 and the world still didn't change. 2019 is different, for sure - there's more green energy, more fuel efficient vehicles - but it's also the same. We have to demand climate action now. And it's heartening to see the younger generation below mine demanding that action, striking for the future, and being educated about the problem and speaking up. "
16,0812976088,http://goodreads.com/user/show/30284756-rashi-gupta,4,"This book combines extraordinary level of scientific detail with hints of philosophy. It tries to make the man of 2005 see reason and the future of his actions detailing how one cannot postpone taking radical decisions in context of nature to their future gens. Reading this book in 2020 hits differently - an year which is a constant reminder of wrath of nature with pandemic, wildfires, floods, droughts and what not. It allures me to imagine indigenous, unadulterated forests of the past and details how we have left our imprint now on every inch of it. I could not help gazing out of my window every now and then, wondering if the trees and birds outside were sick and the polluted rain making them sicker.The book however is based on the experiences of US and UK and the ""we"" therefore is a Western man."

McKibben argues his point that nature has ended, in the sense that there is no longer any natural aspect of our world that still exists without any human signature. For example, the most remote parts of the world now experience weather that is influenced by our greenhouse gas emissions, or by the anthropogenically increased acidity of rain. I disagreed with Bill at many points, but overall the message was thoughtful, poignant and articulated well by McKibben. Although this book was designed to be the “Silent Spring” of climate change, and although it is beyond its time, it evidently did not hit its marks. A fantastic book, would definitely recommend. "

I’m sure someone who has an easier time with nonfiction might rate this higher than me, but this took so much conscious work for me to get through that I’m in the middle on it. The good things: it’s a topic that interests me, I feel much more informed about the details of climate change versus just having a vague idea of it, and I appreciated the various angles McKibben took to this topic. The less good: this book felt long (much lengthier than its actual length), and it was difficult not to grow tired of McKibben as the narrator. He’s in a tricky position, as the science tells us how scary the situation is, but he is so doom-and-gloom throughout the book that it’s tough to continue. I wonder how many people are left feeling like the issue is beyond hope. I think I’d rather get informed through an interview in an article or podcast."

21,0812976088,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2588199-jack,3,"This long essay asks two questions: What would our lives be like if nature were not bigger than us? And what would it be like to imagine ourselves smaller?	The first question -- which takes up the first half of the book -- is fascinating. McKibben argues that a core part of what Nature does for us is let us know that the world has rhythms, predicability. That there is beauty out there that transcends us. It gives us a sense that there is something more than us out there. He has a very nice section where he acknowledges that this is what religion does, or, for many of us, once did. Nature can help take some of burden off our shoulders, by reminding us as individuals that, even if we screw everything up, the sun will still set gorgeously. But, he asks provocatively, what would we lose if that were no longer true? And he makes a powerful case -- one that has come to feel more like common sense in the two decades since he wrote -- that our large scale changes to the environment, particularly via the green house gases, are creating a world that is more volatile. Moreover, it is more volatile because of what we did. Beyond all the palpable damage those changes will cause, knowing that we did it will take away from us the solace of nature.	This may be overstating the point a little -- the Grand Canyon's going to be impressive for a long time, as are the brilliant red of the cardinals that live in the hedge outside my door -- but the point is there. I came across McKibben's book when it was repeatedly references by Richard Louv's Last Child in the Woods. Louv makes a more modest case, but one so persuasive that, over a few years, it changed my approach to fathering, and had a large role in where we currently live. Louv argues that children need, at a very deep level, to be a part of nature. Not ""Nature"" like on t.v. or in an aquarium -- that is, Nature as some abstract bit of environmental knowledge, possibly at risk, certainly over there somewhere. Instead, they need to have nature -- things growing, unpredictably -- somewhere close, where they can palpably interact with it. This lead to a lot more hikes in my family, and lot of wandering off paths and poking at things. Nature as a body-contact sport. I feel like my kids, and I, are better off for it, even if we got some scratches and scars to show for it. And this interpretation of McKibben that Louv offers is particularly compelling, in saying that we need to not imagine ourselves separate from nature.	And that is the sense in which McKibben challenges us to be smaller, to live more simply. To imagine living as if we had NOT been given dominion over the land. My profession makes that hard. It's an enormous challenge to figure out how to enact a more humble way of living. Biking around town helps, sure, but it hardly seems like enough. McKibben seems less compelling here -- he gestures towards Deep Ecology, but doesn't seem himself to really know how to fully do it. He reads the science too carefully, I think, to really believe half measures are enough. But, is a half-measure, a bit less carbon release, enough? I'm not sure myself, and struggle with it. McKibben sharpened that struggle, but it sits unresolved. I end up feeling like the Oncler, ""Perhaps...."""
22,0812976088,http://goodreads.com/user/show/71658-aj,3,"This book was okay... McKibben's main thesis is that humans have done such a grand job dominating nature that it is no longer natural. Thanks to climate change, our weather is no longer due to nature, it's due to human activity, which is why the book is titled The End of Nature.I think that Michael Pollan offers an interesting counter-argument to this idea in Second Nature A Gardener's Education, where he asks, what is nature when man has been playing around with it for so long? Is man truly disconnected from nature?I read the 1990 edition, which was interesting. I'd like to compare it to the recent editions which I'm sure he must have edited (if only to remove the Soviet Union references). The chapter about biotechnology and genetic engineering was something else. I didn't realize it was satire at first (I hope it was satire!), which made it kind of shocking coming from an environmentalist. He did seem to hold some hope in the genetic engineering of plants to help us get through hot, dry weather, but now that we have enough evidence to the contrary maybe he'll realize that was sort of a pipe dream.Overall the book doesn't really offer any concrete ideas for change, it doesn't shake the status quo too much, and McKibben even admits that he would find it hard to change his lifestyle, because it is comfortable and he's used to it. I kind of just feel ambivalent about this book, just as I felt ambivalent about his recent ""upload a photo of yourself with 3 numbers to stop global warming"" movement. I guess I just feel like, if this is all our environmentalists can come up with, this planet is screwed.(Also, side note, this was a library book and a previous reader circled the name Thoreau every single damn time it was written in the book. WTF?)"
23,0812976088,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1500718-ryan,4,"""We are no longer able to think of ourselves as a species tossed about by larger forces--now we are those larger forces.""Originally published in 1989, The End of Nature mostly holds up. McKibben relies on the carbon dioxide measurements coming from Hawaii to demonstrate concern about a warming climate. The warmest years on record at the time were 1988, 1987, 1983, 1981, 1980, and 1986. Hansen appears, and after his testimony, McKibben notes that ""the columnist George Will had spanked the then presidential candidate Senator Albert Gore of Tennessee for his long-held interest in the greenhouse effect and other issues 'that are in the eyes of the electorate, not even peripheral.'"" McKibben is already worried about methane releasing from the permafrost, and he is further beginning to study ways of communicating climate science to a lay audience. There are already climate models, talk of accounting for various feedbacks, and the ocean's ability to regulate temperature is already being discussed.There is more concern over the ozone layer and acid rain than today, mostly because we responded to those problems. One gets the sense that Carson's Silent Spring, and the movement against DDT it championed, was still a recent memory. (The yellow warbler on the cover alludes to her book's cover.) McKibben reports Hansen's worry that there won't be birch trees within twenty years, which has not come to pass (though he was broadly correct to suggest trees are stressed by heat). End of Nature's central argument, that nature-as-something-that-is-larger-than-us has in some way passed, is correct. Although blizzards and hurricanes threaten us, we are the dominant species on the planet. As much as I still am able to feel that sense of transcendence while in the woods, and as much as climate change seems like a threat to millions of humans, the planet is now, for better or worse, in many ways an artwork."
24,0812976088,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4545794-andrei-taylor,2,"The end of nature is a enviromental awareness novel about the end of nature as we understand it. We have ended nature through our need for growth.Bill shows that it is not nature itself that is ending but rather the nature that has been blossoming for years. Through genetic engineering we may be able to save our world, but this created world will lack the beauty of the old world. We will have trees and plants but these genetically modified versions of our trees and plants will not do justice to the beauty of a natural forest. He says (in 1989) that the end of nature is already inevitable so there is really no point to try to stop it and it is a shame that our grand children may never know what it looks like to see a sky without sodium sulphate, or what it looks like for a forest to have a diversity of trees. Our world was and is beautiful, but we will never be able to return to an age where the temperature, animals or any other aspect of nature cant be manipulated for our benefit. We hope to learn enough to save ourselves but we must begin to limit ourselves, though it will be difficult to do.I cannot say I agree with all the points he has made, but this book is also (at the time of this writing) 24 years old. We are experiencing some of the problems, but others were greatly exaggerated. Overall it is a good book, but it is extremely outdated."
25,0812976088,http://goodreads.com/user/show/325852-michael,4,"Written in the late 80's, this is a disturbing book to read as we approach the second decade of the 21st century. Disturbing because so little of our dialogue about climate change has progressed beyond what was being discussed two decades ago. Doubly so because McKibbin's nightmare, that we might delay action for 20 or more years, is precisely the course we have chosen, and the consequences are sure to be all-the-more dire because of it.Much of this book is dated now... The science, for certain (An Inconvenient Truth is a far better source for more recent research). But on the whole, the book and McKibbin's perspective remains relevant as we, every day, make the choice between action & inaction regarding our impact on what remains of the natural world. This book is a reminder of what we are losing and, sadly, what we have already lost. Two decades later, it's still worth the read."
26,0812976088,http://goodreads.com/user/show/118880926-marie-evanston,4,"This book was not what I was expecting. I was expecting it to be about the various ways humans are disrupting ecosystems, causing mass extinctions, polluting natural resources, and generally destroying the planet – the end of nature in this sense. There is some of this, certainly, but it’s not McKibbons main point. McKibbon defines “nature” in a different sense. (Thankfully, he makes this clear on page 5 of the text). He is talking about a certain idea of nature, a particular meaning which nature/natural places have to people. This idea holds that what is most essential and defining of nature is that it is separate from us. “Nature’s independence of us is its meaning; without it, there is nothing but us.” It is this loss, this “death”, which McKibbon argues for – convincingly, I think, since climate change leaves nothing untouched. However, I think McKibbon is worrying about the wrong thing. It’s worth mentioning that I read The End of Nature after reading Braiding Sweetgrass, and the perspectives of Robin Wall Kimmerer informed my judgment of TEoN. In short, I do not think McKibbon’s definition of nature is a helpful one. In fact, I think that it is a symptom of a larger mindset which itself is the real problem. It is the mindset that humans and nature are fundamentally at odds, that the only way for nature to exist is to be pristine and untouched by humans. Don’t get me wrong, there are certainly grounds for this idea in reality! Humans have done immeasurable and irreversible harm to the natural world. But my point is that this does not need to be the case; it is not an essential part of humanity that we are necessarily at odds with nature. Rather, the destruction of nature at human hands is based on a mindset that devalues nature, and this is based on a still deeper mindset that believes people and nature are fundamentally at odds. It is this idea of separateness that leads humans to believe that we owe nature nothing, that at worst we need to conquer nature, and at best we can use nature for our own purposes. But of course this mindset is not inherent to human nature; it is cultural, and therefore changeable. It is this mindset which needs to be changed. Ultimately, I think our goal should not be mourning the loss of a nature which is separate from and untainted by people; our goal should be to realize that humans and nature were never really separate in the first place, that we need each other, and that our relationship can be harmonious and mutually enriching. It is this relationship which needs fixing, and the idea that nature is “separate” from humans is a symptom of this broken relationship.McKibbon begins chapter 2 (also called “The End of Nature”) by describing how modern notions of nature (in his sense of the word) were informed by the experience of the American frontier as a pristine, unblemished land. Already, we can see his definition of “nature” unravelling. The America Europeans found was surely more “pristine” than it is today, but it was not because there weren’t any humans there to ruin it – there were people there! The relevant difference was not the presence or absence of people, but how the people related to and treated the land. In other words, the American wilderness was still “wild”, still “natural”, not because no one had touched it, but because they had touched it gently. McKibbons talks about European explorers feeling (emphasis on “feeling”) like they were the first to see American lands, and the particular joy that came from seeing truly “wild” land. Again, this reveals the mindset that any contact with humans is inherently corrupting. All we have to do is once again remember that there were in fact people living in America to realize that this mindset is false. The land was “wild” not because it has been separate from humans, but because humans had a particular relationship with it. With all this said, of course climate change is a category all its own. None of what I am saying is denying the damage we have done, or the scale on which we have done it. My point is rather that I think part of the solution will be changing how we relate to nature, and this fundamentally involves realizing that we are not separate from nature. And climate change demonstrates this better than anything. Everything we do has an impact. I do understand, at least partly, why McKibbons mourns the idea of “nature” in his sense of the term. There is something humbling, even sublime, about experiencing raw forces of nature, and knowing that these are forces that you cannot control, forces which you can only be swept up in. But recognizing that we are always intertwined with nature does not need to undermine this. After all, part of being in a relationship means that you are not totally in control. (And certainly, we are not totally in control of climate change! We have impacted the earth, but we are still at her mercy.) Recognizing the reciprocity of humans and nature, and being more actively and consciously involved in that reciprocity, can be richly rewarding. Climate change forces us to recognize the reciprocity, to be involved with nature in this way, and it forces us to confront the fact that we were never really separate in the first place. "
27,0812976088,http://goodreads.com/user/show/689791-beth,2,"I gave this book a quick re-read after initially reading it for academic purposes years ago and being put off by the doomsday approach of McKibben. Even though I agree with McKibben in general, I don't like this book. It offers nothing but commentary. It leaves the human species out of the equation. Instead of motivating one to action, it takes the winds out of the sails. "
28,0812976088,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1180394-maureen,5,"Bill McKibben is more than a science writer: he is a poet. His descriptions of forests ravaged by acid rain are more deeply moving now than when this book was written ten years ago. He issued a clarion call that was taken up by many people, but still we are struggling with the issues presented in this book. If you have not read any of McKibben's other works, this is the place to start."
29,0812976088,http://goodreads.com/user/show/76515-jeremy,3,"The thesis is clear and probably true: Human beings are now causing so many changes in the world that we cannot think of ""nature"" as an independent force that acts on us.

32,0812976088,http://goodreads.com/user/show/436346-brett,4,"Among the earliest popular treatments of global warming, The End of Nature is a lyrical, near-metaphysical meditation on the meaning of how humans have changed the planet through production of CO2. Though originally published in 1989, because it is not focused on numbers or cutting edge science, the book feels evergreen and relevant, even decades later.What McKibben means by the ""end of nature"" is the end of nature as a force outside of and greater than the human imprint on our planet. Because of the effects of our industrial policy, torrential storms or droughts or what have you are no longer simply acts of God, but are in part human-caused events. There is no separating the natural world from the human world in the traditional sense. To McKibben, this change is nearly of religious importance. I can't say that this view of nature and human separateness is central to me, but McKibben writes about it well enough that it has made an impression, and I've spent quite a bit of time reflecting on it since finishing this book.It is humbling to read McKibben's views from nearly 30 years ago, where he believes the die is essentially cast, and that global warming will inevitably wreak substantial damage on the Earth. All these many years have past since then without serious efforts to ameliorate the worst effects of climate change. In that span of time, I've brought a child into the world who will likely live to see some of the more dire fallout of our stubbornness. (Though I have to admit it is cold comfort to think that I'll be dead by the time some of the worst outcomes may come to pass.)On a parallel track, in the second half of the book, McKibben also discusses the dawning of the ability of humans to manipulate genes and influence living things through what we'd now I guess call genetic engineering. I found this line of reasoning a lot less compelling, though it makes a certain kind of sense given McKibben's worldview. He sees this as simply another way that nature is no longer separate from humankind. Perhaps it is just because this is the world I've grown up in and lived in for most of my life, but I'm not terribly troubled by GMOs or genetically modified animals. Certainly they don't seem to pose the same kind of worldwide dangers as climate change, at any rate.I also appreciate the honesty with which McKibben admits that his belief that we will likely have to live smaller lives makes him personally unhappy. He enjoys the comforts of fossil fuel consumption and would rather avoid the unpleasantness of smaller homes, fewer possessions, growing his own food in a garden, etc. It's refreshing to hear this described without sanctimony, and with the candor to acknowledge that we are rightfully loathe to give up our comforts, that our virtue won't keep us warm (or, more aptly, keep us cool in the summers). I'll just sum up by saying that, over the last year or so, I've undertaken to read several environmental texts, and usually come away a little underwhelmed. Though I didn't agree with every point, the End of Nature wasn't a disappointment. McKibben is an excellent writer and well-informed on the science. Would be a great starting point in any environmental crisis reading list. "
33,0812976088,http://goodreads.com/user/show/13510236-richard-reese,5,"Long, long ago, in scorching-hot 1988, Bill McKibben was busy writing The End of Nature, a book that cranked up the global warming warning sirens. It was the first climate change book written for non-scientists, and it was a smash hit. It makes an eloquent effort to convince those entranced by the dominant culture to radically change their thinking and lifestyles, this week if possible, because the biosphere is more damaged than we think. It’s about living with great care, fully present in reality, and pursuing the healing sanity of voluntary self-restraint.The root issue is that human cleverness has succeeded in creating so many brilliant ideas that we’re blindsiding nature. This does not mean we’re eliminating all life on Earth. It means that humankind has spawned powerful cultures that no longer blend in smoothly with the rest of the family of life. The biosphere can no longer run on autopilot, because humans are fooling around in the control room and, despite good intentions, are piling up an impressive collection of devastating misjudgments.If we look at the world of 500 years ago, we can observe a number of blotches resulting from human activities, but the atmosphere remained fairly close to its original condition, as did the oceans, and much of the planet’s land surface. The seas were loaded with fish, and millions of bison thundered across North America. Overall, the world largely remained the domain of Big Mama Nature. It was able to shake off the punches from human activities.In the last 200 years or so, this has changed. Human cleverness is now capable of causing disturbances that are global in scale. These include DDT, ozone holes, radiation, acid rain, and an unstable climate. The dominant culture is discharging pollutants that affect the biosphere everywhere. Humankind has (temporarily) forced nature out of the pilot’s seat. This is what is meant by “the end of nature.” Legions of radicalized consumers are now vigorously rocking the boat, to a degree that exceeds nature’s ability to compensate and maintain balance.In recent decades, our techno-juggernaut has invented a new and improved way of suppressing nature, genetic engineering. This represents an enormous advance in our mistake-making talents. By fooling around with gene splicing, we are beginning to interfere with evolution’s autopilot. Highly specialized mistake makers have pushed us beyond the amateur level of mere biosphere destroyers. They now strive to control the future of the family of life, by fooling around with matters that were once the sole domain of the Creator. What could possibly go wrong?Genetic engineering gave McKibben intense nightmares. It’s a technology with fabulous potential for creating multitudes of unintended consequences; bizarre surprises that the mad scientists could have never imagined. Some manmade organisms might survive for millions of years, affecting the biosphere longer than nuclear waste. Obviously, GMOs are absolutely unnecessary for our long and challenging return to balance with nature.McKibben is a good thinker, a good writer, and a good-hearted human being. He’s an environmental wordsmith who is also a Christian, providing a perspective that is not common in green literature. The end of nature deeply offended his beliefs. Many Christians don’t get much farther than the instructions to “multiply and subdue,” which imply that God made the world for us to dominate and exploit. McKibben knew that the scriptures could be annoyingly inconsistent. He was fond of the Book of Job, which teaches that humans are not the center of the universe, and wilderness is not ours to trash.As the dominant culture furiously thrashes the planet, glaring questions arise — why doesn’t God stop us? Did he die, or move away? McKibben sidesteps the sixth chapter of Genesis, where God realized that creating humans was a huge mistake, because they turned out to be remarkably wicked. God corrected his blooper by bringing “a flood of waters upon the earth, to destroy all flesh, wherein is the breath of life, from under heaven; and every thing that is in the earth shall die.” Today, humans are the ones executing the end of nature, not the Creator. No other species is so clever — or so willing to mindlessly imitate a pissed-off sky god.The End of Nature is also notable because it does not reek with a pungent anthropocentric stink. The path to healing requires the abandonment of human superiority, a deadly brain fever. McKibben concurs with Dave Foreman, “Each of you is an animal, and you should be proud of it.” It’s not easy for us to accept that we are delicious two-legged meatballs wandering around in the food chain, and that the rest of creation is at least as important as we are.Green wordsmiths rarely reveal a profound love for the natural world, maybe because it’s unprofessional, or because they have no spiritual connection to life, the norm in this society. The focus for many green thinkers is finding a way to maintain our “high standard of living” while leaving no scars on the ecosystem, an absurd and impossible quest. Usually, their primary objective is generating enough electricity to keep their gizmos glowing and humming. Food is lower on the list, and population reduction is nowhere to be seen.Lately, hysterical electricity addicts have been hallucinating that nuclear energy is the silver bullet solution. McKibben noted that if we quit burning fossil fuels to generate electricity, and switched to nuclear, our carbon dioxide emissions would only drop 30 percent, because much of our economy cannot run on electricity (ships, planes, trucks, trains, etc.). Furthermore, carbon dioxide is only half of the greenhouse gases we are releasing. Alas, there is no free nuclear lunch.McKibben loved nature. While writing, he lived in the Adirondacks, and he gushed with adoration for the surrounding forest and mountains. Outdoors, he felt the presence of God far more than when he sat indoors among a congregation of holy rollers. God created nature, not cities. One of God’s great delights was annihilating cities, according to the scriptures.McKibben confessed that he’s also an American who enjoys the cool things that modern living provides, and he has no desire to live in an unheated cabin. Modern living is so comfortable. Unfortunately, it’s beating the stuffing out of nature. There is a vast chasm between the way of life we enjoy, and a sustainable life. If we were rational, we would leap into “an all-out race to do with less.” Instead, we desperately cling to a blind faith in technological miracles that will magically eliminate all need for living intelligently.A memorable portion of the book describes the author’s sincere struggle to find answers, tirelessly wrestling with hordes of demons and inconvenient truths. He tries so hard to find workable approaches, but there are no quick and easy solutions. Centuries will pass before balance returns. But our biggest obstacles are psychological, and radical change is not impossible, in theory.The nations of the world actually cooperated in sharply reducing the use of DDT, and ozone-eating CFCs, because the risks clearly exceeded the costs. Fossil energy is different. Billions of people literally cannot survive without oil. Therefore, the radical changes we need will not happen anytime soon, if ever. We can continue living like there’s no tomorrow, or we can make a heroic effort to encourage a gentler collapse — McKibben’s preference.To recharge his sanity, he enjoys stepping outdoors at night, and gazing at the stars. The rest of the universe is still as wild and free as it ever was. What could be more inspiring?"
34,0812976088,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3037001-pamela,5,"Last week I read my first book by McKibben, Radio Free Vermont: A Fable of Resistance and it was his only fictional one. I knew it wasn't the best place to start with his work, but it was short and after just reading some longer books, I wanted a quick read. The subtitle of that book made it more intriguing so I did start there. It wasn't an overwhelmingly environmental novel as it was more overwhelmingly local. Oh, but yes, local is part of being more ""green"".Anyway, since I'm planning on attending an event soon where Bill McKibben is speaking, I thought it best to finally read something by him that represented his work. Now this book here, The End of Nature, is probably his most iconic book. I have known about this book, and others he wrote, but held back reading any of them, even held back buying any of his books. It feels a little odd to me since really I have a shelf or two of just these types of books, environmental in nature. And perhaps that is the exact reason why I haven't read McKibben before, I have these other books, read some of them, and overall thought I knew what he was writing about, what he said in his books. It's a bit silly of me I know, but I'm being truthful here. I figured I didn't need to read another writer about the same topic.Yet, I decided before hearing him speak I should try his work. Quickly after starting this book I realized the mistake I made long ago, and kept making year after year. I should have read this book sooner. Perhaps read more of his books. Not so much that it taught me something I didn't know before, but that it was a good book. It was more engrossing and thought-provoking than I expected. I grew to ponder his sentences as well. Now why would you say like a half glass of gin and tonic, instead of a half glass of water? Probably because you would expect the word water, and not gin and tonic. That makes the writing more readable, more interesting. This book has put together a lot of specific details and facts and made them readable. McKibben has added his own personal life in here to make it more relatable. What is most significant perhaps is his main thesis how ""we"" (meaning us humans, but mostly in the West) have now ended the natural, or wild nature. We have affected the change in all animals and plants with our consumption and procreation. There are no longer any place in this earth that is not pristine or untouched by what we have done. And still we do crave the wild, don't we? And how much nature is completely destroyed depends on how much we are willing to let global-warming go. From here on out nature is being managed, much like a park is not a natural green space but a planned area designed for humans, not the plants or any animals that may inhabit the park . It is not a happy book, but I'm glad I finally read it. I have many questions for McKibben now, as this book was written two decades ago. Perhaps some of those questions have been answered in his more recent work. At some point I shall find out."
35,0812976088,http://goodreads.com/user/show/74550389-finn,3,"This is a book that id long on questions but disappointingly short on answers. It is nearly impossible to take away any message other than that there are perhaps no good answers to our environmental dilemma, and that the only possible outcome is whichever one occurs. McKibben's heart tells him that we must give up our dominion over nature if we are to succeed, that we must cease enslaving the Earth -- lest she rise up and swallow us alive. His gut, though, tells him that we won't: he himself does not want to give up his modest lifestyle. Who can blame him?This is not a new book, and it is strange to think that in the twenty-odd years since he has written it, he has not give n up. What's to fight for? Even on this he is uncertain. Perhaps merely a planet that we can even survive on. Invocations of inevitability runs thick through the book. The praises he sings of nature's joys sound suspiciously like prayers or even eulogies. This is a man who will fight because he'd feel even worse not fighting. In his heart, he does not believe this is winnable.GMOs are disparaged as totally lacking in ""naturalness,"" and this is true. When all rabbits are GMO rabbits, designed to withstand the new climate, what makes a rabbit different from a soda bottle? Surprisingly little. This is a chilling future, and a depressingly realistic one. How will we modify ourselves? To eat trees, dirt, and rocks?I believe that we cannot change, cannot get out of our own way any more than the salmon or moose can get out of our way. If the salmon is to stay, it will be as a GMO salmon. GMO man, too, is maybe our only realistic path forward.So long as creatures can reproduce, the future will always belong to evolution. We cannot destroy nature unless we completely sterilize it. This, it seems, will never happen. We will perish before it does. Still, we can mostly ruin the thought of it, and most likely we will. What is our purpose, our future, our destiny? McKibben doesn't know; perhaps we are not meant to think we have answers, anyway. We probably could not deal with them. We probably would alter, damage, and destroy them, as we seem to do with anything we've been granted, with anything we touch at all."
36,0812976088,http://goodreads.com/user/show/59342354-john-newton,3,"I think it might be hard for a book that is based in large part on current scientific research to stand the test of time. This book isn't that old (it was first published in 1989), but many of the forecasts of what may happen by 2000 or 2020 didn't take place while there were other developments that McKibben didn't foresee. Even the introduction to the updated edition, written in 2005, feels dated at this point. His discussion of obstacles to climate change obviously don't include the Paris Accords or the Trump presidency. Given that there are plenty of newer books, including others by McKibben, this is not the best one to get an overview of the latest science on climate change, even if it was ground-breaking in its day. Other sections of the book are timeless. The grim prognosis overall still remains true, even if the likely timing has changed, as does the discussion about the uncertainty we face. Adapting to a changing climate is harder than it might sound, as every change brings about other unimagined ones. A hotter summer may alter the migration of a certain bird or allow a certain fungus to flourish, and then that change cascades throughout the ecosystem. That said, even while this is a slim volume, he could have made those arguments in even fewer words. I would give the last chapter, ""A Path of More Resistance,"" five stars, however. A question it posits—are we (in the West) ready to live lifestyles in which we consume half or even better a fifth of the resources we currently do?—is one that we still must answer. Can we truly break the habits of consumption that we have developed? Likewise are we interested in putting the health of the earth first, even if that means checking development that may improve the lives of many of the world's poorest people. Thirty years after the first publication of The End of Nature, those are choices we still must ponder. "
37,0812976088,http://goodreads.com/user/show/15657404-brandon-pytel,5,"This is a reread for me, from when I read it back in high school, but this time, working in the environmental feel, I’m blown away by how some of McKibben’s talking points are still relevant, 30 years on. McKibben argues that we have ended nature, in the sense that man has infected everything around it through not just pollution but greenhouse gases, fundamentally altering more than a lake or stream but the entire planet. What once was so large it could never be moved is now turning into something artificial.Looking at this 30 years later is really upsetting, mostly because of how accurate McKibben’s reporting is and how we failed to do anything after the Hansen testimony. But McKibben’s strongest arguments lie within how he approaches nature: this certain way of thinking that we feel the need for pristine places, places substantially unaltered by man. Humans’ quest to control the land has made everything manmade and the result has been this loss of beauty and a sadness we must face for knowing but not acting to prevent this. As we try to solve this predicament through technology, we only move further and further away from nature, eventually losing our memory of what nature was and all that it used to mean for us. Unless we swallow our human pride to change our lifestyles, we will never return to that which we most crave: That which is inhuman. And that’s the paradox of the ever-progressing and polluting industrialism within our rapidly degrading planet. "
38,0812976088,http://goodreads.com/user/show/8373093-ingrid,4,I often found instances that fulfill the predictions and warnings from the 80s during the time this book was written. Bill McKibben warns us of the dangers of living unsustainably through our continued reliance on fossil fuels. He describes the difficulties we face and acknowledges the challenges we have. Nature has ended through mans actions. It now requires human intervention and ingenuity to stabilize nature in order to provide a world for our children that we knew during our lifetime. Can we make the sacrifices? Can we make the changes necessary? Can we give up our comforts? Can we move from materialism and find peace and tranquility without the greedy acquisition of 'stuff'. Will our inherent tendencies that define success allow us to redefine personal success? Very thought provoking. 
39,0812976088,http://goodreads.com/user/show/11600077-rob,5,"This book gets right to the heart of the ecological problems we're grappling with today, talking about all we stand to lose in the face of a changing climate and collapsing biosphere.Thing is, it was published in 1989.The result: Reading this now is a heartbreaking experience. Everything laid out clearly, lining up pretty darn close to the projections of today, only our leaders squandered decades and have brought us even closer to ruin.If that's the kind of read that gets you up in the morning, I heartily recommend checking out this book. It's great. You'll even get a glimmer of hope when you see ""solved"" problems like acid rain and the ozone layer talked about in some depth. But if you can't handle the grim truth that our the darkest fears of today were also the darkest fears of people who first encountered them long ago, give this one a pass for now."
40,0812976088,http://goodreads.com/user/show/63073680-briar-wyatt,5,"“But this could be the epoch when people decide at least to go no farther down the path we’ve been following - when we make not only the necessary technological adjustments to preserve the world from overheating but also the necessary mental adjustments to ensure we’ll never again put our good ahead of everything else’s. This is the path I choose, for it offers at least a shred of hope for a living, eternal, meaningful world” 1989. Particularly profound reflecting on these words today, not long after the release of the IPCC special report which arguably tells us the same thing. It’s time to do something about it. Bill McKibben is a wonderful, inspiring writer but boy is it bleak to reflect on the time that has passed since this book was originally released. "
41,0812976088,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4034128-emily,3,"It's interesting to realize that this book launched the climate change movement 30 years ago. McKibben really got a lot of people to pay attention - although not, alas, enough attention to stop emitting carbon 30 years ago.i'm finding the author's unconscious privilege off-putting. his assumption that the Americas were ""wild"" before the Europeans arrived is not true; the Natives managed things before that, just with a lot more respect and gentleness. And when he says that ""we don't believe"" that humans should be a part of nature, blended together - well, i don't. i don't like the royal we. it goes back to his misconceptions about native Americans and indigenous ways of life. humans being integrated into the landscape does not have to be creepy or weird or unnatural. "
42,0812976088,http://goodreads.com/user/show/46328584-denise-sudbeck,4,"I've read this book after recently reading Elizabeth Rush's Rising. The two of them make quite a pair, if you can stand it. The common thread running through readers' criticisms is the depressing nature of the work and as far as that goes, I think it's true. But this isn't a book about science as much as it is about the Romantic understanding of nature in which our culture is steeped. It's about the soul as much as the head. Another interesting way to read The End of Nature is paired with Sallie McFague's The Body of God or any similar work in feminist ecology/theology. "
43,0812976088,http://goodreads.com/user/show/115428198-maddy,3,"Some points are much more compelling than others. I think the organization could have been much better. It did succeed in making me very emotional and angry at myself for the ignorance with which I have walked and interacted with my own forms of nature. The questions we are left with afterwards are questions of the viability of any change. The looming issue I faced while reading the book was that it was published in the 80's, and just how little has truly changed to face the issues of climate change. "
44,0812976088,http://goodreads.com/user/show/27991374-chris-meads,5,"This book came out in 1989-1990 and already the author was predicting the event of global warming and the over use of the greenhouse gases, mainly CO2 and coal. Most of his predictions are slowly coming true with the disappearance of nature as we know it with the growth of the human population and the wilderness slowly disappearing as buildings are put up. Even today farmland is disappearing, the economy is not good so farmers are having to sell out only to have housing developments taking over."
45,0812976088,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5747115-jed-mayer,4,"This remains a brave and impassioned meditation on the world we have largely destroyed, but it's astonishing to me that the author would have labored so intensely over a work without citing a single source for his assertions: how can a work of what essentially popular science writing not contain any citations? Nevertheless, an important work that ranks with Rachel Carson and Elizabeth Kolbert. "
46,0812976088,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2522762-marlena,4,This was the best depressing book I ever read. Why is it depressing? It's a doom and gloom book written 30 years ago about the future of the world with the effects of global warming. The depressing part is that most of what he predicts has come true. This isn't a large book but took me 6 months to read it.
47,0812976088,http://goodreads.com/user/show/19017096-isla,2,"I am never reading a scientific book written by a journalist again. I suppose it’s written for quite a broad audience and this book is approachable, but some of it is quite condescending. It is a product of its time but would it kill the author to quote more than a handful of women and to use words like “humans,” “humanity” or “human kind”?"
48,0812976088,http://goodreads.com/user/show/11426356-jerrid-kruse,4,"The book summarized the major science and implications of global warming. While some of it is speculative based on the time it was written, it is compelling. I found the last half of the book most interesting as the author engages the reader in considering how our relationship has or will change, and engages in ecological and technological philosophy. "
