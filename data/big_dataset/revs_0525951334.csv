Why?A: Like déjà vu?B: No, not déjà vu. Really remembering the future.A: But the future doesn't exist yet. How can you remember something that hasn't happened?B: On the other hand, the only reason you think the past exists is that you can remember it.A: Hmm... maybe! But it would be very confusing to be able to remember the future. You'd have no reason to want to do anything.B: It's not just memory, it's everything!

A: But how could you have a photograph of something that's going to happen in the future?B: A camera takes pictures of things that happened in the past. Why couldn't a future-camera take pictures of things that happen in the future?A: Because you can't.

1,0525951334,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4213258-bradley,5,"This is some very impressive stuff. I've read a lot of nonfiction science books that sometimes had equations but mostly did not, but what I really wanted was a cohesive drive, an arrow to spear right through some of the biggest questions of our time... such as What Is Time.Sean Carroll manages to keep things very sharp between what is perfectly understood and all of the theories that are somewhat understood, and the other Cosmology stuff that's mostly just baffling. :)Any way you look at it, though, this is not a book that gets derailed or goes off into super strange directions. He lays out all the foundations, from the opening definitions of Time and what we think it means, from the average to the rather advanced notions of space-time and curvature, Einstein's energy equation, speed of light, diliation, moving all the way to Black Holes. This is very solid stuff.Plus, we have a very coherent definition of Time as Entropy, showing us just how complicated it can get when time's arrow might just be the illusion that Hawking says it is. I really enjoyed that discussion.Of course, we come up with lots of possibilities and digressions that are always explored in SF, too, but most of these are just bylines, moving quickly by the Grandfather paradox, etc, to get right back on the main track. Yes. We have Equations. :) Fortunately, the author does a very good job about explaining them and even getting deeper into the extra areas that made this rather more interesting for me since I've read many science books and have heard most of this already.I recommend this for anyone interested in Time. :) Not time management. Just Time. :) We do touch rather heavily upon Cosmology by the end, too, which was a blast and a half, getting into many-universes theory and string theory, to name a few. And he makes it clear! :)Seriously. This was some sharp stuff. Very readable. It's not a general overview. You might say it's putting time's arrow right through the heart of a big question and staying on track all the way to the end. "
2,0525951334,http://goodreads.com/user/show/61519-aerin,4,"In space, there should be no material difference between left and right, forward and backward, up and down. However, for us there is a substantive difference between up and down because we live in the spatial vicinity of a massive object - the earth - which exerts a gravitational pull on us. And in spacetime, there should be no material difference between past and future. But for us there is a substantive difference because we live in the temporal vicinity of a massive event - the Big Bang - which gave rise to the arrow of time. Or so Sean Carroll argues in From Eternity to Here The Quest for the Ultimate Theory of Time. He says that the reason we remember the past and not the future, the reason effects always follow causes and never vice versa, the reason we perceive time always moving in a particular direction, is because of entropy. For whatever reason (physicists collectively shrug their shoulders), the Big Bang was an extremely low-entropy event, and ever since entropy has been increasing and pulling the arrow of time with it. Even if the arrow were to somehow reverse and run time backwards, supposedly we would still remember the low-entropy direction as the ""past"", and feel we were moving toward the high-entropy ""future"". Entropy itself is an interesting concept, one that most of us are taught in high school physics class is synonymous with ""disorder"". But that's not really what it is - entropy measures ""the number of microstates corresponding to each macrostate"". Basically, the more possible configurations of all the particles within a substance, the higher the entropy, and the more likely the substance is to eventually reach that state. After all, there are many more ways egg molecules can be situated in an omelet than in an unbroken egg, where all the yolk molecules must cluster together, and the albumin, and the shell and so forth. It's just statistics that any given egg is likely to end up in the high-entropy condition. (And another name for these statistics is the Second Law of Thermodynamics.) Since everything is far more likely to be in a high-entropy condition than a low one, it remains a mystery why the universe currently has relatively low entropy, and apparently had even less in the past. Yet that seems to be the case, and so we need the Past Hypothesis: when considering the past, we ignore the statistically-preferred high-entropy condition, and assume that the closer we get in time to the Big Bang, the more the entropy decreases. Why? Well, that's the question the book grapples with, because nobody has the faintest clue. Carroll scoffs at popular concepts like the anthropic principle, irreversible temporal systems, and a symmetrical, entropy-decreasing Big Crunch, as irrelevant or inadequate to explain the mystery. Instead, he's fond of the idea of ""baby universes"", spawned spontaneously from the maximal-entropy atomic soup of impossibly ancient dead universes. The creation of the baby would have properties similar to the Big Bang - inflation, expansion, low entropy, an arrow of time, and so on. Maybe the reason we observe such crazily low levels of entropy is because our universe is just a toddler. Admittedly, this is a cool idea, but it's not really science. It's not remotely empirical, testable, or falsifiable (which Carroll freely admits). And veering off into crazy metaphysical theories is fun and all, but I mean... we could all be brains in jars, too, or the elaborate fever dream of some minor god. Who knows? I enjoyed this book, though. Its explanation of quantum mechanics was far more lucid and understandable than anything I'd read previously - and it uses cats, but more entertainingly (and humanely) than Schrödinger did. Its speculations on time travel and wormholes and multiple universes gave my inner sci fi geek plenty to chew on. And it introduced me to the concept of Boltzmann brains, which was worth the price of admission in and of itself. But mostly, I just found Carroll's writing to be clear, funny, and affecting. As an example, the following paragraph, which encapsulates everything I consider beautiful and fulfilling about science:  We find ourselves, not as a central player in the life of the cosmos, but as a tiny epiphenomenon, flourishing for a brief moment as we ride a wave of increasing entropy from the Big Bang to the quiet emptiness of the future universe. Purpose and meaning are not to be found in the laws of nature, or in the plans of any external agent who made things that way; it is our job to create them. One of those purposes - among many - stems from our urge to explain the world around us the best we can. If our lives are brief and undirected, at least we can take pride in our mutual courage as we struggle to understand things much greater than ourselves.pg. 374"
3,0525951334,http://goodreads.com/user/show/155663-david,5,"This is a very well-written, and entertaining book on our understanding of the arrow of time. Entropy is a key concept, which deserves (and gets) lots of attention. The second law of thermodynamics states that, in a closed system, entropy can either stay the same or increase--it cannot decrease. Sean Carroll shows why the reversibility of physics at the particle level gives rise to a seeming paradox; if the physics of particles is just as correct with time switched backwards, why can't entropy decrease? Carroll discusses this issue at length.I have often wondered, if the universe were to start contracting at some point (for example, if dark energy did not exist, causing inflation to accelerate), wouldn't entropy start decreasing then? Just as I was getting annoyed that the answer wasn't forthcoming, Carroll started addressing this very issue! He explained that a calculation of entropy requires including gravitational fields, especially in the realms of ""lumpy"" matter. For example, the single supermassive black hole in the center of our galaxy contains more entropy than all of the rest of the universe combined, excluding other black holes!Toward the end of the book, Carroll starts to wander into speculation; he clearly states that his opinion is a minority opinion, but that it is just as well supported as other ideas. The central question that he raises, is this; if the entropy of the universe is still relatively low, but always increases, then at an earlier stage the entropy of the universe must have been much much lower still. So, how did the entropy get that way, so very very low compared to what it would be if the universe were in ""equilibrium"". It is a very important question in cosmology, but I won't ""spoil"" your reading by giving away the answer here. Read the book, and discover a truly interesting, but highly speculative explanation of this conundrum. "
4,0525951334,http://goodreads.com/user/show/31021-kristin,3,"If I could, I would give 5 stars to the first half of this book and 2 to the second. For the first 500 pages or so (in the iBook version), I was enthralled by Carroll's exceptional ability to lay down the fundamentals of physics and cosmology in clear, straightforward language with simple but highly effective illustrations. This book has by far the best description of general relativity (especially the equivalence principle) for the non-physicist that I have ever encountered. His explanation of dark matter and vacuum energy is also brilliant--I was all mixed up on those concepts before I read this book but now I feel I have at least some clarity (though in reality I'm probably as confused as ever). I also loved the discussion on black holes, white holes, and Hawking's black hole radiation. The chapter on quantum mechanics, the collapse of the quantum wave function, and the wave function of the universe (is this stuff for real?), and Miss Kitty is also superb. However, the book isn't really meant to be an introduction to the fundamentals of physics and cosmology. It is about the arrow of time (i.e., why we experience time as flowing from past to present to future) and the author's view that it connects not only to the origin of our universe but to a much broader cosmology. We're talking multi-verses, baby universes, and all sorts of other wild visions here. Carroll believes that they key to understanding time, the universe, and everything is...entropy. I would try to summarize entropy here but, quite honestly, I'm now terrified at the thought. Carroll spends about 1/3-2/3 of the book explaining and re-explaining it. It all started with some engineers in the 19th century who were determined to build more effective steam engines. But, in this book, entropy's reach extends far, far, FAR beyond that. And, whether you are convinced by Carroll's application of entropy/thermodynamics will determine your final views on this book.In the end, I wasn't totally convinced. Entropy is a slippery, fuzzy statistical concept, and it seemed to me that Carroll had no trouble defining and re-defining it on a whim to suit his argument. At times, this practice has completely ridiculous and nonsensical consequences (Boltzmann brains, for instance, which the author seems to believe are ""out there""). And, I felt that Carroll spent way too much time chasing down dead ends, seemingly for its own sake. I did, however, find the end game--once we finally got there--to be really intriguing and imaginative. It will be interesting to see if his model--of our universe being one of many ""baby universes"" that bubbled up from an infinite, static, high-entropy background universe--is ever backed up by real data. What is it they like to say in physics? ""Shut up and calculate?"" "
5,0525951334,http://goodreads.com/user/show/16160897-warpdrive,5,"This is a very good book about some fundamental modern physics concepts (such as arrow of time, entropy, symmetry, time-reversibility, complexity, theory of information) and their complex inter-relationships. I found that this book has one of the best explanations of entropy for the layman, and the treatment of potentially complex areas such as symmetry, quantum mechanics and relativity, is very good - deeper than in most popular science books. Overall, a very enjoyable read, which would appeal to a wide audience, from the mathematically challenged (as maths is very minimal), to individuals looking for a deeper treatment of modern physics than what found in most popular science books.Just a couple of areas where I found areas for improvement: - in the treatment of quantum mechanics, the collapse of the wave function is correctly regarded by the author as a potential problem of the so-called ""Copenhagen interpretation"": this is correct, but there are other interpretations (in particular, the DeBroglie-Bohm theory) that overcome this problem (yes they are non-local, but the author himself actually tends to agree with the non-locality position of this and similar approaches) - so a even brief mention of these alternatives would have made the book much more complete - whilst the concept of symmetry is very nicely illustrated and explained, unfortunately the very important concept of symmetry-breaking is not explained - which I think is baffling in a book which is supposed to deal with time reversibility and the arrow of time. Apart from these minor points, a very enjoyable and rewarding read.  "
6,0525951334,http://goodreads.com/user/show/8079403-max,5,"Carroll offers a provocative explanation for the arrow of time. I found it fascinating, but those without a strong interest in physics may not. Most of the book is spent explaining the basic concepts he uses to make his case. I learned a great deal from these science lessons. In the last few chapters Carroll steps outside the mainstream. He carefully identifies what is speculative. His unconventional ideas true or not were thought provoking. Carroll defines time through its use to label and locate events and its perception as something we move through. Unlike space, time has only one direction. Carroll explores this taking care to clarify difficult concepts such as the space of states, microstates, macrostates, time translation invariance, reversibility of the laws of physics and the conservation of information. We get brief but helpful discussions of special relativity, general relativity, quantum mechanics, light cones, black holes, and white holes all of which play into Carroll’s theme.Much of the book is devoted to entropy. The reason we proceed from past to future is entropy, the relentless decrease of order and useful energy. This comes from the second law of thermodynamics. Ultimately the universe will likely stabilize in a high entropy state. Carroll examines Boltzmann’s equation defining entropy and gives us many simple examples to help us understand it. Carroll explains the scientific meaning of entropy as disorder. Scientists do not use disorder in the general sense. That the universe is always going from lower to higher entropy indicates it started in a low entropy state. This is not a law of physics, but an assumption, a boundary condition called the Past Hypothesis. The Past Hypothesis is essential to construct a credible story of the universe. It is often construed to be due to the Big Bang. Perhaps but Carroll has other ideas. Carroll’s point of departure into the speculative part of the book is the question of how the universe began in a low entropy state.Carroll is searching for a credible theory of quantum gravity. He gives an approving nod to string theory admitting it is a work in progress. In one respect Carroll seems to be in line with some popular string theorists. He believes in the multiverse. He posits that universes are created by quantum fluctuations in empty space. These form bubbles that become baby universes that bud off from the universe that formed them, a process without beginning or end. This answers the anthropic principle, the idea that the universe is finely tuned for life, and the problem of first cause. Carroll takes care to craft his solution so that there are fixed space of states with reversible laws of physics and conservation of information. Most important to Carroll is that this is a way the universe could have started with low entropy. Throughout Carroll points out common assumptions that we may forget are assumptions such as the Past Hypothesis. Another is that the universe we can’t see is like the universe we can. There is no reason to believe that. We don’t know what lies outside our small visible slice. Also while there is no evidence of unusual influence from the unobservable universe on our slice, the observable universe is not a closed system. The second Law of thermodynamics only holds true in a closed system. Another common assumption is that the Big Bang model means a singularity was the beginning of time and space. Carroll views the Big Bang model working well as we look backwards until we reach the singularity at which point the laws of general relativity break down. Thus the conditions present in a singularity are unknown. Carroll accepts the theory of inflation because it is consistent with what we believe about the early universe, but as he notes that does not prove it is true. Obviously that can be said of Carroll’s multiverse; just because it can explain conditions such as low entropy doesn’t make it true. As Carroll points out the multiverse is not even a theory since it is not falsifiable.I enjoyed Carroll’s wild ride into the multiverse at the end of the book. It makes just as much sense to me to have multiple universes as it does to have only one, but then I am not a physicist. Carroll writes with enthusiasm and purpose. The basic physics he takes pains to explain he ties nicely together to support his ideas. I learned some worthwhile science, whether or not there is a multiverse. Recommended highly for those who were wondering why we always wake up tomorrow instead of yesterday."
7,0525951334,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2876105-marc,2,"I’ll be honest: this was a tough job. Sean Carroll really does his best to explain the basic issues of theoretical physics in a comprehensible and pleasant way. Certainly in the beginning he uses a lot of humour, nice literary references and a very patient style to successfully present the ins and outs of classical mechanics (from Newton to Einstein) and quantum mechanics (lots of cats involved).But somewhere halfway through, he starts with what is the logical main part when it comes to time as a physical phenomenon: entropy. And from then on this book slowly becomes a difficult read. From as many as 20-something different perspectives, Carroll tries to answer the question why that entropy exists, how it defines the one-directional arrow of time, and why in our universe it runs from past to future (yep, apparently that is not an obvious question).The answer to that question seems to come down to the initial state of our universe, namely in low entropy. But why was it actually that low back then? From a logical point of view this seems to make no sense. To explain this Carroll jumps from one scenario and theory to another, and every time new issues pop up that make the proposed hypotheses unlikely. It has been cited in some reviews: this book looks like an infinite set of Russian dolls placed one inside another. But in the end Carroll has to conclude: we know too little (especially on quantum gravity) to give a definite answer on this time- and entropy question. But then, Carroll ventures into his own hypothesis (he calls it a prediction, not a theory), which is inspired by the multiversum theory (charming little baby universes are part of it). He admits that this is all very speculative, but he also defends that approach, because to him that is simply the way in which science advances. This was a very interesting book, which ultimately didn't provide a satisfactory answer to the question why time exists as it exists. But it does provide an honest insight into how theoretical science works, although at the cost of a mind boggling reading experience. (2.5 stars)"
8,0525951334,http://goodreads.com/user/show/20245481-mohamed-al-jamri,2,"This book asks and attempts to solve several important questions such as what is time? Why is there an arrow of time? Was there time before the Big Bang? Why did our part of the universe start in a low entropy state? Is time eternal? Is time travel possible?The author explains several cosmological and physical stuff such as the Big Bang, the Steady State model, special and general relativity. He does so using easy to understand language. However as I finished the first third, the book started to become hard to follow and I eventually stopped reading by the middle of it."

10,0525951334,http://goodreads.com/user/show/16212136-peter-pete-mcloughlin,5,"I first read this book in 2010 and may have read it once or twice since then. This time around I listened to an audiobook version of the same book. I think listening to an audio version slowed me down a bit to think more about Carroll's ideas and get a deeper insight into the book. I enjoyed his treatment of the second law and time's arrow and the Boltzmann model of time and the problems that arise from positing a low entropy beginning to the universe. I think Carroll does a good job explaining Time, Entropy, and how it relates to the big bang and the evolution of the universe. Some of the things covered are pretty mind-blowing like the problem of Boltzmann brains and Poincare Recurrence time for the Universe, and inflationary cosmology, eternal inflation, and the multiverse. Carroll entertains many models and is honest about when he is speculating and when he is on solid ground. I recommend this book to anyone who likes physics and philosophy."
11,0525951334,http://goodreads.com/user/show/16080726-sabin,5,"Very, very impressed with the author’s treatment of his subject material. The book is about time. Not about what we do with our time, not about how to manage our time more efficiently, not even about the history of timekeeping, time-travel, or other things that we can do in time and with time. Ok, it is a bit about each of these subjects, but it is essentially about why we have this concept. Why do we perceive time in the way we do and why is time such a difficult concept to grasp.Well it turns out that according to the reversible laws of physics in effect around us, time is just a construct by convention: it helps us order events, measure the duration between them and there’s also the fact that we see time as something which flows past us. But just like Terry Pratchett’s “atoms of justice” or “molecules of mercy” there is no fundamental particle of time. The physical process which makes us imagine time is the decay of useful energy, or the increase of entropy. It quite straightforward actually, you notice it as you age: you get weaker, internal organs perform worse, there’s an increasing chance that something will fail, and so on. So the evolution from a low-entropy state towards a higher entropy state is the direction of the arrow of time.And now comes the interesting question. “Why?” Why should there be an arrow of time, a preferred direction, from a low-entropy past to a high-entropy future. Caroll states from the outset that we don’t actually know the answer, but that there are some things we do know. And Caroll hopes they can help point us in the right direction. Instead of an answer to that question, what we get in this book is a very thorough exploration of the concept of entropy in thermodynamics, information theory, black hole cosmology and how it ties together with quantum mechanics.This is not another way to look at the world around us, but a way to challenge the reader to think seriously about an issue with almost no practical implications to our day to day life. The nature of time is right there, on the same level with the beginning of life, consciousness and the nature of reality: we could function very well without knowing any of the details. But by thinking about such issues, a person sees oneself as part of a privileged group, the human species, and their personal existence as a chance event in the great scheme of things. To me it feels like a kind of spiritual liberation.A book of non-fiction always runs the risk of requiring too much specialised knowledge from the reader to properly understand the arguments therein, but, on the other extreme, it can get really dull if it spends too much time on basic information. The middle ground is hard to find and it depends heavily on the reader’s familiarity with the topic. For my part, this book was almost perfect. It filled a lot of holes in my sketchy understanding of entropy and showed me how to think about relativity past its basic implications, but the quantum mechanics part was a bit sketchy. I could follow his arguments, but I was left hungry for more information.Caroll discusses the concept of entropy in depth because it is central to his theory, then gives a whirlwind tour of the main statements in special and general relativity, and also of the most popular interpretations of quantum mechanics. He concludes that the nature of time is still an open issue, without much hope of being solved with our current understanding of the physical laws of the universe, at least until quantum gravity is finally integrated into a unified system of laws. It seems that since we get different configurations of matter when we account for entropy at first without and then with gravity, we will need to understand what happens inside of black holes and on the other side of their event horizon, where quantum gravity becomes important. Since 2010, when Caroll wrote the book, we have made a few more discoveries concerning the nature of gravity, but from what I can gather there is still no definitive theory to integrate the theory of gravity from general relativity with quantum physics. So the answer may still lie out there.I guess one person’s enjoyment of a science book comes down to how much they can actually follow the author’s line of reasoning and understand the author’s conclusions. So for light reading or an introduction and background information you could do worse than read something by James Gleick, but if you feel ready to go to the next level I definitely recommend Caroll. It is demanding, frustrating at times, but well worth the time invested, and has a great bibliography, with suggested reading material both for the specialist and for the reader of popular non-fiction."
12,0525951334,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1345046-todd-martin,2,"Science and journalism are two very different disciplines and require a different set of skill sets. Those with skill in one area may or may not have talent in the other. I’m not sure about Sean Carroll’s skills as a scientist, but I have little praise for his talents as a writer.Carroll seems incapable of explaining things clearly. He attempts to illustrate points throughout the book with convoluted examples that appear to be intended to confuse rather than illuminate. He even manages to make very simple topics (ice cooling water in a glass, or the uncertainty principle for example) a confusing, over-complicated muddle. Couple the above with a dry, meandering writing style that goes on for close to 500 pages and you are left with a reading experience that can best be described as pure drudgery.In the end, those that already understand the concepts covered will be able to follow Carroll’s tortuous examples, but are unlikely to learn anything new. Those not familiar with the subject matter will probably not be able to follow Carroll’s examples, and are also unlikely to learn anything new. ‘Time’ is therefore better spent elsewhere (let me suggest Brian Greene’s “Fabric of the Cosmos”).So what is the ‘ultimate theory of time’? Time is an inherent property of the universe, it goes forwards and not backwards because entropy would decrease if it did (a violation of the 2nd law of thermodynamics). That’s it."
13,0525951334,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7035744-tony-heyl,5,"Time is both a simple and yet complicated scientific question. I looked up books about time after seeing one of the Through the Wormhole shows on Science Channel. This is actually a really well put together book. Most of the book is about entropy and the evolution of the universe, so it makes sense that the content itself goes from the very simple to the very complicated, bring you along the way without making you feel like an idiot. The equations and explanations are also done in a way to really tease out how they came to be formulated so that you understand the timeline of understanding time and can put things into context. The way that charts and examples are done is good too because it's not like you have to move to the next page to understand what the text is saying. By the end of the book, not only did I have a much better picture of time, but also of how a multiverse would work, and it really does make sense. Not the best science book I've read because it is complex at times, but I definitely think it is quality."
14,0525951334,http://goodreads.com/user/show/688965-sean,1,"In the realm of popular physics books, this one is a three-legged mule. It doesn't even have much to say about time, aside from an unbelievably long-winded explanation of entropy. The writing is simplistic in the extreme, yet manages to obscure more than it explains. Carroll obviously wishes he was Brian Greene. He is not. Had to skim the second half of it."
15,0525951334,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1072527-nicholas,5,"Simply the best popular physics book I've ever read. Carroll is amazingly lucid, practical and totally excited about the subject while being conscious of the problems inherent in understanding something that is so fundamental to our existence that we take it for granted: time. What is time? Does it exist naturally, or is it emergent from some other property of the universe? These are the grand questions that drive From Eternity to Here. In fact, the questions are so grand, and so monumental, Carroll can't help but comment on the scope of modern physics from classical mechanics and relativity to the absurd realities of quantum mechanics. Within From Eternity the lay reader will find a candid and clear discussion of pretty much anything physics related a non-specialist would want to know (and perhaps a few things you didn't). The book is divided into roughly four parts - each dealing with an aspect that explains several key features about time. Of primary focus to Carroll is the arrow of time - a fundamental asymmetry in the flow of time. How is it that we can remember the past, but not the future? It sounds like a nonsensical question at first glance, but when you really think about it, there is no logical reason for why it should be so. The first part of the book attempts to nail down what we even mean by time, and to elucidate some of its properties so that we can better understand what it is we're looking for when constructing a theory of time. Next, Carroll takes us on a whirlwind tour of Einstein's theories of relativity and the way that they distort our common sense notion of what time is and how it's supposed to function. In particular, Carroll emphasizes that subjective nature of time, not in the figurative sense we're all used to (This class feels like it's taking forever!), but in a very literal sense through the exploration of light cones and the time bending effects of black holes. Perhaps the most interesting part of the book follows thereafter. Carroll ties the evolution of time and its direction to the laws of thermodynamics, in particular to statistical mechanic descriptions of the second law: entropy always tends to increase. Here we see asymmetry manifest and perhaps the first clue as to why we perceive time ""flowing"" in a single direction, or even existing at all. The tendency of any closed system is to always be more and more entropic (here we can insert the word disorganized, but very carefully). In common parlance, any system tends toward the most likely state we should find it in - mostly equilibrium. Think of a box of gas that initially has all of the gas restricted to one side in its initial condition. If we watched such a box over time, what would we find? Most likely, we'd find that in the future, the gas would have dispersed until it reached equilibrium throughout the box, at which point it stops evolving. So goes the universe according to Carroll. For some reason that we're not one hundred percent clear on, the universe just after the Big Bang contained very low entropy. Our experience of change and time rests on the natural working of that system toward a more natural high entropy condition. The last section is highly speculative, but exciting to think about. Here Carroll expands upon a number of theories about the evolution of the universe, its origins and its ultimate destination. Admittedly, there is little evidence from any of the proposals, but they're all fantastic to think about. Carroll seems to succeed more than anything in making you feel smaller and more insignificant than you thought possible. This is an impressive feat given the series of substantial widenings in perspective given to us by scientists from Galileo to Hubble. But it's not a bad thing. On the contrary, there's a wonderful sense of order and determinism in the evolution of the universe as presented by Carroll that's mind-blowing to think about. As a reader, you really can't help but be infected by Carroll's own excitement and optimism that science will ultimately unlock even the deepest mysteries of where we came from and where we're going. Probably not for people who have no concept of physics whatsoever, but if you've read any popular physics books by Greene or Kaku, you'll find that Carroll is much more down to earth. The stuff in the latter section tends toward the esoteric, but it's presented clearly and with as much caution as possible. Pick it up. It's worth your while."
16,0525951334,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1019174-terence,3,"Unlike my usual practice since joining GoodReads, I very deliberately did not take notes while reading From Eternity to Here. I wanted to enjoy myself with an interesting topic (cosmology) and not be overly concerned with learning anything - the nonfiction analog of the fictional brain candy I read.But this is the post-GoodReads era of my life so am compelled to offer some note to the interested reader. Thus:The problem under discussion here is the ""arrow of time"" - why, unlike the physical principles of space, do the principles of time appear irreversible? It turns out we simply don't know. We know enough about quantum mechanics and classical gravity to make reasonable guesses but absent a theory of quantum gravity we're pretty much fumbling around in a very dark room.Carroll has his own favored answer - which has to do with the multiverse, de Sitter spaces, infinite entropy, low-entropy states and baby universes, and preserves the reversibility of time (though not within a particular universe (sorry, ""Dr. Who"" fans) - but he's honest enough to say it's unverifiable with the present state of knowledge and lays out other promising competitors.I thought Carroll padded the laying out of the problem (and why it is a problem), and he's another author who has a tendency to make cute, folksy, annoying asides but if you're interested in cosmology this is a book worthy of your unrecoverable time.(In an aside - Reading this book brought to mind one of the worst books I've ever read - John Horgan's The End of Science Facing the Limits of Knowledge in the Twilight of the Scientific Age Helix Books, where the author argues that we've pretty much come to the end of scientific advance and are only mopping up a few loose ends here and there. This is one of the few books that truly disgusted me. Most of my one-stars are simply books that I didn't like but this one made me feel intellectually assaulted. In the light of what we're discovering in space, consciousness and genetics (among the sciences that I'm interested in), Horgan's short-sightedness appears especially appalling.)"

18,0525951334,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1680974-alex-zakharov,4,"Great read, under proper expectations. The central theme is the puzzle of macroscopic irreversibility which we are all intuitively familiar with - eggs don’t spontaneously unbreak from the frying pan and the milk doesn’t unmix from your morning latte. The puzzle is that at the microscopic level the fundamental laws of physics are perfectly reversible, so why does the Second Law of thermodynamics hold in every situation that we know of? More specifically, Carroll seeks the explanation for why the time flows in one direction only. Frankly, nobody knows the answer, and even in order to ask the question meaningfully Carroll is forced to cover the basics of relativity, gravity, entropy, thermodynamics, evolution of early universe and quantum field theory. This is a lot of ground to cover and the man refuses to use any equations! Sure, intuition is often useful, but “the unreasonable effectiveness of mathematics in the natural sciences” is not accidental and avoiding equations altogether is a disservice to your audience, no matter what your publishers tell you.And so, the chapters are really hit and miss. For example, the overview of special and general relativity were disappointing (Brian Greene’s and Jeffrey Bennett’s pop introductions are better). Similarly, for clear overview of primordial nucleosynthesis, plasma, and recombination epoch I would go with Max Tegmark. Let’s move on to entropy – the subject is notoriously confusing so I won’t hold too much grudge against the author. In fact he covers Boltzmann entropy better than most, but once he moves out of thermodynamic equilibrium into Shannon, Gibbs and free energy the absence of any equations muddies up the “intuitive” explanation. On the plus side there are number of areas where Carroll is fantastic - black hole thermodynamics, Hawkins radiation and microscopic reversibility were all excellent. The various flavors of Boltzmann brain arguments and the havoc they wreak on the inviolability of arrow of time are by themselves worth the price of the book. And in the end Carroll does make a convincing case for the necessity and arbitrariness of the “Past Hypothesis”. In other words, we fully concede that we cannot derive macroscopic irreversibility from the fundamental laws of physics, and we simply must assume low-entropy early universe as the boundary condition. And it is that boundary condition that sets up the directionality of the Second Law and One-way Arrow of Time.The “Past Hypothesis” seems to be the mainstream view today, in a sense that we have to assume it until we find a better explanation. Naturally, there is no dearth of principled suggestions that attempt to avoid the necessity of assumption (e.g. bubble universes, cyclical time, string-theoretic “branes”), but clearly the question is still open. Carroll himself has a speculative theory (the Carrol-Chen model) where there is a background de Sitter space, in equilibrium and without arrow of time. Against this background, quantum fluctuations occasionally give rise to “baby universes” that start out in a low-entropy state and have local arrows of time (backwards or forward!). These baby universes eventually dilute back into the background, resulting in an overall time-symmetric multiverse. Yep, a little crazy, but wait till you get to the next paragraph.The book was published in 2010 and since then there were further developments in the field. I particularly liked the tasty 2014 marriage of quantum computing and spacetime, where perhaps for the first time in history computer scientists contributed to theoretical physics. Yes, I’m referring to the whole ER=EPR conjecture, and the dissolution of the “Firewall Paradox” with the help of computational complexity. In that context Leonard Susskind explicitly relates space to quantum entanglement, and time to the growth of quantum computational complexity. If this plays out then “Past Hypothesis” won’t be necessary, but till then I will leave you with this thought: “Those who think of metaphysics as the most unconstrained or speculative of disciplines are misinformed; compared with cosmology, metaphysics is pedestrian and unimaginative.” —Stephen Toulmin"

But come on, low star reviewers. What do you expect from a discursive (i.e., non mathematical) treatment of so complex a topic? The author makes heavy use of metaphor? How the hell else is he to make abstruse and -- let's face it -- oftentimes pretty bizarre ideas accessible to a non-specialist readership? You were bored? Again, my low-star confreres, why the #%^* did you bother reading past the first chapter? Bottom line: this is a first-rate piece of popular science writing. By the time you've finished reading it you may not fully understand what time is or why it points in the direction it does, but you'll understand well why cosmologists pose these questions in the first place and where answers to them may one day lie.

Pay close attention to the word ""Quest"" in the subtitle. This books poses many questions that don't have answers yet and instead focuses on the various theories that currently exist. The book starts with an introduction to possible definitions of what time is, the role of entropy, and the Second Law of Thermodynamics. With that foundation it dives into microscopic constituents, macroscopic systems, and quantum mechanics before finishing off with inflation, the reversibility of time, and multiverses. I found as I went along the tractability became further removed from everyday life and ended up almost entirely in the realm of theoretical physics and dare I say philosophy. If you are interested in understanding the current state of thinking about what time is, the origins of the universe, and similar topics the author's writing is excellent and the copious footnotes helpful.

The best feature of the book was the honest admission by the author of ideas that have been robustly tested and verified, as well as those which are yet to be accepted by scientists. In the process, Mr. Carroll conveys the excitement and uncertainty around the development of new ideas in Science.The book is richly sprinkled with personal anecdotes, historical curiosities and various missteps as well as intellectual triumphs of scientists. Additionally, the relationship between time and cosmology is richly elucidated, which was kinda surprising to me.

28,0525951334,http://goodreads.com/user/show/18942380-william-schram,5,"From Eternity To Here by Sean Carroll is an excellent book on the nature of time itself. The book is for the layman and is quite well-written, with its focus being on the Arrow of Time and why it exists. Through his musings, we find content on Information Theory, Statistical Thermodynamics and so on. This book touches on a great many subjects in Physics.The book doesn’t have many equations but it does take some understanding of the Second Law of Thermodynamics. That is the law that states that things tend toward disorder. While it is possible to unbreak an egg, it is extremely unlikely. Most physical equations don’t have a preferred direction in time. This makes it easy to calculate certain things. However, that is not the same for our experiences of the world as a whole. To see such a phenomenon as the unbreaking of an egg; or cream, sugar, and coffee unmixing into their constituent parts would be akin to watching a movie in reverse. Here’s the crux of the matter, it isn’t forbidden for such things to happen. Like I mentioned before, it is quite unlikely for a floor to hit all the molecules of a broken egg back into place, but that doesn’t make it completely impossible. Using these ideas, we can extrapolate back in time to the Big Bang. Supposedly, the time of the Big Bang was a situation in which the Universe was perfectly ordered and had extremely low entropy. We can infer this since the entropy of the universe tends to increase with time. If the Universe started out at a high entropy state, nothing would happen, and I would not be here to write this review.While the book doesn’t have many equations as I mentioned, the ones that it does contain are pretty famous. Well, to some, I suppose. Einstein’s E=mc squared is almost ubiquitous, but while his Field Equation for General Relativity is famous to a select few, I can’t imagine many people recognizing that one. As it does cover all these things, relativity comes into play; with light cones, Spacetime, Black Holes, and all of that good stuff.Throughout the book, we find references to such luminaries as Ludwig Boltzmann, Sadi Carnot, Rudolf Clausius, James Clerk Maxwell, and others. Along with the founders of Thermodynamics and other disciplines, we also follow some more modern scientists.This book is really good, as I might have mentioned before. If you can find it, I feel it is worth a look."
29,0525951334,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2105523-bob-nichols,4,"If I am tracking his argument accurately, Carroll is saying in this book that change, as time, is eternal.The so-called arrow of time flows one way as energy dissipates from low entropy to high entropy states. The problem in physics that Carroll needs to address is the big bang theory which states that time (space-time) begins with the initial 'bang' and is expanding space-time outward (i.e., not moving into pre-existent space-time; ""the universe expands into nothing""). At this point, the current theory suggests three scenarios. In one, expansion continues without end. In a second, expansion continues until energy is fully dissipated and a heat death is reached. The third scenario is that the universe is pulled back to it's starting center by the collective force of gravity ('big crunch'). Regarding the thermal equilibrium and heat death scenario, Carrol writes that as there can never be a complete absence of heat, there is a perpetual movement toward entropy (Whether and how this relates to the first law - the conservation of energy - he doesn't say as I recall). He also states that there will always be clumps of matter that re-form over vast scales of time. These become centers of gravity that, in turn, form new planets, stars, galaxies, and clusters of galaxies. This leaves the first scenario, perpetual expansion (which, appropriating Einstein, he calls the ""cosmological constant""), as the only one that is consistent with the state of the evidence.The 'dark horse' for Carroll is the role of dark energy which, he argues, moves the 'arrow of time' from a low entropy (high energy) to high entropy (low energy) state that began with the big bang. Dark energy is responsible for the continued, and accelerated, expansion (like an expanding balloon) of our universe as energy dissipates along the low to high entropy gradient. Given the unevenness of the expansion (""fluctuation""), matter collects and forms mass, and gravity continues to do its job of creating ""pocket universes"" of which we, in our corner, are one. These, collectively, constitute a ""multi-verse"" situation where universes somehow (wormholes?) connect to each other and where each go through continuous cycles of collapse and expansion. Whether this is close to an accurate summary of Carroll, I can't say. Carroll opens one of his chapters with a quote that states that, compared to cosmology, metaphysics is ""pedestrian and unimaginative."" That characterization seems true with this book and where Carroll takes his reader. In a way, what Carroll presents is an inspirational and even beautiful theory. We, however small, are privileged to be part of this infinitely vast cosmos and to have the capacity to wonder what it is all about.On the book cover, Brian Green is quoted as saying Carroll's book is ""delightful,"" but that doesn't seem to be the right word. What Carroll is writing about is hard-to-grasp, heady stuff. Depending on the intended audience, the book may have benefited from leaving out more of the mental experiments and focusing on the big picture instead. Carroll maintains that his book is about time but in a way, this seems to be not really the most interesting part of this book. In the concept of entropy, the universe as we know it moves from states of disequilibrium to (relative) equilibrium, and then back to states of disequilibrium as dark energy recollects itself as matter. Where Carroll sees this as the driving of time one way, a 'power' gradient can be also seen to lie at the heart of the cosmos as it moves from disequilibrium (concentrated energy or power) to equilibrium states (dissipated energy where there is no power). It's interesting to speculate on the parallels with life processes, where disequilibrium as 'survival need' creates action that results in the re-establishment of equilibrium (satisfaction of need), and the operation of human societies where we, as organic matter, seem to operate by this cyclic tension created by relative power differentials. The way Carroll uses the term entropy is confusing. He consistently refers to high and low entropy and when this is deciphered more, low energy means order, and order means disequilibrium; high entropy means disorder and equilibrium. As one tends to see equilibrium as order and disequilibrium as disorder, and as it's confusing to understand ""high entropy/low energy, and low entropy/high energy,"" the lay reader has to fight his or her way through this hurdle (constant mental gymnastics) throughout the book. Elsewhere, he references an ""increase in entropy"" and says such things as ""Black Holes have entropy,"" leaving the reader to wonder what happened to ""high and low,"" and wondering if entropy is a static concept rather than a high-to-low energy gradient and process.It is also not clear what is meant by ""order"" in entropy. ""Order,"" Carroll writes, involves ""a purposeful arrangement of matter"" and it is this movement from order to disorder that drives the arrow of time. While we can readily understand life as some form of purposeful arrangement of matter (i.e., a system of parts that works together), understanding a black hole or a big bang situation as 'order' seems to involve, 'simply,' gravitational pull of matter onto itself. If this is true, it becomes harder to understand order here as ""a purposeful arrangement"" of matter unless, perhaps, it could ever be understood what it is about gravity that enables it to pull matter into itself.

Someday we may know what is beyond our galaxy. Our galaxy is still expanding.

32,0525951334,http://goodreads.com/user/show/26055396-sense-of-history,2,"A fascinating book, without a doubt, about a subject that interests me uttermost: why does time exist, and why does it always flow in one direction? Of course, we end up with the inevitable 2nd law of thermodynamics and the concept of entropy. Carroll really does his best to explain the consequences of that strange concept, and especially the mysteries that linger around it. For the time being, science does not succeed in formulating a truly satisfactory answer, and so doesn’t Carroll. See my review in my general account Marc: https://www.goodreads.com/review/show.... I was therefore somewhat disappointed by the lack of a clear answer to the basic question. But nevertheless Carroll in this book introduces a number of paths or lines of thought that stimulated me in my current reading program about time experience and temporality. For example, he refers to an interesting remark in John Pirsigs' cult book Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance: An Inquiry Into Values, namely that the ancient Greeks apparently “saw the future as something that came upon them from behind their backs, with the past receding away before their eyes”. I do not know where Pirsig got this from (Plato/Aristotle?), but it is a vision that challenges because it goes against our intuitive feeling in western modernity that a person always is facing the future and has the past in his back. Interesting to think further about that one.Another notion that comes up in this book is our intuitive sense about the past as fixed, unchangeable, as opposed to the future that seems like open to many possibilities. Theoretical physics seriously challenges this view: in quantum physics cause and effect do not appear to be unambiguously separated from each other and - at least in theory - can also occur in reverse order. That uncertainty actually fits in with the post-modern historiography of the last decades, which places a great deal of emphasis on perception and representation. In an extreme version of that current, the past seems to be open to infinite variability; I personally have a hard time with that extreme way of looking at the past, but you can't just wipe it off the table: every glance at the past is coloured by the present and the context of the observer, and the 'represented' past can therefore undergo considerable change over time.The observation that we are living in a 4-dimensional space in our universe, where spatial aspects take on 3 dimensions, but time is limited to only 1 dimension, also stimulates the imagination. I understand from Carroll that (in connection with that issue about entropy) scientists still cannot really give a clear explanation for that one time dimension (there are theoretical models that take into account multiple time dimensions, but frankly this line of thinking seems very much like pure science fiction). And so we arrive at what may be the best quote that this book contains: ""But the question remains: ""what is time?"" The response from the American physicist John Wheeler is worth remembering: ""Time is nature's way of keeping everything from happening at once.” It may seem a very laconic way of representing things (not taking into account the quantum mechanical issues), but this statement certainly is unequivocal."
33,0525951334,http://goodreads.com/user/show/21788173-daniel-shawen,4,"I really like Sean's newer book, 'Particle at the end of the universe', which I read first, and also Sean's blogs, videos and many public debates on various topics.'From Ethernity to Here' is a thorough treatment of time as viewed from a quantum mechanical and relativistic perspective, but missing is any discussion of time after the July 2012 discovery of the Higgs boson.The Higgs boson, an excitation of the Higgs field that permeates all of space, and the Higgs mechanism which gives inertial mass to electrons, positrons, quarks, antiquarks and possibly even neutrinos must surely change our ideas about space-time. We long suspected (but evidently did not make any theories about, because most did not expect confirmation from the LHC) that the backdrop of space and time had a component that is the virtual particle sea that is space itself. Current thinking is that the Higgs mechanism does not violate conservation of energy because it is the slowing down of certain particles which imparts the property we understand as mass. Could it be that the absolute limit of the speed of light for both matter and energy is related to the Higgs mechanism? How could this not change our conception of how the flow of time and the underlying theories of Special and General relativity operate? Well, by simply ignoring the result of course. Don't blame Sean's book; it hadn't been discovered yet. But someone had better start contemplating the consequences soon.Dark matter and dark energy loom large in astrophysics circles without anything resembling an explanation of what they are. As Sean points out in his book, a discrepancy of 10^120 in the value of the vacuum expectation value cannot stand for long as a calculation that purports to explain anything about the universe and have the audacity to call itself a science.We now know more about time than this book suggests. Can't wait to read the next treatment of the subject by someone without a vested interest in further development of what is now an obsoleted model of time."
34,0525951334,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4873736-keith,2,"Sean Carroll’s book is not for the faint of heart. It is a dense, complex tour of physics over the past century and a half. While the book is nominally called “The quest for the ultimate theory of time,” it is really about entropy and the Second Law of Thermodynamics (that things go from order to disorder — entropy — and not the opposite way). That law essentially defines the direction of time, and thus, to Carroll, time. (You can make eggs into omelets, but you can't make omelets into eggs.)I must admit that I probably understood less than a quarter of this book. To really comprehend it, you’d better have a better-than-average understanding of physics and cosmology. (Which I certainly don’t have, but I do have an interest in time and universe as it relates to any “meaning of life.”)At many times, the book goes on long tangents and I wasn’t sure what they had to do with time. That can make the book grueling to read. (It took me almost a year of picking it up and putting it down before I could finish it, and I pride myself on being able to read some arcane, dry stuff.)The author admits that the first 12 (of 16 chapters) are background leading up to this main point. That point seems to be that we live in a world of multiple universes. I.e., there is a universe outside of ours from which ours was created. So time never had a beginning — it existed before the Big Bang in the larger ""outside"" universe. That’s his key point. And if we (humans) are dwarfed by the size of our knowable universe, there is even a greater universe “outside” that dwarfs ours. It’s kind of depressing. Of course, Carroll admits this is just a prediction that, as of yet, has no proof. The book has some interesting sections, but I can’t recommend it to the layman reader. It is just too complex and rambling. "
35,0525951334,http://goodreads.com/user/show/10270148-mac,2,"Confession: I didn't read the entire book. I tried. I really tried, but I just couldn't get through portions. I started out fine but began to lose momentum when I reached quantum theory, and I was totally lost when I entered ""Bekenstein's Entropy Conjecture,"" ""Magnetic Monopoles,"" and ""A String Theory Surprise."" So there were sections where I read the words and didn't understand and even some places where I did not read the words. The fault, if blame is in order, is almost all with me as a reader, not with Carroll as author. I just don't have enough science background or aptitude to understand a book like this. It's beyond my abilities.In my defense, I will say the book is extremely detailed, with idea vs idea, example vs example, and theory vs theory. Though the writing is clear and the visuals are frequent--and also clear--Carroll seems to be writing for physicists, not for the layman. I don't sense he is showing off; I do sense he is a very thorough (and repetitive) guy, conveying every possible twist and turn, journeying down every avenue of current scientific thought on the theory of time. Along the way, it seems he leaves no stone unturned. To summarize, I'm interested in time as a subject, but this isn't the book for me. In the future, I'll stick with writers like Brian Greene where I'll have a better chance of understanding the ideas and a better chance of reading the entire book."

Unfortunately, I still couldn't get my mind around the concepts and claim that they brought me any real understanding.I learned tidbits such as the fact that GPS satellites experience about 38 more microseconds per day in orbit than they would on the ground, but I can't say I understand why. (I love that Carroll uses the phrase ""about 38 more microseconds,"" because, you know, this is just an approximation that is probably off by some fraction of a microsecond!)His sense of humor leads him to write: ""The saying goes that every equation cuts your book sales in half."" Then he proceeds to reproduce the Einstein field equation for general relativity, which is different and more complicated than the E=MC2 one and involves Greek letters. This was the excuse I needed, on page 90, to give up.I really can't give a book I gave up on more than two stars, but for someone more savvy in physics or possibly just plain smarter than I am, From Eternity to Here might be an absolute delight."

Physicists are starting to consider the question, and the author of this book asserts that time essentially is a by-product of the second law of thermodynamics, which states that the entropy of a closed system never decreases, and can only increase or stay the same. This theory does not seem sufficient to me. It implies that if one were to occupy a region of space where entropy was decreasing (through the use of energy from outside that region, which is the only way it could happen), the direction of time would reverse, and one would ""remember"" the future rather than the past. Further, it is unclear at best whether the region of space occupied by one's mind is increasing or decreasing in entropy, or perhaps both at different times. After all, the essence of life is that it uses energy from outside the organism to at least temporarily stave off entropy and decay. Still, this is a very interesting book, and well worth reading. I must add that it has a great title, especially for a cinephile like me. It is punchy, evocative of the book's subject matter, and tied to a great film which is one of my personal favorites."

The book contains very clear summaries of general relativity and quantum physics, but the real agenda here is entropy. I've been able to identify and answer entropic questions in everyday experience while reading this book, and his discussion of both Boltzmann Brains and the information-based solution to Maxwell's Demon thoroughly cleared away the fuzziness in my understanding of those concepts (for now, at least). Carroll is also refreshingly transparent about when he's discussing thoroughly verified scientific theories, when there's data we can't explain, when there are more theories than data, and when one of those theories is his own. Highly recommended if you have any interest in cosmology, entropy, or time."

This was disappointing mainly because Carroll states rather brazenly at the beginning of the book that all our questions would be answered. So all in all a pretty good book that effectively explains to the laymen some of the most important concepts in physics, but just a bit too much over-promising at the start to give it the punch it could have otherwise had."

46,0525951334,http://goodreads.com/user/show/235151-richard,4,"Why do we careen relentlessly from the known and static past towards an unknown and seemingly protean future? Physicist Sean Carroll's answer is that every expression of ""time's arrow,"" from the impossibility of unscrambling an egg to the absurdity of remembering the future, is ultimately rooted in the 
second law of thermodynamics
, which tells us that the 
entropy
 of any 
closed system
 can never decrease. Entropy – essentially a physical measurement, not unlike temperature or length – can be thought of in a number of ways that all turn out to be equivalent: as a measure of disorder, as a measure of the unavailability of energy to perform useful work, or (most weirdly) as a measure of our ignorance of the internal physical state of a system. The (not so intuitive) fact that entropy may never decrease (i.e., that it must always either increase or remain constant) is due to the (more intuitive) fact that for any collection of objects, the number of ways in which those objects can be arranged arbitrarily, must be greater than the number of ways in which they can be arranged systematically. Because of this, any random change in a configuration of objects is more likely to favor increasing disorder over increasing order. As the number of objects in a collection grows larger, this tendency strengthens rapidly. The number of molecules that make up an object even as small as (for example) an egg is absurdly large, so there are vastly many more ways for those molecules to be arranged when that egg is scrambled, than there are when that egg is intact. When an egg breaks, the random collisions of molecules that occur will therefore be overwhelmingly more likely to disorganize it than to spontaneously reassemble it. This statistical tendency towards disorder, uniquely among physical laws, makes a distinction between past and future, and manifests itself to us as the universal arrow of time. That a chicken is able to manufacture an egg in the first place owes to the fact that disorder can be decreased locally, but only at the cost of generating a greater measure of disorder elsewhere within the same system: the disorder of the system as a whole must increase. If the entire universe were in a state of maximum disorder (that is, if all matter and energy were distributed so homogeneously that it would be impossible for the distribution to become more disordered), then it wouldn't be possible for any structure (such as a molecule, or a planet, or an person) to form. Since it would be impossible to construct a clock of any type, there would in that situation be no way to measure the passage of time. Time would still exist as a measure of location in four-dimensional spacetime, but there would be no more distinction between past and future than there is now between left and right; time's arrow would become meaningless. That it's possible for structures to exist at all is due to the fact that there exists a ""surplus"" of order which may be ""spent in payment"" for new order; in other words, that entropy was lower in the past than it is today. Indeed, the reason that we can even make the distinction between past and future at all is that we live in the (four dimensional) neighborhood of an event of extremely low entropy: the Big Bang. Just as our proximity to the Earth's great mass creates a local sense of up and down, our proximity to the Big Bang's low disorder creates a local sense of past and future. And, just as the concepts of up and down become meaningless far away (in space) from the Earth's gravity, so too would the concepts of future and past become meaningless far away (in spacetime) from the low entropy of the Big Bang.It seems to me that there are at least two weaknesses to the argument that the directionality of time is a consequence of The Second Law. The first is that there's a subatomic interaction, known as kayon decay, which possesses an arrow of time that's completely independent of the Second Law arrow that I've described above. But if there are two arrows that each point in the same direction, and neither can be shown to orient the other, doesn't that suggest that they're each directed by some deeper, underlying principle? It also appears to me that Carroll never really proves the contention that the thermodynamic arrow of time generates every other aspect of time's directionality, so much as he defaults to it, on the ground that entropy is the only plausible option available to us (in other words, there is no other fundamental rule of physics – outside of kayon decay, which Carroll assures us has no impact on any arrow of time that affects us – that is irreversible with respect to time and that could, therefore, explain time's arrow). As fascinating as Carroll's explanation is, I can't help wondering if there isn't some deeper explanation awaiting discovery.Assuming that disorder is the explanation for the arrow of time, a new question is raised: why was the entropy of the Big Bang so low in the first place? The low entropy of the early universe is a deep mystery, and Carroll admits that for now we can only speculate as to the answer. One possibility is that there is no explanation, that the state of the early universe is simply a ""brute fact"" about reality. This would of course be an unsatisfying answer, and not a particularly helpful one.Another conjecture is that the low disorder of the early universe was a random, anomalous fluctuation. Sheer chance can cause order to emerge spontaneously, given sufficient time (or given a sufficiently large number of random permutations). Richard Feynman addressed this possibility in his  Lectures on Physics: ""From the hypothesis that the world is a fluctuation, all of the predictions are that if we look at a part of the world we have never seen before, we will find it mixed up, and not like the piece we just looked at. If our order were due to a fluctuation, we would not expect order anywhere but where we have just noticed it. We therefore conclude that the universe is not a fluctuation."" Carroll nevertheless suggests an intriguing (and in my view, unsettling), way in which the universe might in fact turn out to be a fluctuation. In this scenario, our entire universe (which is at least 46 billion light years across, and possibly much larger), would be an infinitesimally small oasis of order, one among (perhaps infinitely) many other island universes, scattered in a (perhaps infinite) sea of chaotic particles each of which is separated from its siblings by near-perfect vacuum stretching across distances many orders of magnitude greater than the already unimaginable distances within each universe. Given an infinitely large space in which to play, and an infinite length of time, every configuration of energy and matter that could possibly exist, no matter how absurdly unlikely and infrequent (such as a low entropy Big Bang) would be not merely possible but inevitable. This possibility appears to have been ruled out by Ludwig Boltzmann, who reasoned that in such a reality, any arbitrarily chosen conscious observer would be more likely to find itself to be a randomly-assembled, disembodied consciousness (a so-called ""Boltzmann Brain""), than to find itself to be a part of a larger and well-organized world, as we ourselves appear to be. In 
Cosmos
, Carl Sagan wrote, ""if you wish to make an apple pie from scratch, you must first invent the universe."" Carroll remarks, only partly facetiously, that it would in fact take less time for an apple pie to emerge spontaneously from chaos, than for a low entropy universe to emerge by chance from the same chaos.(It also seems to me that the expansion of the universe would mean that eventually, the future light cone of every particle would be completely devoid of all but virtual particles. But I could be mistaken.)The speculation that Carroll considers most likely is that our spacetime continuum came into existence with the Big Bang and will continue to expand for an infinite length of time, eventually reaching maximum entropy or ""heat death."" In this scenario, our continuum ""gives birth"" to ""daughter universes,"" at least some of which generate their own ""babies,"" each of which in turn begins at a low entropy state, expands, ""gives birth,"" and finally exhausts its supply of usable energy and ""dies."" There would always be a fresh supply of low-entropy spaces in which interesting things (people, for example) could occur, the total entropy of the entire system would be able to increase without limit, and the process would be able to continue infinitely far into both the past and future (to whatever extent those terms make sense in this context).From Here to Eternity offers exceptionally clear and informative discussions of entropy (and in particular to its relation to information theory) and a small but amusing bonus for those who enjoy debating creationists: a back-of-the-envelope calculation that demonstrates that the sunlight that falls on the Earth in a single year is more than sufficient to decrease the entropy of Earth's entire biomass from the theoretical maximum to zero. (In other words, the entropy of the sunlight that arrives at the Earth is lower than the entropy of the waste heat that leaves the Earth, and the difference between these two figures is easily enough to account for the local decrease in entropy that is necessary for all of the life on our planet to have emerged and evolved.)Early on, Carroll remarks that he draws clear distinctions between almost-certainly-true facts, probably-true facts, and possibly-true conjectures. I suspect that in stating this so explicitly, he's wagging a finger at other popular-science writers (Stephen Hawking and Brian Greene perhaps?) who present their favorite conjectures (for instance, all of String theory) as firmly established truths. Personally, I enjoyed Carroll's style and sense of humour but of course there's no arguing questions of taste."
47,0525951334,http://goodreads.com/user/show/22446927-martti,4,"Sean Carroll's ""From Eternity to Here"" is an exploration to the arrow of time within the context of entropy, the disorder specified by thermodynamics. The book has both width and depth: the author gives detailed discussions of several approaches to the nature of time ranging from physics and thermodynamics to cosmological aspects.As a theoretical physicist Carroll has written the book from a rather theoretical perspective. His approach is successful, it actually makes the book enjoyable. He is not even afraid to include some mathematical notations and formulas in the text. The book begins with a pleasant surprise: the informative table of contents has a short and lucid summary of each chapter. Notes in the end of the book give further references and more detailed background information.The concept of entropy is crucial in order to understand Carroll's discussion concerning the arrow of time. Entropy means the disorder in an isolated system. The famous second law of thermodynamics states that the entropy has a tendency to increase, or at least stay constant, as time passes. The increase in entropy seems to account for the irreversibility of natural processes, and the asymmetry between past and future. To me Carroll presents the concept of entropy well and understandably. However, I found that I should have more background knowledge to understand better other important concepts used in the book, like the vacuum energy and the inflation. Sometimes I could notice unnecessary repetition and intricacy in the text. Also the author seems to notice that when he admits ""I'm making simple things sound complicated, but there's a method in the madness.""Throughout the book, Carroll makes several overall assumptions. One of the them is that the fundamental laws of physics are reversible: they are valid even if we exchange past and future. They work equally well running forward or backward in time. But then he also points out that quantum mechanics does not support reversibility. The behaviour of elementary particles in quantum mechanics is irreversible: once you do it, you can't undo it. This is a bit confusing and would deserve more analysis. Irreversible processes are at the heart of the arrow of time, and Carroll has a good point concerning their possible connection to entropy when he writes:""If entropy tends to go up, and if there is some process that happens all the time in the universe, but its time-reverse never happens, it probably represents an increase in entropy.""Carroll is clearly fond of the cosmological multiverse model with baby universes. This approach is based on the idea that the spacetime itself could quantum fluctuate: as the result a tiny bit of space could disconnect from the larger universe and evolve independently as a baby universe. The baby universe could then inflate and grow to the size of our observable universe or even larger. The model allows the entropy to increase without bound and at the same time it allows to create a continuous stream of patches of spacetime like our observable universe. Carroll admits that the details of the model are highly speculative and he emphasizes that we don't really understand quantum gravity and vacuum energy well enough to say for sure whether baby universes really do fluctuate into existence.In spite of current more or less speculative ideas and approaches Carroll firmly believes that the laws of physics will one day be sufficient to explain the arrow of time:""There is every reason to be optimistic that we will eventually settle on an understanding of how the arrow of time arises naturally and dynamically from the laws of physics themselves."""
48,0525951334,http://goodreads.com/user/show/62410658-gemma-moolman,4,"I initially picked this book up due to the fact that I liked the cover and title, yes, I judged a book by its cover. Never have I been so thrilled with such a decision based purely off of physical properties. Turning the book around and reading the blurb immediately set off a voice of pure excitement in my head. I had finally found a book on the nature of time. I'm sure this isn't the only one out there, but this is the first one that I had found, (it wasn't a subject that I was sure I was ready to read about and expand upon.) That being said, I did have to read the first few pages, making sure that I could actually understand what was being talked about as sadly, that's not always the outcome. From my rating you already know that I did indeed understand what was being written about, and it only added fuel to the fire that is my curiosity about time and our universe. The book attempts to make sense of time and what it really is, looking at what we call 'The Arrow of Time', and does so in a fairly simple and also quite humorous manner. Carroll goes on to talk about how you can pass time in line at a bank by asking other people what they think time really is if they were to put it into words. That's something I actually tried to do while eating lunch with some friends, and most of them couldn't give me an answer, one of them continued to dwell on the thought well into the next week, calling me at 2 am to tell me what he thought. Right off of the bat, I loved the way that this book was written. As an average high school student, science books intimidate me because I feel like the concepts being explained are too vast for me to expand upon in my own mind; However that was not the case with this book. Carroll writes and explains these basic physics concepts in such a way that even someone with the reading level of a 9th grader can understand most if not all of what he is trying to explain. There are a lot of comparisons to things we would encounter in our day to day lives, for example, how entropy (the second law of thermodynamics) can be seen as an omelette. We can scramble it all we want but we cannot put it back inside of the egg shell, we can only increase disorder and it is easier to do so than to maintain the same state. There are also illustrations to accompany some explanations, which is also very helpful because I know I'm not the only person out there who sometimes needs a visual representation to understand what is being said. Carroll brings up entropy a lot, this is because it is something that changes with time. It is easier for the universe to increase in disorder in order to progress. It is the transition from past to present to future, terms that we associate with the passing of time. It is also worth noting that entropy is almost relative from person to person. You have to observe certain events in order to see a pattern that you yourself perceive as entropy. In my mind this almost helped explain why time seems to 'fly by' some days more than it does others, I'm not sure if I'm entirely correct on that note, but it's something to think about.He then goes on to talk about three basic explanations of time.1. Time labels moments in the universe.2. Time measures the duration elapsed between events.3. Time is a medium through which we move.Throughout the book he expands on what these explanations are and why they appear to us as such, why the majority of the people he asked about time answered in such a way. I will admit that at first glance I didn't see how these explanations were different from one another, if anything I thought that it was just multiple ways of saying the same thing. I was both correct and incorrect about this. Carroll goes on to explain that while all three of these explanations are similar, they actually differ from one another in various ways. Carroll gets onto the topic of the multiverse, something that sounds like it came straight out of a sci-fi movie which is super exciting to me. It is the idea that there are multiple universes including our own, where everything we know (and don't) exists. He believes that this and entropy has an effect on the universe, making time irreversible. In conclusion I'd give this book a 4/5. I was pleasantly surprised by the fact that I actually understood it, seeing as I haven't even gotten to do physics at school yet. Carroll's personality really shines through some parts of the book, which makes me feel like an actual human has written this, it's as if I were having this explained to me by a friend rather than just reading an article on time and theories around it. It's worth noting that this is the first time I have read a science book in it's entirety and with time my opinions may change, as well as my understanding. Perhaps once I have more of a background in this area of expertise I can formulate a stronger opinion as to whether I agree of disagree with this theory. Until then, I now have more to wonder about in terms of time in the universe. My mind felt like a kid in a candy store, and it's hardly finished with it's first chocolate."
49,0525951334,http://goodreads.com/user/show/76436730-stephane,5,"Sean CarrollFrom Eternity to HereI have a meagre background in science with no academic credential to speak of. It hardly diminishes my enthusiasm for questions related to the workings of the universe, it does however, make them difficult for me to understand... ...but I keep hammering at them! And the nail, slowly, seems to get through, in the concrete of my brain. What I strive to present here is my interpretation of the book; it might very well be off track so it is to be taken with a grain of salt. Sean Carroll’s book is about time. It is described as a popular science book, and there is enough repetition and explanations (and extensive endnotes) to warrant that label. I understood some of it, but certainly not all, or even most. This is essentially what I expected. For Carroll (and many others) the arrow of time is linked to entropy. The book left me with at least a nascent understanding of what entropy is, and a coherent vision of what time could be. What we perceive as time is the passage from lower entropy to higher entropy states. Entropy never decreases, just as time can’t go backward. Ultimately, the amount of entropy in our universe should continue to increase, and eventually stabilize. Our universe would then be smooth, cold, dark and listless, becoming a De Sitter universe. Clearly, we can’t exist in such as high entropy state. (Boltzmann brain might exist. I can't help but feeling that this is a science fiction story screaming to be written...) The last part of the book ask uncomfortable questions. Why are we living in such a time of relatively low entropy? Why is the Big Bang, a state of even remarkably lower entropy, lurking right there, in our recent past? Those questions are highly problematic, and their answers might fly in the face of the mediocrity principle: we should expect to live in an era of much higher entropy, but we are not. Time (or entropy), for Carroll, did not begin with the Big Bang, but rather might be a feature of a larger ensemble; of which the entropy is bound to infinitively increase. Our universe would be nothing but a low entropy fluctuation, a mere bubble, in a vast ocean of eternal and ever increasing entropy. Those fluctuations are rare, but they do happen. Thus, we are not special. This is highly speculative and perhaps unpopular, and Carroll admits it. He knows it is untestable, at least currently. One certainly can’t accuse Carroll of presenting his ideas as certitudes or facts as he takes great pain in highlighting their speculative nature. I truly appreciated his reserve. At this point, it is fair to ask if we are doing science, philosophy, or speculative fiction. Carroll would certainly say it is science, but for the layman that I am, it merges all that. And there is, in my opinion, nothing wrong with that."
50,0525951334,http://goodreads.com/user/show/57803005-tomas-sedovic,4,"Having read this book after The Big Picture, it is clear this is the older of the two. Carroll had not yet refined his language and the book is much dryer and demanding. You will want to pause, think and stretch your imagination.It is absolutely worth it, though.The theme of From Eternity to Here is entropy and the arrow of time. Why in the face of laws of physics that work the same way from the past to the future and vice versa, we clearly see the universe has a preferred direction?Throughout the book, we encounter thermodynamics, statistical approaches to entropy (it doesn't *always* increase) and then dive straight into the general relativity and quantum mechanics as if we were not taught these are impossible to understand and contemplate.And that's what I most liked about this book: it's not afraid to dig into the hard topics. And when it does, it takes them seriously. Yes, there are analogies and simplifications so the reader has a chance of understanding what's going on. But it goes much closer to the meat of the matter. Most books I've read tend to outline these topics, present a few weird examples and be done with it. From Eternity to Here only stops where the next step would have to involve the actual math.This makes it a demanding book to read. You have to give it your full attention. Trying to juggle various light cones in my head was not the easiest past-time activity, but it was absolutely worth it.I have a much better understanding of cosmology and some of the nuances that get lost in the more accessible explanations. I finally get why is the conservation of information important and how black holes seem to cause trouble there and what the bloody hell does the term ""information"" mean in this context. I have a better understanding of how you can describe entropy more formally than ""the amount of disorderliness on the macroscopic level"" (when Sean dropped Kolmogorov complexity -- a term I know from computer science, my mind was utterly blown).This is a science book for people who feel they've outgrown the watered-down popular explanations, but they're not comfortable getting a physics Ph.D. to learn more."
51,0525951334,http://goodreads.com/user/show/18362346-valentina-salvatierra,4,"In this book, Carroll addresses the dilemma of the arrow of time - why we remember the past but not the future, why it's easy to scramble an egg but nearly impossible to unscramble one, and from there to why the universe started out with low entropy rather than high. In the process, he delves into well-established physical theories (thermodynamics, relativity) and also explores some wacky ones like the holographic principle and the multiverse.The good, exciting news: The multiverse is real, or at least a plausible scientific prediction! The bad news: it won’t lead to any fun Rick & Morty scenarios or allow us to watch interdimensional TV, because the sub-universes would be inexorably in-communicated by the same physical laws that make them plausible.This book, the first of its kind I read, was challenging to follow at times. It is definitely not light bedside reading but rather requires you to concentrate on the concepts and theories being discussed. This is certainly made easier, however, by its highly conversational tone. It remains readable despite the abstract, easily confusing topics because it uses very down-to-earth language wherever possible. It also features fun examples (lots of them involving cats), and useful illustrations. What about the content? The time-travel portal illustrations struck me as especially suggestive, and the Maxwell's demon explanation as very comprehensible. The idea of Boltzmann brains spontaneously fluctuating into existence in the cold void, meanwhile, although I'm not sure I understood its refutation entirely, struck me as an absolutely haunting and fascinating image. Carroll also uses a lot of references to literary and popular culture, including novels like Slaughterhouse-Five, Time's Arrow, and even Alice in Wonderland. These are often at the start of chapters, to illustrate popular conceptions of time, what time travel should like, etc - and are usually forgotten or refuted as mere fantasy by the end of those same chapters. I think his anecdotal use of pop culture points towards the one disadvantage I might identify in this book: it's ultimately very distant subject matter. Although Carroll tries to ground his grand discussions about entropy and time and the origin of the universe in daily life and human experience, it does end up feeling somewhat detached. So, for example, I'm not sure his explanation for the psychological arrow of time (why we remember the past and not the future, and experience ourselves moving forward in time) was given much depth, and in the whole chapters on quantum mechanics, despite using cats and dogs as examples, he's very clear on the fact that none of this actually has any relevance at the macroscopic level where we exist. More than a limitation in his approach, I suppose this is a shortcoming of what we expect science to do in practice. Because some social theorists use things like quantum mechanics to ""prove"" that uncertainty is inherent to complex social systems or reality is always subjective (or whatever it is Baudrillard argues), I was kind of expecting these topics to have a bigger impact on how the world can be perceived at the human level. Mostly, they don't - and that's not really the author's fault, I suppose, it's how theoretical physics tends to work when properly understood.One final thing to highlight, as a positive aspect that far outweighs the above, is that Carroll is always very honest about the limitations of what he is discussing. From the start, he makes clear the distinction between a) what is scientifically established as fact, b) what is still under exploration but has empirical evidence to support it, and c) what is altogether speculative and has yet to be empirically verified or even verifiable (e.g. the multiverse prediction). Ultimately, when reading a science book like this from a non-scientific background, you have to just trust that what the author is saying is legit. Because of this, I was really grateful for Carroll's intellectual honesty and transparency, which enabled me to trust that this wasn't all made-up as he explained things that I know I'm unable to understand in deep terms, i.e. the mathematical proofs involved.

This result suggests that maybe spacetime is not as foundational as experience suggests. And moreover, it shows why locality need not be true. (Locality is the intuition that if thing A happens, its influence on faraway B can only propagate at the speed of light or slower.) When I first read about quantum entanglement, the thing that blew my mind is that locality is out of window. This knowledge of the equivalence between two spaces of different dimension seems to suggest that *of course* locality is not necessarily true. If I have one bone to pick then it is that there are multiple places where Carroll could have gone a little more in depth and spend the pages to explain, even if it’s using 7pt font in the endnotes. For instance, it would be nice to explain why our current observable university is about 45B lightyear across and how a bubble of true vacuum occurs out of false vacua. "
54,0525951334,http://goodreads.com/user/show/18293816-bill-leach,4,"An excellent book wherein Carroll explores the concept of time as a physical entity. In examining the idea, the author looks into thermodynamics and entropy, the special theory of relativity, quantum mechanics and finally cosmology where he considers black holes, dark matter, inflation and the concept of the multiverse.The book is a very readable grand tour of modern science. Little math is used beyond exponentials and logarithms. The author makes clear whether any given idea is widely held, or speculative.Carroll sums up saying that relativity, quantum mechanics and statistical mechanics are well understood, providing confidence of our understanding of the basic evolution of the universe. However our current ideas about quantum gravity, the multiverse and what happened at the Big Bang are still very speculative.In the epilogue, Carroll has an excellent section on the meaning of science and it's goal of searching for understanding rather than theorizing to cover off all of the known data. Thus theories can reach beyond a specific problem, providing more general explanations - he uses the concept of inflation as an example. Carroll suggests the multiverse concept may be difficult to test, and is better thought of as a prediction."
55,0525951334,http://goodreads.com/user/show/65913-tim,5,"There is a glut of popular science books on the market that will march you through the basics of quantum mechanics and relativity -- the twin pillars of 20th century physics. (...which is even the subject of a funny joke footnote here). Carroll is one of the clearest and best science writers out there (and an excellent teacher), and makes for an excellent tour guide through some of the less well-traveled precincts of modern physics. Namely, thermodynamics, statistical mechanics, and the central concept of entropy.The study of entropy naturally leads directly into some of the thorniest open questions in physics and philosophy: the nature of time, the structure of space-time, the life-cycle of black holes, the interpretation of quantum mechanics, even free will. The basic question Carroll seeks an answer for here is this: if entropy of a closed system almost always increases, that means that in the distant past entropy must have been much lower. So why is that? The question opens up several fascinating discussions, many of which are active areas of current research. There's a risk of this all turning quite philosophical and confusing, but Carroll is an exceptionally lucid writer, so fear not. (Although I could do with a more thorough discussion of free will...)"
56,0525951334,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5338819-ed-bernard,4,"More like 4.5 stars.A genuinely mind-blowing book about time — what it is (spoiler: it’s movement from a state of low entropy to a state of high entropy), why it works the way it does, why it only moves in one direction (you can’t unscramble an egg) while the other elements of space/time go in all directions and a bunch more stuff. Carroll is a theoretical physicist at Call Tech, which means he questions everything — starting with the Big Bang and moving onward, through worm holes, white holes, cosmic inflation and more. I can’t claim to have understood every idea, much less remember them all, but the book was never ungraspable and was well explained for the non-physicist. At one point, Carroll quotes another physicist about a proper definition for time. “Time,” the guy says, “is nature’s way of keeping everything from happening at once.” Sounds good to me. A good book to read slowly, and, BTW, not a great read-aloud — it’s well executed but I could’ve used a little time to digest a big idea and/or go back and have another look, which is tough to do with an audio book.Grade: A-"
57,0525951334,http://goodreads.com/user/show/27367650-brian-cloutier,5,"I feel a little bad for the author. He sets out to explain Time, or at least present the most plausible answers. There are around 50 pages of explanations and discussion, but it takes him 330 pages to first give you the necessary background! It takes a while to get us laity up to speed.Those 330 pages are wonderful though, they constitute a guided tour of much of the physics I wasn't taught in in high school. Entropy (a lot about entropy!), closed timelike curves, quantum field theory, cosmology, even a little string theory, it's all lucidly explained. I sometimes wished he had gone a little deeper and I sometimes didn't quite follow his arguments; in each case there were a few footnotes referencing sources with as much detail as I could handle (and much more).This book doesn't lead to any destination. It never actually answers the question of why we have Time. Nobody knows the answer! It does lead the reader on quite a fun journey, and that's really the most a reader can ask for anyway."
58,0525951334,http://goodreads.com/user/show/77306690-iqbal-rahmadhan,3,"Finally! Most of this book give us some challenging question. But to answer this question need some special time to really think about it. A part of this book can be enjoyed with a cake or coffee in the other hand, and the other part needs a good physics (such as: special and general relativity, thermodynamics, etc) and some of philosophical things to be 'enjoyed'. I think the conclusion about the arrow of time is not yet answer except because of entropy. You'll read so many times about entropy in this book. If you're a student of physics of engineering, you must give more respect to thermodynamics or statistical physics course. The course will help you to understand this book and vise versa, the book will help you (more) to get interest to the course. Thank you, Sean!""What is time? If no one asks me, I know.

59,0525951334,http://goodreads.com/user/show/35-michael-siliski,5,"Excellent review of physics and cosmology for the layman. Carroll is great at explaining mind-bending concepts and making them approachable without dumbing them down.* Focuses on the hardest concept (for me at least): what time is and how it fits in with everything else.* Treats time not as something that exists on its own, but as a result of entropy and the 2nd law of thermodynamics.* Goes directly at the challenge of understanding what the Big Bang is and what (if anything) came before, asking questions that feel intuitive but often feel summarily dismissed in unsatisfying ways.The 2nd half of the book drags a bit as it works through the details of various theories, especially compared to the first half where it feels we make great progress so rapidly. But I think this is useful at the end of the day to understand the state of physics today"
60,0525951334,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6110400-rrisher,4,"Well, I finished it, but I wish I could say that I retained as much as I read. I owe it to myself to go back through some chapters that I only got through on a superficial level, not that I could ever understand any of these concepts on a mathematical level. I'll always have a superficial relationship with cosmology and quantum physics, but I'm always game for a difficult to reach concept and Carroll does his precise best to edify those similar to myself who bite off more physics than they will ever be able to chew. This is the second book by Carroll that I've read and he is by far the most approachable voice on these matters that I've encountered, and he is excellent at returning to the point of each question that he addresses even when there is no answer, or no satisfactory answer at least."
61,0525951334,http://goodreads.com/user/show/644865-kim,2,"A failure in terms of writing. In terms of science, I think Carroll is so enamored of and fixated on the second law of thermodynamics that his reaction to any cosmological theory that doesn’t slot that law into its core and use it to explain everything else is to shut his eyes, cover his ears, and yell “Lalalalalalala!” at the top of his lungs.At the beginning of the book, he mentions an unnamed professor of physics who dismissed Carroll’s theory as ridiculous. By the end of the book, I felt increasing sympathy and respect for that unnamed professor.If you are a layman and want to learn more about cosmology and astrophysics, read Neil Degrasse Tyson. I hear good things about Brian Greene’s writing style as well, but as he is a string theorist, I personally wouldn’t recommend him. String Theory is non-falsifiable, which in my judgement puts it on the same level as religion. YMMV."
62,0525951334,http://goodreads.com/user/show/8890799-kim,3,"I am obsessed with understanding the nature of Time, so this was right up my alley. But it was a hard read and took me months to finish the book. It was definitely a hard slog for me. It was hard science, or at least as hard as theoretical cosmology can be. And it covered many aspects of the field. It felt like a comprehensive review of all aspects of contemporary (and historical) cosmology. Consequently, I am afraid that I will retain very little of it. I think I might head more towards understanding the psychology and philosophy of Time. I would benefit from reading this book again, but it was so challenging that I doubt I ever will. But I certainly don't regret the time spent reading it. However, as soon as I finished, I immediately read the first of the sci-fi Murderbot books which took me two days start to finish and was as enjoyabl as eating a chocolate bar."

Carrol argues that our current state of complexity, a very low entropy state is one of the most important problems in cosmology and its proper solution will give us great insight into the universal beginnings and evolution. Clear descriptions of mathematical concepts like logarithms and fractals make the listening experience very pleasurable and lead to greater insights for the educated layman."
65,0525951334,http://goodreads.com/user/show/8742827-jack,5,"Another excellent book by Sean Carroll. This book is a great complement to Sean’s Great Courses course on the physics of time. As you would expect, it seems to be as much about philosophy as it is about physics . We are in a situation where we have a lot of theories that are arguable, but so far unprovable. I’m guessing that there is some solid mathematics behind the theories, or perhaps some mathematical artifices that make the theories seem plausible. It’s clear that there are some folks out there who do physics for a living and are operating at a level that amateurs like me can’t get to. Nonetheless, it’s fun to hear about them and to speculate on their implications."

Didn't really find much in the way of controversy in the book, although it was acknowledged that there are many differences of opinion in the community and numerous counter proposed theories. I don't think this is very controversial, just a feature of the process of science.I was able to follow, roughly (I am no scientist), up to chapter 12. From then on I understood only about 25%.
