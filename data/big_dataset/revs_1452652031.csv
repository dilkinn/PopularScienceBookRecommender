0,1452652031,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1419068-elaine,2," Since I'm writing a book about dogs, I reread this in the light of reams of scholarly articles and books, not to mention documentaries featuring the leading dog researchers in the world today--as well as my own thinking about all matters dog. I am amazed that I originally rated this as highly as I did. Yes,i t is repetitious as I noted before, but now I see also how fallacious it is. Bradshaw seems to have forgotten Occam's Razor: the simplest explanation that accounts for all the data is the one to accept. In other instances, he seems to have forgotten the implications of his own previous statements.For instance, he mentions Rico, the Border Collie who has demonstrated that he knew 50 words, each the name of a toy. The 250 toys are kept in a separate room, and Rico is =told to go get Blinkie or whatever name has been given to each toy. With no problem, Rico goes to the pile of toys in another room and picks out the one asked for. Then, one day, Rico was asked to get a toy with a name he had never heard before. Still he ran to the toy room and searched for a new toy. He figured that must be the one with the unfamiliar toy. He was right.Bradshaw decided to ""refute"" this well-known and well-received study. He says that Rico just took the toy that had a ""different scent."" Differen tfromthe scents of 250 other toys? There is no evidence that Rico selected other toys on any basis except for their names. He never was told to go find the toy with Binke's scent. In fact, such a command could not be given. The dog wouldn't be able to understand it. I don't doubt that, given dogs' incredible noses, that each toy might have a different scent. However, he was always told to fetch one by its name. No matter how you look at it, Rico discriminated among the toys by human verbally given names. Now, in fact, there is a Border Collie who can choose among 1,000 toys, each with a different name. Bradshaw would have us believe that Rico knows the names for 250 toys, but, when a new name is given to him, he resorts to his sense of smell. Bradshaw offers no explanation for how or even if the toys each had a particular scent. Even if they did, which is unproven and probably unproveable, he responded in each instance, solely to the names of the toys. The simples explanation that fits the data is that Rico figured if there was a toy he had not seen before, it must be the one that had the name he hadn't learned before. Bradshaw's interpretation is over complex, based upon an unproven assumption. That is, it is bad science. And, Bradshaw is a scientist.Another example of bad science is that Bradshaw claims that aggression is not inborn in certain dog breeds. They become aggressive because of their owners' training. However, previously he noted correctly that the complex behaviors of herding dogs are not a result of training, but of their genetic inheritance, which is a generally accepted view. Nobody could teach a herding dog to do what it does when it herds. Now, if a complex set of behaviors is inborn in certain dogs, on what basis can one then say that aggression is not inborn? Bradshaw gives no rationale. I had a very aggressive mongrel years ago. Nobody taught him to be aggressive. He just was. That was evident by the time he was three months old. He actually chased my neighbor back into his house, growling and with bared fangs. Unfortunately, he was so dangerous, he had to be put down. We got him from a litter of pups from a bitch who had mated with feral canids, possibly a coyote. I gave Bradshaw a one star demerit because of his constant repetitions of every point he makes, 2, 3, or more times, and his preachy tone. I love dogs and am very concerned for their welfare, but I found his preaching tiresome.On the other hand, I laud Bradshaw's rebuttal of the ""dog whisperer"" nonsense: all that stuff about alphas and the human family as a wolf pack.  My rebuttal to Bradshaw's other claims will appear in my book Humans, Dogs , & Civilization, but first they will appear in my blog http://elainechaika.com/dogs"
1,1452652031,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3948872-laura,4,"This is in the class of books that I really enjoyed and don’t have the background to critically evaluate. It is also loosely in the category of books exploring the thesis of “yeah, that thing you were taught? That’s wrong.” Unlike many of those books (I’m lookin’ at you, Malcolm Gladwell), it also has a positive thesis. And it’s very positive. “Train dogs with positive feedback. Not just because it’s humane. Because it works, bitches.” Okay, he didn’t put it quite that way. He is English. Dr. Bradshaw is a professor at the University of Bristol Veterinary School. He’s a specialist in anthrozoology, and has consulted with the US military on how to train dogs. He had the good fortune to have his book published just as lots of people were going – wait, we sent a dog in with Seal Team 6? Possibly with titanium teeth? Wwwhhhaaa? He was hilarious on the Colbert Report, http://www.colbertnation.com/the-colb..., and fascinating on Fresh Air. http://www.npr.org/2011/05/26/1364970.... First, he suggests that the popular understanding of wolves at the time many dog training schools got systematized and written down was wrong, and wrong for a very good reason. It was based on observations of man made wolf packs, were unrelated adult wolves were put together and had to work it out. In the wild, he says, wolf packs are mostly family groups, made of a breeding pair and 2 or 3 litters, with the older children helping to raise their younger siblings before sexually maturing and moving on. They get along because they like each other, not because someone establishes dominance. When that sort of posturing starts, it’s time to move on. He also points out something that I feel silly for not realizing – selection went both ways. Dogs are the descendants of wolves that could tolerate people. Wolves are the descendants of those who could not. Comparing them is a little like comparing chimps and bonobos, who are nearly alike genetically, but one settles disputes by fighting and dominance displays; the other with sex. Kinda different. Next, dominance, he says, does not drive dogs the way we are trained to believe it does. He suggests a better model is the “resource holding potential” (RPH) (85). “According to this model, whenever a conflict of interests arise, each dog is thought to make its decision based on the answers to two questions: How much do I want this resource (food, toy, etc.) and, How likely is it that the other dog is going to beat me if we fight for it?” Despite that, he says dogs aren’t rational the way we like to impute to them. They don’t build a model of the world and work out the causal connections. Instead, he says, their intelligence is much more associative. He doesn’t say magical thinking, but that’s what it reminds me of. That dogs remember connections between things and do what works. It’s not that they “know” they’ve done wrong when we find the poop on the carpet; it’s that they know from our body language we’re angry with them; they feel bad and/or are afraid of punishment and are expressing that fear – plus, perhaps, some behavior that seems to have deflected punishment – as a result. He talked about a great experiment where they put a dog in a room, had the dog’s person tell the dog not to eat the treat, then leave. (219). Then in half the rooms, another person gave the dog the treat, in half the person took the treat away. Rotate 90% (so to speak) and half the people were told, incorrectly, their dog had eaten the treat; half were told a person and taken it. All the humans were asked to go back in and do what they would do if their dog had done such a thing. There was no correlation between whether the dog had eaten the treat and how “guilty” the dog acted. And the three dogs that had been physically disciplined by their owners acted the most guilty. I heard an interview on NPR with a guy who took in a wolf puppy, and he had an observation that really stuck with me. He said that dogs are superstitious. They don’t understand the world on a causal level; they just know that there’s these associations. But wolves aren’t superstitious. They don’t believe that humans are miracle workers. I don’t know enough to judge that, I wouldn’t mind if that was true. He says there’s no reason we couldn’t breed dogs to be better pets; we just aren’t doing that. These days, most people who want dogs as pets neuter them; breeding is largely unplanned or designed for the show ring. That’s sad. Especially since the genetic diversity in many dog breeds is appallingly thin (like, every dog is essentially a first cousin or closer), and many of those dogs have preventable genetic ailments. Bottom line: dogs are dogs. They aren’t wolves; they’re not people. But they’re awesome. "
2,1452652031,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3726509-lis-carey,4,"It was the best of books, it was--not the worst of books, not by a long shot, but incredibly annoying in places.This is a serious effort at collecting in one place the current state of the science of dog behavior. Bradshaw discusses the evidence we have for how and when dogs evolved from wolves, as well as what dogs' close relationship to wolves does and doesn't mean for their behavior and needs in human households. For the last century or so, much training and dog management advice has been based on the idea that wolf packs are competitive, internally violent groups, dominated by the fiercest, most powerful male, or possibly the fiercest, most powerful male and female--the ""alphas."" Since, the reasoning goes, ""dogs are wolves,"" dog owners need to establish themselves as ""alpha"" and dominate their dogs, lest the dogs seize control of the household and become problems and even threats.Bradshaw explains in clear and understandable terms why every piece of this argument is wrong.The studies that showed wolf packs as violent groupings dominated by the strongest were done with artificial, captive wolf packs--wolves who were not related to each other and had no way to leave the group if they weren't happy with. They had no choice but to work out Who's In Charge Here, by any means necessary. Natural wolf packs in the wild have since been studied extensively, and they are, in contrast, peaceful, mostly harmonious family groups. The ""alpha pair"" are in fact the parents of the younger wolves. Depending on local conditions, offspring from past litters may stick around for a year or three, helping to raise their younger siblings before eventually heading off to find mates and start their own packs. Where plentiful large game is available, a stable, long-lasting pack may include not only several years' worth of offspring, but siblings of one or both of the mated pair--aunts and uncles helping to hunt large game and feed and care for the pups.So wolves aren't what we think they are. But then, neither are dogs what we're sometimes told to think they are--and we know this, from our own observations of our own dogs. Most dogs who have had reasonably normal puppy experiences are extremely friendly and social, both with humans and with other dogs. Wolves, as harmonious and cooperative as they are within their own family groups, do not share dogs' interest in being friendly and social with either humans, or other wolves. Contact with wolves outside the family pack doesn't always descend into violence, but it's always an occasion of conflict, with the resident group warning off the intruders. If our domestic pet dogs shared the behavioral traits of wolves to the extent that ""dominance-based"" training tells us they do, there would be no dog parks. We wouldn't have the idea of dog parks; it would engender not visions of happy dogs playing, but of conflict between dogs or groups of dogs of different households. Just the fact that dogs form close social bonds with humans is a clue they're not like wolves behaviorally; wolves are incredibly wary of humans, and even where an individual human has formed a relationship with an individual wolf, wolves don't have dogs' inclination to trust our judgment, regard us as sources of information, or respond to human body language.Bradshaw goes further, and points out that today's wolves are the descendants of several hundred years of relentless human hunting and territorial encroachment; they've been effectively selected for distrust and wariness of humans in a way that wouldn't have been true of the original wolf protodogs who first started following humans to exploit our leftovers, and then gradually joined our human families and their skills for our skills to the greater prosperity of both species.The wolves our dogs evolved from don't exist anymore.The book further discusses how easy it is to get dogs to focus on humans. A dog who has no contact with humans as a puppy will normally be quite wary of people and is unlikely to be successful as a pet, but even minimal positive contact with humans at any point between the ages of three and eight weeks of age will set the puppy up to be ready to bond with humans and learn to be a good pet. How much contact, and at exactly what age, will affect how easy and smooth it is, but any positive contact with humans during that period will give the dog at least the minimal tools it needs to live with humans.So, that's the good stuff. There's a lot of it, I've barely scratched the surface, and you really do want to read the book and get all of it, with Bradshaw's much fuller explanation, references to more sources, etc.But.You knew there was a ""but"" coming, right?Bradshaw says dogs are becoming less common as pets in the cities, being pushed out to suburban and rural areas. Maybe in the UK, I don't know, but not here in the US, where instead there is a shift to smaller dogs and/or lower-energy dogs, more likely to be happy and successful in cities--while the larger and/or higher-energy dogs remain extremely popular with people who have either more room, or a lifestyle that enables them to give those dogs the exercise and stimulation they need, regardless of geographic location. He says cats have become more than dogs as pets in the US--this is completely wrong. There are more cats than dogs kept as pets in the US--but more households have dogs than cats. The discrepancy in numbers is due to most cat owners having at least two cats, and often more, while dog owners are far more likely to have only one at a time--and this is often true even in households that have both. There's no evidence that dogs are falling in popularity as pets--not with the huge increase in numbers of dogs, numbers of households with dogs, and percentage of households with dogs over the last thirty years.He also has a great deal to say about purebred, or, as he terms it, ""pedigree"" dog breeding, and he says it over and over. He talks about excessive inbreeding, kennel club regulations that prevent out-crossing to deal with mistakes that have made genetic diseases common in some breeds, the loss of genetic diversity within each breed, and emphasis on extremes of type due to show standards, leading to what are in effect major deformities in some breeds that make them less than viable.These are all real concerns, some of them more so in some breeds than others, and yet he makes a complete hash of his discussion of it. Bradshaw places all the responsibility for the current problems on show breeders (who are not without fault), and completely misses the degree to which all of these problems are worse in puppy mills (puppy farms, commercial puppy factories, pick your terminology.) Many (not all) show breeders study pedigrees and do genetic testing where tests are available, to minimize the chance of producing puppies affected by the known genetic problems of their breed. Puppy mills don't; as long as a female can whelp litters of commercially viable size, they'll breed her. Many (not all) show breeders think seriously about the Coefficient of Inbreeding (COI) and out-cross to different lines to the extent practical within their breeds. Puppy mills don't; they'll happily breed a bitch to her full brother if it happens to be convenient, and it often is. Many (not all) show breeders follow up on the pups they place in pet households as well as show and performance households, and include the long-term health of those puppies in their considerations of future breeding decisions. Puppy mills don't.Cavalier King Charles Spaniels, a breed he specifically mentions as being descended from just six individuals and having serious genetic problems as a result (I think he's wrong; I believe it's four individuals), are a breed in deep trouble, no question. These sweet, loving, perfect pets are at severe risk of developing heart disease, syringomyelia, or both, even when they come from the best breeders. I honestly believe that this is a breed that's doomed unless planned, controlled out-crossing is introduced to fix their compromised genetic heritage.But 100% of the breeders who care about this, and who are doing their best within the available rules and tools to save this wonderful breed, are the dread ""show breeders."" Backyard breeders, even the best, even the ones that love their dogs and really are breeding wonderful pets--an undertaking that gets too little respect in a world in which most dog owners desire dogs as pets and not as working companions--don't have the knowledge to do this. And the puppy millers, as well as most of the backyard breeders, simply don't care and aren't going to cut into their own profits by worrying about it.Bradshaw doesn't state clearly enough what I believe the real problem is: between the late 1860s when much of dog breeding in the West became divorced from working considerations with the corresponding excellent empirical grasp of genetics, and the 1960s with the beginnings of a real scientific understanding of genetics, the combination of dogs shows judging by a written conformation standard and the insidious effects of ""eugenics"" leading to a belief that being ""purebred"" was a good thing in itself, caused many (not all, by any means) breeds to go seriously astray genetically. And once the problems are established, they are hard to undo--especially with the strong commitment to purebred breeding, now largely divorced from the pernicious philosophy that originally produced it, blocking planned out-crosses to other breeds or mixes to eliminate or dilute the genetic problem while preserving the essential character of the breed. And while Bradshaw rails against ""pedigree breeding,"" at no point does he mention the most convincing proof that we don't have to lose our breeds in order to fix them, if we allow planned out-crosses: The Pointer/Dalmatian Backcross Project, which has produced dogs that look and act no different than AKC/KC registered Dalmatians--except that they lack the Dalmatians' extremely painful problem with improper metabolism of uric acid.It's a complete mystery to me why someone who cares so much about the long-term health and welfare of dogs would waste time talking about Jemima Harrison's sensationalist ""documentary,"" Pedigree Dogs Exposed, and not talk about the Pointer/Dal backcross project, which proves we can solve the problems without losing the breeds we love.On balance, this really is a very good book, and I do recommend it. Read it, argue with it, come back here and tell me what you think about it!No free galley on this one; I bought the ebook."
3,1452652031,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4490040-carly,4,"I picked this up on audio in my continuing quest to try to understand dogs a little better.In some ways, I think it makes for a nice companion read to Inside of a Dog. Bradshaw's focus is very different than Horowitz, who focuses mainly on doggy perception and the way the doggy umwelt differs from our own. Bradshaw is rather (too) dismissive of this angle of study and instead seems more interested in the genetic components. Bradshaw spends quite a lot of the book expressing concerns about purebred dogs. Overbreeding tends to introduce various health issues, and since modern breeders tend to go for looks over temperament or abilities, dogs aren’t necessarily being bred for the “right” characteristics. As I spend all my time around mutts, it’s not an issue I really considered, but it is an interesting angle. After I read the book, I started looking into the controversy surrounding the AKC and the potential damage it does to the breeds it recognizes.Unlike Horowitz, Bradshaw goes into far more detail about the evolution of dogs. Bradshaw hypothesizes that the genetic changes that produced dogs effectively trapped dogs in various neonatal stages. He also proposes a theory that dog owners probably subscribe to almost universally: your dog is a baby (wolf) that never grew up.At the same time, Bradshaw is very emphatic about the distinction between dogs and wolves. He points out that the wolves of today are not the wolves of pre-dog times; just like dogs, they have continued to evolve. The wolves of today are the wolves that decided not to join the humans at the campfire and spent the rest of the millenia avoiding them. He also compares the behaviour of wolves to wild dogs. In the wild, wolves roam in highly cooperative packs primarily composed of family members. The position of alpha usually goes to the matriarch and patriarch, and it isn’t contended. The strict hierarchies we associate with wolf packs aren’t found in the wild; they are formed only when unrelated wolves are forced into artificial packs in captivity. Wild dogs don’t show either pattern; they don’t cooperate to the extent of wolves, but they don’t exhibit the rigid inability to accept non-familial pack members, either.Bradshaw’s desire to emphasize the difference between dogs and wolves is well-founded. For decades, dog trainers have used the dog-as-wolf analogy to back up their recommendation of brutal training methods. According to popular TV trainers like Cesar Milan, your dog is a wolf who is always vying to become the alpha, so you must continually--and usually forcefully-- assert your own dominance. Bradshaw repudiates this reasoning: not only are dogs distinct from wolves, but that’s not actually how wolves behave. This is especially true with techniques such as the “alpha roll,” where the person forcibly rolls the dog and holds it in a submissive position. The “alpha roll” has been observed in wolves on occasion--it’s performed in extremely serious fights and is often followed by a death bite. If we accept that dogs are wolves, then putting your dog in that position is telling him that you’re considering killing him. It’s only natural for the dog to fight back. Bradshaw also discusses evidence that indicates that negative reinforcement, especially physical punishment, is ineffective.Overall, while I don’t necessarily agree with all of Bradshaw’s interpretations, the book presents a lot of interesting research and hypotheses about what makes a dog a dog."
4,1452652031,http://goodreads.com/user/show/92397-brittany,4,"This was another one of those books that ought to be required reading for any dog owner, or for anyone who's just around dogs a lot. However, it's the best of the bunch. Bradshaw, a published and respected scientist who has spent years studying canine cognition walks through the common misconceptions about dog mentality, personality, and behavior. He identifies where they came from, why, and why they're wrong. He doesn't just assert they're wrong and leave it at that, though. He walks through the science step-by-step in a way that makes it extremely understandable even to people who don't usually read science books for fun. He brings up some fascinating, and relevant, points I had never thought of before. Such as that, while dogs descended from wolves, they didn't descend from modern wolves. Ancient wolves were probably socially very different from our modern wolves who have been hunted. Modern wolves are probably ones that have self-selected themselves to be elusive to humans. Dogs have been selected to be compatible with humans. This alone is a huge difference that requires us to rethink everything we thought we knew about dog behavior, and what we can learn about it from wolf behavior.The only downfall of this book is that occasionally Bradshaw gets a little sloppy with his terminology so that, at points, he seems to contradict himself with regard to whether it is or is not useful to look at wolf behavior to learn about dogs. However, this fault is so slight that it seems small-minded to bring it up.Overall, this is a readable and stunning work that everyone should have to read before getting a dog. It explains why certain training methods work, work in spite of themselves, or are counter-productive. He addresses how dogs sense the world, and what that means for their humans, and he adds a lot of fascinating detail and data that I never knew about dogs. For instance, I know that I love the smell of Lily's ears. And it turns out that scientifically, dogs produce a lot of their smell through their ears (which is why it's generally the second place strange dogs sniff). I cannot reccomend this book highly enough."
5,1452652031,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2860188-eduardo-santiago,4,"The whole “alpha dog” thing is a mistake: dogs aren't wolves, and we should really just forget that whole pack/dominance thing. (Side note: even wolves aren't wolves. The pack model is based on observations in old-time zoos; not necessarily the most natural and stress-free environment). Reward training works better than punishment. And pedigree breeding is harmful. That's pretty much it. Bradshaw covers the latest knowledge about dog evolution and behavior, entertainingly and with helpful endnotes ... but then sort of continues on and on because books can't just be 150 pages, y'know. (Come on, publishers. Yes they can. The world is changing.) 5-star book if it were half the length. It would've been more memorable, had more of an impact. Instead, the second half felt like it dragged.Content: useful, and important. I still recommend this and will pass it along to friends. "
6,1452652031,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5778153-craig,4,"John Bradshaw is determined to improve dog's lives. This well written, if repetitive, book disproves some common myths about dogs and explains how modern breeding and training are hurting the pets we love. Dog Sense isn’t meant to be a training manual: other authors would better serve someone looking to train their new puppy. Read this if you’re looking for a history of how dogs became what they are and what we can do to help them thrive.In the first three chapters Dr. Bradshaw explains where dogs come from and how they were domesticated. He discusses some of the myths that persist about wolves, such as packs being hierarchical with a strong alpha being the dominant leader, and explains how modern science has moved past these views. I found these to be the most repetitive chapters in the book. The author was clearly basing the rest of the book on the idea that wolf societies aren’t based on dominance and dogs and wolves are different so he felt it important to repeat this idea several dozen times. Fortunately he used different evidence each retelling taking away some of the tedium. If you consider this a controversial idea it might be appreciated, if you agreed with this premise coming into the book it is a bit tedious. The next 7 chapters make up the bulk of the book and get into some more interesting topics. Bradshaw discusses the ability of dogs to understand human actions and thoughts and why this means we shouldn’t use dominance training. The chapters on which emotions dogs can feel were particularly interesting. He explains tests created to determine if dogs can feel emotions like love, guilt or jealousy and how long they can remember past events. Understanding dogs’ emotional capabilities is important since punishing a dog who doesn’t remember doing anything wrong would be counterproductive. Bradshaw ends the book with two chapters discussing the current problems dogs face and what it means for their future. The chapter on pedigree dogs discussed how inbreeding reduces the genetic diversity and causes more disease is fascinated but disturbing. I was amazed that in only 150 or so years of dog fancying humans have been able to cause this many problems by breeding to standards. He closes the book on a cautiously optimistic note pointing out how we haven’t caused irrevocable harm to dogs (mainly due to dogs adaptability) and if we want to have them be around for another 15000 years we’ll need to change how we interact. Modern dog owners have less use for many jobs dogs were bred for such as herding, hunting and ratting. Instead we should focus less on standards and appearance and ensure pets have the temperament and physical abilities to be good pets."
7,1452652031,http://goodreads.com/user/show/716666-alida,4,"This is mandatory reading for everyone that deals with dogs. Owners, prospective owners, staff of rescue organizations, fostering families and government officials in charge of making and enforcing policy (city council members, animal control staff, supervisors, etc.) regarding dogs. But the people that I would force to read/listen this book are the idiots of the AKC (and others of that ilk), the commercial breeders and pet store owners that are either clueless or don't give a f!&k as long as their ego/money objectives are met. The sooner the latter are put out of business and the former properly educated, the better it will be for dogs (at least in the Western world). "
8,1452652031,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7238221-martha-burns,5,"For those interested in biology as well as reflections on human-canine interactions. Takeaway: dogs are not mini wolves, whatever their genes say. Their adaptability and lack of hierarchical structure is what made them our perfect companions and treating them as little wolves misconstrues their nature, but does reflect our tendency to project what we want onto animals. Fascinating, thoughtful, and enjoyable to read, though our tendency to resort to cruel or pointless training techniques makes one squirm by making very clear s strand of sadism in our relationship to not just dogs, but those unlike us."
9,1452652031,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6985392-ryan,4,"Fascinating read. I'm a first time dog owner and read this book during the first days of ownership. I'm so glad I did for I'm sure I would have been guilty of some common mistakes owners make in rearing their dogs. The author makes clear from the beginning that this is not a training book, but more of a book about understanding the nature, origin and science of your pet. Equipped with that insight, we can then make informed decisions concerning training and the like. I highly recommend. "
10,1452652031,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2174508-monica-willyard-moen,4,"This book is written by a biologist who has spent most of his career studying how dogs and cats learn, thrive, and interact with humans. His love of dogs shines through in every page of this book as he tells us what science has been learning over the past 30 years about every aspect of the lives of dogs. In the past, many trainers told us that we should view dogs as descendants of wolves and that we should use the analogy of how wolves operate in a pack to understand what dogs want, do, and need. However, scientists have recently discovered that wolves in captivity behave very differently from wolves living in the wild, and they have also discovered that dogs have changed enough genetically and behaviorally that treating dogs as wolves is counterproductive. Instead, scientists and an increasing number of trainers have come to believe that dogs should be studied in their own right and treated accordingly. This book can be very helpful to those of us who own dogs, especially those of us who are training puppies in their first year of life. From changing some of my training practices, I am already noticing improved cooperation from our seven month old boxer mix puppy. We are building a bond based on trust, care, and positive rewards for good behavior rather than using harsh physical punishment. I am noticing a significant drop off in behaviors like unwanted barking, inappropriate chewing, and mouthing. I’m glad I read this book, and I plan to keep it on my shelf for reference as my dog goes through later stages in his life."
11,1452652031,http://goodreads.com/user/show/12213552-nancy,5,"I read this book years ago when it first came out. We had just adopted our first dog in many years, so although I found the material fascinating, it was very new to me. Since 2012, we have fostered 13 Belgian Malinois puppies for the military and adopted 4 of that breed. Therefore, when I listened to this excellent book a second time it hit home on a far more personal level. I have worked with these dogs in obedience and detection so the research on those specific areas made more sense to me than it had in the abstraction.There has been a significant amount of research done on dogs since this book was written. For example, scientists are now able to study canine emotions by actually watching their brains with fMRI, and a lot of work has been done to improve training techniques. Yet I still found this book informative, and I recommend it to those with a strong interest in dogs. It will improve your appreciation of them as well as your understanding of their unique skills and abilities, and their limitations. Dogs are not furry little humans, and the author carefully explains why this is the case. Dogs are like us in many ways, but it is the important differences that make our relationship with them so special."

I enjoyed parts of the book, and found his ideas about the need to stop breeding to aesthetic standards due to concerns for the health and well being of the entire species extremely thought provoking, and frankly, a refreshing perspective as a dog person-- usually breed standards are hailed as good things/gold standards, and thus is the first truly expert opinion I've read that says that is flat out biologically untrue and in fact unhealthy. Unfortunately, several chapters drone on too long, and due to the consistently textbook like writing style, I was a little bored with the book overall and think it could reach more people with more conversational writing tone. 2.5 stars, rounded up. Recommended only for strict dog enthusiasts. "

Nonetheless, this is a fascinating book that uses a different theory of ""dog think"" and offers logical ways of working with a dog from this different premise.I made the mistake of listening to the audiobook alone, rather than playing it so the dog could hear it, too. If you have a dog, either read the book aloud to him/her or let him/her listen to the audiobook."
14,1452652031,http://goodreads.com/user/show/821868-kirsten,4,"This is an engaging book that explains what we know about how dogs evolved, how their social structures function, how they interact with the world, and how this might be applied to the way we live with our dogs.The biggest focus of this book is to finally put to bed the notion that 1) dogs act just like wolves, and 2) wolves have strictly hierarchical pack structures, and thus dogs do, too. The idea of the ""alpha wolf"" has been by and large debunked; new research into wolves shows that most packs operate in a family structure. While there will tend to be a male and a female wolf who lead the pack, they also tend to be the mother and father to most of the animals within the pack, and the pack members' roles are more fluid. It's about time people stopped drawing conclusions based on old research.What is more important, however, is the knowledge that dogs are very far removed from wolves in their social behaviors. They are much, much more affable toward strangers than any wolf will ever be, they are domesticated, and they have the (astonishing, when you think about it) ability to easily interact both with humans and with other dogs. Bradshaw emphasizes the differences by sharing his research on feral and semi-feral dog populations in cities around the world. Many cities, particularly in India and in some African countries, have colonies of ""village dogs"" that live alongside humans without actually belonging to anyone. These packs of dogs interact entirely differently than wolf packs in adjacent territories would. Their packs are permeable, allowing individuals to come and go, and loosely organized. They bear much more resemblence to coyotes than to wolves, socially speaking.All of this is to say that the popular conception of a dog as an animal in the house that wants to be ""pack leader"" and will fight its owners unless it is taught not to be ""dominant"" is based on erroneous science. The basic idea is that most dogs act in ways that are labeled ""dominant"" because... they want things. They do want the best spot on the couch, the food from the counter, and to win at tug-of-war. And they do need leadership to know when that's not appropriate, because otherwise they will be untrained hellions. But everything is not related to ""dominance,"" it's related to wanting the good stuff. In a lot of cases, this is functionally not that different. The difference is in how we think about the dog's behaviors (plotting to gain control vs. ""I like sleeping on the bed"") and in how we react to them. People who buy into the dominance theory of training tend to also believe that dogs expect to be physically cowed. This is not always the case, and more importantly, even if physical methods often work, they are very easy to screw up. Performing an ""alpha roll"" or another kind of physical correction is a good way to frighten or anger a dog into biting.By and large, Bradshaw does a good job of explaining all this. For me, the most compelling discussion was of the village dog pack structure, because that's a very clear indication that dogs, even dogs who've reverted to a feral state, do not function the way wolves do.There's a lot of other really interesting information in this book, such as how scent expands a dog's world, and how dogs with exaggerated and/or artificial features (such as docked tails) may have trouble communicating with other dogs. Ultimately, it won't change how I interact much with my dog, because I was already pretty much doing the right thing, but it really emphasized to me how AMAZING dogs are in the way that they have adapted to people."
15,1452652031,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2700768-pam,3,"This book will teach you a lot about where dogs came from but not much about how to enhance your friendship with your dogs.Dog Sense offers an excellent discussion on the evolution of the dog as a domestic companion to humans and a thorough description of canine social structure. Along with Bradshaw’s thorough dissection of force-based and behavioral training approaches, the book effectively demolishes the myths that “dogs are cute wolves” and that humans must establish dominance over dogs. But readers could be turned off by the heavy, long scientific discussion. There are two long chapters devoted to a rehashing of how dogs and humans came to be friends, with no new information presented. Despite the marketing copy (and the subtitle), there is little about the modern-day dog-human relationship other than a convincing (if obvious) statement that force-based training could damage that relationship. Unfortunately, and again contradicting the marketing copy, the book does not present a dog’s perspective. Instead, Bradshaw falls into the familiar anthropocentric habit of denying that dogs can feel complex emotions because they lack spoken language. This anthropocentric bias is humorously illustrated in Bradshaw’s comment that dogs never evolved the ability to see colors because it wasn’t necessary, as exemplified by his belief that carnivorous wolves wouldn’t have needed to choose the ripest berries. Wolves are opportunistic omnivores who do, indeed, eat berries. More to the point, neither dogs nor wolves need to rely on sight to choose ripe berries; they simply follow their far more sensitive noses to the choicest of fruits, as many a domestic dog has been known to do.Despite a too-common reliance on old myths and a too-anthropocentric focus, there is much solid information in Dog Sense and it is a valuable addition to any dog professional’s library, especially for those who seek a detailed analysis of the science of the evolution, domestication, and social history of dogs."
16,1452652031,http://goodreads.com/user/show/51955799-why-dog-blog,5,"By far one of my favorite books, Dog Sense is written by renowned anthrozoologist John Bradshaw, whose unique research on dog-human interactions takes this book to a whole new level. Dog Sense was, perhaps, my first, real look into the world through the eyes of a dog. Bradshaw brings to light a better understanding into the true nature of what it means to be or own a dog in the modern world. It’s a very science-oriented book and quite dense at parts. I had to re-read many thing and get a feel for chapters before I dived right in. However, once you get comfortable with Bradshaw’s straight-forward somewhat dry manner of writing, you will see that a whole new world opens up to you. Bradshaw takes research that he, as well as many of his colleagues, have preformed and explains exactly why and how many ancient myths on the dog can be disproved and kicked aside for more modern and refreshing ways of thinking about dogs and dog-human interactions. Bradshaw rebuffs such theories as dog dominance, and explains exactly why dogs are not and should not be thought of as wolves, human accessories or furry humans in themselves. You will see that I gather much information from Bradshaw and base many of my posts off his theories. I strongly believe in his manner of teaching, and agree with many of his theories and techniques when it comes to handling dogs. I would recommend this book to everyone and anyone and I hope, should you choose to read it, that you find it as helpful and as inspiring as I did. Just be prepared to sit down with a highlighter and pen so you can take lots of notes! "
17,1452652031,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5538634-bill-eger,5,"For many reasons this is an important book for those who want to gain a wholesome and helpful understanding of their dogs. It is likely far more helpful for readers who have had dogs on their family for some time rather than those with their first canine pet. The reason for that is the highly technical nature of John Bradshaw's efforts and its best to have some experience with dogs to fully appreciate the knowledge he is offering. His examples need to be understood with your own experience, in other words.At 76, I've had dogs of many types through much of my life and over that time gained a lot of patience with peculiarities that each dog has with the varied personalities. My experience is that dogs tend -- over time -- to adjust to their owner's personality. That's a way of saying that most of my dog pals have become calmer and more patient with me as a caretaker devoted to their welfare. They 'get it,' in other words and seem to enjoy my relatively quiet nature as a person and adjust to it. So my reading of Bradshaw gave me some clues on how that works with canine personalities which are as varied as their physical appearances!Be patient with this book and you will find it helpful in ways you may not have expected."
18,1452652031,http://goodreads.com/user/show/326553-lauren,5,"Though I agree with others who state that Bradshaw was at times repetitious, esp when it came to the chapters comparing dogs to wolves, I believe this book was excellent. I wanted to stop my fellow dog-owners on the streets and say, ""hey, read this! Seriously you will understand your dog so much better!"" Bradshaw brings up excellent questions/ideas at the end of the book concerning the future of dogs and how we as humans can help them adjust to a rapidly changing world. For me, this book was key as my dog has just recently developed separation anxiety, and I am trying to work with him to relieve his fears and anxiety. Bradshaw's chapters on how dogs learn and the connection with time was excellent and something I am trying to keep in mind as I train my dog through positive reinforcement. My last comment is that this book was extremely refreshing in terms of his complete disagreement with trainers like Ceaser Milan, who use dominance and punishment as the basis for training. I once picked up a Milan book and have watched his show, and almost from the start I have despised his methods and am happy the professionals out there are saying the same thing. "
19,1452652031,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1541322-hoss,4,"Lots of great findings from the latest research in canine cognition, and how those findings relate to the various dilemmas of dog companionship. Contrary to the accepted wisdom promoted by trainers like Cesar Millan, dogs are not merely domesticated wolves, and they are not inherently wired to seek ""dominance"". In fact, even wolves themselves aren't quite wired the way we thought. Bradshaw also touches upon some alarming findings in the lack of genetic diversity of so-called ""purebred"" dogs, and how the aesthetic criteria by which these dogs are bred is causing much suffering for both dogs and owners alike.Fascinating, readable, well-summarized science, with complete references to the literature for those who want to check the original research. Highly recommended reading for anyone contemplating bringing a dog into their home. Mandatory reading for anyone considering a ""purebred""."

The last couple of chapters didn't make sense to me--after spending the first 3/4ths of the book explaining how dogs are NOT that closely related to modern American grey wolves, he builds a whole chapter on how modern purebreds are handicapped by their inabilities to replicate modern grey wolf body language (because they have short tails, for instance, or pug faces). "
21,1452652031,http://goodreads.com/user/show/14432350-kate-baldwin,4,"Very scientific and thorough overview of dogs in general, beginning with their ancestry and how that should or shouldn't play into our training and relationship with them. It also offers some great insights on how modern dog breeding has really changed/destroyed some breeds and even how dogs relate to each other. For example, docking tails limits how that dog is able to communicate with other dogs because those other dogs can't ""read"" its body language. Very, very interesting material here."

So, we guess, surmise, presume and believe something until more research renders former assumptions and beliefs moot. This guy often contradicts himself. And he's repetitive. Something many reviewers have noted. I most hate when people claim that human intelligence is superior, or higher, than animal intelligence. Human intelligence created an island of plastic waste in the ocean. I saw a clip from a documentary where some people extracted a plastic straw from a poor distressed turtle's nostril, and I can't get that image out of my mind. The poor turtle's obvious pain, his little legs thrashing, opening it's mouth in agony. If it had a voice, it would have been screaming. Human stupidity makes me so angry. I don't disagree with or doubt everything he brings up, but I find no useful information in this book. Dude's way of thinking, his assumptions, simply stirred my anger. (Grrrr...)"

For those without a behavior or scientific background it may be too much science and research talk. It even really was for me and I have some background in these studies. I wanted it to be more about how I can better train my dog, share information with clients at work, and how we can understand our dogs. I guess someone with no knowledge would’ve learned something, but I personally didn’t. What I learned was a lot of facts that I didn’t think were necessary about behavior of various wild animals, and not all canids. The beginning felt like a long intro to a research thesis. It flashed me back to college for sure. So if you’re looking for a book that reminds you of something like that, this is it. I wasn’t quite looking for that style. So the rating is average because for those reasons I just didn’t really enjoy it all that much. If you’re looking for that thesis feeling you’ll probably rate it higher. "

They all bag on Cesar Millan (who rehabilitates - not trains) as if he advocates this type of behavior .... They assume that using a choke collar or slip lead is used to make a dog stop pulling ... that isn't quite true, either.This book had a lot of really great & useful information (as do some of the other books I've read on Positive training methods) - and it's a must read if you are studying dog behavior.

36,1452652031,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6052204-tracey,4,"In Dog Sense: How the New Science of Dog Behavior Can Make You a Better Friend to Your Pet, Bradshaw includes scads of information about wolves, about the evolution of the dog from the wolf and into a relationship with human society, about modern scientific studies on dog behavior, and about modern dog breeding and in-breeding, etc. He also discusses the human/dog bond, common errors humans make in understanding their dogs, and some comparisons between our species. Bradshaw launches his book with an engaging preface, describing two of the dogs of his childhood, Ginger and Alexis, the first of which he knew only from family legends that outlasted her. It's a great start, but much of the book relies on a stiffer and more formal voice, perhaps due to the scientific nature of the content.Some of what Bradshaw includes in his book is also in Mark Derr's book, How the Dog Became the Dog: From Wolves to Our Best Friends-- a book I liked less well than Bradshaw's. A few of the studies cited have also aired in PBS or National Geographic shows. For example, those showing that dogs outperform chimpanzees in some tasks, including: interpretation of human facial expressions, responsiveness to human pointing, and the ability to use humans as resources when attempting to get to a desired object, such as a tasty bit of food. There's also the Siberian fox domestication experiment.But much in this book is new, to me anyway. And when Bradshaw gets on a roll, his writing can be lively and pleasurable, spotted here and there with the kind of facts and ideas that one wants to read out loud to whomever is in earshot. For example, puppies begin to learn their mother's scent while they're still in the womb. Unborn pups gestating within a bitch who's had aniseed in her diet will gravitate to the scent of aniseed after they're born. And cats can hear higher frequencies than dogs. Or how about this?: after watching a scripted interaction between a ""beggar"" person, a ""generous"" person (who gives the beggar food or whatever), and a ""selfish"" person (who turns the beggar away), dogs prefer to interact with the ""generous"" person. Fascinating stuff. However, long passages seem to exist for the purpose of refuting those who disagree with ""the new science."" These parts are less accessible, come across as argumentative, and are repetitive, too. For example, it seems that Chapters 1 through 3 could have been shortened considerably, in part by moving some of the more involved material to footnotes, a text box, or an appendix. The writing style and organization of these chapters, and their fit into the whole, also made me wonder if they were pulled from articles he'd previously written. My biggest complaint about the book is that it does not, I think,fully deliver on its subtitle, neither describing ""the new science of dog behavior"" clearly enough nor telling the reader how to apply this science to be ""a better friend"" to one's pet. (One exception is an excerpt giving instructions on how to a dog of separation anxiety.) The book does explain, repeatedly, what the new science is not: it is not the old science of seeing dogs as wolves in disguise, ambitious to gain alpha status in the household. It is not about owners claiming the alpha role and keeping the dog in its beta, or omega, place. And it does not employ physical punishment.But Dog Sense contains a lot of interesting material, is well written (if not always consistently accessible), and its author is a pleasant enough chap to spend time with --- humane, intelligent, sensible, compassionate. Knowledgeable, of course. If the reader has a little patience, this book may vastly enrich how you see the world of dogs."
37,1452652031,http://goodreads.com/user/show/9003269-meghan,3,"Although I knew, going in, that this book contradicts what I personally feel about dogs, I strive to keep my eyes and ears open and was willing to give this book a shot. I have done my best to review this book on it's own merits, and not based on my own personal bias.And.. it reminds me of listening to one of my relatives. You know the type: he's armed with a couple of real concrete scientific facts and then scrapes those along to cover his own opinions. By repeating himself several times, he thinks you will be too stupid to figure out that everything he says (minus the actual science) is really just his own opinion dressed up with scientific jargon. But the author's repetitions of ""we can assume"", ""it's obvious that"", and ""we can suppose"" were a dead giveaway to how much of this was just his own views. Rather disappointing from a biologist. This book, imho, has the nearly identical issues as The Wolf in the Parlor: The Eternal Connection between Humans and Dogs: too little actual data to cover the author's premise, and therefore the claims are all questionable. Mr. Bradshaw did, however, avoid the pitfall of describing his own dogs as his main proof. Unfortunately he made another mistake: getting on a soapbox about a popular dog trainer. It became a bit much, honestly, and came across as a bitch-fest instead of an intellectual discourse.It isn't that I think this book was entirely wrong or that I got nothing out of it. I did find the discussion on purebred dogs and having dogs bred specifically for the pet market interesting (. I found some of his dog science interesting, even if I didn't agree with his conclusions. I laughed out loud when he mentioned 'pee-mail'. I enjoyed his comments on how dogs see the world (even if I think most dog owners are aware how important smell is to our dogs), and did think this was relatively easy to listen to- the writing flowed smoothly and the sentence structure was never boring despite the scientific words. The studies he includes on puppies do give us insight into how dogs bond with humans, and there were a number of other studies included that I found interesting as well. The idea that temperament testing of puppies really tells us very little about grown dogs was new to me, and I will read more on that subject (as I have always put a lot of faith in this for choosing puppies).I do suggest this author Never Ever Ever write about domestic cats again. Ever. He clearly hasn't lived with or observed cats at all, and cats are a crappy example for what he was trying to prove. As always, this is only my own opinion. Clearly other readers were far more impressed than I was, and I invite you to read this book and form your own thoughts. Note: this is NOT a dog training manual. With the exception of a bit about helping dog separation anxiety (which he calls separation distress, for his own reasons that were a bit unclear to me), there is no training advice here. I'm not sure he really took much of a stand on what sort of training was best (other than that he hates dominance theory). "

42,1452652031,http://goodreads.com/user/show/24179583-evan,4,"I enjoyed this book and found the information helpful. The author speaks to how the environment for dogs has changed with our urbanization and higher expectations that dogs must be under their owners control at all times. Also dogs are used less and less as workers and more and more as companions. The most responsible dog owners usually neuter their pets so these companion dogs do not get to pass on their genetics. It is the working dogs, the show dogs, and the dogs of irresponsible owners who are most likely to pass on their genes. Dogs are not wolves and they are not little people. They have a strong urge to bond to people. They live in the moment. Except in rare cases physical punishment of a dog is counterproductive as it creates a less trusting, less bonded, more anxious animal. If punishment is used it must be immediate. The dog cannot understand being punished for something in the past. Reward based training generates a happy, trusting animal. Dogs naturally wish to please. Most of their negative behavior is the result of fear, not an urge to dominate. When selecting a companion dog stay away from the most popular and thus inbred breeds where genetic weaknesses are concentrated. The first eight weeks of the puppy’s life is very important in determining its personality. Look for a puppy who has been raised in a home and who has had a variety of experiences. A puppy who has lived isolated in a kennel or backroom somewhere is likely to be fearful and maladjusted. Taking a young dog to obedience training class exposes the dog to other dogs and people as well as teaching it important commands. Much of this information is commonsense, but I appreciate the reinforcement. The book could have shorter. As others have pointed out there was considerable repetition. The information that was repeated was important information so I did not find it overly annoying. Having dog companions for most of my life and having trained several of them in obedience and agility I can attest to the value of reward based training versus punishment based. Dogs just become fearful when they are hurt. Eventually a fearful dog may become aggressive out of self-defense. The author explains what dogs are capable of understanding. It is unfair to hold an animal responsible for something that is beyond its capability to comprehend. "
43,1452652031,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1356959-h-w,3,A mix of the author's conclusions regarding particular scientific studies on dogs mixed with his personal impressions of what makes dogs tick. It would have been nice if he had more actual animal training experience (like animal behaviorists Karen Pryor or Patricia McConnell) that would have given his ideas more credibility. I think the positive take away from this book is that you need to think critically about the things you've heard and assumed to be true about dog behavior since much of the conventional information out there is likely to be wrong.
44,1452652031,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5438598-don,5,"I enjoyed this book VERY much and highly recommend it to anyone who lives with a dog and wants to understand more of what's going on in their furry little heads. Understanding more of what dogs think and experience can only make your life with them better.Strangely, there are elements in this book which also apply to how we relate to our fellow humans. One huge theme in this book is rethinking the idea that we should treat dog ownership into a constant reassertion of our dominance because dogs inherit the drive for dominance from wolves. As it turns out, dogs left on their own form familial units, not rigid hierarchies. And wolves in the wild also form familial groups, unlike the stressed groups of unrelated wolves observed in captivity. So constantly browbeating your dog is only going to turn a potential loving family member into a stressed out roommate.Why does this apply to humans? Because we have also allowed ourselves to buy into the old dominance model ""wolf pack"" for human interactions. From the workplace and it's obsessively ""alpha"" managers to our interactions with government ""public servants"", we have gotten locked into a pathological system where we are increasingly told what to do and to shut up about what we really think. This is a situation in dire need of rethinking. But back to the book...Dogs are creatures who have been co-evolving with the human race for tens of thousands of years and are one of the few creatures capable of forming stronger bonds to another species than to their own.But if you have a dog around, you also need to understand how it thinks. While amazingly capable of predicting what humans they know are going to do, dogs do NOT have the capability to understandthe consequences of their actions. A crucial example offered is the dog with separation anxiety, who only knows that sometimes when his owner comes back, the owner gets REALLY angry...so he gets increasingly stressed and chews something to bits. And then the owner gets angry...Dogs love us and chances are, if you are thinking about reading this book, you love them too. I recommend this book as a tool to help make that relationship as good as it can possibly be."
45,1452652031,http://goodreads.com/user/show/21256356-jocelyn,4,"I was going to give this book three stars but in the end decided not to. It's hard to find dog behavior books that are based objectively off of scientific evidence, and Dog Sense came close.Now, I say ""close"" because an incident early on in my reading undermined a lot of the confidence I had in the author's sources--in chapter 3 (p.92 in my version), after spending a while bashing some rather well-known trainers' techniques, Bradshaw gives an example list of ""commandments"" that people of those training methods allegedly must follow.This list contains ridiculous elements such as ""Do not cuddle or stroke your dog"" and ""Do not allow your dog to climb your stairs,"" and eventually I decided to just check the source that it came from. It turns out that the list is idealized to portray the most exaggerated of those trainers' tenets and was written by a critic of the method in question; obviously the reader is not told about this in the text and show quite clearly that Bradshaw is extremely biased and in this case at least has cherry-picked his ""cases.""So I will say, be wary of the sources he cites, since they might be chosen out of fields of other data just to better prove his point. Nevertheless, everything else that I checked after that seemed to be on-target, and his points about dog psychology are valid. This was one of the more scientifically well-founded dog books that I've read, and as such was in some ways more enlightening than, say, a dog-raising manual or a book on methods of training.Dog Sense doesn't really impart any great knowledge about training techniques but only about how dogs might think and why they act the way they do. It talks about the origins of common problems in dogs (separation anxiety is a big one) but doesn't go into any depth about how to solve the problems, but that's acceptable since it never advertised that it would provide any solutions and since there are so many other great sources on the subject.Overall, it's mostly just an educational read with little practical importance. I enjoyed it despite my wariness after that sketchy-source incident."
46,1452652031,http://goodreads.com/user/show/399070-nick,3,"Dog Sense provides a valuable survey of what scientists currently know about dogs, and it illustrates how far behind lags the practice of owning and training dogs. For example, the first misconception that Bradshaw attacks is the characterization of dogs as essentially wolves always striving to achieve alpha status. Modern research into wolf packs in the wild – not those fabricated by captivity – reveals a social structure recognizable as a family unit, with younger wolves deferring naturally to their parents, not to the strongest and most dominant. And Bradshaw argues convincingly that dogs have come a long way from their wolf ancestors.Bradshaw is first and foremost a scientist. His book makes for disappointingly dry reading, as he earnestly attempts to present the facts and describe the methodology and results of individual experiments. Yet he clearly cares deeply about the welfare of dogs: his outrage at the ignorant mistreatment of dogs is palpable. When science cannot conclusively show whether dogs experience emotions as humans do, he makes a leap of faith, seeing no reason to deny that dogs experience something we would recognize as love.Despite the book's title, Bradshaw's focus is on enlightening readers about dogs as a species. Only in passing does he occasionally instruct readers on how to be better dog owners. His book would be most valuable to those who assume wrongly that dogs must be forced to submit, or that dogs always understand why you punish them, or that dogs perceive the world in basically the same way that we do.Like those scientists who are trying to convince people that yes, global warming is real and a real problem, Bradshaw's main goal is to raise awareness. But although many of the challenges facing dogs are societal, such as the growing expectations of canine discipline in urban areas, and the ongoing efforts of breeders to optimize for (brittle) appearances instead of suitability for companionship, this eye-opening book can revolutionize how you understand your dog. The rest is up to you."
47,1452652031,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7566522-ray-campbell,4,"I love dogs, thus my review of any discussion may be skewed - sorry. Bradshaw begins with a study of the origins of dogs which was nothing new, though fun to read again. The one point he makes on origins which I liked, and he builds on later in the book, is that while dogs are 99% genetically wolves, they are not wolves. The animal, which was a now extincted breed of grey wolf, has evolved into modern dogs and no longer exists as a unique animal. Thus, we can not understand dogs by studying wolves anymore than we can understand humans by studying chimps, though we share ancestors and are 99% genetically similar... dogs are dogs.The middle part of the book is a look at doggy psychology which is lots of fun. Bradshaw explores the research on training effectiveness, the emotional lives of our beloved fuzzy friends and the general benefits of positive versus negative training practices. I picked up some useful tips, but it mostly reinforced ideas I embrace.The last part of the book is commentary. Bradshaw becomes activist in his reflection on the purposes of breeding and the resulting dogs, the dangers and benefits of the various practices. As he explains problems and mismatches, he becomes increasingly passionate about issues with over-breeding, puppy-mills and his vision of the best direction we can take for the sake of dogs and the happiness of our lives with them.Lots of great insight and lots of fun while clearly based on solid research. This is not a ""how-to"" book. This is a look at our friends and an exploration of how they think and how we might use current research to understand them and make decisions about them. If you love dogs, you'll love this book. If you are having issues, you might find a helpful insight. If you are looking for step by step instructions or a study of a specific breed - not here. I liked this book and would like to recommend it, though I hope I've been clear on what it is. Woof."
48,1452652031,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1713788-sarah,4,"This book is a sort of guide to better understanding dogs. It made me appreciate my favorite animal even more.Bradshaw's take on dogs' social, emotional, and physical lives is based on an evolutionary perspective. He points out that many popular ideas on training and dealing with dogs are based on bad logic. We look to a not-directly-related specie of captive wolf to understand how our dogs, who have been selectively bred for thousands of years for life among humans, behave. I think Bradshaw's angle of looking at how and why humans have domesticated and bred dogs gives a much more realistic, useful interpretation.This book made me understand why dogs are ""man's best friend"". We are both social creatures who evolved in cooperative groups, not just domination hierarchies. We are well-adapted to learn and read each others' body language and to take pleasure in interacting with each other.It expanded my understanding of how dogs think, feel, and behave, and made me realize that they interpret and experience the world in very different ways than we do (particularly their sense of smell). So, while it's tempting to anthropomorphize our little buddies and assume that they feel and understand just like us, that's a dangerous assumption that asks too much of dogs.It also raises some concerns about the future of dogs in our society. By breeding for dogs who seek human companionship above any other kind, we are creating dogs prone to separation anxiety. By purchasing dogs based on appearance, we are putting dogs bred for certain kinds of lifestyles (e.g., hunting, herding) in incompatible environments, then wondering why they react negatively.This book was well-written with as much research as he could find to support his claims. Bradshaw obviously appreciates dogs and wants to educate others so we can all appreciate and treat them well."
49,1452652031,http://goodreads.com/user/show/537331-araminta-matthews,3,"I read this book hoping to learn some of my very own human tricks that would allow me to better relate to and interact with my dog. That isn't exactly what I received, though I'm enough of an amateur scientist to have gleaned, connected, and otherwise sussed out of this book what I needed to improve my whippet-rearing tactics (and before you ask, yes, my dog is a rescue; not a store-bought pedigree). This book does a great job laying out science, studies, and general observations of canine history, behavior, and socialization, but it falls short of recommending methods promised by its title that would ""make you a better friend to your pet."" At the same time, there were a few things I found interesting that I'll share. For one, research has found that negative reinforcers produce only 12% obedience rates, whereas positive reinforcers or rewards produce 60% obedience rates, according to Bradshaw. In addition, Bradshaw effectively debunks the notion that dogs experience the human emotion of ""guilt,"" and furthermore, demonstrates clear science to support the idea that Ddgs have a different brand of intelligence to primates (and thus can't be compared to us on emotional scales--they aren't the same). At the same time, he does argue that dogs consistently outperform even chimpanzees at reading human facial expressions, vocal tones, commands, and gestures. I'll leave my review on one note that struck me to the point of necessitating a full quotation. No tears, fellow-dog-moms: p.171: “Dogs really do miss their owners when they are separated from them. Many dogs also seem to become much more emotionally fragile under sudden shocks, such as the noise of fireworks going off. . . they find it difficult to cope without us.” "
50,1452652031,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1161667-shel,4,"While there's nothing earth-shattering here, the book makes an excellent point that in order to relate better to our canine companions we ought to invest more effort in thinking about how they perceive the world.Perhaps that's the most surprising revelation here: how little scientific and purposeful thought we've given to how our dogs friends think and what makes them happy. While, dogs on the other hand, watch and respond sensitively to our every move and mood.The book counters some conventional wisdom and wrong-thinking which has lead to misguided and harmful training techniques i.e. dogs do not behave like wolves. They do not need to be dominated and, in fact, this can cause them anxiety and fear.This book is part of a growing and useful trend toward delving more into the emotional lives of animals, not in the sense of anthropormorphizing, but rather in perceiving the world in the way another species would. Dogs, for example, have a huge olfactory world available to them.It's a helpful point of view. Bradshaw makes a strong case for the need to think about how to access and maximize the potential of the inner world of dogs to help them integrate and be our companions in modern society rather than simply breeding them to look a certain way - often to the detriment of their health and temperament.The book ends on a pessimistic note about the fate of dogs, if their needs are not taken into consideration. As a dog lover, I have to feel more hopeful about the future of dogs. What would we do without them? Loyal dog people will certainly read books like this and speak out to make changes (in training techniques, breeding, welfare) on the dogs' behalf. Won't they?"
51,1452652031,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2716223-julie,5,"This is, by far, one of the best books I've read on dog behavior and training. Bradshaw walks the reader through the previous held theories of wolf behavior and how dog training - based on captive wolf behavior (not wild wolves) can lead humans to train dogs in a manner that is not fair to the true nature of dogs. This book justified many of my gut reactions on my experiences training dogs. I've never been comfortable employing punishment or negative techniques preferring instead to observe the dog and work with the personality that each dog has. Many other trainers, such at Patricia McConnell and Pat Miller, practice positive dog training techniques and I'm a huge fan of their work. Bradshaw, however, adds more context - based on research - around the nature of dogs and their connectivity to humans. The research covers not only the ""lupomorph"" model but also tackles the breeding of dogs and how breeding for looks and not behavior has created dogs with far greater health and behavior problems than ever before. This book is a must read for anyone remotely interested in animal behavior. I'd even say that anyone who has a dog or is thinking of getting a dog should read this as the insight is invaluable as one works with (and even choses) a dog. Bradshaw ends the book with this line: ""Addressing the twin pressures of misguided breeding and poor understanding of canine psychology is crucial to ensuring that dogs remain as significant a part of human life as they have ben for the past ten millennia. My hope is that this book will make some contribution toward that goal."" I believe it has. "
52,1452652031,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1783712-kelly,5,"Absolutely fascinating book. It's a little slow in some parts but seems scientifically sound (in my not-especially-informed opinion) and provides compelling evidence for why looking at modern wolf behavior tells us precious little about domesticated dogs. The science makes a strong case for basing dog training in rewards rather than punishment. The book also covers the major problems caused by breeding for looks rather than companionship traits. The most shocking statistic: pedigree dogs have lost about 40 percent of their genetic variation due to inbreeding, which is the equivalent of a WHOLE BREED having a gene pool no more diverse than human first cousins (p. 255). This certainly explains some of the health problems we've had with our purebred golden retrievers. I also enjoyed the chapters on what the world is like from a dog's perspective--what emotions they are capable of feeling, what colors they see, how they make use of their heightened sense of smell, how they communicate with other dogs, etc. (Spoiler alert: there is no evidence that dogs can feel jealousy, guilt, pride, or shame. Yelling at your dog for chewing up a shoe while you were away just makes them confused and anxious, enough so that they may begin to associate your return home with anxiety and punishment. They don't have the presence of mind to connect the punishment with having chewed the shoe earlier, much less to feel guilty about it.)This really is a must-read for dog owners. I will keep this information in mind for future dog purchases as I consider breeds, training programs, and the way I interact with my pet."
53,1452652031,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2755825-ellen-broadhurst,5,"Dog Sense is an excellent read for someone interested in a layman's overview of dog behavior and psychology research. Basically offering evidence that refutes the ""dominant down"" sort of dog training (which I find puzzling: are there still people who subscribe to this??), the author offers insights into how dogs differ from wolves, how dogs interact with their environment, how dogs (probably) perceive their care-taker humans, their hearth and home, and how dogs (likely) interact with each other. As a half way intelligent dog owner who has already internalized much of the message Bradshaw is delivering, most of the book was not a revelation. That said, there were golden nuggets that made Dog Sense well worth a read. It is also exactly the sort of book I would give to a non-dog person considering getting a dog. One of the biggest, obvious mistakes people make in getting a ""first dog"" is not taking the time to understand what a dog really is, how they operate and how best to integrate a dog into your household. As someone who had done the research upfront, hired a trainer before getting the dog, and ultimately adopting a nearly-perfect 5 year old dog (who came, super polite, house trained, crate trained, didn't chew, etc), I *still* made some beginner mistakes; books like this aren't going to solve training problems, but it should give readers a broader perspective that helps them think about the 'whole' dog when they are integrating a dog into the household, or trying to problem-solve issues do arise. "
54,1452652031,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1279767-nita,4,"The author's main premise is that as we continue to expect more and more obedience and human-like behavior from our dogs since our world continues to change into one where we have less and less time for them, we must spend more time breeding them to behave as the dogs we want as pets and less time worrying about what they look like. He has very strong opinions about how this should be done. And while I agree with the author that the old dominance-aggression based training methods used by popular dog trainers such as Cesar Millan need to go the way of the dinosaur, the author said it so many times in so many different ways that it got very old quickly. Still, I enjoyed the book and found his insights helpful in thinking about the way I have trained dogs in the past and how I might select and train a pet dog in the future. This is not a training manual, but a scientific study of canine evolution. I found it especially interesting that the dog did not evolve directly from the wolf, but rather more likely from a common ancestor. No wonder dog training methods that use wolf behavior as a foundation for training our highly domesticated pet dogs is so off base! He maintains that the dog's strongest evolutionary trait is to want to please us, but is often confused about how to go about it. It's our job not to punish bad behavior which the dog has likely forgotten as soon as we've entered the room, but to use positive techniques to teach and breed dogs to be the best companions possible."
55,1452652031,http://goodreads.com/user/show/975391-steven,3,"Bradshaw looks at dogs and their long interaction with our species, considering this relationship from scratch -- without all the baggage and traditionally-taught notions about what dogs are thinking. It's a good approach, although maybe not what readers might expect.He's upfront with stating that this is NOT a training manual. Rather, he looks at the trends and beliefs that have informed dog trainers, and holds up a mirror of genetics, evolution, and behavioral studies. One of his major goals is to debunk the idea that our modern dogs are just ""little wolves,"" vying for position in a pack, or a indeed, a human household. He points out that most studies of wolf behavior are either based on specifically local populations of modern wolves, or are based on captive groups, neither of which are typical. And in either case, their behavior doesn't have much to do with creatures that split from a common ancestor tens of thousands of years ago.Bradshaw discusses several ideas that I found intriguing, including the fact that dogs seem to be more focused on people than on other dogs, that we often overestimate dogs' ability to process information and their capacity for self-reflection. He also discusses their physiology and how it differs from humans, giving insight into how they see, hear and, of course, smell in very different ways from us. A good book. Quite sciencey, but there's nothing wrong with that. I certainly looked at the canine's I'm in charge of differently while reading this book. So much so, that the next book I plan to read is about dogs and their minds, too."
56,1452652031,http://goodreads.com/user/show/69313297-jina,2,"Honestly, Dr. John Bradshaw irritated me. He disagreed with a lot of the findings discussed in The Genius of Dogs (note that Dog Sense was published 2 years before), but that’s not what irritated me. He goes on and on and on in the first half of his book about why it doesn’t make any sense to look at wolves to understand dog behaviour. Then, in the second to last chapter of his book, he has the nerve to say that humans are ruining the way dogs can communicate with each other the more we breed them to look less like a wolf. Like -wait a minute. If we should not be looking at wolves to understand dog behaviour, why are we looking at how wolves communicate to make a statement that the less dogs look like the wolves, the less expressive their faces are, and, therefore, the less they are able to effectively communicate with their fellow dogs. This hypocrisy annoyed me mostly because of how much Dr. Bradshaw reiterates over and over and over again about how it doesn’t make any sense to compare dogs to wolves. “My view is that the key to understanding the domestic dog is, first and foremost, to understand the domestic dog… By analyzing the dog has its own animal rather than a lesser version of the wolf, we have the opportunity to understand it and refine our dealings with it as never before.” - Evidently, this statement doesn’t apply to how dogs communicate."
57,1452652031,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4689182-ronald,5,"A very well written book representing the evolution of the present day dog from a common ancestor with todays wolf. He points out that dogs did not evolve from the wolf. He postulates how todays canid became domesticated primarily to serve man primarily as a help in sheparding, hunting and other practical purposes. Man began breeding dogs for specific traits which enhanced these skills. Breeds have become increasingly inbred This inbreeding for physical attributes has become problematic to the health of some breed. Breed and show organizations have been the root cause of this problem. The role of dogs todays is providing a companion a to its owner more so then for practical work purpose. Some breeds still carry the work traits that they were originally bred. Those original work traits make certain breeds less suitable for companion purposes.Bradshaw speaks to the physical, perceptual and psychological make up of dogs such as their superior scent capability. He offers for consideration ideas of how people and more effectively interface with there dogs for the positive benefit of both.I enjoyed reading this book since I have had dogs since I was a young lad. I wish that I new then what I have learned now."
58,1452652031,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5041758-heather-hunter,3,"I was pretty intrigued by this title though I passed it over a few times initially at my local library before picking it up. (I'm always looking for ways to be a better friend to my pets.) Although portions of it, mainly on the evolutionary history of dogs, were interesting, I probably should have followed my gut on this one. I kept finding myself literally falling asleep after a few pages and, by a few weeks in, had only made it halfway through. Perhaps the second half is better, but I just couldn't bear it anymore and had to turn to something else. Parts of the theory on the behavior of domestic dogs as it relates to that of wolves was particularly confusing, in as much as the author states many times that the two should not be compared due to many distinct differences and, yet, continues to do so himself. I was kind of left feeling much like I do about politics- that comparisons were being made only when it was useful to support this point of view.I may try again someday since I can borrow it for free, but I think on this one I'd have to say I'd rather go with MY instincts about how to interact with my dogs."
59,1452652031,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4534004-chel,5,"This is not a how-to book for a dog owner. It's more of a book about how to evaluate all the other how-to books. Bradshaw looks at what researchers have learned about the evolution of domestic dogs; how they are and are not like their nearest relative, the wolf; what we know about how their senses perceive, how they learn, their intelligence, their emotions, and what the breeding of specific strains has meant for the wellbeing of dogs today. At times it's a little difficult to figure out who he is writing for -- the reading is a little heavy in places for the recreational reader, offering what seems to be a full literature review out of all the various studies, frequently noting what we don't know, as well as what we do know. But I imagine he is defending himself from criticisms of his conclusions from people who would cite the studies he did not.I most appreciated his strong refutation of the idea that the dog's world must have an ""alpha"" character, a boss, and if humans don't take pains to assume that role, then the dog will. Good riddance to that way of thinking -- now I am going to go play tug-of-war with my dog!"

Both points formed touchstones for arguments against a lot of currently accepted thought about dog behavior.

66,1452652031,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6052204-tracey,4,"In Dog Sense: How the New Science of Dog Behavior Can Make You a Better Friend to Your Pet, Bradshaw includes scads of information about wolves, about the evolution of the dog from the wolf and into a relationship with human society, about modern scientific studies on dog behavior, and about modern dog breeding and in-breeding, etc. He also discusses the human/dog bond, common errors humans make in understanding their dogs, and some comparisons between our species. Bradshaw launches his book with an engaging preface, describing two of the dogs of his childhood, Ginger and Alexis, the first of which he knew only from family legends that outlasted her. It's a great start, but much of the book relies on a stiffer and more formal voice, perhaps due to the scientific nature of the content.Some of what Bradshaw includes in his book is also in Mark Derr's book, How the Dog Became the Dog: From Wolves to Our Best Friends-- a book I liked less well than Bradshaw's. A few of the studies cited have also aired in PBS or National Geographic shows. For example, those showing that dogs outperform chimpanzees in some tasks, including: interpretation of human facial expressions, responsiveness to human pointing, and the ability to use humans as resources when attempting to get to a desired object, such as a tasty bit of food. There's also the Siberian fox domestication experiment.But much in this book is new, to me anyway. And when Bradshaw gets on a roll, his writing can be lively and pleasurable, spotted here and there with the kind of facts and ideas that one wants to read out loud to whomever is in earshot. For example, puppies begin to learn their mother's scent while they're still in the womb. Unborn pups gestating within a bitch who's had aniseed in her diet will gravitate to the scent of aniseed after they're born. And cats can hear higher frequencies than dogs. Or how about this?: after watching a scripted interaction between a ""beggar"" person, a ""generous"" person (who gives the beggar food or whatever), and a ""selfish"" person (who turns the beggar away), dogs prefer to interact with the ""generous"" person. Fascinating stuff. However, long passages seem to exist for the purpose of refuting those who disagree with ""the new science."" These parts are less accessible, come across as argumentative, and are repetitive, too. For example, it seems that Chapters 1 through 3 could have been shortened considerably, in part by moving some of the more involved material to footnotes, a text box, or an appendix. The writing style and organization of these chapters, and their fit into the whole, also made me wonder if they were pulled from articles he'd previously written. My biggest complaint about the book is that it does not, I think,fully deliver on its subtitle, neither describing ""the new science of dog behavior"" clearly enough nor telling the reader how to apply this science to be ""a better friend"" to one's pet. (One exception is an excerpt giving instructions on how to a dog of separation anxiety.) The book does explain, repeatedly, what the new science is not: it is not the old science of seeing dogs as wolves in disguise, ambitious to gain alpha status in the household. It is not about owners claiming the alpha role and keeping the dog in its beta, or omega, place. And it does not employ physical punishment.But Dog Sense contains a lot of interesting material, is well written (if not always consistently accessible), and its author is a pleasant enough chap to spend time with --- humane, intelligent, sensible, compassionate. Knowledgeable, of course. If the reader has a little patience, this book may vastly enrich how you see the world of dogs."

I have done my best to review this book on it's own merits, and not based on my own personal bias.And.. it reminds me of listening to one of my relatives. You know the type: he's armed with a couple of real concrete scientific facts and then scrapes those along to cover his own opinions. By repeating himself several times, he thinks you will be too stupid to figure out that everything he says (minus the actual science) is really just his own opinion dressed up with scientific jargon. But the author's repetitions of ""we can assume"", ""it's obvious that"", and ""we can suppose"" were a dead giveaway to how much of this was just his own views. Rather disappointing from a biologist. This book, imho, has the nearly identical issues as The Wolf in the Parlor: The Eternal Connection between Humans and Dogs: too little actual data to cover the author's premise, and therefore the claims are all questionable. Mr. Bradshaw did, however, avoid the pitfall of describing his own dogs as his main proof. Unfortunately he made another mistake: getting on a soapbox about a popular dog trainer. It became a bit much, honestly, and came across as a bitch-fest instead of an intellectual discourse.It isn't that I think this book was entirely wrong or that I got nothing out of it. I did find the discussion on purebred dogs and having dogs bred specifically for the pet market interesting (. I found some of his dog science interesting, even if I didn't agree with his conclusions. I laughed out loud when he mentioned 'pee-mail'. I enjoyed his comments on how dogs see the world (even if I think most dog owners are aware how important smell is to our dogs), and did think this was relatively easy to listen to- the writing flowed smoothly and the sentence structure was never boring despite the scientific words. The studies he includes on puppies do give us insight into how dogs bond with humans, and there were a number of other studies included that I found interesting as well. The idea that temperament testing of puppies really tells us very little about grown dogs was new to me, and I will read more on that subject (as I have always put a lot of faith in this for choosing puppies).I do suggest this author Never Ever Ever write about domestic cats again. Ever. He clearly hasn't lived with or observed cats at all, and cats are a crappy example for what he was trying to prove. As always, this is only my own opinion. Clearly other readers were far more impressed than I was, and I invite you to read this book and form your own thoughts. Note: this is NOT a dog training manual. With the exception of a bit about helping dog separation anxiety (which he calls separation distress, for his own reasons that were a bit unclear to me), there is no training advice here. I'm not sure he really took much of a stand on what sort of training was best (other than that he hates dominance theory). "

72,1452652031,http://goodreads.com/user/show/24179583-evan,4,"I enjoyed this book and found the information helpful. The author speaks to how the environment for dogs has changed with our urbanization and higher expectations that dogs must be under their owners control at all times. Also dogs are used less and less as workers and more and more as companions. The most responsible dog owners usually neuter their pets so these companion dogs do not get to pass on their genetics. It is the working dogs, the show dogs, and the dogs of irresponsible owners who are most likely to pass on their genes. Dogs are not wolves and they are not little people. They have a strong urge to bond to people. They live in the moment. Except in rare cases physical punishment of a dog is counterproductive as it creates a less trusting, less bonded, more anxious animal. If punishment is used it must be immediate. The dog cannot understand being punished for something in the past. Reward based training generates a happy, trusting animal. Dogs naturally wish to please. Most of their negative behavior is the result of fear, not an urge to dominate. When selecting a companion dog stay away from the most popular and thus inbred breeds where genetic weaknesses are concentrated. The first eight weeks of the puppy’s life is very important in determining its personality. Look for a puppy who has been raised in a home and who has had a variety of experiences. A puppy who has lived isolated in a kennel or backroom somewhere is likely to be fearful and maladjusted. Taking a young dog to obedience training class exposes the dog to other dogs and people as well as teaching it important commands. Much of this information is commonsense, but I appreciate the reinforcement. The book could have shorter. As others have pointed out there was considerable repetition. The information that was repeated was important information so I did not find it overly annoying. Having dog companions for most of my life and having trained several of them in obedience and agility I can attest to the value of reward based training versus punishment based. Dogs just become fearful when they are hurt. Eventually a fearful dog may become aggressive out of self-defense. The author explains what dogs are capable of understanding. It is unfair to hold an animal responsible for something that is beyond its capability to comprehend. "
73,1452652031,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1356959-h-w,3,A mix of the author's conclusions regarding particular scientific studies on dogs mixed with his personal impressions of what makes dogs tick. It would have been nice if he had more actual animal training experience (like animal behaviorists Karen Pryor or Patricia McConnell) that would have given his ideas more credibility. I think the positive take away from this book is that you need to think critically about the things you've heard and assumed to be true about dog behavior since much of the conventional information out there is likely to be wrong.
74,1452652031,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5438598-don,5,"I enjoyed this book VERY much and highly recommend it to anyone who lives with a dog and wants to understand more of what's going on in their furry little heads. Understanding more of what dogs think and experience can only make your life with them better.Strangely, there are elements in this book which also apply to how we relate to our fellow humans. One huge theme in this book is rethinking the idea that we should treat dog ownership into a constant reassertion of our dominance because dogs inherit the drive for dominance from wolves. As it turns out, dogs left on their own form familial units, not rigid hierarchies. And wolves in the wild also form familial groups, unlike the stressed groups of unrelated wolves observed in captivity. So constantly browbeating your dog is only going to turn a potential loving family member into a stressed out roommate.Why does this apply to humans? Because we have also allowed ourselves to buy into the old dominance model ""wolf pack"" for human interactions. From the workplace and it's obsessively ""alpha"" managers to our interactions with government ""public servants"", we have gotten locked into a pathological system where we are increasingly told what to do and to shut up about what we really think. This is a situation in dire need of rethinking. But back to the book...Dogs are creatures who have been co-evolving with the human race for tens of thousands of years and are one of the few creatures capable of forming stronger bonds to another species than to their own.But if you have a dog around, you also need to understand how it thinks. While amazingly capable of predicting what humans they know are going to do, dogs do NOT have the capability to understandthe consequences of their actions. A crucial example offered is the dog with separation anxiety, who only knows that sometimes when his owner comes back, the owner gets REALLY angry...so he gets increasingly stressed and chews something to bits. And then the owner gets angry...Dogs love us and chances are, if you are thinking about reading this book, you love them too. I recommend this book as a tool to help make that relationship as good as it can possibly be."
75,1452652031,http://goodreads.com/user/show/21256356-jocelyn,4,"I was going to give this book three stars but in the end decided not to. It's hard to find dog behavior books that are based objectively off of scientific evidence, and Dog Sense came close.Now, I say ""close"" because an incident early on in my reading undermined a lot of the confidence I had in the author's sources--in chapter 3 (p.92 in my version), after spending a while bashing some rather well-known trainers' techniques, Bradshaw gives an example list of ""commandments"" that people of those training methods allegedly must follow.This list contains ridiculous elements such as ""Do not cuddle or stroke your dog"" and ""Do not allow your dog to climb your stairs,"" and eventually I decided to just check the source that it came from. It turns out that the list is idealized to portray the most exaggerated of those trainers' tenets and was written by a critic of the method in question; obviously the reader is not told about this in the text and show quite clearly that Bradshaw is extremely biased and in this case at least has cherry-picked his ""cases.""So I will say, be wary of the sources he cites, since they might be chosen out of fields of other data just to better prove his point. Nevertheless, everything else that I checked after that seemed to be on-target, and his points about dog psychology are valid. This was one of the more scientifically well-founded dog books that I've read, and as such was in some ways more enlightening than, say, a dog-raising manual or a book on methods of training.Dog Sense doesn't really impart any great knowledge about training techniques but only about how dogs might think and why they act the way they do. It talks about the origins of common problems in dogs (separation anxiety is a big one) but doesn't go into any depth about how to solve the problems, but that's acceptable since it never advertised that it would provide any solutions and since there are so many other great sources on the subject.Overall, it's mostly just an educational read with little practical importance. I enjoyed it despite my wariness after that sketchy-source incident."
76,1452652031,http://goodreads.com/user/show/399070-nick,3,"Dog Sense provides a valuable survey of what scientists currently know about dogs, and it illustrates how far behind lags the practice of owning and training dogs. For example, the first misconception that Bradshaw attacks is the characterization of dogs as essentially wolves always striving to achieve alpha status. Modern research into wolf packs in the wild – not those fabricated by captivity – reveals a social structure recognizable as a family unit, with younger wolves deferring naturally to their parents, not to the strongest and most dominant. And Bradshaw argues convincingly that dogs have come a long way from their wolf ancestors.Bradshaw is first and foremost a scientist. His book makes for disappointingly dry reading, as he earnestly attempts to present the facts and describe the methodology and results of individual experiments. Yet he clearly cares deeply about the welfare of dogs: his outrage at the ignorant mistreatment of dogs is palpable. When science cannot conclusively show whether dogs experience emotions as humans do, he makes a leap of faith, seeing no reason to deny that dogs experience something we would recognize as love.Despite the book's title, Bradshaw's focus is on enlightening readers about dogs as a species. Only in passing does he occasionally instruct readers on how to be better dog owners. His book would be most valuable to those who assume wrongly that dogs must be forced to submit, or that dogs always understand why you punish them, or that dogs perceive the world in basically the same way that we do.Like those scientists who are trying to convince people that yes, global warming is real and a real problem, Bradshaw's main goal is to raise awareness. But although many of the challenges facing dogs are societal, such as the growing expectations of canine discipline in urban areas, and the ongoing efforts of breeders to optimize for (brittle) appearances instead of suitability for companionship, this eye-opening book can revolutionize how you understand your dog. The rest is up to you."
77,1452652031,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7566522-ray-campbell,4,"I love dogs, thus my review of any discussion may be skewed - sorry. Bradshaw begins with a study of the origins of dogs which was nothing new, though fun to read again. The one point he makes on origins which I liked, and he builds on later in the book, is that while dogs are 99% genetically wolves, they are not wolves. The animal, which was a now extincted breed of grey wolf, has evolved into modern dogs and no longer exists as a unique animal. Thus, we can not understand dogs by studying wolves anymore than we can understand humans by studying chimps, though we share ancestors and are 99% genetically similar... dogs are dogs.The middle part of the book is a look at doggy psychology which is lots of fun. Bradshaw explores the research on training effectiveness, the emotional lives of our beloved fuzzy friends and the general benefits of positive versus negative training practices. I picked up some useful tips, but it mostly reinforced ideas I embrace.The last part of the book is commentary. Bradshaw becomes activist in his reflection on the purposes of breeding and the resulting dogs, the dangers and benefits of the various practices. As he explains problems and mismatches, he becomes increasingly passionate about issues with over-breeding, puppy-mills and his vision of the best direction we can take for the sake of dogs and the happiness of our lives with them.Lots of great insight and lots of fun while clearly based on solid research. This is not a ""how-to"" book. This is a look at our friends and an exploration of how they think and how we might use current research to understand them and make decisions about them. If you love dogs, you'll love this book. If you are having issues, you might find a helpful insight. If you are looking for step by step instructions or a study of a specific breed - not here. I liked this book and would like to recommend it, though I hope I've been clear on what it is. Woof."
78,1452652031,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1713788-sarah,4,"This book is a sort of guide to better understanding dogs. It made me appreciate my favorite animal even more.Bradshaw's take on dogs' social, emotional, and physical lives is based on an evolutionary perspective. He points out that many popular ideas on training and dealing with dogs are based on bad logic. We look to a not-directly-related specie of captive wolf to understand how our dogs, who have been selectively bred for thousands of years for life among humans, behave. I think Bradshaw's angle of looking at how and why humans have domesticated and bred dogs gives a much more realistic, useful interpretation.This book made me understand why dogs are ""man's best friend"". We are both social creatures who evolved in cooperative groups, not just domination hierarchies. We are well-adapted to learn and read each others' body language and to take pleasure in interacting with each other.It expanded my understanding of how dogs think, feel, and behave, and made me realize that they interpret and experience the world in very different ways than we do (particularly their sense of smell). So, while it's tempting to anthropomorphize our little buddies and assume that they feel and understand just like us, that's a dangerous assumption that asks too much of dogs.It also raises some concerns about the future of dogs in our society. By breeding for dogs who seek human companionship above any other kind, we are creating dogs prone to separation anxiety. By purchasing dogs based on appearance, we are putting dogs bred for certain kinds of lifestyles (e.g., hunting, herding) in incompatible environments, then wondering why they react negatively.This book was well-written with as much research as he could find to support his claims. Bradshaw obviously appreciates dogs and wants to educate others so we can all appreciate and treat them well."
79,1452652031,http://goodreads.com/user/show/537331-araminta-matthews,3,"I read this book hoping to learn some of my very own human tricks that would allow me to better relate to and interact with my dog. That isn't exactly what I received, though I'm enough of an amateur scientist to have gleaned, connected, and otherwise sussed out of this book what I needed to improve my whippet-rearing tactics (and before you ask, yes, my dog is a rescue; not a store-bought pedigree). This book does a great job laying out science, studies, and general observations of canine history, behavior, and socialization, but it falls short of recommending methods promised by its title that would ""make you a better friend to your pet."" At the same time, there were a few things I found interesting that I'll share. For one, research has found that negative reinforcers produce only 12% obedience rates, whereas positive reinforcers or rewards produce 60% obedience rates, according to Bradshaw. In addition, Bradshaw effectively debunks the notion that dogs experience the human emotion of ""guilt,"" and furthermore, demonstrates clear science to support the idea that Ddgs have a different brand of intelligence to primates (and thus can't be compared to us on emotional scales--they aren't the same). At the same time, he does argue that dogs consistently outperform even chimpanzees at reading human facial expressions, vocal tones, commands, and gestures. I'll leave my review on one note that struck me to the point of necessitating a full quotation. No tears, fellow-dog-moms: p.171: “Dogs really do miss their owners when they are separated from them. Many dogs also seem to become much more emotionally fragile under sudden shocks, such as the noise of fireworks going off. . . they find it difficult to cope without us.” "
80,1452652031,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1161667-shel,4,"While there's nothing earth-shattering here, the book makes an excellent point that in order to relate better to our canine companions we ought to invest more effort in thinking about how they perceive the world.Perhaps that's the most surprising revelation here: how little scientific and purposeful thought we've given to how our dogs friends think and what makes them happy. While, dogs on the other hand, watch and respond sensitively to our every move and mood.The book counters some conventional wisdom and wrong-thinking which has lead to misguided and harmful training techniques i.e. dogs do not behave like wolves. They do not need to be dominated and, in fact, this can cause them anxiety and fear.This book is part of a growing and useful trend toward delving more into the emotional lives of animals, not in the sense of anthropormorphizing, but rather in perceiving the world in the way another species would. Dogs, for example, have a huge olfactory world available to them.It's a helpful point of view. Bradshaw makes a strong case for the need to think about how to access and maximize the potential of the inner world of dogs to help them integrate and be our companions in modern society rather than simply breeding them to look a certain way - often to the detriment of their health and temperament.The book ends on a pessimistic note about the fate of dogs, if their needs are not taken into consideration. As a dog lover, I have to feel more hopeful about the future of dogs. What would we do without them? Loyal dog people will certainly read books like this and speak out to make changes (in training techniques, breeding, welfare) on the dogs' behalf. Won't they?"
81,1452652031,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2716223-julie,5,"This is, by far, one of the best books I've read on dog behavior and training. Bradshaw walks the reader through the previous held theories of wolf behavior and how dog training - based on captive wolf behavior (not wild wolves) can lead humans to train dogs in a manner that is not fair to the true nature of dogs. This book justified many of my gut reactions on my experiences training dogs. I've never been comfortable employing punishment or negative techniques preferring instead to observe the dog and work with the personality that each dog has. Many other trainers, such at Patricia McConnell and Pat Miller, practice positive dog training techniques and I'm a huge fan of their work. Bradshaw, however, adds more context - based on research - around the nature of dogs and their connectivity to humans. The research covers not only the ""lupomorph"" model but also tackles the breeding of dogs and how breeding for looks and not behavior has created dogs with far greater health and behavior problems than ever before. This book is a must read for anyone remotely interested in animal behavior. I'd even say that anyone who has a dog or is thinking of getting a dog should read this as the insight is invaluable as one works with (and even choses) a dog. Bradshaw ends the book with this line: ""Addressing the twin pressures of misguided breeding and poor understanding of canine psychology is crucial to ensuring that dogs remain as significant a part of human life as they have ben for the past ten millennia. My hope is that this book will make some contribution toward that goal."" I believe it has. "
82,1452652031,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1783712-kelly,5,"Absolutely fascinating book. It's a little slow in some parts but seems scientifically sound (in my not-especially-informed opinion) and provides compelling evidence for why looking at modern wolf behavior tells us precious little about domesticated dogs. The science makes a strong case for basing dog training in rewards rather than punishment. The book also covers the major problems caused by breeding for looks rather than companionship traits. The most shocking statistic: pedigree dogs have lost about 40 percent of their genetic variation due to inbreeding, which is the equivalent of a WHOLE BREED having a gene pool no more diverse than human first cousins (p. 255). This certainly explains some of the health problems we've had with our purebred golden retrievers. I also enjoyed the chapters on what the world is like from a dog's perspective--what emotions they are capable of feeling, what colors they see, how they make use of their heightened sense of smell, how they communicate with other dogs, etc. (Spoiler alert: there is no evidence that dogs can feel jealousy, guilt, pride, or shame. Yelling at your dog for chewing up a shoe while you were away just makes them confused and anxious, enough so that they may begin to associate your return home with anxiety and punishment. They don't have the presence of mind to connect the punishment with having chewed the shoe earlier, much less to feel guilty about it.)This really is a must-read for dog owners. I will keep this information in mind for future dog purchases as I consider breeds, training programs, and the way I interact with my pet."
83,1452652031,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2755825-ellen-broadhurst,5,"Dog Sense is an excellent read for someone interested in a layman's overview of dog behavior and psychology research. Basically offering evidence that refutes the ""dominant down"" sort of dog training (which I find puzzling: are there still people who subscribe to this??), the author offers insights into how dogs differ from wolves, how dogs interact with their environment, how dogs (probably) perceive their care-taker humans, their hearth and home, and how dogs (likely) interact with each other. As a half way intelligent dog owner who has already internalized much of the message Bradshaw is delivering, most of the book was not a revelation. That said, there were golden nuggets that made Dog Sense well worth a read. It is also exactly the sort of book I would give to a non-dog person considering getting a dog. One of the biggest, obvious mistakes people make in getting a ""first dog"" is not taking the time to understand what a dog really is, how they operate and how best to integrate a dog into your household. As someone who had done the research upfront, hired a trainer before getting the dog, and ultimately adopting a nearly-perfect 5 year old dog (who came, super polite, house trained, crate trained, didn't chew, etc), I *still* made some beginner mistakes; books like this aren't going to solve training problems, but it should give readers a broader perspective that helps them think about the 'whole' dog when they are integrating a dog into the household, or trying to problem-solve issues do arise. "
84,1452652031,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1279767-nita,4,"The author's main premise is that as we continue to expect more and more obedience and human-like behavior from our dogs since our world continues to change into one where we have less and less time for them, we must spend more time breeding them to behave as the dogs we want as pets and less time worrying about what they look like. He has very strong opinions about how this should be done. And while I agree with the author that the old dominance-aggression based training methods used by popular dog trainers such as Cesar Millan need to go the way of the dinosaur, the author said it so many times in so many different ways that it got very old quickly. Still, I enjoyed the book and found his insights helpful in thinking about the way I have trained dogs in the past and how I might select and train a pet dog in the future. This is not a training manual, but a scientific study of canine evolution. I found it especially interesting that the dog did not evolve directly from the wolf, but rather more likely from a common ancestor. No wonder dog training methods that use wolf behavior as a foundation for training our highly domesticated pet dogs is so off base! He maintains that the dog's strongest evolutionary trait is to want to please us, but is often confused about how to go about it. It's our job not to punish bad behavior which the dog has likely forgotten as soon as we've entered the room, but to use positive techniques to teach and breed dogs to be the best companions possible."
85,1452652031,http://goodreads.com/user/show/975391-steven,3,"Bradshaw looks at dogs and their long interaction with our species, considering this relationship from scratch -- without all the baggage and traditionally-taught notions about what dogs are thinking. It's a good approach, although maybe not what readers might expect.He's upfront with stating that this is NOT a training manual. Rather, he looks at the trends and beliefs that have informed dog trainers, and holds up a mirror of genetics, evolution, and behavioral studies. One of his major goals is to debunk the idea that our modern dogs are just ""little wolves,"" vying for position in a pack, or a indeed, a human household. He points out that most studies of wolf behavior are either based on specifically local populations of modern wolves, or are based on captive groups, neither of which are typical. And in either case, their behavior doesn't have much to do with creatures that split from a common ancestor tens of thousands of years ago.Bradshaw discusses several ideas that I found intriguing, including the fact that dogs seem to be more focused on people than on other dogs, that we often overestimate dogs' ability to process information and their capacity for self-reflection. He also discusses their physiology and how it differs from humans, giving insight into how they see, hear and, of course, smell in very different ways from us. A good book. Quite sciencey, but there's nothing wrong with that. I certainly looked at the canine's I'm in charge of differently while reading this book. So much so, that the next book I plan to read is about dogs and their minds, too."
86,1452652031,http://goodreads.com/user/show/69313297-jina,2,"Honestly, Dr. John Bradshaw irritated me. He disagreed with a lot of the findings discussed in The Genius of Dogs (note that Dog Sense was published 2 years before), but that’s not what irritated me. He goes on and on and on in the first half of his book about why it doesn’t make any sense to look at wolves to understand dog behaviour. Then, in the second to last chapter of his book, he has the nerve to say that humans are ruining the way dogs can communicate with each other the more we breed them to look less like a wolf. Like -wait a minute. If we should not be looking at wolves to understand dog behaviour, why are we looking at how wolves communicate to make a statement that the less dogs look like the wolves, the less expressive their faces are, and, therefore, the less they are able to effectively communicate with their fellow dogs. This hypocrisy annoyed me mostly because of how much Dr. Bradshaw reiterates over and over and over again about how it doesn’t make any sense to compare dogs to wolves. “My view is that the key to understanding the domestic dog is, first and foremost, to understand the domestic dog… By analyzing the dog has its own animal rather than a lesser version of the wolf, we have the opportunity to understand it and refine our dealings with it as never before.” - Evidently, this statement doesn’t apply to how dogs communicate."
87,1452652031,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4689182-ronald,5,"A very well written book representing the evolution of the present day dog from a common ancestor with todays wolf. He points out that dogs did not evolve from the wolf. He postulates how todays canid became domesticated primarily to serve man primarily as a help in sheparding, hunting and other practical purposes. Man began breeding dogs for specific traits which enhanced these skills. Breeds have become increasingly inbred This inbreeding for physical attributes has become problematic to the health of some breed. Breed and show organizations have been the root cause of this problem. The role of dogs todays is providing a companion a to its owner more so then for practical work purpose. Some breeds still carry the work traits that they were originally bred. Those original work traits make certain breeds less suitable for companion purposes.Bradshaw speaks to the physical, perceptual and psychological make up of dogs such as their superior scent capability. He offers for consideration ideas of how people and more effectively interface with there dogs for the positive benefit of both.I enjoyed reading this book since I have had dogs since I was a young lad. I wish that I new then what I have learned now."
88,1452652031,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5041758-heather-hunter,3,"I was pretty intrigued by this title though I passed it over a few times initially at my local library before picking it up. (I'm always looking for ways to be a better friend to my pets.) Although portions of it, mainly on the evolutionary history of dogs, were interesting, I probably should have followed my gut on this one. I kept finding myself literally falling asleep after a few pages and, by a few weeks in, had only made it halfway through. Perhaps the second half is better, but I just couldn't bear it anymore and had to turn to something else. Parts of the theory on the behavior of domestic dogs as it relates to that of wolves was particularly confusing, in as much as the author states many times that the two should not be compared due to many distinct differences and, yet, continues to do so himself. I was kind of left feeling much like I do about politics- that comparisons were being made only when it was useful to support this point of view.I may try again someday since I can borrow it for free, but I think on this one I'd have to say I'd rather go with MY instincts about how to interact with my dogs."
89,1452652031,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4534004-chel,5,"This is not a how-to book for a dog owner. It's more of a book about how to evaluate all the other how-to books. Bradshaw looks at what researchers have learned about the evolution of domestic dogs; how they are and are not like their nearest relative, the wolf; what we know about how their senses perceive, how they learn, their intelligence, their emotions, and what the breeding of specific strains has meant for the wellbeing of dogs today. At times it's a little difficult to figure out who he is writing for -- the reading is a little heavy in places for the recreational reader, offering what seems to be a full literature review out of all the various studies, frequently noting what we don't know, as well as what we do know. But I imagine he is defending himself from criticisms of his conclusions from people who would cite the studies he did not.I most appreciated his strong refutation of the idea that the dog's world must have an ""alpha"" character, a boss, and if humans don't take pains to assume that role, then the dog will. Good riddance to that way of thinking -- now I am going to go play tug-of-war with my dog!"

96,1452652031,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6052204-tracey,4,"In Dog Sense: How the New Science of Dog Behavior Can Make You a Better Friend to Your Pet, Bradshaw includes scads of information about wolves, about the evolution of the dog from the wolf and into a relationship with human society, about modern scientific studies on dog behavior, and about modern dog breeding and in-breeding, etc. He also discusses the human/dog bond, common errors humans make in understanding their dogs, and some comparisons between our species. Bradshaw launches his book with an engaging preface, describing two of the dogs of his childhood, Ginger and Alexis, the first of which he knew only from family legends that outlasted her. It's a great start, but much of the book relies on a stiffer and more formal voice, perhaps due to the scientific nature of the content.Some of what Bradshaw includes in his book is also in Mark Derr's book, How the Dog Became the Dog: From Wolves to Our Best Friends-- a book I liked less well than Bradshaw's. A few of the studies cited have also aired in PBS or National Geographic shows. For example, those showing that dogs outperform chimpanzees in some tasks, including: interpretation of human facial expressions, responsiveness to human pointing, and the ability to use humans as resources when attempting to get to a desired object, such as a tasty bit of food. There's also the Siberian fox domestication experiment.But much in this book is new, to me anyway. And when Bradshaw gets on a roll, his writing can be lively and pleasurable, spotted here and there with the kind of facts and ideas that one wants to read out loud to whomever is in earshot. For example, puppies begin to learn their mother's scent while they're still in the womb. Unborn pups gestating within a bitch who's had aniseed in her diet will gravitate to the scent of aniseed after they're born. And cats can hear higher frequencies than dogs. Or how about this?: after watching a scripted interaction between a ""beggar"" person, a ""generous"" person (who gives the beggar food or whatever), and a ""selfish"" person (who turns the beggar away), dogs prefer to interact with the ""generous"" person. Fascinating stuff. However, long passages seem to exist for the purpose of refuting those who disagree with ""the new science."" These parts are less accessible, come across as argumentative, and are repetitive, too. For example, it seems that Chapters 1 through 3 could have been shortened considerably, in part by moving some of the more involved material to footnotes, a text box, or an appendix. The writing style and organization of these chapters, and their fit into the whole, also made me wonder if they were pulled from articles he'd previously written. My biggest complaint about the book is that it does not, I think,fully deliver on its subtitle, neither describing ""the new science of dog behavior"" clearly enough nor telling the reader how to apply this science to be ""a better friend"" to one's pet. (One exception is an excerpt giving instructions on how to a dog of separation anxiety.) The book does explain, repeatedly, what the new science is not: it is not the old science of seeing dogs as wolves in disguise, ambitious to gain alpha status in the household. It is not about owners claiming the alpha role and keeping the dog in its beta, or omega, place. And it does not employ physical punishment.But Dog Sense contains a lot of interesting material, is well written (if not always consistently accessible), and its author is a pleasant enough chap to spend time with --- humane, intelligent, sensible, compassionate. Knowledgeable, of course. If the reader has a little patience, this book may vastly enrich how you see the world of dogs."

I have done my best to review this book on it's own merits, and not based on my own personal bias.And.. it reminds me of listening to one of my relatives. You know the type: he's armed with a couple of real concrete scientific facts and then scrapes those along to cover his own opinions. By repeating himself several times, he thinks you will be too stupid to figure out that everything he says (minus the actual science) is really just his own opinion dressed up with scientific jargon. But the author's repetitions of ""we can assume"", ""it's obvious that"", and ""we can suppose"" were a dead giveaway to how much of this was just his own views. Rather disappointing from a biologist. This book, imho, has the nearly identical issues as The Wolf in the Parlor: The Eternal Connection between Humans and Dogs: too little actual data to cover the author's premise, and therefore the claims are all questionable. Mr. Bradshaw did, however, avoid the pitfall of describing his own dogs as his main proof. Unfortunately he made another mistake: getting on a soapbox about a popular dog trainer. It became a bit much, honestly, and came across as a bitch-fest instead of an intellectual discourse.It isn't that I think this book was entirely wrong or that I got nothing out of it. I did find the discussion on purebred dogs and having dogs bred specifically for the pet market interesting (. I found some of his dog science interesting, even if I didn't agree with his conclusions. I laughed out loud when he mentioned 'pee-mail'. I enjoyed his comments on how dogs see the world (even if I think most dog owners are aware how important smell is to our dogs), and did think this was relatively easy to listen to- the writing flowed smoothly and the sentence structure was never boring despite the scientific words. The studies he includes on puppies do give us insight into how dogs bond with humans, and there were a number of other studies included that I found interesting as well. The idea that temperament testing of puppies really tells us very little about grown dogs was new to me, and I will read more on that subject (as I have always put a lot of faith in this for choosing puppies).I do suggest this author Never Ever Ever write about domestic cats again. Ever. He clearly hasn't lived with or observed cats at all, and cats are a crappy example for what he was trying to prove. As always, this is only my own opinion. Clearly other readers were far more impressed than I was, and I invite you to read this book and form your own thoughts. Note: this is NOT a dog training manual. With the exception of a bit about helping dog separation anxiety (which he calls separation distress, for his own reasons that were a bit unclear to me), there is no training advice here. I'm not sure he really took much of a stand on what sort of training was best (other than that he hates dominance theory). "

102,1452652031,http://goodreads.com/user/show/24179583-evan,4,"I enjoyed this book and found the information helpful. The author speaks to how the environment for dogs has changed with our urbanization and higher expectations that dogs must be under their owners control at all times. Also dogs are used less and less as workers and more and more as companions. The most responsible dog owners usually neuter their pets so these companion dogs do not get to pass on their genetics. It is the working dogs, the show dogs, and the dogs of irresponsible owners who are most likely to pass on their genes. Dogs are not wolves and they are not little people. They have a strong urge to bond to people. They live in the moment. Except in rare cases physical punishment of a dog is counterproductive as it creates a less trusting, less bonded, more anxious animal. If punishment is used it must be immediate. The dog cannot understand being punished for something in the past. Reward based training generates a happy, trusting animal. Dogs naturally wish to please. Most of their negative behavior is the result of fear, not an urge to dominate. When selecting a companion dog stay away from the most popular and thus inbred breeds where genetic weaknesses are concentrated. The first eight weeks of the puppy’s life is very important in determining its personality. Look for a puppy who has been raised in a home and who has had a variety of experiences. A puppy who has lived isolated in a kennel or backroom somewhere is likely to be fearful and maladjusted. Taking a young dog to obedience training class exposes the dog to other dogs and people as well as teaching it important commands. Much of this information is commonsense, but I appreciate the reinforcement. The book could have shorter. As others have pointed out there was considerable repetition. The information that was repeated was important information so I did not find it overly annoying. Having dog companions for most of my life and having trained several of them in obedience and agility I can attest to the value of reward based training versus punishment based. Dogs just become fearful when they are hurt. Eventually a fearful dog may become aggressive out of self-defense. The author explains what dogs are capable of understanding. It is unfair to hold an animal responsible for something that is beyond its capability to comprehend. "
103,1452652031,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1356959-h-w,3,A mix of the author's conclusions regarding particular scientific studies on dogs mixed with his personal impressions of what makes dogs tick. It would have been nice if he had more actual animal training experience (like animal behaviorists Karen Pryor or Patricia McConnell) that would have given his ideas more credibility. I think the positive take away from this book is that you need to think critically about the things you've heard and assumed to be true about dog behavior since much of the conventional information out there is likely to be wrong.
104,1452652031,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5438598-don,5,"I enjoyed this book VERY much and highly recommend it to anyone who lives with a dog and wants to understand more of what's going on in their furry little heads. Understanding more of what dogs think and experience can only make your life with them better.Strangely, there are elements in this book which also apply to how we relate to our fellow humans. One huge theme in this book is rethinking the idea that we should treat dog ownership into a constant reassertion of our dominance because dogs inherit the drive for dominance from wolves. As it turns out, dogs left on their own form familial units, not rigid hierarchies. And wolves in the wild also form familial groups, unlike the stressed groups of unrelated wolves observed in captivity. So constantly browbeating your dog is only going to turn a potential loving family member into a stressed out roommate.Why does this apply to humans? Because we have also allowed ourselves to buy into the old dominance model ""wolf pack"" for human interactions. From the workplace and it's obsessively ""alpha"" managers to our interactions with government ""public servants"", we have gotten locked into a pathological system where we are increasingly told what to do and to shut up about what we really think. This is a situation in dire need of rethinking. But back to the book...Dogs are creatures who have been co-evolving with the human race for tens of thousands of years and are one of the few creatures capable of forming stronger bonds to another species than to their own.But if you have a dog around, you also need to understand how it thinks. While amazingly capable of predicting what humans they know are going to do, dogs do NOT have the capability to understandthe consequences of their actions. A crucial example offered is the dog with separation anxiety, who only knows that sometimes when his owner comes back, the owner gets REALLY angry...so he gets increasingly stressed and chews something to bits. And then the owner gets angry...Dogs love us and chances are, if you are thinking about reading this book, you love them too. I recommend this book as a tool to help make that relationship as good as it can possibly be."
105,1452652031,http://goodreads.com/user/show/21256356-jocelyn,4,"I was going to give this book three stars but in the end decided not to. It's hard to find dog behavior books that are based objectively off of scientific evidence, and Dog Sense came close.Now, I say ""close"" because an incident early on in my reading undermined a lot of the confidence I had in the author's sources--in chapter 3 (p.92 in my version), after spending a while bashing some rather well-known trainers' techniques, Bradshaw gives an example list of ""commandments"" that people of those training methods allegedly must follow.This list contains ridiculous elements such as ""Do not cuddle or stroke your dog"" and ""Do not allow your dog to climb your stairs,"" and eventually I decided to just check the source that it came from. It turns out that the list is idealized to portray the most exaggerated of those trainers' tenets and was written by a critic of the method in question; obviously the reader is not told about this in the text and show quite clearly that Bradshaw is extremely biased and in this case at least has cherry-picked his ""cases.""So I will say, be wary of the sources he cites, since they might be chosen out of fields of other data just to better prove his point. Nevertheless, everything else that I checked after that seemed to be on-target, and his points about dog psychology are valid. This was one of the more scientifically well-founded dog books that I've read, and as such was in some ways more enlightening than, say, a dog-raising manual or a book on methods of training.Dog Sense doesn't really impart any great knowledge about training techniques but only about how dogs might think and why they act the way they do. It talks about the origins of common problems in dogs (separation anxiety is a big one) but doesn't go into any depth about how to solve the problems, but that's acceptable since it never advertised that it would provide any solutions and since there are so many other great sources on the subject.Overall, it's mostly just an educational read with little practical importance. I enjoyed it despite my wariness after that sketchy-source incident."
106,1452652031,http://goodreads.com/user/show/399070-nick,3,"Dog Sense provides a valuable survey of what scientists currently know about dogs, and it illustrates how far behind lags the practice of owning and training dogs. For example, the first misconception that Bradshaw attacks is the characterization of dogs as essentially wolves always striving to achieve alpha status. Modern research into wolf packs in the wild – not those fabricated by captivity – reveals a social structure recognizable as a family unit, with younger wolves deferring naturally to their parents, not to the strongest and most dominant. And Bradshaw argues convincingly that dogs have come a long way from their wolf ancestors.Bradshaw is first and foremost a scientist. His book makes for disappointingly dry reading, as he earnestly attempts to present the facts and describe the methodology and results of individual experiments. Yet he clearly cares deeply about the welfare of dogs: his outrage at the ignorant mistreatment of dogs is palpable. When science cannot conclusively show whether dogs experience emotions as humans do, he makes a leap of faith, seeing no reason to deny that dogs experience something we would recognize as love.Despite the book's title, Bradshaw's focus is on enlightening readers about dogs as a species. Only in passing does he occasionally instruct readers on how to be better dog owners. His book would be most valuable to those who assume wrongly that dogs must be forced to submit, or that dogs always understand why you punish them, or that dogs perceive the world in basically the same way that we do.Like those scientists who are trying to convince people that yes, global warming is real and a real problem, Bradshaw's main goal is to raise awareness. But although many of the challenges facing dogs are societal, such as the growing expectations of canine discipline in urban areas, and the ongoing efforts of breeders to optimize for (brittle) appearances instead of suitability for companionship, this eye-opening book can revolutionize how you understand your dog. The rest is up to you."
107,1452652031,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7566522-ray-campbell,4,"I love dogs, thus my review of any discussion may be skewed - sorry. Bradshaw begins with a study of the origins of dogs which was nothing new, though fun to read again. The one point he makes on origins which I liked, and he builds on later in the book, is that while dogs are 99% genetically wolves, they are not wolves. The animal, which was a now extincted breed of grey wolf, has evolved into modern dogs and no longer exists as a unique animal. Thus, we can not understand dogs by studying wolves anymore than we can understand humans by studying chimps, though we share ancestors and are 99% genetically similar... dogs are dogs.The middle part of the book is a look at doggy psychology which is lots of fun. Bradshaw explores the research on training effectiveness, the emotional lives of our beloved fuzzy friends and the general benefits of positive versus negative training practices. I picked up some useful tips, but it mostly reinforced ideas I embrace.The last part of the book is commentary. Bradshaw becomes activist in his reflection on the purposes of breeding and the resulting dogs, the dangers and benefits of the various practices. As he explains problems and mismatches, he becomes increasingly passionate about issues with over-breeding, puppy-mills and his vision of the best direction we can take for the sake of dogs and the happiness of our lives with them.Lots of great insight and lots of fun while clearly based on solid research. This is not a ""how-to"" book. This is a look at our friends and an exploration of how they think and how we might use current research to understand them and make decisions about them. If you love dogs, you'll love this book. If you are having issues, you might find a helpful insight. If you are looking for step by step instructions or a study of a specific breed - not here. I liked this book and would like to recommend it, though I hope I've been clear on what it is. Woof."
108,1452652031,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1713788-sarah,4,"This book is a sort of guide to better understanding dogs. It made me appreciate my favorite animal even more.Bradshaw's take on dogs' social, emotional, and physical lives is based on an evolutionary perspective. He points out that many popular ideas on training and dealing with dogs are based on bad logic. We look to a not-directly-related specie of captive wolf to understand how our dogs, who have been selectively bred for thousands of years for life among humans, behave. I think Bradshaw's angle of looking at how and why humans have domesticated and bred dogs gives a much more realistic, useful interpretation.This book made me understand why dogs are ""man's best friend"". We are both social creatures who evolved in cooperative groups, not just domination hierarchies. We are well-adapted to learn and read each others' body language and to take pleasure in interacting with each other.It expanded my understanding of how dogs think, feel, and behave, and made me realize that they interpret and experience the world in very different ways than we do (particularly their sense of smell). So, while it's tempting to anthropomorphize our little buddies and assume that they feel and understand just like us, that's a dangerous assumption that asks too much of dogs.It also raises some concerns about the future of dogs in our society. By breeding for dogs who seek human companionship above any other kind, we are creating dogs prone to separation anxiety. By purchasing dogs based on appearance, we are putting dogs bred for certain kinds of lifestyles (e.g., hunting, herding) in incompatible environments, then wondering why they react negatively.This book was well-written with as much research as he could find to support his claims. Bradshaw obviously appreciates dogs and wants to educate others so we can all appreciate and treat them well."
109,1452652031,http://goodreads.com/user/show/537331-araminta-matthews,3,"I read this book hoping to learn some of my very own human tricks that would allow me to better relate to and interact with my dog. That isn't exactly what I received, though I'm enough of an amateur scientist to have gleaned, connected, and otherwise sussed out of this book what I needed to improve my whippet-rearing tactics (and before you ask, yes, my dog is a rescue; not a store-bought pedigree). This book does a great job laying out science, studies, and general observations of canine history, behavior, and socialization, but it falls short of recommending methods promised by its title that would ""make you a better friend to your pet."" At the same time, there were a few things I found interesting that I'll share. For one, research has found that negative reinforcers produce only 12% obedience rates, whereas positive reinforcers or rewards produce 60% obedience rates, according to Bradshaw. In addition, Bradshaw effectively debunks the notion that dogs experience the human emotion of ""guilt,"" and furthermore, demonstrates clear science to support the idea that Ddgs have a different brand of intelligence to primates (and thus can't be compared to us on emotional scales--they aren't the same). At the same time, he does argue that dogs consistently outperform even chimpanzees at reading human facial expressions, vocal tones, commands, and gestures. I'll leave my review on one note that struck me to the point of necessitating a full quotation. No tears, fellow-dog-moms: p.171: “Dogs really do miss their owners when they are separated from them. Many dogs also seem to become much more emotionally fragile under sudden shocks, such as the noise of fireworks going off. . . they find it difficult to cope without us.” "
110,1452652031,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1161667-shel,4,"While there's nothing earth-shattering here, the book makes an excellent point that in order to relate better to our canine companions we ought to invest more effort in thinking about how they perceive the world.Perhaps that's the most surprising revelation here: how little scientific and purposeful thought we've given to how our dogs friends think and what makes them happy. While, dogs on the other hand, watch and respond sensitively to our every move and mood.The book counters some conventional wisdom and wrong-thinking which has lead to misguided and harmful training techniques i.e. dogs do not behave like wolves. They do not need to be dominated and, in fact, this can cause them anxiety and fear.This book is part of a growing and useful trend toward delving more into the emotional lives of animals, not in the sense of anthropormorphizing, but rather in perceiving the world in the way another species would. Dogs, for example, have a huge olfactory world available to them.It's a helpful point of view. Bradshaw makes a strong case for the need to think about how to access and maximize the potential of the inner world of dogs to help them integrate and be our companions in modern society rather than simply breeding them to look a certain way - often to the detriment of their health and temperament.The book ends on a pessimistic note about the fate of dogs, if their needs are not taken into consideration. As a dog lover, I have to feel more hopeful about the future of dogs. What would we do without them? Loyal dog people will certainly read books like this and speak out to make changes (in training techniques, breeding, welfare) on the dogs' behalf. Won't they?"
111,1452652031,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2716223-julie,5,"This is, by far, one of the best books I've read on dog behavior and training. Bradshaw walks the reader through the previous held theories of wolf behavior and how dog training - based on captive wolf behavior (not wild wolves) can lead humans to train dogs in a manner that is not fair to the true nature of dogs. This book justified many of my gut reactions on my experiences training dogs. I've never been comfortable employing punishment or negative techniques preferring instead to observe the dog and work with the personality that each dog has. Many other trainers, such at Patricia McConnell and Pat Miller, practice positive dog training techniques and I'm a huge fan of their work. Bradshaw, however, adds more context - based on research - around the nature of dogs and their connectivity to humans. The research covers not only the ""lupomorph"" model but also tackles the breeding of dogs and how breeding for looks and not behavior has created dogs with far greater health and behavior problems than ever before. This book is a must read for anyone remotely interested in animal behavior. I'd even say that anyone who has a dog or is thinking of getting a dog should read this as the insight is invaluable as one works with (and even choses) a dog. Bradshaw ends the book with this line: ""Addressing the twin pressures of misguided breeding and poor understanding of canine psychology is crucial to ensuring that dogs remain as significant a part of human life as they have ben for the past ten millennia. My hope is that this book will make some contribution toward that goal."" I believe it has. "
112,1452652031,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1783712-kelly,5,"Absolutely fascinating book. It's a little slow in some parts but seems scientifically sound (in my not-especially-informed opinion) and provides compelling evidence for why looking at modern wolf behavior tells us precious little about domesticated dogs. The science makes a strong case for basing dog training in rewards rather than punishment. The book also covers the major problems caused by breeding for looks rather than companionship traits. The most shocking statistic: pedigree dogs have lost about 40 percent of their genetic variation due to inbreeding, which is the equivalent of a WHOLE BREED having a gene pool no more diverse than human first cousins (p. 255). This certainly explains some of the health problems we've had with our purebred golden retrievers. I also enjoyed the chapters on what the world is like from a dog's perspective--what emotions they are capable of feeling, what colors they see, how they make use of their heightened sense of smell, how they communicate with other dogs, etc. (Spoiler alert: there is no evidence that dogs can feel jealousy, guilt, pride, or shame. Yelling at your dog for chewing up a shoe while you were away just makes them confused and anxious, enough so that they may begin to associate your return home with anxiety and punishment. They don't have the presence of mind to connect the punishment with having chewed the shoe earlier, much less to feel guilty about it.)This really is a must-read for dog owners. I will keep this information in mind for future dog purchases as I consider breeds, training programs, and the way I interact with my pet."
113,1452652031,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2755825-ellen-broadhurst,5,"Dog Sense is an excellent read for someone interested in a layman's overview of dog behavior and psychology research. Basically offering evidence that refutes the ""dominant down"" sort of dog training (which I find puzzling: are there still people who subscribe to this??), the author offers insights into how dogs differ from wolves, how dogs interact with their environment, how dogs (probably) perceive their care-taker humans, their hearth and home, and how dogs (likely) interact with each other. As a half way intelligent dog owner who has already internalized much of the message Bradshaw is delivering, most of the book was not a revelation. That said, there were golden nuggets that made Dog Sense well worth a read. It is also exactly the sort of book I would give to a non-dog person considering getting a dog. One of the biggest, obvious mistakes people make in getting a ""first dog"" is not taking the time to understand what a dog really is, how they operate and how best to integrate a dog into your household. As someone who had done the research upfront, hired a trainer before getting the dog, and ultimately adopting a nearly-perfect 5 year old dog (who came, super polite, house trained, crate trained, didn't chew, etc), I *still* made some beginner mistakes; books like this aren't going to solve training problems, but it should give readers a broader perspective that helps them think about the 'whole' dog when they are integrating a dog into the household, or trying to problem-solve issues do arise. "
114,1452652031,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1279767-nita,4,"The author's main premise is that as we continue to expect more and more obedience and human-like behavior from our dogs since our world continues to change into one where we have less and less time for them, we must spend more time breeding them to behave as the dogs we want as pets and less time worrying about what they look like. He has very strong opinions about how this should be done. And while I agree with the author that the old dominance-aggression based training methods used by popular dog trainers such as Cesar Millan need to go the way of the dinosaur, the author said it so many times in so many different ways that it got very old quickly. Still, I enjoyed the book and found his insights helpful in thinking about the way I have trained dogs in the past and how I might select and train a pet dog in the future. This is not a training manual, but a scientific study of canine evolution. I found it especially interesting that the dog did not evolve directly from the wolf, but rather more likely from a common ancestor. No wonder dog training methods that use wolf behavior as a foundation for training our highly domesticated pet dogs is so off base! He maintains that the dog's strongest evolutionary trait is to want to please us, but is often confused about how to go about it. It's our job not to punish bad behavior which the dog has likely forgotten as soon as we've entered the room, but to use positive techniques to teach and breed dogs to be the best companions possible."
115,1452652031,http://goodreads.com/user/show/975391-steven,3,"Bradshaw looks at dogs and their long interaction with our species, considering this relationship from scratch -- without all the baggage and traditionally-taught notions about what dogs are thinking. It's a good approach, although maybe not what readers might expect.He's upfront with stating that this is NOT a training manual. Rather, he looks at the trends and beliefs that have informed dog trainers, and holds up a mirror of genetics, evolution, and behavioral studies. One of his major goals is to debunk the idea that our modern dogs are just ""little wolves,"" vying for position in a pack, or a indeed, a human household. He points out that most studies of wolf behavior are either based on specifically local populations of modern wolves, or are based on captive groups, neither of which are typical. And in either case, their behavior doesn't have much to do with creatures that split from a common ancestor tens of thousands of years ago.Bradshaw discusses several ideas that I found intriguing, including the fact that dogs seem to be more focused on people than on other dogs, that we often overestimate dogs' ability to process information and their capacity for self-reflection. He also discusses their physiology and how it differs from humans, giving insight into how they see, hear and, of course, smell in very different ways from us. A good book. Quite sciencey, but there's nothing wrong with that. I certainly looked at the canine's I'm in charge of differently while reading this book. So much so, that the next book I plan to read is about dogs and their minds, too."
116,1452652031,http://goodreads.com/user/show/69313297-jina,2,"Honestly, Dr. John Bradshaw irritated me. He disagreed with a lot of the findings discussed in The Genius of Dogs (note that Dog Sense was published 2 years before), but that’s not what irritated me. He goes on and on and on in the first half of his book about why it doesn’t make any sense to look at wolves to understand dog behaviour. Then, in the second to last chapter of his book, he has the nerve to say that humans are ruining the way dogs can communicate with each other the more we breed them to look less like a wolf. Like -wait a minute. If we should not be looking at wolves to understand dog behaviour, why are we looking at how wolves communicate to make a statement that the less dogs look like the wolves, the less expressive their faces are, and, therefore, the less they are able to effectively communicate with their fellow dogs. This hypocrisy annoyed me mostly because of how much Dr. Bradshaw reiterates over and over and over again about how it doesn’t make any sense to compare dogs to wolves. “My view is that the key to understanding the domestic dog is, first and foremost, to understand the domestic dog… By analyzing the dog has its own animal rather than a lesser version of the wolf, we have the opportunity to understand it and refine our dealings with it as never before.” - Evidently, this statement doesn’t apply to how dogs communicate."
117,1452652031,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4689182-ronald,5,"A very well written book representing the evolution of the present day dog from a common ancestor with todays wolf. He points out that dogs did not evolve from the wolf. He postulates how todays canid became domesticated primarily to serve man primarily as a help in sheparding, hunting and other practical purposes. Man began breeding dogs for specific traits which enhanced these skills. Breeds have become increasingly inbred This inbreeding for physical attributes has become problematic to the health of some breed. Breed and show organizations have been the root cause of this problem. The role of dogs todays is providing a companion a to its owner more so then for practical work purpose. Some breeds still carry the work traits that they were originally bred. Those original work traits make certain breeds less suitable for companion purposes.Bradshaw speaks to the physical, perceptual and psychological make up of dogs such as their superior scent capability. He offers for consideration ideas of how people and more effectively interface with there dogs for the positive benefit of both.I enjoyed reading this book since I have had dogs since I was a young lad. I wish that I new then what I have learned now."
118,1452652031,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5041758-heather-hunter,3,"I was pretty intrigued by this title though I passed it over a few times initially at my local library before picking it up. (I'm always looking for ways to be a better friend to my pets.) Although portions of it, mainly on the evolutionary history of dogs, were interesting, I probably should have followed my gut on this one. I kept finding myself literally falling asleep after a few pages and, by a few weeks in, had only made it halfway through. Perhaps the second half is better, but I just couldn't bear it anymore and had to turn to something else. Parts of the theory on the behavior of domestic dogs as it relates to that of wolves was particularly confusing, in as much as the author states many times that the two should not be compared due to many distinct differences and, yet, continues to do so himself. I was kind of left feeling much like I do about politics- that comparisons were being made only when it was useful to support this point of view.I may try again someday since I can borrow it for free, but I think on this one I'd have to say I'd rather go with MY instincts about how to interact with my dogs."
119,1452652031,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4534004-chel,5,"This is not a how-to book for a dog owner. It's more of a book about how to evaluate all the other how-to books. Bradshaw looks at what researchers have learned about the evolution of domestic dogs; how they are and are not like their nearest relative, the wolf; what we know about how their senses perceive, how they learn, their intelligence, their emotions, and what the breeding of specific strains has meant for the wellbeing of dogs today. At times it's a little difficult to figure out who he is writing for -- the reading is a little heavy in places for the recreational reader, offering what seems to be a full literature review out of all the various studies, frequently noting what we don't know, as well as what we do know. But I imagine he is defending himself from criticisms of his conclusions from people who would cite the studies he did not.I most appreciated his strong refutation of the idea that the dog's world must have an ""alpha"" character, a boss, and if humans don't take pains to assume that role, then the dog will. Good riddance to that way of thinking -- now I am going to go play tug-of-war with my dog!"
120,1452652031,http://goodreads.com/user/show/923535-greg-pettit,3,"Very enjoyable, although the author had a tendency to repeat some points over and over again, such as ""Dogs are not Wolves"" and ""Dogs are not People."" Both points formed touchstones for arguments against a lot of currently accepted thought about dog behavior. There were a lot of informative takeaways from the book, without it getting to dense or technical."

125,1452652031,http://goodreads.com/user/show/87988275-ema-phillips,3,"Incredibly similar to John's other book ""In Defense of Dogs"", not worth reading both in my opinion as they're almost identical in content. Read one or the other not both."
126,1452652031,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6052204-tracey,4,"In Dog Sense: How the New Science of Dog Behavior Can Make You a Better Friend to Your Pet, Bradshaw includes scads of information about wolves, about the evolution of the dog from the wolf and into a relationship with human society, about modern scientific studies on dog behavior, and about modern dog breeding and in-breeding, etc. He also discusses the human/dog bond, common errors humans make in understanding their dogs, and some comparisons between our species. Bradshaw launches his book with an engaging preface, describing two of the dogs of his childhood, Ginger and Alexis, the first of which he knew only from family legends that outlasted her. It's a great start, but much of the book relies on a stiffer and more formal voice, perhaps due to the scientific nature of the content.Some of what Bradshaw includes in his book is also in Mark Derr's book, How the Dog Became the Dog: From Wolves to Our Best Friends-- a book I liked less well than Bradshaw's. A few of the studies cited have also aired in PBS or National Geographic shows. For example, those showing that dogs outperform chimpanzees in some tasks, including: interpretation of human facial expressions, responsiveness to human pointing, and the ability to use humans as resources when attempting to get to a desired object, such as a tasty bit of food. There's also the Siberian fox domestication experiment.But much in this book is new, to me anyway. And when Bradshaw gets on a roll, his writing can be lively and pleasurable, spotted here and there with the kind of facts and ideas that one wants to read out loud to whomever is in earshot. For example, puppies begin to learn their mother's scent while they're still in the womb. Unborn pups gestating within a bitch who's had aniseed in her diet will gravitate to the scent of aniseed after they're born. And cats can hear higher frequencies than dogs. Or how about this?: after watching a scripted interaction between a ""beggar"" person, a ""generous"" person (who gives the beggar food or whatever), and a ""selfish"" person (who turns the beggar away), dogs prefer to interact with the ""generous"" person. Fascinating stuff. However, long passages seem to exist for the purpose of refuting those who disagree with ""the new science."" These parts are less accessible, come across as argumentative, and are repetitive, too. For example, it seems that Chapters 1 through 3 could have been shortened considerably, in part by moving some of the more involved material to footnotes, a text box, or an appendix. The writing style and organization of these chapters, and their fit into the whole, also made me wonder if they were pulled from articles he'd previously written. My biggest complaint about the book is that it does not, I think,fully deliver on its subtitle, neither describing ""the new science of dog behavior"" clearly enough nor telling the reader how to apply this science to be ""a better friend"" to one's pet. (One exception is an excerpt giving instructions on how to a dog of separation anxiety.) The book does explain, repeatedly, what the new science is not: it is not the old science of seeing dogs as wolves in disguise, ambitious to gain alpha status in the household. It is not about owners claiming the alpha role and keeping the dog in its beta, or omega, place. And it does not employ physical punishment.But Dog Sense contains a lot of interesting material, is well written (if not always consistently accessible), and its author is a pleasant enough chap to spend time with --- humane, intelligent, sensible, compassionate. Knowledgeable, of course. If the reader has a little patience, this book may vastly enrich how you see the world of dogs."
127,1452652031,http://goodreads.com/user/show/9003269-meghan,3,"Although I knew, going in, that this book contradicts what I personally feel about dogs, I strive to keep my eyes and ears open and was willing to give this book a shot. I have done my best to review this book on it's own merits, and not based on my own personal bias.And.. it reminds me of listening to one of my relatives. You know the type: he's armed with a couple of real concrete scientific facts and then scrapes those along to cover his own opinions. By repeating himself several times, he thinks you will be too stupid to figure out that everything he says (minus the actual science) is really just his own opinion dressed up with scientific jargon. But the author's repetitions of ""we can assume"", ""it's obvious that"", and ""we can suppose"" were a dead giveaway to how much of this was just his own views. Rather disappointing from a biologist. This book, imho, has the nearly identical issues as The Wolf in the Parlor: The Eternal Connection between Humans and Dogs: too little actual data to cover the author's premise, and therefore the claims are all questionable. Mr. Bradshaw did, however, avoid the pitfall of describing his own dogs as his main proof. Unfortunately he made another mistake: getting on a soapbox about a popular dog trainer. It became a bit much, honestly, and came across as a bitch-fest instead of an intellectual discourse.It isn't that I think this book was entirely wrong or that I got nothing out of it. I did find the discussion on purebred dogs and having dogs bred specifically for the pet market interesting (. I found some of his dog science interesting, even if I didn't agree with his conclusions. I laughed out loud when he mentioned 'pee-mail'. I enjoyed his comments on how dogs see the world (even if I think most dog owners are aware how important smell is to our dogs), and did think this was relatively easy to listen to- the writing flowed smoothly and the sentence structure was never boring despite the scientific words. The studies he includes on puppies do give us insight into how dogs bond with humans, and there were a number of other studies included that I found interesting as well. The idea that temperament testing of puppies really tells us very little about grown dogs was new to me, and I will read more on that subject (as I have always put a lot of faith in this for choosing puppies).I do suggest this author Never Ever Ever write about domestic cats again. Ever. He clearly hasn't lived with or observed cats at all, and cats are a crappy example for what he was trying to prove. As always, this is only my own opinion. Clearly other readers were far more impressed than I was, and I invite you to read this book and form your own thoughts. Note: this is NOT a dog training manual. With the exception of a bit about helping dog separation anxiety (which he calls separation distress, for his own reasons that were a bit unclear to me), there is no training advice here. I'm not sure he really took much of a stand on what sort of training was best (other than that he hates dominance theory). "
128,1452652031,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6757279-marley,3,"DNF - I found it pretty boring and slow. I thought it would really give me insight to my dog but I felt like it was WAAAY more about history, genetics, etc."

132,1452652031,http://goodreads.com/user/show/24179583-evan,4,"I enjoyed this book and found the information helpful. The author speaks to how the environment for dogs has changed with our urbanization and higher expectations that dogs must be under their owners control at all times. Also dogs are used less and less as workers and more and more as companions. The most responsible dog owners usually neuter their pets so these companion dogs do not get to pass on their genetics. It is the working dogs, the show dogs, and the dogs of irresponsible owners who are most likely to pass on their genes. Dogs are not wolves and they are not little people. They have a strong urge to bond to people. They live in the moment. Except in rare cases physical punishment of a dog is counterproductive as it creates a less trusting, less bonded, more anxious animal. If punishment is used it must be immediate. The dog cannot understand being punished for something in the past. Reward based training generates a happy, trusting animal. Dogs naturally wish to please. Most of their negative behavior is the result of fear, not an urge to dominate. When selecting a companion dog stay away from the most popular and thus inbred breeds where genetic weaknesses are concentrated. The first eight weeks of the puppy’s life is very important in determining its personality. Look for a puppy who has been raised in a home and who has had a variety of experiences. A puppy who has lived isolated in a kennel or backroom somewhere is likely to be fearful and maladjusted. Taking a young dog to obedience training class exposes the dog to other dogs and people as well as teaching it important commands. Much of this information is commonsense, but I appreciate the reinforcement. The book could have shorter. As others have pointed out there was considerable repetition. The information that was repeated was important information so I did not find it overly annoying. Having dog companions for most of my life and having trained several of them in obedience and agility I can attest to the value of reward based training versus punishment based. Dogs just become fearful when they are hurt. Eventually a fearful dog may become aggressive out of self-defense. The author explains what dogs are capable of understanding. It is unfair to hold an animal responsible for something that is beyond its capability to comprehend. "
133,1452652031,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1356959-h-w,3,A mix of the author's conclusions regarding particular scientific studies on dogs mixed with his personal impressions of what makes dogs tick. It would have been nice if he had more actual animal training experience (like animal behaviorists Karen Pryor or Patricia McConnell) that would have given his ideas more credibility. I think the positive take away from this book is that you need to think critically about the things you've heard and assumed to be true about dog behavior since much of the conventional information out there is likely to be wrong.
134,1452652031,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5438598-don,5,"I enjoyed this book VERY much and highly recommend it to anyone who lives with a dog and wants to understand more of what's going on in their furry little heads. Understanding more of what dogs think and experience can only make your life with them better.Strangely, there are elements in this book which also apply to how we relate to our fellow humans. One huge theme in this book is rethinking the idea that we should treat dog ownership into a constant reassertion of our dominance because dogs inherit the drive for dominance from wolves. As it turns out, dogs left on their own form familial units, not rigid hierarchies. And wolves in the wild also form familial groups, unlike the stressed groups of unrelated wolves observed in captivity. So constantly browbeating your dog is only going to turn a potential loving family member into a stressed out roommate.Why does this apply to humans? Because we have also allowed ourselves to buy into the old dominance model ""wolf pack"" for human interactions. From the workplace and it's obsessively ""alpha"" managers to our interactions with government ""public servants"", we have gotten locked into a pathological system where we are increasingly told what to do and to shut up about what we really think. This is a situation in dire need of rethinking. But back to the book...Dogs are creatures who have been co-evolving with the human race for tens of thousands of years and are one of the few creatures capable of forming stronger bonds to another species than to their own.But if you have a dog around, you also need to understand how it thinks. While amazingly capable of predicting what humans they know are going to do, dogs do NOT have the capability to understandthe consequences of their actions. A crucial example offered is the dog with separation anxiety, who only knows that sometimes when his owner comes back, the owner gets REALLY angry...so he gets increasingly stressed and chews something to bits. And then the owner gets angry...Dogs love us and chances are, if you are thinking about reading this book, you love them too. I recommend this book as a tool to help make that relationship as good as it can possibly be."
135,1452652031,http://goodreads.com/user/show/21256356-jocelyn,4,"I was going to give this book three stars but in the end decided not to. It's hard to find dog behavior books that are based objectively off of scientific evidence, and Dog Sense came close.Now, I say ""close"" because an incident early on in my reading undermined a lot of the confidence I had in the author's sources--in chapter 3 (p.92 in my version), after spending a while bashing some rather well-known trainers' techniques, Bradshaw gives an example list of ""commandments"" that people of those training methods allegedly must follow.This list contains ridiculous elements such as ""Do not cuddle or stroke your dog"" and ""Do not allow your dog to climb your stairs,"" and eventually I decided to just check the source that it came from. It turns out that the list is idealized to portray the most exaggerated of those trainers' tenets and was written by a critic of the method in question; obviously the reader is not told about this in the text and show quite clearly that Bradshaw is extremely biased and in this case at least has cherry-picked his ""cases.""So I will say, be wary of the sources he cites, since they might be chosen out of fields of other data just to better prove his point. Nevertheless, everything else that I checked after that seemed to be on-target, and his points about dog psychology are valid. This was one of the more scientifically well-founded dog books that I've read, and as such was in some ways more enlightening than, say, a dog-raising manual or a book on methods of training.Dog Sense doesn't really impart any great knowledge about training techniques but only about how dogs might think and why they act the way they do. It talks about the origins of common problems in dogs (separation anxiety is a big one) but doesn't go into any depth about how to solve the problems, but that's acceptable since it never advertised that it would provide any solutions and since there are so many other great sources on the subject.Overall, it's mostly just an educational read with little practical importance. I enjoyed it despite my wariness after that sketchy-source incident."
136,1452652031,http://goodreads.com/user/show/399070-nick,3,"Dog Sense provides a valuable survey of what scientists currently know about dogs, and it illustrates how far behind lags the practice of owning and training dogs. For example, the first misconception that Bradshaw attacks is the characterization of dogs as essentially wolves always striving to achieve alpha status. Modern research into wolf packs in the wild – not those fabricated by captivity – reveals a social structure recognizable as a family unit, with younger wolves deferring naturally to their parents, not to the strongest and most dominant. And Bradshaw argues convincingly that dogs have come a long way from their wolf ancestors.Bradshaw is first and foremost a scientist. His book makes for disappointingly dry reading, as he earnestly attempts to present the facts and describe the methodology and results of individual experiments. Yet he clearly cares deeply about the welfare of dogs: his outrage at the ignorant mistreatment of dogs is palpable. When science cannot conclusively show whether dogs experience emotions as humans do, he makes a leap of faith, seeing no reason to deny that dogs experience something we would recognize as love.Despite the book's title, Bradshaw's focus is on enlightening readers about dogs as a species. Only in passing does he occasionally instruct readers on how to be better dog owners. His book would be most valuable to those who assume wrongly that dogs must be forced to submit, or that dogs always understand why you punish them, or that dogs perceive the world in basically the same way that we do.Like those scientists who are trying to convince people that yes, global warming is real and a real problem, Bradshaw's main goal is to raise awareness. But although many of the challenges facing dogs are societal, such as the growing expectations of canine discipline in urban areas, and the ongoing efforts of breeders to optimize for (brittle) appearances instead of suitability for companionship, this eye-opening book can revolutionize how you understand your dog. The rest is up to you."
137,1452652031,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7566522-ray-campbell,4,"I love dogs, thus my review of any discussion may be skewed - sorry. Bradshaw begins with a study of the origins of dogs which was nothing new, though fun to read again. The one point he makes on origins which I liked, and he builds on later in the book, is that while dogs are 99% genetically wolves, they are not wolves. The animal, which was a now extincted breed of grey wolf, has evolved into modern dogs and no longer exists as a unique animal. Thus, we can not understand dogs by studying wolves anymore than we can understand humans by studying chimps, though we share ancestors and are 99% genetically similar... dogs are dogs.The middle part of the book is a look at doggy psychology which is lots of fun. Bradshaw explores the research on training effectiveness, the emotional lives of our beloved fuzzy friends and the general benefits of positive versus negative training practices. I picked up some useful tips, but it mostly reinforced ideas I embrace.The last part of the book is commentary. Bradshaw becomes activist in his reflection on the purposes of breeding and the resulting dogs, the dangers and benefits of the various practices. As he explains problems and mismatches, he becomes increasingly passionate about issues with over-breeding, puppy-mills and his vision of the best direction we can take for the sake of dogs and the happiness of our lives with them.Lots of great insight and lots of fun while clearly based on solid research. This is not a ""how-to"" book. This is a look at our friends and an exploration of how they think and how we might use current research to understand them and make decisions about them. If you love dogs, you'll love this book. If you are having issues, you might find a helpful insight. If you are looking for step by step instructions or a study of a specific breed - not here. I liked this book and would like to recommend it, though I hope I've been clear on what it is. Woof."
138,1452652031,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1713788-sarah,4,"This book is a sort of guide to better understanding dogs. It made me appreciate my favorite animal even more.Bradshaw's take on dogs' social, emotional, and physical lives is based on an evolutionary perspective. He points out that many popular ideas on training and dealing with dogs are based on bad logic. We look to a not-directly-related specie of captive wolf to understand how our dogs, who have been selectively bred for thousands of years for life among humans, behave. I think Bradshaw's angle of looking at how and why humans have domesticated and bred dogs gives a much more realistic, useful interpretation.This book made me understand why dogs are ""man's best friend"". We are both social creatures who evolved in cooperative groups, not just domination hierarchies. We are well-adapted to learn and read each others' body language and to take pleasure in interacting with each other.It expanded my understanding of how dogs think, feel, and behave, and made me realize that they interpret and experience the world in very different ways than we do (particularly their sense of smell). So, while it's tempting to anthropomorphize our little buddies and assume that they feel and understand just like us, that's a dangerous assumption that asks too much of dogs.It also raises some concerns about the future of dogs in our society. By breeding for dogs who seek human companionship above any other kind, we are creating dogs prone to separation anxiety. By purchasing dogs based on appearance, we are putting dogs bred for certain kinds of lifestyles (e.g., hunting, herding) in incompatible environments, then wondering why they react negatively.This book was well-written with as much research as he could find to support his claims. Bradshaw obviously appreciates dogs and wants to educate others so we can all appreciate and treat them well."
139,1452652031,http://goodreads.com/user/show/537331-araminta-matthews,3,"I read this book hoping to learn some of my very own human tricks that would allow me to better relate to and interact with my dog. That isn't exactly what I received, though I'm enough of an amateur scientist to have gleaned, connected, and otherwise sussed out of this book what I needed to improve my whippet-rearing tactics (and before you ask, yes, my dog is a rescue; not a store-bought pedigree). This book does a great job laying out science, studies, and general observations of canine history, behavior, and socialization, but it falls short of recommending methods promised by its title that would ""make you a better friend to your pet."" At the same time, there were a few things I found interesting that I'll share. For one, research has found that negative reinforcers produce only 12% obedience rates, whereas positive reinforcers or rewards produce 60% obedience rates, according to Bradshaw. In addition, Bradshaw effectively debunks the notion that dogs experience the human emotion of ""guilt,"" and furthermore, demonstrates clear science to support the idea that Ddgs have a different brand of intelligence to primates (and thus can't be compared to us on emotional scales--they aren't the same). At the same time, he does argue that dogs consistently outperform even chimpanzees at reading human facial expressions, vocal tones, commands, and gestures. I'll leave my review on one note that struck me to the point of necessitating a full quotation. No tears, fellow-dog-moms: p.171: “Dogs really do miss their owners when they are separated from them. Many dogs also seem to become much more emotionally fragile under sudden shocks, such as the noise of fireworks going off. . . they find it difficult to cope without us.” "
140,1452652031,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1161667-shel,4,"While there's nothing earth-shattering here, the book makes an excellent point that in order to relate better to our canine companions we ought to invest more effort in thinking about how they perceive the world.Perhaps that's the most surprising revelation here: how little scientific and purposeful thought we've given to how our dogs friends think and what makes them happy. While, dogs on the other hand, watch and respond sensitively to our every move and mood.The book counters some conventional wisdom and wrong-thinking which has lead to misguided and harmful training techniques i.e. dogs do not behave like wolves. They do not need to be dominated and, in fact, this can cause them anxiety and fear.This book is part of a growing and useful trend toward delving more into the emotional lives of animals, not in the sense of anthropormorphizing, but rather in perceiving the world in the way another species would. Dogs, for example, have a huge olfactory world available to them.It's a helpful point of view. Bradshaw makes a strong case for the need to think about how to access and maximize the potential of the inner world of dogs to help them integrate and be our companions in modern society rather than simply breeding them to look a certain way - often to the detriment of their health and temperament.The book ends on a pessimistic note about the fate of dogs, if their needs are not taken into consideration. As a dog lover, I have to feel more hopeful about the future of dogs. What would we do without them? Loyal dog people will certainly read books like this and speak out to make changes (in training techniques, breeding, welfare) on the dogs' behalf. Won't they?"
141,1452652031,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2716223-julie,5,"This is, by far, one of the best books I've read on dog behavior and training. Bradshaw walks the reader through the previous held theories of wolf behavior and how dog training - based on captive wolf behavior (not wild wolves) can lead humans to train dogs in a manner that is not fair to the true nature of dogs. This book justified many of my gut reactions on my experiences training dogs. I've never been comfortable employing punishment or negative techniques preferring instead to observe the dog and work with the personality that each dog has. Many other trainers, such at Patricia McConnell and Pat Miller, practice positive dog training techniques and I'm a huge fan of their work. Bradshaw, however, adds more context - based on research - around the nature of dogs and their connectivity to humans. The research covers not only the ""lupomorph"" model but also tackles the breeding of dogs and how breeding for looks and not behavior has created dogs with far greater health and behavior problems than ever before. This book is a must read for anyone remotely interested in animal behavior. I'd even say that anyone who has a dog or is thinking of getting a dog should read this as the insight is invaluable as one works with (and even choses) a dog. Bradshaw ends the book with this line: ""Addressing the twin pressures of misguided breeding and poor understanding of canine psychology is crucial to ensuring that dogs remain as significant a part of human life as they have ben for the past ten millennia. My hope is that this book will make some contribution toward that goal."" I believe it has. "
142,1452652031,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1783712-kelly,5,"Absolutely fascinating book. It's a little slow in some parts but seems scientifically sound (in my not-especially-informed opinion) and provides compelling evidence for why looking at modern wolf behavior tells us precious little about domesticated dogs. The science makes a strong case for basing dog training in rewards rather than punishment. The book also covers the major problems caused by breeding for looks rather than companionship traits. The most shocking statistic: pedigree dogs have lost about 40 percent of their genetic variation due to inbreeding, which is the equivalent of a WHOLE BREED having a gene pool no more diverse than human first cousins (p. 255). This certainly explains some of the health problems we've had with our purebred golden retrievers. I also enjoyed the chapters on what the world is like from a dog's perspective--what emotions they are capable of feeling, what colors they see, how they make use of their heightened sense of smell, how they communicate with other dogs, etc. (Spoiler alert: there is no evidence that dogs can feel jealousy, guilt, pride, or shame. Yelling at your dog for chewing up a shoe while you were away just makes them confused and anxious, enough so that they may begin to associate your return home with anxiety and punishment. They don't have the presence of mind to connect the punishment with having chewed the shoe earlier, much less to feel guilty about it.)This really is a must-read for dog owners. I will keep this information in mind for future dog purchases as I consider breeds, training programs, and the way I interact with my pet."
143,1452652031,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2755825-ellen-broadhurst,5,"Dog Sense is an excellent read for someone interested in a layman's overview of dog behavior and psychology research. Basically offering evidence that refutes the ""dominant down"" sort of dog training (which I find puzzling: are there still people who subscribe to this??), the author offers insights into how dogs differ from wolves, how dogs interact with their environment, how dogs (probably) perceive their care-taker humans, their hearth and home, and how dogs (likely) interact with each other. As a half way intelligent dog owner who has already internalized much of the message Bradshaw is delivering, most of the book was not a revelation. That said, there were golden nuggets that made Dog Sense well worth a read. It is also exactly the sort of book I would give to a non-dog person considering getting a dog. One of the biggest, obvious mistakes people make in getting a ""first dog"" is not taking the time to understand what a dog really is, how they operate and how best to integrate a dog into your household. As someone who had done the research upfront, hired a trainer before getting the dog, and ultimately adopting a nearly-perfect 5 year old dog (who came, super polite, house trained, crate trained, didn't chew, etc), I *still* made some beginner mistakes; books like this aren't going to solve training problems, but it should give readers a broader perspective that helps them think about the 'whole' dog when they are integrating a dog into the household, or trying to problem-solve issues do arise. "
144,1452652031,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1279767-nita,4,"The author's main premise is that as we continue to expect more and more obedience and human-like behavior from our dogs since our world continues to change into one where we have less and less time for them, we must spend more time breeding them to behave as the dogs we want as pets and less time worrying about what they look like. He has very strong opinions about how this should be done. And while I agree with the author that the old dominance-aggression based training methods used by popular dog trainers such as Cesar Millan need to go the way of the dinosaur, the author said it so many times in so many different ways that it got very old quickly. Still, I enjoyed the book and found his insights helpful in thinking about the way I have trained dogs in the past and how I might select and train a pet dog in the future. This is not a training manual, but a scientific study of canine evolution. I found it especially interesting that the dog did not evolve directly from the wolf, but rather more likely from a common ancestor. No wonder dog training methods that use wolf behavior as a foundation for training our highly domesticated pet dogs is so off base! He maintains that the dog's strongest evolutionary trait is to want to please us, but is often confused about how to go about it. It's our job not to punish bad behavior which the dog has likely forgotten as soon as we've entered the room, but to use positive techniques to teach and breed dogs to be the best companions possible."
145,1452652031,http://goodreads.com/user/show/975391-steven,3,"Bradshaw looks at dogs and their long interaction with our species, considering this relationship from scratch -- without all the baggage and traditionally-taught notions about what dogs are thinking. It's a good approach, although maybe not what readers might expect.He's upfront with stating that this is NOT a training manual. Rather, he looks at the trends and beliefs that have informed dog trainers, and holds up a mirror of genetics, evolution, and behavioral studies. One of his major goals is to debunk the idea that our modern dogs are just ""little wolves,"" vying for position in a pack, or a indeed, a human household. He points out that most studies of wolf behavior are either based on specifically local populations of modern wolves, or are based on captive groups, neither of which are typical. And in either case, their behavior doesn't have much to do with creatures that split from a common ancestor tens of thousands of years ago.Bradshaw discusses several ideas that I found intriguing, including the fact that dogs seem to be more focused on people than on other dogs, that we often overestimate dogs' ability to process information and their capacity for self-reflection. He also discusses their physiology and how it differs from humans, giving insight into how they see, hear and, of course, smell in very different ways from us. A good book. Quite sciencey, but there's nothing wrong with that. I certainly looked at the canine's I'm in charge of differently while reading this book. So much so, that the next book I plan to read is about dogs and their minds, too."
146,1452652031,http://goodreads.com/user/show/69313297-jina,2,"Honestly, Dr. John Bradshaw irritated me. He disagreed with a lot of the findings discussed in The Genius of Dogs (note that Dog Sense was published 2 years before), but that’s not what irritated me. He goes on and on and on in the first half of his book about why it doesn’t make any sense to look at wolves to understand dog behaviour. Then, in the second to last chapter of his book, he has the nerve to say that humans are ruining the way dogs can communicate with each other the more we breed them to look less like a wolf. Like -wait a minute. If we should not be looking at wolves to understand dog behaviour, why are we looking at how wolves communicate to make a statement that the less dogs look like the wolves, the less expressive their faces are, and, therefore, the less they are able to effectively communicate with their fellow dogs. This hypocrisy annoyed me mostly because of how much Dr. Bradshaw reiterates over and over and over again about how it doesn’t make any sense to compare dogs to wolves. “My view is that the key to understanding the domestic dog is, first and foremost, to understand the domestic dog… By analyzing the dog has its own animal rather than a lesser version of the wolf, we have the opportunity to understand it and refine our dealings with it as never before.” - Evidently, this statement doesn’t apply to how dogs communicate."
147,1452652031,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4689182-ronald,5,"A very well written book representing the evolution of the present day dog from a common ancestor with todays wolf. He points out that dogs did not evolve from the wolf. He postulates how todays canid became domesticated primarily to serve man primarily as a help in sheparding, hunting and other practical purposes. Man began breeding dogs for specific traits which enhanced these skills. Breeds have become increasingly inbred This inbreeding for physical attributes has become problematic to the health of some breed. Breed and show organizations have been the root cause of this problem. The role of dogs todays is providing a companion a to its owner more so then for practical work purpose. Some breeds still carry the work traits that they were originally bred. Those original work traits make certain breeds less suitable for companion purposes.Bradshaw speaks to the physical, perceptual and psychological make up of dogs such as their superior scent capability. He offers for consideration ideas of how people and more effectively interface with there dogs for the positive benefit of both.I enjoyed reading this book since I have had dogs since I was a young lad. I wish that I new then what I have learned now."

(I'm always looking for ways to be a better friend to my pets.) Although portions of it, mainly on the evolutionary history of dogs, were interesting, I probably should have followed my gut on this one. I kept finding myself literally falling asleep after a few pages and, by a few weeks in, had only made it halfway through. Perhaps the second half is better, but I just couldn't bear it anymore and had to turn to something else. Parts of the theory on the behavior of domestic dogs as it relates to that of wolves was particularly confusing, in as much as the author states many times that the two should not be compared due to many distinct differences and, yet, continues to do so himself. I was kind of left feeling much like I do about politics- that comparisons were being made only when it was useful to support this point of view.I may try again someday since I can borrow it for free, but I think on this one I'd have to say I'd rather go with MY instincts about how to interact with my dogs."
149,1452652031,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4534004-chel,5,"This is not a how-to book for a dog owner. It's more of a book about how to evaluate all the other how-to books. Bradshaw looks at what researchers have learned about the evolution of domestic dogs; how they are and are not like their nearest relative, the wolf; what we know about how their senses perceive, how they learn, their intelligence, their emotions, and what the breeding of specific strains has meant for the wellbeing of dogs today. At times it's a little difficult to figure out who he is writing for -- the reading is a little heavy in places for the recreational reader, offering what seems to be a full literature review out of all the various studies, frequently noting what we don't know, as well as what we do know. But I imagine he is defending himself from criticisms of his conclusions from people who would cite the studies he did not.I most appreciated his strong refutation of the idea that the dog's world must have an ""alpha"" character, a boss, and if humans don't take pains to assume that role, then the dog will. Good riddance to that way of thinking -- now I am going to go play tug-of-war with my dog!"

Both points formed touchstones for arguments against a lot of currently accepted thought about dog behavior. There were a lot of informative takeaways from the book, without it getting to dense or technical."

156,1452652031,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6052204-tracey,4,"In Dog Sense: How the New Science of Dog Behavior Can Make You a Better Friend to Your Pet, Bradshaw includes scads of information about wolves, about the evolution of the dog from the wolf and into a relationship with human society, about modern scientific studies on dog behavior, and about modern dog breeding and in-breeding, etc. He also discusses the human/dog bond, common errors humans make in understanding their dogs, and some comparisons between our species. Bradshaw launches his book with an engaging preface, describing two of the dogs of his childhood, Ginger and Alexis, the first of which he knew only from family legends that outlasted her. It's a great start, but much of the book relies on a stiffer and more formal voice, perhaps due to the scientific nature of the content.Some of what Bradshaw includes in his book is also in Mark Derr's book, How the Dog Became the Dog: From Wolves to Our Best Friends-- a book I liked less well than Bradshaw's. A few of the studies cited have also aired in PBS or National Geographic shows. For example, those showing that dogs outperform chimpanzees in some tasks, including: interpretation of human facial expressions, responsiveness to human pointing, and the ability to use humans as resources when attempting to get to a desired object, such as a tasty bit of food. There's also the Siberian fox domestication experiment.But much in this book is new, to me anyway. And when Bradshaw gets on a roll, his writing can be lively and pleasurable, spotted here and there with the kind of facts and ideas that one wants to read out loud to whomever is in earshot. For example, puppies begin to learn their mother's scent while they're still in the womb. Unborn pups gestating within a bitch who's had aniseed in her diet will gravitate to the scent of aniseed after they're born. And cats can hear higher frequencies than dogs. Or how about this?: after watching a scripted interaction between a ""beggar"" person, a ""generous"" person (who gives the beggar food or whatever), and a ""selfish"" person (who turns the beggar away), dogs prefer to interact with the ""generous"" person. Fascinating stuff. However, long passages seem to exist for the purpose of refuting those who disagree with ""the new science."" These parts are less accessible, come across as argumentative, and are repetitive, too. For example, it seems that Chapters 1 through 3 could have been shortened considerably, in part by moving some of the more involved material to footnotes, a text box, or an appendix. The writing style and organization of these chapters, and their fit into the whole, also made me wonder if they were pulled from articles he'd previously written. My biggest complaint about the book is that it does not, I think,fully deliver on its subtitle, neither describing ""the new science of dog behavior"" clearly enough nor telling the reader how to apply this science to be ""a better friend"" to one's pet. (One exception is an excerpt giving instructions on how to a dog of separation anxiety.) The book does explain, repeatedly, what the new science is not: it is not the old science of seeing dogs as wolves in disguise, ambitious to gain alpha status in the household. It is not about owners claiming the alpha role and keeping the dog in its beta, or omega, place. And it does not employ physical punishment.But Dog Sense contains a lot of interesting material, is well written (if not always consistently accessible), and its author is a pleasant enough chap to spend time with --- humane, intelligent, sensible, compassionate. Knowledgeable, of course. If the reader has a little patience, this book may vastly enrich how you see the world of dogs."
157,1452652031,http://goodreads.com/user/show/9003269-meghan,3,"Although I knew, going in, that this book contradicts what I personally feel about dogs, I strive to keep my eyes and ears open and was willing to give this book a shot. I have done my best to review this book on it's own merits, and not based on my own personal bias.And.. it reminds me of listening to one of my relatives. You know the type: he's armed with a couple of real concrete scientific facts and then scrapes those along to cover his own opinions. By repeating himself several times, he thinks you will be too stupid to figure out that everything he says (minus the actual science) is really just his own opinion dressed up with scientific jargon. But the author's repetitions of ""we can assume"", ""it's obvious that"", and ""we can suppose"" were a dead giveaway to how much of this was just his own views. Rather disappointing from a biologist. This book, imho, has the nearly identical issues as The Wolf in the Parlor: The Eternal Connection between Humans and Dogs: too little actual data to cover the author's premise, and therefore the claims are all questionable. Mr. Bradshaw did, however, avoid the pitfall of describing his own dogs as his main proof. Unfortunately he made another mistake: getting on a soapbox about a popular dog trainer. It became a bit much, honestly, and came across as a bitch-fest instead of an intellectual discourse.It isn't that I think this book was entirely wrong or that I got nothing out of it. I did find the discussion on purebred dogs and having dogs bred specifically for the pet market interesting (. I found some of his dog science interesting, even if I didn't agree with his conclusions. I laughed out loud when he mentioned 'pee-mail'. I enjoyed his comments on how dogs see the world (even if I think most dog owners are aware how important smell is to our dogs), and did think this was relatively easy to listen to- the writing flowed smoothly and the sentence structure was never boring despite the scientific words. The studies he includes on puppies do give us insight into how dogs bond with humans, and there were a number of other studies included that I found interesting as well. The idea that temperament testing of puppies really tells us very little about grown dogs was new to me, and I will read more on that subject (as I have always put a lot of faith in this for choosing puppies).I do suggest this author Never Ever Ever write about domestic cats again. Ever. He clearly hasn't lived with or observed cats at all, and cats are a crappy example for what he was trying to prove. As always, this is only my own opinion. Clearly other readers were far more impressed than I was, and I invite you to read this book and form your own thoughts. Note: this is NOT a dog training manual. With the exception of a bit about helping dog separation anxiety (which he calls separation distress, for his own reasons that were a bit unclear to me), there is no training advice here. I'm not sure he really took much of a stand on what sort of training was best (other than that he hates dominance theory). "

162,1452652031,http://goodreads.com/user/show/24179583-evan,4,"I enjoyed this book and found the information helpful. The author speaks to how the environment for dogs has changed with our urbanization and higher expectations that dogs must be under their owners control at all times. Also dogs are used less and less as workers and more and more as companions. The most responsible dog owners usually neuter their pets so these companion dogs do not get to pass on their genetics. It is the working dogs, the show dogs, and the dogs of irresponsible owners who are most likely to pass on their genes. Dogs are not wolves and they are not little people. They have a strong urge to bond to people. They live in the moment. Except in rare cases physical punishment of a dog is counterproductive as it creates a less trusting, less bonded, more anxious animal. If punishment is used it must be immediate. The dog cannot understand being punished for something in the past. Reward based training generates a happy, trusting animal. Dogs naturally wish to please. Most of their negative behavior is the result of fear, not an urge to dominate. When selecting a companion dog stay away from the most popular and thus inbred breeds where genetic weaknesses are concentrated. The first eight weeks of the puppy’s life is very important in determining its personality. Look for a puppy who has been raised in a home and who has had a variety of experiences. A puppy who has lived isolated in a kennel or backroom somewhere is likely to be fearful and maladjusted. Taking a young dog to obedience training class exposes the dog to other dogs and people as well as teaching it important commands. Much of this information is commonsense, but I appreciate the reinforcement. The book could have shorter. As others have pointed out there was considerable repetition. The information that was repeated was important information so I did not find it overly annoying. Having dog companions for most of my life and having trained several of them in obedience and agility I can attest to the value of reward based training versus punishment based. Dogs just become fearful when they are hurt. Eventually a fearful dog may become aggressive out of self-defense. The author explains what dogs are capable of understanding. It is unfair to hold an animal responsible for something that is beyond its capability to comprehend. "
163,1452652031,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1356959-h-w,3,A mix of the author's conclusions regarding particular scientific studies on dogs mixed with his personal impressions of what makes dogs tick. It would have been nice if he had more actual animal training experience (like animal behaviorists Karen Pryor or Patricia McConnell) that would have given his ideas more credibility. I think the positive take away from this book is that you need to think critically about the things you've heard and assumed to be true about dog behavior since much of the conventional information out there is likely to be wrong.
164,1452652031,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5438598-don,5,"I enjoyed this book VERY much and highly recommend it to anyone who lives with a dog and wants to understand more of what's going on in their furry little heads. Understanding more of what dogs think and experience can only make your life with them better.Strangely, there are elements in this book which also apply to how we relate to our fellow humans. One huge theme in this book is rethinking the idea that we should treat dog ownership into a constant reassertion of our dominance because dogs inherit the drive for dominance from wolves. As it turns out, dogs left on their own form familial units, not rigid hierarchies. And wolves in the wild also form familial groups, unlike the stressed groups of unrelated wolves observed in captivity. So constantly browbeating your dog is only going to turn a potential loving family member into a stressed out roommate.Why does this apply to humans? Because we have also allowed ourselves to buy into the old dominance model ""wolf pack"" for human interactions. From the workplace and it's obsessively ""alpha"" managers to our interactions with government ""public servants"", we have gotten locked into a pathological system where we are increasingly told what to do and to shut up about what we really think. This is a situation in dire need of rethinking. But back to the book...Dogs are creatures who have been co-evolving with the human race for tens of thousands of years and are one of the few creatures capable of forming stronger bonds to another species than to their own.But if you have a dog around, you also need to understand how it thinks. While amazingly capable of predicting what humans they know are going to do, dogs do NOT have the capability to understandthe consequences of their actions. A crucial example offered is the dog with separation anxiety, who only knows that sometimes when his owner comes back, the owner gets REALLY angry...so he gets increasingly stressed and chews something to bits. And then the owner gets angry...Dogs love us and chances are, if you are thinking about reading this book, you love them too. I recommend this book as a tool to help make that relationship as good as it can possibly be."
165,1452652031,http://goodreads.com/user/show/21256356-jocelyn,4,"I was going to give this book three stars but in the end decided not to. It's hard to find dog behavior books that are based objectively off of scientific evidence, and Dog Sense came close.Now, I say ""close"" because an incident early on in my reading undermined a lot of the confidence I had in the author's sources--in chapter 3 (p.92 in my version), after spending a while bashing some rather well-known trainers' techniques, Bradshaw gives an example list of ""commandments"" that people of those training methods allegedly must follow.This list contains ridiculous elements such as ""Do not cuddle or stroke your dog"" and ""Do not allow your dog to climb your stairs,"" and eventually I decided to just check the source that it came from. It turns out that the list is idealized to portray the most exaggerated of those trainers' tenets and was written by a critic of the method in question; obviously the reader is not told about this in the text and show quite clearly that Bradshaw is extremely biased and in this case at least has cherry-picked his ""cases.""So I will say, be wary of the sources he cites, since they might be chosen out of fields of other data just to better prove his point. Nevertheless, everything else that I checked after that seemed to be on-target, and his points about dog psychology are valid. This was one of the more scientifically well-founded dog books that I've read, and as such was in some ways more enlightening than, say, a dog-raising manual or a book on methods of training.Dog Sense doesn't really impart any great knowledge about training techniques but only about how dogs might think and why they act the way they do. It talks about the origins of common problems in dogs (separation anxiety is a big one) but doesn't go into any depth about how to solve the problems, but that's acceptable since it never advertised that it would provide any solutions and since there are so many other great sources on the subject.Overall, it's mostly just an educational read with little practical importance. I enjoyed it despite my wariness after that sketchy-source incident."
166,1452652031,http://goodreads.com/user/show/399070-nick,3,"Dog Sense provides a valuable survey of what scientists currently know about dogs, and it illustrates how far behind lags the practice of owning and training dogs. For example, the first misconception that Bradshaw attacks is the characterization of dogs as essentially wolves always striving to achieve alpha status. Modern research into wolf packs in the wild – not those fabricated by captivity – reveals a social structure recognizable as a family unit, with younger wolves deferring naturally to their parents, not to the strongest and most dominant. And Bradshaw argues convincingly that dogs have come a long way from their wolf ancestors.Bradshaw is first and foremost a scientist. His book makes for disappointingly dry reading, as he earnestly attempts to present the facts and describe the methodology and results of individual experiments. Yet he clearly cares deeply about the welfare of dogs: his outrage at the ignorant mistreatment of dogs is palpable. When science cannot conclusively show whether dogs experience emotions as humans do, he makes a leap of faith, seeing no reason to deny that dogs experience something we would recognize as love.Despite the book's title, Bradshaw's focus is on enlightening readers about dogs as a species. Only in passing does he occasionally instruct readers on how to be better dog owners. His book would be most valuable to those who assume wrongly that dogs must be forced to submit, or that dogs always understand why you punish them, or that dogs perceive the world in basically the same way that we do.Like those scientists who are trying to convince people that yes, global warming is real and a real problem, Bradshaw's main goal is to raise awareness. But although many of the challenges facing dogs are societal, such as the growing expectations of canine discipline in urban areas, and the ongoing efforts of breeders to optimize for (brittle) appearances instead of suitability for companionship, this eye-opening book can revolutionize how you understand your dog. The rest is up to you."
167,1452652031,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7566522-ray-campbell,4,"I love dogs, thus my review of any discussion may be skewed - sorry. Bradshaw begins with a study of the origins of dogs which was nothing new, though fun to read again. The one point he makes on origins which I liked, and he builds on later in the book, is that while dogs are 99% genetically wolves, they are not wolves. The animal, which was a now extincted breed of grey wolf, has evolved into modern dogs and no longer exists as a unique animal. Thus, we can not understand dogs by studying wolves anymore than we can understand humans by studying chimps, though we share ancestors and are 99% genetically similar... dogs are dogs.The middle part of the book is a look at doggy psychology which is lots of fun. Bradshaw explores the research on training effectiveness, the emotional lives of our beloved fuzzy friends and the general benefits of positive versus negative training practices. I picked up some useful tips, but it mostly reinforced ideas I embrace.The last part of the book is commentary. Bradshaw becomes activist in his reflection on the purposes of breeding and the resulting dogs, the dangers and benefits of the various practices. As he explains problems and mismatches, he becomes increasingly passionate about issues with over-breeding, puppy-mills and his vision of the best direction we can take for the sake of dogs and the happiness of our lives with them.Lots of great insight and lots of fun while clearly based on solid research. This is not a ""how-to"" book. This is a look at our friends and an exploration of how they think and how we might use current research to understand them and make decisions about them. If you love dogs, you'll love this book. If you are having issues, you might find a helpful insight. If you are looking for step by step instructions or a study of a specific breed - not here. I liked this book and would like to recommend it, though I hope I've been clear on what it is. Woof."
168,1452652031,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1713788-sarah,4,"This book is a sort of guide to better understanding dogs. It made me appreciate my favorite animal even more.Bradshaw's take on dogs' social, emotional, and physical lives is based on an evolutionary perspective. He points out that many popular ideas on training and dealing with dogs are based on bad logic. We look to a not-directly-related specie of captive wolf to understand how our dogs, who have been selectively bred for thousands of years for life among humans, behave. I think Bradshaw's angle of looking at how and why humans have domesticated and bred dogs gives a much more realistic, useful interpretation.This book made me understand why dogs are ""man's best friend"". We are both social creatures who evolved in cooperative groups, not just domination hierarchies. We are well-adapted to learn and read each others' body language and to take pleasure in interacting with each other.It expanded my understanding of how dogs think, feel, and behave, and made me realize that they interpret and experience the world in very different ways than we do (particularly their sense of smell). So, while it's tempting to anthropomorphize our little buddies and assume that they feel and understand just like us, that's a dangerous assumption that asks too much of dogs.It also raises some concerns about the future of dogs in our society. By breeding for dogs who seek human companionship above any other kind, we are creating dogs prone to separation anxiety. By purchasing dogs based on appearance, we are putting dogs bred for certain kinds of lifestyles (e.g., hunting, herding) in incompatible environments, then wondering why they react negatively.This book was well-written with as much research as he could find to support his claims. Bradshaw obviously appreciates dogs and wants to educate others so we can all appreciate and treat them well."
169,1452652031,http://goodreads.com/user/show/537331-araminta-matthews,3,"I read this book hoping to learn some of my very own human tricks that would allow me to better relate to and interact with my dog. That isn't exactly what I received, though I'm enough of an amateur scientist to have gleaned, connected, and otherwise sussed out of this book what I needed to improve my whippet-rearing tactics (and before you ask, yes, my dog is a rescue; not a store-bought pedigree). This book does a great job laying out science, studies, and general observations of canine history, behavior, and socialization, but it falls short of recommending methods promised by its title that would ""make you a better friend to your pet."" At the same time, there were a few things I found interesting that I'll share. For one, research has found that negative reinforcers produce only 12% obedience rates, whereas positive reinforcers or rewards produce 60% obedience rates, according to Bradshaw. In addition, Bradshaw effectively debunks the notion that dogs experience the human emotion of ""guilt,"" and furthermore, demonstrates clear science to support the idea that Ddgs have a different brand of intelligence to primates (and thus can't be compared to us on emotional scales--they aren't the same). At the same time, he does argue that dogs consistently outperform even chimpanzees at reading human facial expressions, vocal tones, commands, and gestures. I'll leave my review on one note that struck me to the point of necessitating a full quotation. No tears, fellow-dog-moms: p.171: “Dogs really do miss their owners when they are separated from them. Many dogs also seem to become much more emotionally fragile under sudden shocks, such as the noise of fireworks going off. . . they find it difficult to cope without us.” "
170,1452652031,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1161667-shel,4,"While there's nothing earth-shattering here, the book makes an excellent point that in order to relate better to our canine companions we ought to invest more effort in thinking about how they perceive the world.Perhaps that's the most surprising revelation here: how little scientific and purposeful thought we've given to how our dogs friends think and what makes them happy. While, dogs on the other hand, watch and respond sensitively to our every move and mood.The book counters some conventional wisdom and wrong-thinking which has lead to misguided and harmful training techniques i.e. dogs do not behave like wolves. They do not need to be dominated and, in fact, this can cause them anxiety and fear.This book is part of a growing and useful trend toward delving more into the emotional lives of animals, not in the sense of anthropormorphizing, but rather in perceiving the world in the way another species would. Dogs, for example, have a huge olfactory world available to them.It's a helpful point of view. Bradshaw makes a strong case for the need to think about how to access and maximize the potential of the inner world of dogs to help them integrate and be our companions in modern society rather than simply breeding them to look a certain way - often to the detriment of their health and temperament.The book ends on a pessimistic note about the fate of dogs, if their needs are not taken into consideration. As a dog lover, I have to feel more hopeful about the future of dogs. What would we do without them? Loyal dog people will certainly read books like this and speak out to make changes (in training techniques, breeding, welfare) on the dogs' behalf. Won't they?"
171,1452652031,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2716223-julie,5,"This is, by far, one of the best books I've read on dog behavior and training. Bradshaw walks the reader through the previous held theories of wolf behavior and how dog training - based on captive wolf behavior (not wild wolves) can lead humans to train dogs in a manner that is not fair to the true nature of dogs. This book justified many of my gut reactions on my experiences training dogs. I've never been comfortable employing punishment or negative techniques preferring instead to observe the dog and work with the personality that each dog has. Many other trainers, such at Patricia McConnell and Pat Miller, practice positive dog training techniques and I'm a huge fan of their work. Bradshaw, however, adds more context - based on research - around the nature of dogs and their connectivity to humans. The research covers not only the ""lupomorph"" model but also tackles the breeding of dogs and how breeding for looks and not behavior has created dogs with far greater health and behavior problems than ever before. This book is a must read for anyone remotely interested in animal behavior. I'd even say that anyone who has a dog or is thinking of getting a dog should read this as the insight is invaluable as one works with (and even choses) a dog. Bradshaw ends the book with this line: ""Addressing the twin pressures of misguided breeding and poor understanding of canine psychology is crucial to ensuring that dogs remain as significant a part of human life as they have ben for the past ten millennia. My hope is that this book will make some contribution toward that goal."" I believe it has. "
172,1452652031,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1783712-kelly,5,"Absolutely fascinating book. It's a little slow in some parts but seems scientifically sound (in my not-especially-informed opinion) and provides compelling evidence for why looking at modern wolf behavior tells us precious little about domesticated dogs. The science makes a strong case for basing dog training in rewards rather than punishment. The book also covers the major problems caused by breeding for looks rather than companionship traits. The most shocking statistic: pedigree dogs have lost about 40 percent of their genetic variation due to inbreeding, which is the equivalent of a WHOLE BREED having a gene pool no more diverse than human first cousins (p. 255). This certainly explains some of the health problems we've had with our purebred golden retrievers. I also enjoyed the chapters on what the world is like from a dog's perspective--what emotions they are capable of feeling, what colors they see, how they make use of their heightened sense of smell, how they communicate with other dogs, etc. (Spoiler alert: there is no evidence that dogs can feel jealousy, guilt, pride, or shame. Yelling at your dog for chewing up a shoe while you were away just makes them confused and anxious, enough so that they may begin to associate your return home with anxiety and punishment. They don't have the presence of mind to connect the punishment with having chewed the shoe earlier, much less to feel guilty about it.)This really is a must-read for dog owners. I will keep this information in mind for future dog purchases as I consider breeds, training programs, and the way I interact with my pet."
173,1452652031,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2755825-ellen-broadhurst,5,"Dog Sense is an excellent read for someone interested in a layman's overview of dog behavior and psychology research. Basically offering evidence that refutes the ""dominant down"" sort of dog training (which I find puzzling: are there still people who subscribe to this??), the author offers insights into how dogs differ from wolves, how dogs interact with their environment, how dogs (probably) perceive their care-taker humans, their hearth and home, and how dogs (likely) interact with each other. As a half way intelligent dog owner who has already internalized much of the message Bradshaw is delivering, most of the book was not a revelation. That said, there were golden nuggets that made Dog Sense well worth a read. It is also exactly the sort of book I would give to a non-dog person considering getting a dog. One of the biggest, obvious mistakes people make in getting a ""first dog"" is not taking the time to understand what a dog really is, how they operate and how best to integrate a dog into your household. As someone who had done the research upfront, hired a trainer before getting the dog, and ultimately adopting a nearly-perfect 5 year old dog (who came, super polite, house trained, crate trained, didn't chew, etc), I *still* made some beginner mistakes; books like this aren't going to solve training problems, but it should give readers a broader perspective that helps them think about the 'whole' dog when they are integrating a dog into the household, or trying to problem-solve issues do arise. "
174,1452652031,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1279767-nita,4,"The author's main premise is that as we continue to expect more and more obedience and human-like behavior from our dogs since our world continues to change into one where we have less and less time for them, we must spend more time breeding them to behave as the dogs we want as pets and less time worrying about what they look like. He has very strong opinions about how this should be done. And while I agree with the author that the old dominance-aggression based training methods used by popular dog trainers such as Cesar Millan need to go the way of the dinosaur, the author said it so many times in so many different ways that it got very old quickly. Still, I enjoyed the book and found his insights helpful in thinking about the way I have trained dogs in the past and how I might select and train a pet dog in the future. This is not a training manual, but a scientific study of canine evolution. I found it especially interesting that the dog did not evolve directly from the wolf, but rather more likely from a common ancestor. No wonder dog training methods that use wolf behavior as a foundation for training our highly domesticated pet dogs is so off base! He maintains that the dog's strongest evolutionary trait is to want to please us, but is often confused about how to go about it. It's our job not to punish bad behavior which the dog has likely forgotten as soon as we've entered the room, but to use positive techniques to teach and breed dogs to be the best companions possible."
175,1452652031,http://goodreads.com/user/show/975391-steven,3,"Bradshaw looks at dogs and their long interaction with our species, considering this relationship from scratch -- without all the baggage and traditionally-taught notions about what dogs are thinking. It's a good approach, although maybe not what readers might expect.He's upfront with stating that this is NOT a training manual. Rather, he looks at the trends and beliefs that have informed dog trainers, and holds up a mirror of genetics, evolution, and behavioral studies. One of his major goals is to debunk the idea that our modern dogs are just ""little wolves,"" vying for position in a pack, or a indeed, a human household. He points out that most studies of wolf behavior are either based on specifically local populations of modern wolves, or are based on captive groups, neither of which are typical. And in either case, their behavior doesn't have much to do with creatures that split from a common ancestor tens of thousands of years ago.Bradshaw discusses several ideas that I found intriguing, including the fact that dogs seem to be more focused on people than on other dogs, that we often overestimate dogs' ability to process information and their capacity for self-reflection. He also discusses their physiology and how it differs from humans, giving insight into how they see, hear and, of course, smell in very different ways from us. A good book. Quite sciencey, but there's nothing wrong with that. I certainly looked at the canine's I'm in charge of differently while reading this book. So much so, that the next book I plan to read is about dogs and their minds, too."
176,1452652031,http://goodreads.com/user/show/69313297-jina,2,"Honestly, Dr. John Bradshaw irritated me. He disagreed with a lot of the findings discussed in The Genius of Dogs (note that Dog Sense was published 2 years before), but that’s not what irritated me. He goes on and on and on in the first half of his book about why it doesn’t make any sense to look at wolves to understand dog behaviour. Then, in the second to last chapter of his book, he has the nerve to say that humans are ruining the way dogs can communicate with each other the more we breed them to look less like a wolf. Like -wait a minute. If we should not be looking at wolves to understand dog behaviour, why are we looking at how wolves communicate to make a statement that the less dogs look like the wolves, the less expressive their faces are, and, therefore, the less they are able to effectively communicate with their fellow dogs. This hypocrisy annoyed me mostly because of how much Dr. Bradshaw reiterates over and over and over again about how it doesn’t make any sense to compare dogs to wolves. “My view is that the key to understanding the domestic dog is, first and foremost, to understand the domestic dog… By analyzing the dog has its own animal rather than a lesser version of the wolf, we have the opportunity to understand it and refine our dealings with it as never before.” - Evidently, this statement doesn’t apply to how dogs communicate."
177,1452652031,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4689182-ronald,5,"A very well written book representing the evolution of the present day dog from a common ancestor with todays wolf. He points out that dogs did not evolve from the wolf. He postulates how todays canid became domesticated primarily to serve man primarily as a help in sheparding, hunting and other practical purposes. Man began breeding dogs for specific traits which enhanced these skills. Breeds have become increasingly inbred This inbreeding for physical attributes has become problematic to the health of some breed. Breed and show organizations have been the root cause of this problem. The role of dogs todays is providing a companion a to its owner more so then for practical work purpose. Some breeds still carry the work traits that they were originally bred. Those original work traits make certain breeds less suitable for companion purposes.Bradshaw speaks to the physical, perceptual and psychological make up of dogs such as their superior scent capability. He offers for consideration ideas of how people and more effectively interface with there dogs for the positive benefit of both.I enjoyed reading this book since I have had dogs since I was a young lad. I wish that I new then what I have learned now."
178,1452652031,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5041758-heather-hunter,3,"I was pretty intrigued by this title though I passed it over a few times initially at my local library before picking it up. (I'm always looking for ways to be a better friend to my pets.) Although portions of it, mainly on the evolutionary history of dogs, were interesting, I probably should have followed my gut on this one. I kept finding myself literally falling asleep after a few pages and, by a few weeks in, had only made it halfway through. Perhaps the second half is better, but I just couldn't bear it anymore and had to turn to something else. Parts of the theory on the behavior of domestic dogs as it relates to that of wolves was particularly confusing, in as much as the author states many times that the two should not be compared due to many distinct differences and, yet, continues to do so himself. I was kind of left feeling much like I do about politics- that comparisons were being made only when it was useful to support this point of view.I may try again someday since I can borrow it for free, but I think on this one I'd have to say I'd rather go with MY instincts about how to interact with my dogs."
179,1452652031,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4534004-chel,5,"This is not a how-to book for a dog owner. It's more of a book about how to evaluate all the other how-to books. Bradshaw looks at what researchers have learned about the evolution of domestic dogs; how they are and are not like their nearest relative, the wolf; what we know about how their senses perceive, how they learn, their intelligence, their emotions, and what the breeding of specific strains has meant for the wellbeing of dogs today. At times it's a little difficult to figure out who he is writing for -- the reading is a little heavy in places for the recreational reader, offering what seems to be a full literature review out of all the various studies, frequently noting what we don't know, as well as what we do know. But I imagine he is defending himself from criticisms of his conclusions from people who would cite the studies he did not.I most appreciated his strong refutation of the idea that the dog's world must have an ""alpha"" character, a boss, and if humans don't take pains to assume that role, then the dog will. Good riddance to that way of thinking -- now I am going to go play tug-of-war with my dog!"
180,1452652031,http://goodreads.com/user/show/923535-greg-pettit,3,"Very enjoyable, although the author had a tendency to repeat some points over and over again, such as ""Dogs are not Wolves"" and ""Dogs are not People."" Both points formed touchstones for arguments against a lot of currently accepted thought about dog behavior. There were a lot of informative takeaways from the book, without it getting to dense or technical."

186,1452652031,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6052204-tracey,4,"In Dog Sense: How the New Science of Dog Behavior Can Make You a Better Friend to Your Pet, Bradshaw includes scads of information about wolves, about the evolution of the dog from the wolf and into a relationship with human society, about modern scientific studies on dog behavior, and about modern dog breeding and in-breeding, etc. He also discusses the human/dog bond, common errors humans make in understanding their dogs, and some comparisons between our species. Bradshaw launches his book with an engaging preface, describing two of the dogs of his childhood, Ginger and Alexis, the first of which he knew only from family legends that outlasted her. It's a great start, but much of the book relies on a stiffer and more formal voice, perhaps due to the scientific nature of the content.Some of what Bradshaw includes in his book is also in Mark Derr's book, How the Dog Became the Dog: From Wolves to Our Best Friends-- a book I liked less well than Bradshaw's. A few of the studies cited have also aired in PBS or National Geographic shows. For example, those showing that dogs outperform chimpanzees in some tasks, including: interpretation of human facial expressions, responsiveness to human pointing, and the ability to use humans as resources when attempting to get to a desired object, such as a tasty bit of food. There's also the Siberian fox domestication experiment.But much in this book is new, to me anyway. And when Bradshaw gets on a roll, his writing can be lively and pleasurable, spotted here and there with the kind of facts and ideas that one wants to read out loud to whomever is in earshot. For example, puppies begin to learn their mother's scent while they're still in the womb. Unborn pups gestating within a bitch who's had aniseed in her diet will gravitate to the scent of aniseed after they're born. And cats can hear higher frequencies than dogs. Or how about this?: after watching a scripted interaction between a ""beggar"" person, a ""generous"" person (who gives the beggar food or whatever), and a ""selfish"" person (who turns the beggar away), dogs prefer to interact with the ""generous"" person. Fascinating stuff. However, long passages seem to exist for the purpose of refuting those who disagree with ""the new science."" These parts are less accessible, come across as argumentative, and are repetitive, too. For example, it seems that Chapters 1 through 3 could have been shortened considerably, in part by moving some of the more involved material to footnotes, a text box, or an appendix. The writing style and organization of these chapters, and their fit into the whole, also made me wonder if they were pulled from articles he'd previously written. My biggest complaint about the book is that it does not, I think,fully deliver on its subtitle, neither describing ""the new science of dog behavior"" clearly enough nor telling the reader how to apply this science to be ""a better friend"" to one's pet. (One exception is an excerpt giving instructions on how to a dog of separation anxiety.) The book does explain, repeatedly, what the new science is not: it is not the old science of seeing dogs as wolves in disguise, ambitious to gain alpha status in the household. It is not about owners claiming the alpha role and keeping the dog in its beta, or omega, place. And it does not employ physical punishment.But Dog Sense contains a lot of interesting material, is well written (if not always consistently accessible), and its author is a pleasant enough chap to spend time with --- humane, intelligent, sensible, compassionate. Knowledgeable, of course. If the reader has a little patience, this book may vastly enrich how you see the world of dogs."
187,1452652031,http://goodreads.com/user/show/9003269-meghan,3,"Although I knew, going in, that this book contradicts what I personally feel about dogs, I strive to keep my eyes and ears open and was willing to give this book a shot. I have done my best to review this book on it's own merits, and not based on my own personal bias.And.. it reminds me of listening to one of my relatives. You know the type: he's armed with a couple of real concrete scientific facts and then scrapes those along to cover his own opinions. By repeating himself several times, he thinks you will be too stupid to figure out that everything he says (minus the actual science) is really just his own opinion dressed up with scientific jargon. But the author's repetitions of ""we can assume"", ""it's obvious that"", and ""we can suppose"" were a dead giveaway to how much of this was just his own views. Rather disappointing from a biologist. This book, imho, has the nearly identical issues as The Wolf in the Parlor: The Eternal Connection between Humans and Dogs: too little actual data to cover the author's premise, and therefore the claims are all questionable. Mr. Bradshaw did, however, avoid the pitfall of describing his own dogs as his main proof. Unfortunately he made another mistake: getting on a soapbox about a popular dog trainer. It became a bit much, honestly, and came across as a bitch-fest instead of an intellectual discourse.It isn't that I think this book was entirely wrong or that I got nothing out of it. I did find the discussion on purebred dogs and having dogs bred specifically for the pet market interesting (. I found some of his dog science interesting, even if I didn't agree with his conclusions. I laughed out loud when he mentioned 'pee-mail'. I enjoyed his comments on how dogs see the world (even if I think most dog owners are aware how important smell is to our dogs), and did think this was relatively easy to listen to- the writing flowed smoothly and the sentence structure was never boring despite the scientific words. The studies he includes on puppies do give us insight into how dogs bond with humans, and there were a number of other studies included that I found interesting as well. The idea that temperament testing of puppies really tells us very little about grown dogs was new to me, and I will read more on that subject (as I have always put a lot of faith in this for choosing puppies).I do suggest this author Never Ever Ever write about domestic cats again. Ever. He clearly hasn't lived with or observed cats at all, and cats are a crappy example for what he was trying to prove. As always, this is only my own opinion. Clearly other readers were far more impressed than I was, and I invite you to read this book and form your own thoughts. Note: this is NOT a dog training manual. With the exception of a bit about helping dog separation anxiety (which he calls separation distress, for his own reasons that were a bit unclear to me), there is no training advice here. I'm not sure he really took much of a stand on what sort of training was best (other than that he hates dominance theory). "

192,1452652031,http://goodreads.com/user/show/24179583-evan,4,"I enjoyed this book and found the information helpful. The author speaks to how the environment for dogs has changed with our urbanization and higher expectations that dogs must be under their owners control at all times. Also dogs are used less and less as workers and more and more as companions. The most responsible dog owners usually neuter their pets so these companion dogs do not get to pass on their genetics. It is the working dogs, the show dogs, and the dogs of irresponsible owners who are most likely to pass on their genes. Dogs are not wolves and they are not little people. They have a strong urge to bond to people. They live in the moment. Except in rare cases physical punishment of a dog is counterproductive as it creates a less trusting, less bonded, more anxious animal. If punishment is used it must be immediate. The dog cannot understand being punished for something in the past. Reward based training generates a happy, trusting animal. Dogs naturally wish to please. Most of their negative behavior is the result of fear, not an urge to dominate. When selecting a companion dog stay away from the most popular and thus inbred breeds where genetic weaknesses are concentrated. The first eight weeks of the puppy’s life is very important in determining its personality. Look for a puppy who has been raised in a home and who has had a variety of experiences. A puppy who has lived isolated in a kennel or backroom somewhere is likely to be fearful and maladjusted. Taking a young dog to obedience training class exposes the dog to other dogs and people as well as teaching it important commands. Much of this information is commonsense, but I appreciate the reinforcement. The book could have shorter. As others have pointed out there was considerable repetition. The information that was repeated was important information so I did not find it overly annoying. Having dog companions for most of my life and having trained several of them in obedience and agility I can attest to the value of reward based training versus punishment based. Dogs just become fearful when they are hurt. Eventually a fearful dog may become aggressive out of self-defense. The author explains what dogs are capable of understanding. It is unfair to hold an animal responsible for something that is beyond its capability to comprehend. "
193,1452652031,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1356959-h-w,3,A mix of the author's conclusions regarding particular scientific studies on dogs mixed with his personal impressions of what makes dogs tick. It would have been nice if he had more actual animal training experience (like animal behaviorists Karen Pryor or Patricia McConnell) that would have given his ideas more credibility. I think the positive take away from this book is that you need to think critically about the things you've heard and assumed to be true about dog behavior since much of the conventional information out there is likely to be wrong.
194,1452652031,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5438598-don,5,"I enjoyed this book VERY much and highly recommend it to anyone who lives with a dog and wants to understand more of what's going on in their furry little heads. Understanding more of what dogs think and experience can only make your life with them better.Strangely, there are elements in this book which also apply to how we relate to our fellow humans. One huge theme in this book is rethinking the idea that we should treat dog ownership into a constant reassertion of our dominance because dogs inherit the drive for dominance from wolves. As it turns out, dogs left on their own form familial units, not rigid hierarchies. And wolves in the wild also form familial groups, unlike the stressed groups of unrelated wolves observed in captivity. So constantly browbeating your dog is only going to turn a potential loving family member into a stressed out roommate.Why does this apply to humans? Because we have also allowed ourselves to buy into the old dominance model ""wolf pack"" for human interactions. From the workplace and it's obsessively ""alpha"" managers to our interactions with government ""public servants"", we have gotten locked into a pathological system where we are increasingly told what to do and to shut up about what we really think. This is a situation in dire need of rethinking. But back to the book...Dogs are creatures who have been co-evolving with the human race for tens of thousands of years and are one of the few creatures capable of forming stronger bonds to another species than to their own.But if you have a dog around, you also need to understand how it thinks. While amazingly capable of predicting what humans they know are going to do, dogs do NOT have the capability to understandthe consequences of their actions. A crucial example offered is the dog with separation anxiety, who only knows that sometimes when his owner comes back, the owner gets REALLY angry...so he gets increasingly stressed and chews something to bits. And then the owner gets angry...Dogs love us and chances are, if you are thinking about reading this book, you love them too. I recommend this book as a tool to help make that relationship as good as it can possibly be."
195,1452652031,http://goodreads.com/user/show/21256356-jocelyn,4,"I was going to give this book three stars but in the end decided not to. It's hard to find dog behavior books that are based objectively off of scientific evidence, and Dog Sense came close.Now, I say ""close"" because an incident early on in my reading undermined a lot of the confidence I had in the author's sources--in chapter 3 (p.92 in my version), after spending a while bashing some rather well-known trainers' techniques, Bradshaw gives an example list of ""commandments"" that people of those training methods allegedly must follow.This list contains ridiculous elements such as ""Do not cuddle or stroke your dog"" and ""Do not allow your dog to climb your stairs,"" and eventually I decided to just check the source that it came from. It turns out that the list is idealized to portray the most exaggerated of those trainers' tenets and was written by a critic of the method in question; obviously the reader is not told about this in the text and show quite clearly that Bradshaw is extremely biased and in this case at least has cherry-picked his ""cases.""So I will say, be wary of the sources he cites, since they might be chosen out of fields of other data just to better prove his point. Nevertheless, everything else that I checked after that seemed to be on-target, and his points about dog psychology are valid. This was one of the more scientifically well-founded dog books that I've read, and as such was in some ways more enlightening than, say, a dog-raising manual or a book on methods of training.Dog Sense doesn't really impart any great knowledge about training techniques but only about how dogs might think and why they act the way they do. It talks about the origins of common problems in dogs (separation anxiety is a big one) but doesn't go into any depth about how to solve the problems, but that's acceptable since it never advertised that it would provide any solutions and since there are so many other great sources on the subject.Overall, it's mostly just an educational read with little practical importance. I enjoyed it despite my wariness after that sketchy-source incident."
196,1452652031,http://goodreads.com/user/show/399070-nick,3,"Dog Sense provides a valuable survey of what scientists currently know about dogs, and it illustrates how far behind lags the practice of owning and training dogs. For example, the first misconception that Bradshaw attacks is the characterization of dogs as essentially wolves always striving to achieve alpha status. Modern research into wolf packs in the wild – not those fabricated by captivity – reveals a social structure recognizable as a family unit, with younger wolves deferring naturally to their parents, not to the strongest and most dominant. And Bradshaw argues convincingly that dogs have come a long way from their wolf ancestors.Bradshaw is first and foremost a scientist. His book makes for disappointingly dry reading, as he earnestly attempts to present the facts and describe the methodology and results of individual experiments. Yet he clearly cares deeply about the welfare of dogs: his outrage at the ignorant mistreatment of dogs is palpable. When science cannot conclusively show whether dogs experience emotions as humans do, he makes a leap of faith, seeing no reason to deny that dogs experience something we would recognize as love.Despite the book's title, Bradshaw's focus is on enlightening readers about dogs as a species. Only in passing does he occasionally instruct readers on how to be better dog owners. His book would be most valuable to those who assume wrongly that dogs must be forced to submit, or that dogs always understand why you punish them, or that dogs perceive the world in basically the same way that we do.Like those scientists who are trying to convince people that yes, global warming is real and a real problem, Bradshaw's main goal is to raise awareness. But although many of the challenges facing dogs are societal, such as the growing expectations of canine discipline in urban areas, and the ongoing efforts of breeders to optimize for (brittle) appearances instead of suitability for companionship, this eye-opening book can revolutionize how you understand your dog. The rest is up to you."
197,1452652031,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7566522-ray-campbell,4,"I love dogs, thus my review of any discussion may be skewed - sorry. Bradshaw begins with a study of the origins of dogs which was nothing new, though fun to read again. The one point he makes on origins which I liked, and he builds on later in the book, is that while dogs are 99% genetically wolves, they are not wolves. The animal, which was a now extincted breed of grey wolf, has evolved into modern dogs and no longer exists as a unique animal. Thus, we can not understand dogs by studying wolves anymore than we can understand humans by studying chimps, though we share ancestors and are 99% genetically similar... dogs are dogs.The middle part of the book is a look at doggy psychology which is lots of fun. Bradshaw explores the research on training effectiveness, the emotional lives of our beloved fuzzy friends and the general benefits of positive versus negative training practices. I picked up some useful tips, but it mostly reinforced ideas I embrace.The last part of the book is commentary. Bradshaw becomes activist in his reflection on the purposes of breeding and the resulting dogs, the dangers and benefits of the various practices. As he explains problems and mismatches, he becomes increasingly passionate about issues with over-breeding, puppy-mills and his vision of the best direction we can take for the sake of dogs and the happiness of our lives with them.Lots of great insight and lots of fun while clearly based on solid research. This is not a ""how-to"" book. This is a look at our friends and an exploration of how they think and how we might use current research to understand them and make decisions about them. If you love dogs, you'll love this book. If you are having issues, you might find a helpful insight. If you are looking for step by step instructions or a study of a specific breed - not here. I liked this book and would like to recommend it, though I hope I've been clear on what it is. Woof."
198,1452652031,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1713788-sarah,4,"This book is a sort of guide to better understanding dogs. It made me appreciate my favorite animal even more.Bradshaw's take on dogs' social, emotional, and physical lives is based on an evolutionary perspective. He points out that many popular ideas on training and dealing with dogs are based on bad logic. We look to a not-directly-related specie of captive wolf to understand how our dogs, who have been selectively bred for thousands of years for life among humans, behave. I think Bradshaw's angle of looking at how and why humans have domesticated and bred dogs gives a much more realistic, useful interpretation.This book made me understand why dogs are ""man's best friend"". We are both social creatures who evolved in cooperative groups, not just domination hierarchies. We are well-adapted to learn and read each others' body language and to take pleasure in interacting with each other.It expanded my understanding of how dogs think, feel, and behave, and made me realize that they interpret and experience the world in very different ways than we do (particularly their sense of smell). So, while it's tempting to anthropomorphize our little buddies and assume that they feel and understand just like us, that's a dangerous assumption that asks too much of dogs.It also raises some concerns about the future of dogs in our society. By breeding for dogs who seek human companionship above any other kind, we are creating dogs prone to separation anxiety. By purchasing dogs based on appearance, we are putting dogs bred for certain kinds of lifestyles (e.g., hunting, herding) in incompatible environments, then wondering why they react negatively.This book was well-written with as much research as he could find to support his claims. Bradshaw obviously appreciates dogs and wants to educate others so we can all appreciate and treat them well."
199,1452652031,http://goodreads.com/user/show/537331-araminta-matthews,3,"I read this book hoping to learn some of my very own human tricks that would allow me to better relate to and interact with my dog. That isn't exactly what I received, though I'm enough of an amateur scientist to have gleaned, connected, and otherwise sussed out of this book what I needed to improve my whippet-rearing tactics (and before you ask, yes, my dog is a rescue; not a store-bought pedigree). This book does a great job laying out science, studies, and general observations of canine history, behavior, and socialization, but it falls short of recommending methods promised by its title that would ""make you a better friend to your pet."" At the same time, there were a few things I found interesting that I'll share. For one, research has found that negative reinforcers produce only 12% obedience rates, whereas positive reinforcers or rewards produce 60% obedience rates, according to Bradshaw. In addition, Bradshaw effectively debunks the notion that dogs experience the human emotion of ""guilt,"" and furthermore, demonstrates clear science to support the idea that Ddgs have a different brand of intelligence to primates (and thus can't be compared to us on emotional scales--they aren't the same). At the same time, he does argue that dogs consistently outperform even chimpanzees at reading human facial expressions, vocal tones, commands, and gestures. I'll leave my review on one note that struck me to the point of necessitating a full quotation. No tears, fellow-dog-moms: p.171: “Dogs really do miss their owners when they are separated from them. Many dogs also seem to become much more emotionally fragile under sudden shocks, such as the noise of fireworks going off. . . they find it difficult to cope without us.” "
200,1452652031,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1161667-shel,4,"While there's nothing earth-shattering here, the book makes an excellent point that in order to relate better to our canine companions we ought to invest more effort in thinking about how they perceive the world.Perhaps that's the most surprising revelation here: how little scientific and purposeful thought we've given to how our dogs friends think and what makes them happy. While, dogs on the other hand, watch and respond sensitively to our every move and mood.The book counters some conventional wisdom and wrong-thinking which has lead to misguided and harmful training techniques i.e. dogs do not behave like wolves. They do not need to be dominated and, in fact, this can cause them anxiety and fear.This book is part of a growing and useful trend toward delving more into the emotional lives of animals, not in the sense of anthropormorphizing, but rather in perceiving the world in the way another species would. Dogs, for example, have a huge olfactory world available to them.It's a helpful point of view. Bradshaw makes a strong case for the need to think about how to access and maximize the potential of the inner world of dogs to help them integrate and be our companions in modern society rather than simply breeding them to look a certain way - often to the detriment of their health and temperament.The book ends on a pessimistic note about the fate of dogs, if their needs are not taken into consideration. As a dog lover, I have to feel more hopeful about the future of dogs. What would we do without them? Loyal dog people will certainly read books like this and speak out to make changes (in training techniques, breeding, welfare) on the dogs' behalf. Won't they?"
201,1452652031,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2716223-julie,5,"This is, by far, one of the best books I've read on dog behavior and training. Bradshaw walks the reader through the previous held theories of wolf behavior and how dog training - based on captive wolf behavior (not wild wolves) can lead humans to train dogs in a manner that is not fair to the true nature of dogs. This book justified many of my gut reactions on my experiences training dogs. I've never been comfortable employing punishment or negative techniques preferring instead to observe the dog and work with the personality that each dog has. Many other trainers, such at Patricia McConnell and Pat Miller, practice positive dog training techniques and I'm a huge fan of their work. Bradshaw, however, adds more context - based on research - around the nature of dogs and their connectivity to humans. The research covers not only the ""lupomorph"" model but also tackles the breeding of dogs and how breeding for looks and not behavior has created dogs with far greater health and behavior problems than ever before. This book is a must read for anyone remotely interested in animal behavior. I'd even say that anyone who has a dog or is thinking of getting a dog should read this as the insight is invaluable as one works with (and even choses) a dog. Bradshaw ends the book with this line: ""Addressing the twin pressures of misguided breeding and poor understanding of canine psychology is crucial to ensuring that dogs remain as significant a part of human life as they have ben for the past ten millennia. My hope is that this book will make some contribution toward that goal."" I believe it has. "
202,1452652031,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1783712-kelly,5,"Absolutely fascinating book. It's a little slow in some parts but seems scientifically sound (in my not-especially-informed opinion) and provides compelling evidence for why looking at modern wolf behavior tells us precious little about domesticated dogs. The science makes a strong case for basing dog training in rewards rather than punishment. The book also covers the major problems caused by breeding for looks rather than companionship traits. The most shocking statistic: pedigree dogs have lost about 40 percent of their genetic variation due to inbreeding, which is the equivalent of a WHOLE BREED having a gene pool no more diverse than human first cousins (p. 255). This certainly explains some of the health problems we've had with our purebred golden retrievers. I also enjoyed the chapters on what the world is like from a dog's perspective--what emotions they are capable of feeling, what colors they see, how they make use of their heightened sense of smell, how they communicate with other dogs, etc. (Spoiler alert: there is no evidence that dogs can feel jealousy, guilt, pride, or shame. Yelling at your dog for chewing up a shoe while you were away just makes them confused and anxious, enough so that they may begin to associate your return home with anxiety and punishment. They don't have the presence of mind to connect the punishment with having chewed the shoe earlier, much less to feel guilty about it.)This really is a must-read for dog owners. I will keep this information in mind for future dog purchases as I consider breeds, training programs, and the way I interact with my pet."
203,1452652031,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2755825-ellen-broadhurst,5,"Dog Sense is an excellent read for someone interested in a layman's overview of dog behavior and psychology research. Basically offering evidence that refutes the ""dominant down"" sort of dog training (which I find puzzling: are there still people who subscribe to this??), the author offers insights into how dogs differ from wolves, how dogs interact with their environment, how dogs (probably) perceive their care-taker humans, their hearth and home, and how dogs (likely) interact with each other. As a half way intelligent dog owner who has already internalized much of the message Bradshaw is delivering, most of the book was not a revelation. That said, there were golden nuggets that made Dog Sense well worth a read. It is also exactly the sort of book I would give to a non-dog person considering getting a dog. One of the biggest, obvious mistakes people make in getting a ""first dog"" is not taking the time to understand what a dog really is, how they operate and how best to integrate a dog into your household. As someone who had done the research upfront, hired a trainer before getting the dog, and ultimately adopting a nearly-perfect 5 year old dog (who came, super polite, house trained, crate trained, didn't chew, etc), I *still* made some beginner mistakes; books like this aren't going to solve training problems, but it should give readers a broader perspective that helps them think about the 'whole' dog when they are integrating a dog into the household, or trying to problem-solve issues do arise. "
204,1452652031,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1279767-nita,4,"The author's main premise is that as we continue to expect more and more obedience and human-like behavior from our dogs since our world continues to change into one where we have less and less time for them, we must spend more time breeding them to behave as the dogs we want as pets and less time worrying about what they look like. He has very strong opinions about how this should be done. And while I agree with the author that the old dominance-aggression based training methods used by popular dog trainers such as Cesar Millan need to go the way of the dinosaur, the author said it so many times in so many different ways that it got very old quickly. Still, I enjoyed the book and found his insights helpful in thinking about the way I have trained dogs in the past and how I might select and train a pet dog in the future. This is not a training manual, but a scientific study of canine evolution. I found it especially interesting that the dog did not evolve directly from the wolf, but rather more likely from a common ancestor. No wonder dog training methods that use wolf behavior as a foundation for training our highly domesticated pet dogs is so off base! He maintains that the dog's strongest evolutionary trait is to want to please us, but is often confused about how to go about it. It's our job not to punish bad behavior which the dog has likely forgotten as soon as we've entered the room, but to use positive techniques to teach and breed dogs to be the best companions possible."
205,1452652031,http://goodreads.com/user/show/975391-steven,3,"Bradshaw looks at dogs and their long interaction with our species, considering this relationship from scratch -- without all the baggage and traditionally-taught notions about what dogs are thinking. It's a good approach, although maybe not what readers might expect.He's upfront with stating that this is NOT a training manual. Rather, he looks at the trends and beliefs that have informed dog trainers, and holds up a mirror of genetics, evolution, and behavioral studies. One of his major goals is to debunk the idea that our modern dogs are just ""little wolves,"" vying for position in a pack, or a indeed, a human household. He points out that most studies of wolf behavior are either based on specifically local populations of modern wolves, or are based on captive groups, neither of which are typical. And in either case, their behavior doesn't have much to do with creatures that split from a common ancestor tens of thousands of years ago.Bradshaw discusses several ideas that I found intriguing, including the fact that dogs seem to be more focused on people than on other dogs, that we often overestimate dogs' ability to process information and their capacity for self-reflection. He also discusses their physiology and how it differs from humans, giving insight into how they see, hear and, of course, smell in very different ways from us. A good book. Quite sciencey, but there's nothing wrong with that. I certainly looked at the canine's I'm in charge of differently while reading this book. So much so, that the next book I plan to read is about dogs and their minds, too."
206,1452652031,http://goodreads.com/user/show/69313297-jina,2,"Honestly, Dr. John Bradshaw irritated me. He disagreed with a lot of the findings discussed in The Genius of Dogs (note that Dog Sense was published 2 years before), but that’s not what irritated me. He goes on and on and on in the first half of his book about why it doesn’t make any sense to look at wolves to understand dog behaviour. Then, in the second to last chapter of his book, he has the nerve to say that humans are ruining the way dogs can communicate with each other the more we breed them to look less like a wolf. Like -wait a minute. If we should not be looking at wolves to understand dog behaviour, why are we looking at how wolves communicate to make a statement that the less dogs look like the wolves, the less expressive their faces are, and, therefore, the less they are able to effectively communicate with their fellow dogs. This hypocrisy annoyed me mostly because of how much Dr. Bradshaw reiterates over and over and over again about how it doesn’t make any sense to compare dogs to wolves. “My view is that the key to understanding the domestic dog is, first and foremost, to understand the domestic dog… By analyzing the dog has its own animal rather than a lesser version of the wolf, we have the opportunity to understand it and refine our dealings with it as never before.” - Evidently, this statement doesn’t apply to how dogs communicate."
207,1452652031,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4689182-ronald,5,"A very well written book representing the evolution of the present day dog from a common ancestor with todays wolf. He points out that dogs did not evolve from the wolf. He postulates how todays canid became domesticated primarily to serve man primarily as a help in sheparding, hunting and other practical purposes. Man began breeding dogs for specific traits which enhanced these skills. Breeds have become increasingly inbred This inbreeding for physical attributes has become problematic to the health of some breed. Breed and show organizations have been the root cause of this problem. The role of dogs todays is providing a companion a to its owner more so then for practical work purpose. Some breeds still carry the work traits that they were originally bred. Those original work traits make certain breeds less suitable for companion purposes.Bradshaw speaks to the physical, perceptual and psychological make up of dogs such as their superior scent capability. He offers for consideration ideas of how people and more effectively interface with there dogs for the positive benefit of both.I enjoyed reading this book since I have had dogs since I was a young lad. I wish that I new then what I have learned now."
208,1452652031,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5041758-heather-hunter,3,"I was pretty intrigued by this title though I passed it over a few times initially at my local library before picking it up. (I'm always looking for ways to be a better friend to my pets.) Although portions of it, mainly on the evolutionary history of dogs, were interesting, I probably should have followed my gut on this one. I kept finding myself literally falling asleep after a few pages and, by a few weeks in, had only made it halfway through. Perhaps the second half is better, but I just couldn't bear it anymore and had to turn to something else. Parts of the theory on the behavior of domestic dogs as it relates to that of wolves was particularly confusing, in as much as the author states many times that the two should not be compared due to many distinct differences and, yet, continues to do so himself. I was kind of left feeling much like I do about politics- that comparisons were being made only when it was useful to support this point of view.I may try again someday since I can borrow it for free, but I think on this one I'd have to say I'd rather go with MY instincts about how to interact with my dogs."
209,1452652031,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4534004-chel,5,"This is not a how-to book for a dog owner. It's more of a book about how to evaluate all the other how-to books. Bradshaw looks at what researchers have learned about the evolution of domestic dogs; how they are and are not like their nearest relative, the wolf; what we know about how their senses perceive, how they learn, their intelligence, their emotions, and what the breeding of specific strains has meant for the wellbeing of dogs today. At times it's a little difficult to figure out who he is writing for -- the reading is a little heavy in places for the recreational reader, offering what seems to be a full literature review out of all the various studies, frequently noting what we don't know, as well as what we do know. But I imagine he is defending himself from criticisms of his conclusions from people who would cite the studies he did not.I most appreciated his strong refutation of the idea that the dog's world must have an ""alpha"" character, a boss, and if humans don't take pains to assume that role, then the dog will. Good riddance to that way of thinking -- now I am going to go play tug-of-war with my dog!"
210,1452652031,http://goodreads.com/user/show/923535-greg-pettit,3,"Very enjoyable, although the author had a tendency to repeat some points over and over again, such as ""Dogs are not Wolves"" and ""Dogs are not People."" Both points formed touchstones for arguments against a lot of currently accepted thought about dog behavior. There were a lot of informative takeaways from the book, without it getting to dense or technical."

216,1452652031,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6052204-tracey,4,"In Dog Sense: How the New Science of Dog Behavior Can Make You a Better Friend to Your Pet, Bradshaw includes scads of information about wolves, about the evolution of the dog from the wolf and into a relationship with human society, about modern scientific studies on dog behavior, and about modern dog breeding and in-breeding, etc. He also discusses the human/dog bond, common errors humans make in understanding their dogs, and some comparisons between our species. Bradshaw launches his book with an engaging preface, describing two of the dogs of his childhood, Ginger and Alexis, the first of which he knew only from family legends that outlasted her. It's a great start, but much of the book relies on a stiffer and more formal voice, perhaps due to the scientific nature of the content.Some of what Bradshaw includes in his book is also in Mark Derr's book, How the Dog Became the Dog: From Wolves to Our Best Friends-- a book I liked less well than Bradshaw's. A few of the studies cited have also aired in PBS or National Geographic shows. For example, those showing that dogs outperform chimpanzees in some tasks, including: interpretation of human facial expressions, responsiveness to human pointing, and the ability to use humans as resources when attempting to get to a desired object, such as a tasty bit of food. There's also the Siberian fox domestication experiment.But much in this book is new, to me anyway. And when Bradshaw gets on a roll, his writing can be lively and pleasurable, spotted here and there with the kind of facts and ideas that one wants to read out loud to whomever is in earshot. For example, puppies begin to learn their mother's scent while they're still in the womb. Unborn pups gestating within a bitch who's had aniseed in her diet will gravitate to the scent of aniseed after they're born. And cats can hear higher frequencies than dogs. Or how about this?: after watching a scripted interaction between a ""beggar"" person, a ""generous"" person (who gives the beggar food or whatever), and a ""selfish"" person (who turns the beggar away), dogs prefer to interact with the ""generous"" person. Fascinating stuff. However, long passages seem to exist for the purpose of refuting those who disagree with ""the new science."" These parts are less accessible, come across as argumentative, and are repetitive, too. For example, it seems that Chapters 1 through 3 could have been shortened considerably, in part by moving some of the more involved material to footnotes, a text box, or an appendix. The writing style and organization of these chapters, and their fit into the whole, also made me wonder if they were pulled from articles he'd previously written. My biggest complaint about the book is that it does not, I think,fully deliver on its subtitle, neither describing ""the new science of dog behavior"" clearly enough nor telling the reader how to apply this science to be ""a better friend"" to one's pet. (One exception is an excerpt giving instructions on how to a dog of separation anxiety.) The book does explain, repeatedly, what the new science is not: it is not the old science of seeing dogs as wolves in disguise, ambitious to gain alpha status in the household. It is not about owners claiming the alpha role and keeping the dog in its beta, or omega, place. And it does not employ physical punishment.But Dog Sense contains a lot of interesting material, is well written (if not always consistently accessible), and its author is a pleasant enough chap to spend time with --- humane, intelligent, sensible, compassionate. Knowledgeable, of course. If the reader has a little patience, this book may vastly enrich how you see the world of dogs."
217,1452652031,http://goodreads.com/user/show/9003269-meghan,3,"Although I knew, going in, that this book contradicts what I personally feel about dogs, I strive to keep my eyes and ears open and was willing to give this book a shot. I have done my best to review this book on it's own merits, and not based on my own personal bias.And.. it reminds me of listening to one of my relatives. You know the type: he's armed with a couple of real concrete scientific facts and then scrapes those along to cover his own opinions. By repeating himself several times, he thinks you will be too stupid to figure out that everything he says (minus the actual science) is really just his own opinion dressed up with scientific jargon. But the author's repetitions of ""we can assume"", ""it's obvious that"", and ""we can suppose"" were a dead giveaway to how much of this was just his own views. Rather disappointing from a biologist. This book, imho, has the nearly identical issues as The Wolf in the Parlor: The Eternal Connection between Humans and Dogs: too little actual data to cover the author's premise, and therefore the claims are all questionable. Mr. Bradshaw did, however, avoid the pitfall of describing his own dogs as his main proof. Unfortunately he made another mistake: getting on a soapbox about a popular dog trainer. It became a bit much, honestly, and came across as a bitch-fest instead of an intellectual discourse.It isn't that I think this book was entirely wrong or that I got nothing out of it. I did find the discussion on purebred dogs and having dogs bred specifically for the pet market interesting (. I found some of his dog science interesting, even if I didn't agree with his conclusions. I laughed out loud when he mentioned 'pee-mail'. I enjoyed his comments on how dogs see the world (even if I think most dog owners are aware how important smell is to our dogs), and did think this was relatively easy to listen to- the writing flowed smoothly and the sentence structure was never boring despite the scientific words. The studies he includes on puppies do give us insight into how dogs bond with humans, and there were a number of other studies included that I found interesting as well. The idea that temperament testing of puppies really tells us very little about grown dogs was new to me, and I will read more on that subject (as I have always put a lot of faith in this for choosing puppies).I do suggest this author Never Ever Ever write about domestic cats again. Ever. He clearly hasn't lived with or observed cats at all, and cats are a crappy example for what he was trying to prove. As always, this is only my own opinion. Clearly other readers were far more impressed than I was, and I invite you to read this book and form your own thoughts. Note: this is NOT a dog training manual. With the exception of a bit about helping dog separation anxiety (which he calls separation distress, for his own reasons that were a bit unclear to me), there is no training advice here. I'm not sure he really took much of a stand on what sort of training was best (other than that he hates dominance theory). "

222,1452652031,http://goodreads.com/user/show/24179583-evan,4,"I enjoyed this book and found the information helpful. The author speaks to how the environment for dogs has changed with our urbanization and higher expectations that dogs must be under their owners control at all times. Also dogs are used less and less as workers and more and more as companions. The most responsible dog owners usually neuter their pets so these companion dogs do not get to pass on their genetics. It is the working dogs, the show dogs, and the dogs of irresponsible owners who are most likely to pass on their genes. Dogs are not wolves and they are not little people. They have a strong urge to bond to people. They live in the moment. Except in rare cases physical punishment of a dog is counterproductive as it creates a less trusting, less bonded, more anxious animal. If punishment is used it must be immediate. The dog cannot understand being punished for something in the past. Reward based training generates a happy, trusting animal. Dogs naturally wish to please. Most of their negative behavior is the result of fear, not an urge to dominate. When selecting a companion dog stay away from the most popular and thus inbred breeds where genetic weaknesses are concentrated. The first eight weeks of the puppy’s life is very important in determining its personality. Look for a puppy who has been raised in a home and who has had a variety of experiences. A puppy who has lived isolated in a kennel or backroom somewhere is likely to be fearful and maladjusted. Taking a young dog to obedience training class exposes the dog to other dogs and people as well as teaching it important commands. Much of this information is commonsense, but I appreciate the reinforcement. The book could have shorter. As others have pointed out there was considerable repetition. The information that was repeated was important information so I did not find it overly annoying. Having dog companions for most of my life and having trained several of them in obedience and agility I can attest to the value of reward based training versus punishment based. Dogs just become fearful when they are hurt. Eventually a fearful dog may become aggressive out of self-defense. The author explains what dogs are capable of understanding. It is unfair to hold an animal responsible for something that is beyond its capability to comprehend. "
223,1452652031,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1356959-h-w,3,A mix of the author's conclusions regarding particular scientific studies on dogs mixed with his personal impressions of what makes dogs tick. It would have been nice if he had more actual animal training experience (like animal behaviorists Karen Pryor or Patricia McConnell) that would have given his ideas more credibility. I think the positive take away from this book is that you need to think critically about the things you've heard and assumed to be true about dog behavior since much of the conventional information out there is likely to be wrong.
224,1452652031,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5438598-don,5,"I enjoyed this book VERY much and highly recommend it to anyone who lives with a dog and wants to understand more of what's going on in their furry little heads. Understanding more of what dogs think and experience can only make your life with them better.Strangely, there are elements in this book which also apply to how we relate to our fellow humans. One huge theme in this book is rethinking the idea that we should treat dog ownership into a constant reassertion of our dominance because dogs inherit the drive for dominance from wolves. As it turns out, dogs left on their own form familial units, not rigid hierarchies. And wolves in the wild also form familial groups, unlike the stressed groups of unrelated wolves observed in captivity. So constantly browbeating your dog is only going to turn a potential loving family member into a stressed out roommate.Why does this apply to humans? Because we have also allowed ourselves to buy into the old dominance model ""wolf pack"" for human interactions. From the workplace and it's obsessively ""alpha"" managers to our interactions with government ""public servants"", we have gotten locked into a pathological system where we are increasingly told what to do and to shut up about what we really think. This is a situation in dire need of rethinking. But back to the book...Dogs are creatures who have been co-evolving with the human race for tens of thousands of years and are one of the few creatures capable of forming stronger bonds to another species than to their own.But if you have a dog around, you also need to understand how it thinks. While amazingly capable of predicting what humans they know are going to do, dogs do NOT have the capability to understandthe consequences of their actions. A crucial example offered is the dog with separation anxiety, who only knows that sometimes when his owner comes back, the owner gets REALLY angry...so he gets increasingly stressed and chews something to bits. And then the owner gets angry...Dogs love us and chances are, if you are thinking about reading this book, you love them too. I recommend this book as a tool to help make that relationship as good as it can possibly be."
225,1452652031,http://goodreads.com/user/show/21256356-jocelyn,4,"I was going to give this book three stars but in the end decided not to. It's hard to find dog behavior books that are based objectively off of scientific evidence, and Dog Sense came close.Now, I say ""close"" because an incident early on in my reading undermined a lot of the confidence I had in the author's sources--in chapter 3 (p.92 in my version), after spending a while bashing some rather well-known trainers' techniques, Bradshaw gives an example list of ""commandments"" that people of those training methods allegedly must follow.This list contains ridiculous elements such as ""Do not cuddle or stroke your dog"" and ""Do not allow your dog to climb your stairs,"" and eventually I decided to just check the source that it came from. It turns out that the list is idealized to portray the most exaggerated of those trainers' tenets and was written by a critic of the method in question; obviously the reader is not told about this in the text and show quite clearly that Bradshaw is extremely biased and in this case at least has cherry-picked his ""cases.""So I will say, be wary of the sources he cites, since they might be chosen out of fields of other data just to better prove his point. Nevertheless, everything else that I checked after that seemed to be on-target, and his points about dog psychology are valid. This was one of the more scientifically well-founded dog books that I've read, and as such was in some ways more enlightening than, say, a dog-raising manual or a book on methods of training.Dog Sense doesn't really impart any great knowledge about training techniques but only about how dogs might think and why they act the way they do. It talks about the origins of common problems in dogs (separation anxiety is a big one) but doesn't go into any depth about how to solve the problems, but that's acceptable since it never advertised that it would provide any solutions and since there are so many other great sources on the subject.Overall, it's mostly just an educational read with little practical importance. I enjoyed it despite my wariness after that sketchy-source incident."
226,1452652031,http://goodreads.com/user/show/399070-nick,3,"Dog Sense provides a valuable survey of what scientists currently know about dogs, and it illustrates how far behind lags the practice of owning and training dogs. For example, the first misconception that Bradshaw attacks is the characterization of dogs as essentially wolves always striving to achieve alpha status. Modern research into wolf packs in the wild – not those fabricated by captivity – reveals a social structure recognizable as a family unit, with younger wolves deferring naturally to their parents, not to the strongest and most dominant. And Bradshaw argues convincingly that dogs have come a long way from their wolf ancestors.Bradshaw is first and foremost a scientist. His book makes for disappointingly dry reading, as he earnestly attempts to present the facts and describe the methodology and results of individual experiments. Yet he clearly cares deeply about the welfare of dogs: his outrage at the ignorant mistreatment of dogs is palpable. When science cannot conclusively show whether dogs experience emotions as humans do, he makes a leap of faith, seeing no reason to deny that dogs experience something we would recognize as love.Despite the book's title, Bradshaw's focus is on enlightening readers about dogs as a species. Only in passing does he occasionally instruct readers on how to be better dog owners. His book would be most valuable to those who assume wrongly that dogs must be forced to submit, or that dogs always understand why you punish them, or that dogs perceive the world in basically the same way that we do.Like those scientists who are trying to convince people that yes, global warming is real and a real problem, Bradshaw's main goal is to raise awareness. But although many of the challenges facing dogs are societal, such as the growing expectations of canine discipline in urban areas, and the ongoing efforts of breeders to optimize for (brittle) appearances instead of suitability for companionship, this eye-opening book can revolutionize how you understand your dog. The rest is up to you."
227,1452652031,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7566522-ray-campbell,4,"I love dogs, thus my review of any discussion may be skewed - sorry. Bradshaw begins with a study of the origins of dogs which was nothing new, though fun to read again. The one point he makes on origins which I liked, and he builds on later in the book, is that while dogs are 99% genetically wolves, they are not wolves. The animal, which was a now extincted breed of grey wolf, has evolved into modern dogs and no longer exists as a unique animal. Thus, we can not understand dogs by studying wolves anymore than we can understand humans by studying chimps, though we share ancestors and are 99% genetically similar... dogs are dogs.The middle part of the book is a look at doggy psychology which is lots of fun. Bradshaw explores the research on training effectiveness, the emotional lives of our beloved fuzzy friends and the general benefits of positive versus negative training practices. I picked up some useful tips, but it mostly reinforced ideas I embrace.The last part of the book is commentary. Bradshaw becomes activist in his reflection on the purposes of breeding and the resulting dogs, the dangers and benefits of the various practices. As he explains problems and mismatches, he becomes increasingly passionate about issues with over-breeding, puppy-mills and his vision of the best direction we can take for the sake of dogs and the happiness of our lives with them.Lots of great insight and lots of fun while clearly based on solid research. This is not a ""how-to"" book. This is a look at our friends and an exploration of how they think and how we might use current research to understand them and make decisions about them. If you love dogs, you'll love this book. If you are having issues, you might find a helpful insight. If you are looking for step by step instructions or a study of a specific breed - not here. I liked this book and would like to recommend it, though I hope I've been clear on what it is. Woof."
228,1452652031,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1713788-sarah,4,"This book is a sort of guide to better understanding dogs. It made me appreciate my favorite animal even more.Bradshaw's take on dogs' social, emotional, and physical lives is based on an evolutionary perspective. He points out that many popular ideas on training and dealing with dogs are based on bad logic. We look to a not-directly-related specie of captive wolf to understand how our dogs, who have been selectively bred for thousands of years for life among humans, behave. I think Bradshaw's angle of looking at how and why humans have domesticated and bred dogs gives a much more realistic, useful interpretation.This book made me understand why dogs are ""man's best friend"". We are both social creatures who evolved in cooperative groups, not just domination hierarchies. We are well-adapted to learn and read each others' body language and to take pleasure in interacting with each other.It expanded my understanding of how dogs think, feel, and behave, and made me realize that they interpret and experience the world in very different ways than we do (particularly their sense of smell). So, while it's tempting to anthropomorphize our little buddies and assume that they feel and understand just like us, that's a dangerous assumption that asks too much of dogs.It also raises some concerns about the future of dogs in our society. By breeding for dogs who seek human companionship above any other kind, we are creating dogs prone to separation anxiety. By purchasing dogs based on appearance, we are putting dogs bred for certain kinds of lifestyles (e.g., hunting, herding) in incompatible environments, then wondering why they react negatively.This book was well-written with as much research as he could find to support his claims. Bradshaw obviously appreciates dogs and wants to educate others so we can all appreciate and treat them well."
229,1452652031,http://goodreads.com/user/show/537331-araminta-matthews,3,"I read this book hoping to learn some of my very own human tricks that would allow me to better relate to and interact with my dog. That isn't exactly what I received, though I'm enough of an amateur scientist to have gleaned, connected, and otherwise sussed out of this book what I needed to improve my whippet-rearing tactics (and before you ask, yes, my dog is a rescue; not a store-bought pedigree). This book does a great job laying out science, studies, and general observations of canine history, behavior, and socialization, but it falls short of recommending methods promised by its title that would ""make you a better friend to your pet."" At the same time, there were a few things I found interesting that I'll share. For one, research has found that negative reinforcers produce only 12% obedience rates, whereas positive reinforcers or rewards produce 60% obedience rates, according to Bradshaw. In addition, Bradshaw effectively debunks the notion that dogs experience the human emotion of ""guilt,"" and furthermore, demonstrates clear science to support the idea that Ddgs have a different brand of intelligence to primates (and thus can't be compared to us on emotional scales--they aren't the same). At the same time, he does argue that dogs consistently outperform even chimpanzees at reading human facial expressions, vocal tones, commands, and gestures. I'll leave my review on one note that struck me to the point of necessitating a full quotation. No tears, fellow-dog-moms: p.171: “Dogs really do miss their owners when they are separated from them. Many dogs also seem to become much more emotionally fragile under sudden shocks, such as the noise of fireworks going off. . . they find it difficult to cope without us.” "
230,1452652031,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1161667-shel,4,"While there's nothing earth-shattering here, the book makes an excellent point that in order to relate better to our canine companions we ought to invest more effort in thinking about how they perceive the world.Perhaps that's the most surprising revelation here: how little scientific and purposeful thought we've given to how our dogs friends think and what makes them happy. While, dogs on the other hand, watch and respond sensitively to our every move and mood.The book counters some conventional wisdom and wrong-thinking which has lead to misguided and harmful training techniques i.e. dogs do not behave like wolves. They do not need to be dominated and, in fact, this can cause them anxiety and fear.This book is part of a growing and useful trend toward delving more into the emotional lives of animals, not in the sense of anthropormorphizing, but rather in perceiving the world in the way another species would. Dogs, for example, have a huge olfactory world available to them.It's a helpful point of view. Bradshaw makes a strong case for the need to think about how to access and maximize the potential of the inner world of dogs to help them integrate and be our companions in modern society rather than simply breeding them to look a certain way - often to the detriment of their health and temperament.The book ends on a pessimistic note about the fate of dogs, if their needs are not taken into consideration. As a dog lover, I have to feel more hopeful about the future of dogs. What would we do without them? Loyal dog people will certainly read books like this and speak out to make changes (in training techniques, breeding, welfare) on the dogs' behalf. Won't they?"
231,1452652031,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2716223-julie,5,"This is, by far, one of the best books I've read on dog behavior and training. Bradshaw walks the reader through the previous held theories of wolf behavior and how dog training - based on captive wolf behavior (not wild wolves) can lead humans to train dogs in a manner that is not fair to the true nature of dogs. This book justified many of my gut reactions on my experiences training dogs. I've never been comfortable employing punishment or negative techniques preferring instead to observe the dog and work with the personality that each dog has. Many other trainers, such at Patricia McConnell and Pat Miller, practice positive dog training techniques and I'm a huge fan of their work. Bradshaw, however, adds more context - based on research - around the nature of dogs and their connectivity to humans. The research covers not only the ""lupomorph"" model but also tackles the breeding of dogs and how breeding for looks and not behavior has created dogs with far greater health and behavior problems than ever before. This book is a must read for anyone remotely interested in animal behavior. I'd even say that anyone who has a dog or is thinking of getting a dog should read this as the insight is invaluable as one works with (and even choses) a dog. Bradshaw ends the book with this line: ""Addressing the twin pressures of misguided breeding and poor understanding of canine psychology is crucial to ensuring that dogs remain as significant a part of human life as they have ben for the past ten millennia. My hope is that this book will make some contribution toward that goal."" I believe it has. "
232,1452652031,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1783712-kelly,5,"Absolutely fascinating book. It's a little slow in some parts but seems scientifically sound (in my not-especially-informed opinion) and provides compelling evidence for why looking at modern wolf behavior tells us precious little about domesticated dogs. The science makes a strong case for basing dog training in rewards rather than punishment. The book also covers the major problems caused by breeding for looks rather than companionship traits. The most shocking statistic: pedigree dogs have lost about 40 percent of their genetic variation due to inbreeding, which is the equivalent of a WHOLE BREED having a gene pool no more diverse than human first cousins (p. 255). This certainly explains some of the health problems we've had with our purebred golden retrievers. I also enjoyed the chapters on what the world is like from a dog's perspective--what emotions they are capable of feeling, what colors they see, how they make use of their heightened sense of smell, how they communicate with other dogs, etc. (Spoiler alert: there is no evidence that dogs can feel jealousy, guilt, pride, or shame. Yelling at your dog for chewing up a shoe while you were away just makes them confused and anxious, enough so that they may begin to associate your return home with anxiety and punishment. They don't have the presence of mind to connect the punishment with having chewed the shoe earlier, much less to feel guilty about it.)This really is a must-read for dog owners. I will keep this information in mind for future dog purchases as I consider breeds, training programs, and the way I interact with my pet."
233,1452652031,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2755825-ellen-broadhurst,5,"Dog Sense is an excellent read for someone interested in a layman's overview of dog behavior and psychology research. Basically offering evidence that refutes the ""dominant down"" sort of dog training (which I find puzzling: are there still people who subscribe to this??), the author offers insights into how dogs differ from wolves, how dogs interact with their environment, how dogs (probably) perceive their care-taker humans, their hearth and home, and how dogs (likely) interact with each other. As a half way intelligent dog owner who has already internalized much of the message Bradshaw is delivering, most of the book was not a revelation. That said, there were golden nuggets that made Dog Sense well worth a read. It is also exactly the sort of book I would give to a non-dog person considering getting a dog. One of the biggest, obvious mistakes people make in getting a ""first dog"" is not taking the time to understand what a dog really is, how they operate and how best to integrate a dog into your household. As someone who had done the research upfront, hired a trainer before getting the dog, and ultimately adopting a nearly-perfect 5 year old dog (who came, super polite, house trained, crate trained, didn't chew, etc), I *still* made some beginner mistakes; books like this aren't going to solve training problems, but it should give readers a broader perspective that helps them think about the 'whole' dog when they are integrating a dog into the household, or trying to problem-solve issues do arise. "
234,1452652031,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1279767-nita,4,"The author's main premise is that as we continue to expect more and more obedience and human-like behavior from our dogs since our world continues to change into one where we have less and less time for them, we must spend more time breeding them to behave as the dogs we want as pets and less time worrying about what they look like. He has very strong opinions about how this should be done. And while I agree with the author that the old dominance-aggression based training methods used by popular dog trainers such as Cesar Millan need to go the way of the dinosaur, the author said it so many times in so many different ways that it got very old quickly. Still, I enjoyed the book and found his insights helpful in thinking about the way I have trained dogs in the past and how I might select and train a pet dog in the future. This is not a training manual, but a scientific study of canine evolution. I found it especially interesting that the dog did not evolve directly from the wolf, but rather more likely from a common ancestor. No wonder dog training methods that use wolf behavior as a foundation for training our highly domesticated pet dogs is so off base! He maintains that the dog's strongest evolutionary trait is to want to please us, but is often confused about how to go about it. It's our job not to punish bad behavior which the dog has likely forgotten as soon as we've entered the room, but to use positive techniques to teach and breed dogs to be the best companions possible."
235,1452652031,http://goodreads.com/user/show/975391-steven,3,"Bradshaw looks at dogs and their long interaction with our species, considering this relationship from scratch -- without all the baggage and traditionally-taught notions about what dogs are thinking. It's a good approach, although maybe not what readers might expect.He's upfront with stating that this is NOT a training manual. Rather, he looks at the trends and beliefs that have informed dog trainers, and holds up a mirror of genetics, evolution, and behavioral studies. One of his major goals is to debunk the idea that our modern dogs are just ""little wolves,"" vying for position in a pack, or a indeed, a human household. He points out that most studies of wolf behavior are either based on specifically local populations of modern wolves, or are based on captive groups, neither of which are typical. And in either case, their behavior doesn't have much to do with creatures that split from a common ancestor tens of thousands of years ago.Bradshaw discusses several ideas that I found intriguing, including the fact that dogs seem to be more focused on people than on other dogs, that we often overestimate dogs' ability to process information and their capacity for self-reflection. He also discusses their physiology and how it differs from humans, giving insight into how they see, hear and, of course, smell in very different ways from us. A good book. Quite sciencey, but there's nothing wrong with that. I certainly looked at the canine's I'm in charge of differently while reading this book. So much so, that the next book I plan to read is about dogs and their minds, too."
236,1452652031,http://goodreads.com/user/show/69313297-jina,2,"Honestly, Dr. John Bradshaw irritated me. He disagreed with a lot of the findings discussed in The Genius of Dogs (note that Dog Sense was published 2 years before), but that’s not what irritated me. He goes on and on and on in the first half of his book about why it doesn’t make any sense to look at wolves to understand dog behaviour. Then, in the second to last chapter of his book, he has the nerve to say that humans are ruining the way dogs can communicate with each other the more we breed them to look less like a wolf. Like -wait a minute. If we should not be looking at wolves to understand dog behaviour, why are we looking at how wolves communicate to make a statement that the less dogs look like the wolves, the less expressive their faces are, and, therefore, the less they are able to effectively communicate with their fellow dogs. This hypocrisy annoyed me mostly because of how much Dr. Bradshaw reiterates over and over and over again about how it doesn’t make any sense to compare dogs to wolves. “My view is that the key to understanding the domestic dog is, first and foremost, to understand the domestic dog… By analyzing the dog has its own animal rather than a lesser version of the wolf, we have the opportunity to understand it and refine our dealings with it as never before.” - Evidently, this statement doesn’t apply to how dogs communicate."
237,1452652031,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4689182-ronald,5,"A very well written book representing the evolution of the present day dog from a common ancestor with todays wolf. He points out that dogs did not evolve from the wolf. He postulates how todays canid became domesticated primarily to serve man primarily as a help in sheparding, hunting and other practical purposes. Man began breeding dogs for specific traits which enhanced these skills. Breeds have become increasingly inbred This inbreeding for physical attributes has become problematic to the health of some breed. Breed and show organizations have been the root cause of this problem. The role of dogs todays is providing a companion a to its owner more so then for practical work purpose. Some breeds still carry the work traits that they were originally bred. Those original work traits make certain breeds less suitable for companion purposes.Bradshaw speaks to the physical, perceptual and psychological make up of dogs such as their superior scent capability. He offers for consideration ideas of how people and more effectively interface with there dogs for the positive benefit of both.I enjoyed reading this book since I have had dogs since I was a young lad. I wish that I new then what I have learned now."
238,1452652031,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5041758-heather-hunter,3,"I was pretty intrigued by this title though I passed it over a few times initially at my local library before picking it up. (I'm always looking for ways to be a better friend to my pets.) Although portions of it, mainly on the evolutionary history of dogs, were interesting, I probably should have followed my gut on this one. I kept finding myself literally falling asleep after a few pages and, by a few weeks in, had only made it halfway through. Perhaps the second half is better, but I just couldn't bear it anymore and had to turn to something else. Parts of the theory on the behavior of domestic dogs as it relates to that of wolves was particularly confusing, in as much as the author states many times that the two should not be compared due to many distinct differences and, yet, continues to do so himself. I was kind of left feeling much like I do about politics- that comparisons were being made only when it was useful to support this point of view.I may try again someday since I can borrow it for free, but I think on this one I'd have to say I'd rather go with MY instincts about how to interact with my dogs."
239,1452652031,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4534004-chel,5,"This is not a how-to book for a dog owner. It's more of a book about how to evaluate all the other how-to books. Bradshaw looks at what researchers have learned about the evolution of domestic dogs; how they are and are not like their nearest relative, the wolf; what we know about how their senses perceive, how they learn, their intelligence, their emotions, and what the breeding of specific strains has meant for the wellbeing of dogs today. At times it's a little difficult to figure out who he is writing for -- the reading is a little heavy in places for the recreational reader, offering what seems to be a full literature review out of all the various studies, frequently noting what we don't know, as well as what we do know. But I imagine he is defending himself from criticisms of his conclusions from people who would cite the studies he did not.I most appreciated his strong refutation of the idea that the dog's world must have an ""alpha"" character, a boss, and if humans don't take pains to assume that role, then the dog will. Good riddance to that way of thinking -- now I am going to go play tug-of-war with my dog!"
240,1452652031,http://goodreads.com/user/show/923535-greg-pettit,3,"Very enjoyable, although the author had a tendency to repeat some points over and over again, such as ""Dogs are not Wolves"" and ""Dogs are not People."" Both points formed touchstones for arguments against a lot of currently accepted thought about dog behavior. There were a lot of informative takeaways from the book, without it getting to dense or technical."

246,1452652031,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6052204-tracey,4,"In Dog Sense: How the New Science of Dog Behavior Can Make You a Better Friend to Your Pet, Bradshaw includes scads of information about wolves, about the evolution of the dog from the wolf and into a relationship with human society, about modern scientific studies on dog behavior, and about modern dog breeding and in-breeding, etc. He also discusses the human/dog bond, common errors humans make in understanding their dogs, and some comparisons between our species. Bradshaw launches his book with an engaging preface, describing two of the dogs of his childhood, Ginger and Alexis, the first of which he knew only from family legends that outlasted her. It's a great start, but much of the book relies on a stiffer and more formal voice, perhaps due to the scientific nature of the content.Some of what Bradshaw includes in his book is also in Mark Derr's book, How the Dog Became the Dog: From Wolves to Our Best Friends-- a book I liked less well than Bradshaw's. A few of the studies cited have also aired in PBS or National Geographic shows. For example, those showing that dogs outperform chimpanzees in some tasks, including: interpretation of human facial expressions, responsiveness to human pointing, and the ability to use humans as resources when attempting to get to a desired object, such as a tasty bit of food. There's also the Siberian fox domestication experiment.But much in this book is new, to me anyway. And when Bradshaw gets on a roll, his writing can be lively and pleasurable, spotted here and there with the kind of facts and ideas that one wants to read out loud to whomever is in earshot. For example, puppies begin to learn their mother's scent while they're still in the womb. Unborn pups gestating within a bitch who's had aniseed in her diet will gravitate to the scent of aniseed after they're born. And cats can hear higher frequencies than dogs. Or how about this?: after watching a scripted interaction between a ""beggar"" person, a ""generous"" person (who gives the beggar food or whatever), and a ""selfish"" person (who turns the beggar away), dogs prefer to interact with the ""generous"" person. Fascinating stuff. However, long passages seem to exist for the purpose of refuting those who disagree with ""the new science."" These parts are less accessible, come across as argumentative, and are repetitive, too. For example, it seems that Chapters 1 through 3 could have been shortened considerably, in part by moving some of the more involved material to footnotes, a text box, or an appendix. The writing style and organization of these chapters, and their fit into the whole, also made me wonder if they were pulled from articles he'd previously written. My biggest complaint about the book is that it does not, I think,fully deliver on its subtitle, neither describing ""the new science of dog behavior"" clearly enough nor telling the reader how to apply this science to be ""a better friend"" to one's pet. (One exception is an excerpt giving instructions on how to a dog of separation anxiety.) The book does explain, repeatedly, what the new science is not: it is not the old science of seeing dogs as wolves in disguise, ambitious to gain alpha status in the household. It is not about owners claiming the alpha role and keeping the dog in its beta, or omega, place. And it does not employ physical punishment.But Dog Sense contains a lot of interesting material, is well written (if not always consistently accessible), and its author is a pleasant enough chap to spend time with --- humane, intelligent, sensible, compassionate. Knowledgeable, of course. If the reader has a little patience, this book may vastly enrich how you see the world of dogs."

I have done my best to review this book on it's own merits, and not based on my own personal bias.And.. it reminds me of listening to one of my relatives. You know the type: he's armed with a couple of real concrete scientific facts and then scrapes those along to cover his own opinions. By repeating himself several times, he thinks you will be too stupid to figure out that everything he says (minus the actual science) is really just his own opinion dressed up with scientific jargon. But the author's repetitions of ""we can assume"", ""it's obvious that"", and ""we can suppose"" were a dead giveaway to how much of this was just his own views. Rather disappointing from a biologist. This book, imho, has the nearly identical issues as The Wolf in the Parlor: The Eternal Connection between Humans and Dogs: too little actual data to cover the author's premise, and therefore the claims are all questionable. Mr. Bradshaw did, however, avoid the pitfall of describing his own dogs as his main proof. Unfortunately he made another mistake: getting on a soapbox about a popular dog trainer. It became a bit much, honestly, and came across as a bitch-fest instead of an intellectual discourse.It isn't that I think this book was entirely wrong or that I got nothing out of it. I did find the discussion on purebred dogs and having dogs bred specifically for the pet market interesting (. I found some of his dog science interesting, even if I didn't agree with his conclusions. I laughed out loud when he mentioned 'pee-mail'. I enjoyed his comments on how dogs see the world (even if I think most dog owners are aware how important smell is to our dogs), and did think this was relatively easy to listen to- the writing flowed smoothly and the sentence structure was never boring despite the scientific words. The studies he includes on puppies do give us insight into how dogs bond with humans, and there were a number of other studies included that I found interesting as well. The idea that temperament testing of puppies really tells us very little about grown dogs was new to me, and I will read more on that subject (as I have always put a lot of faith in this for choosing puppies).I do suggest this author Never Ever Ever write about domestic cats again. Ever. He clearly hasn't lived with or observed cats at all, and cats are a crappy example for what he was trying to prove. As always, this is only my own opinion. Clearly other readers were far more impressed than I was, and I invite you to read this book and form your own thoughts. Note: this is NOT a dog training manual. With the exception of a bit about helping dog separation anxiety (which he calls separation distress, for his own reasons that were a bit unclear to me), there is no training advice here. I'm not sure he really took much of a stand on what sort of training was best (other than that he hates dominance theory). "

252,1452652031,http://goodreads.com/user/show/24179583-evan,4,"I enjoyed this book and found the information helpful. The author speaks to how the environment for dogs has changed with our urbanization and higher expectations that dogs must be under their owners control at all times. Also dogs are used less and less as workers and more and more as companions. The most responsible dog owners usually neuter their pets so these companion dogs do not get to pass on their genetics. It is the working dogs, the show dogs, and the dogs of irresponsible owners who are most likely to pass on their genes. Dogs are not wolves and they are not little people. They have a strong urge to bond to people. They live in the moment. Except in rare cases physical punishment of a dog is counterproductive as it creates a less trusting, less bonded, more anxious animal. If punishment is used it must be immediate. The dog cannot understand being punished for something in the past. Reward based training generates a happy, trusting animal. Dogs naturally wish to please. Most of their negative behavior is the result of fear, not an urge to dominate. When selecting a companion dog stay away from the most popular and thus inbred breeds where genetic weaknesses are concentrated. The first eight weeks of the puppy’s life is very important in determining its personality. Look for a puppy who has been raised in a home and who has had a variety of experiences. A puppy who has lived isolated in a kennel or backroom somewhere is likely to be fearful and maladjusted. Taking a young dog to obedience training class exposes the dog to other dogs and people as well as teaching it important commands. Much of this information is commonsense, but I appreciate the reinforcement. The book could have shorter. As others have pointed out there was considerable repetition. The information that was repeated was important information so I did not find it overly annoying. Having dog companions for most of my life and having trained several of them in obedience and agility I can attest to the value of reward based training versus punishment based. Dogs just become fearful when they are hurt. Eventually a fearful dog may become aggressive out of self-defense. The author explains what dogs are capable of understanding. It is unfair to hold an animal responsible for something that is beyond its capability to comprehend. "
253,1452652031,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1356959-h-w,3,A mix of the author's conclusions regarding particular scientific studies on dogs mixed with his personal impressions of what makes dogs tick. It would have been nice if he had more actual animal training experience (like animal behaviorists Karen Pryor or Patricia McConnell) that would have given his ideas more credibility. I think the positive take away from this book is that you need to think critically about the things you've heard and assumed to be true about dog behavior since much of the conventional information out there is likely to be wrong.
254,1452652031,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5438598-don,5,"I enjoyed this book VERY much and highly recommend it to anyone who lives with a dog and wants to understand more of what's going on in their furry little heads. Understanding more of what dogs think and experience can only make your life with them better.Strangely, there are elements in this book which also apply to how we relate to our fellow humans. One huge theme in this book is rethinking the idea that we should treat dog ownership into a constant reassertion of our dominance because dogs inherit the drive for dominance from wolves. As it turns out, dogs left on their own form familial units, not rigid hierarchies. And wolves in the wild also form familial groups, unlike the stressed groups of unrelated wolves observed in captivity. So constantly browbeating your dog is only going to turn a potential loving family member into a stressed out roommate.Why does this apply to humans? Because we have also allowed ourselves to buy into the old dominance model ""wolf pack"" for human interactions. From the workplace and it's obsessively ""alpha"" managers to our interactions with government ""public servants"", we have gotten locked into a pathological system where we are increasingly told what to do and to shut up about what we really think. This is a situation in dire need of rethinking. But back to the book...Dogs are creatures who have been co-evolving with the human race for tens of thousands of years and are one of the few creatures capable of forming stronger bonds to another species than to their own.But if you have a dog around, you also need to understand how it thinks. While amazingly capable of predicting what humans they know are going to do, dogs do NOT have the capability to understandthe consequences of their actions. A crucial example offered is the dog with separation anxiety, who only knows that sometimes when his owner comes back, the owner gets REALLY angry...so he gets increasingly stressed and chews something to bits. And then the owner gets angry...Dogs love us and chances are, if you are thinking about reading this book, you love them too. I recommend this book as a tool to help make that relationship as good as it can possibly be."
255,1452652031,http://goodreads.com/user/show/21256356-jocelyn,4,"I was going to give this book three stars but in the end decided not to. It's hard to find dog behavior books that are based objectively off of scientific evidence, and Dog Sense came close.Now, I say ""close"" because an incident early on in my reading undermined a lot of the confidence I had in the author's sources--in chapter 3 (p.92 in my version), after spending a while bashing some rather well-known trainers' techniques, Bradshaw gives an example list of ""commandments"" that people of those training methods allegedly must follow.This list contains ridiculous elements such as ""Do not cuddle or stroke your dog"" and ""Do not allow your dog to climb your stairs,"" and eventually I decided to just check the source that it came from. It turns out that the list is idealized to portray the most exaggerated of those trainers' tenets and was written by a critic of the method in question; obviously the reader is not told about this in the text and show quite clearly that Bradshaw is extremely biased and in this case at least has cherry-picked his ""cases.""So I will say, be wary of the sources he cites, since they might be chosen out of fields of other data just to better prove his point. Nevertheless, everything else that I checked after that seemed to be on-target, and his points about dog psychology are valid. This was one of the more scientifically well-founded dog books that I've read, and as such was in some ways more enlightening than, say, a dog-raising manual or a book on methods of training.Dog Sense doesn't really impart any great knowledge about training techniques but only about how dogs might think and why they act the way they do. It talks about the origins of common problems in dogs (separation anxiety is a big one) but doesn't go into any depth about how to solve the problems, but that's acceptable since it never advertised that it would provide any solutions and since there are so many other great sources on the subject.Overall, it's mostly just an educational read with little practical importance. I enjoyed it despite my wariness after that sketchy-source incident."
256,1452652031,http://goodreads.com/user/show/399070-nick,3,"Dog Sense provides a valuable survey of what scientists currently know about dogs, and it illustrates how far behind lags the practice of owning and training dogs. For example, the first misconception that Bradshaw attacks is the characterization of dogs as essentially wolves always striving to achieve alpha status. Modern research into wolf packs in the wild – not those fabricated by captivity – reveals a social structure recognizable as a family unit, with younger wolves deferring naturally to their parents, not to the strongest and most dominant. And Bradshaw argues convincingly that dogs have come a long way from their wolf ancestors.Bradshaw is first and foremost a scientist. His book makes for disappointingly dry reading, as he earnestly attempts to present the facts and describe the methodology and results of individual experiments. Yet he clearly cares deeply about the welfare of dogs: his outrage at the ignorant mistreatment of dogs is palpable. When science cannot conclusively show whether dogs experience emotions as humans do, he makes a leap of faith, seeing no reason to deny that dogs experience something we would recognize as love.Despite the book's title, Bradshaw's focus is on enlightening readers about dogs as a species. Only in passing does he occasionally instruct readers on how to be better dog owners. His book would be most valuable to those who assume wrongly that dogs must be forced to submit, or that dogs always understand why you punish them, or that dogs perceive the world in basically the same way that we do.Like those scientists who are trying to convince people that yes, global warming is real and a real problem, Bradshaw's main goal is to raise awareness. But although many of the challenges facing dogs are societal, such as the growing expectations of canine discipline in urban areas, and the ongoing efforts of breeders to optimize for (brittle) appearances instead of suitability for companionship, this eye-opening book can revolutionize how you understand your dog. The rest is up to you."
257,1452652031,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7566522-ray-campbell,4,"I love dogs, thus my review of any discussion may be skewed - sorry. Bradshaw begins with a study of the origins of dogs which was nothing new, though fun to read again. The one point he makes on origins which I liked, and he builds on later in the book, is that while dogs are 99% genetically wolves, they are not wolves. The animal, which was a now extincted breed of grey wolf, has evolved into modern dogs and no longer exists as a unique animal. Thus, we can not understand dogs by studying wolves anymore than we can understand humans by studying chimps, though we share ancestors and are 99% genetically similar... dogs are dogs.The middle part of the book is a look at doggy psychology which is lots of fun. Bradshaw explores the research on training effectiveness, the emotional lives of our beloved fuzzy friends and the general benefits of positive versus negative training practices. I picked up some useful tips, but it mostly reinforced ideas I embrace.The last part of the book is commentary. Bradshaw becomes activist in his reflection on the purposes of breeding and the resulting dogs, the dangers and benefits of the various practices. As he explains problems and mismatches, he becomes increasingly passionate about issues with over-breeding, puppy-mills and his vision of the best direction we can take for the sake of dogs and the happiness of our lives with them.Lots of great insight and lots of fun while clearly based on solid research. This is not a ""how-to"" book. This is a look at our friends and an exploration of how they think and how we might use current research to understand them and make decisions about them. If you love dogs, you'll love this book. If you are having issues, you might find a helpful insight. If you are looking for step by step instructions or a study of a specific breed - not here. I liked this book and would like to recommend it, though I hope I've been clear on what it is. Woof."
258,1452652031,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1713788-sarah,4,"This book is a sort of guide to better understanding dogs. It made me appreciate my favorite animal even more.Bradshaw's take on dogs' social, emotional, and physical lives is based on an evolutionary perspective. He points out that many popular ideas on training and dealing with dogs are based on bad logic. We look to a not-directly-related specie of captive wolf to understand how our dogs, who have been selectively bred for thousands of years for life among humans, behave. I think Bradshaw's angle of looking at how and why humans have domesticated and bred dogs gives a much more realistic, useful interpretation.This book made me understand why dogs are ""man's best friend"". We are both social creatures who evolved in cooperative groups, not just domination hierarchies. We are well-adapted to learn and read each others' body language and to take pleasure in interacting with each other.It expanded my understanding of how dogs think, feel, and behave, and made me realize that they interpret and experience the world in very different ways than we do (particularly their sense of smell). So, while it's tempting to anthropomorphize our little buddies and assume that they feel and understand just like us, that's a dangerous assumption that asks too much of dogs.It also raises some concerns about the future of dogs in our society. By breeding for dogs who seek human companionship above any other kind, we are creating dogs prone to separation anxiety. By purchasing dogs based on appearance, we are putting dogs bred for certain kinds of lifestyles (e.g., hunting, herding) in incompatible environments, then wondering why they react negatively.This book was well-written with as much research as he could find to support his claims. Bradshaw obviously appreciates dogs and wants to educate others so we can all appreciate and treat them well."
259,1452652031,http://goodreads.com/user/show/537331-araminta-matthews,3,"I read this book hoping to learn some of my very own human tricks that would allow me to better relate to and interact with my dog. That isn't exactly what I received, though I'm enough of an amateur scientist to have gleaned, connected, and otherwise sussed out of this book what I needed to improve my whippet-rearing tactics (and before you ask, yes, my dog is a rescue; not a store-bought pedigree). This book does a great job laying out science, studies, and general observations of canine history, behavior, and socialization, but it falls short of recommending methods promised by its title that would ""make you a better friend to your pet."" At the same time, there were a few things I found interesting that I'll share. For one, research has found that negative reinforcers produce only 12% obedience rates, whereas positive reinforcers or rewards produce 60% obedience rates, according to Bradshaw. In addition, Bradshaw effectively debunks the notion that dogs experience the human emotion of ""guilt,"" and furthermore, demonstrates clear science to support the idea that Ddgs have a different brand of intelligence to primates (and thus can't be compared to us on emotional scales--they aren't the same). At the same time, he does argue that dogs consistently outperform even chimpanzees at reading human facial expressions, vocal tones, commands, and gestures. I'll leave my review on one note that struck me to the point of necessitating a full quotation. No tears, fellow-dog-moms: p.171: “Dogs really do miss their owners when they are separated from them. Many dogs also seem to become much more emotionally fragile under sudden shocks, such as the noise of fireworks going off. . . they find it difficult to cope without us.” "
260,1452652031,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1161667-shel,4,"While there's nothing earth-shattering here, the book makes an excellent point that in order to relate better to our canine companions we ought to invest more effort in thinking about how they perceive the world.Perhaps that's the most surprising revelation here: how little scientific and purposeful thought we've given to how our dogs friends think and what makes them happy. While, dogs on the other hand, watch and respond sensitively to our every move and mood.The book counters some conventional wisdom and wrong-thinking which has lead to misguided and harmful training techniques i.e. dogs do not behave like wolves. They do not need to be dominated and, in fact, this can cause them anxiety and fear.This book is part of a growing and useful trend toward delving more into the emotional lives of animals, not in the sense of anthropormorphizing, but rather in perceiving the world in the way another species would. Dogs, for example, have a huge olfactory world available to them.It's a helpful point of view. Bradshaw makes a strong case for the need to think about how to access and maximize the potential of the inner world of dogs to help them integrate and be our companions in modern society rather than simply breeding them to look a certain way - often to the detriment of their health and temperament.The book ends on a pessimistic note about the fate of dogs, if their needs are not taken into consideration. As a dog lover, I have to feel more hopeful about the future of dogs. What would we do without them? Loyal dog people will certainly read books like this and speak out to make changes (in training techniques, breeding, welfare) on the dogs' behalf. Won't they?"
261,1452652031,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2716223-julie,5,"This is, by far, one of the best books I've read on dog behavior and training. Bradshaw walks the reader through the previous held theories of wolf behavior and how dog training - based on captive wolf behavior (not wild wolves) can lead humans to train dogs in a manner that is not fair to the true nature of dogs. This book justified many of my gut reactions on my experiences training dogs. I've never been comfortable employing punishment or negative techniques preferring instead to observe the dog and work with the personality that each dog has. Many other trainers, such at Patricia McConnell and Pat Miller, practice positive dog training techniques and I'm a huge fan of their work. Bradshaw, however, adds more context - based on research - around the nature of dogs and their connectivity to humans. The research covers not only the ""lupomorph"" model but also tackles the breeding of dogs and how breeding for looks and not behavior has created dogs with far greater health and behavior problems than ever before. This book is a must read for anyone remotely interested in animal behavior. I'd even say that anyone who has a dog or is thinking of getting a dog should read this as the insight is invaluable as one works with (and even choses) a dog. Bradshaw ends the book with this line: ""Addressing the twin pressures of misguided breeding and poor understanding of canine psychology is crucial to ensuring that dogs remain as significant a part of human life as they have ben for the past ten millennia. My hope is that this book will make some contribution toward that goal."" I believe it has. "
262,1452652031,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1783712-kelly,5,"Absolutely fascinating book. It's a little slow in some parts but seems scientifically sound (in my not-especially-informed opinion) and provides compelling evidence for why looking at modern wolf behavior tells us precious little about domesticated dogs. The science makes a strong case for basing dog training in rewards rather than punishment. The book also covers the major problems caused by breeding for looks rather than companionship traits. The most shocking statistic: pedigree dogs have lost about 40 percent of their genetic variation due to inbreeding, which is the equivalent of a WHOLE BREED having a gene pool no more diverse than human first cousins (p. 255). This certainly explains some of the health problems we've had with our purebred golden retrievers. I also enjoyed the chapters on what the world is like from a dog's perspective--what emotions they are capable of feeling, what colors they see, how they make use of their heightened sense of smell, how they communicate with other dogs, etc. (Spoiler alert: there is no evidence that dogs can feel jealousy, guilt, pride, or shame. Yelling at your dog for chewing up a shoe while you were away just makes them confused and anxious, enough so that they may begin to associate your return home with anxiety and punishment. They don't have the presence of mind to connect the punishment with having chewed the shoe earlier, much less to feel guilty about it.)This really is a must-read for dog owners. I will keep this information in mind for future dog purchases as I consider breeds, training programs, and the way I interact with my pet."
263,1452652031,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2755825-ellen-broadhurst,5,"Dog Sense is an excellent read for someone interested in a layman's overview of dog behavior and psychology research. Basically offering evidence that refutes the ""dominant down"" sort of dog training (which I find puzzling: are there still people who subscribe to this??), the author offers insights into how dogs differ from wolves, how dogs interact with their environment, how dogs (probably) perceive their care-taker humans, their hearth and home, and how dogs (likely) interact with each other. As a half way intelligent dog owner who has already internalized much of the message Bradshaw is delivering, most of the book was not a revelation. That said, there were golden nuggets that made Dog Sense well worth a read. It is also exactly the sort of book I would give to a non-dog person considering getting a dog. One of the biggest, obvious mistakes people make in getting a ""first dog"" is not taking the time to understand what a dog really is, how they operate and how best to integrate a dog into your household. As someone who had done the research upfront, hired a trainer before getting the dog, and ultimately adopting a nearly-perfect 5 year old dog (who came, super polite, house trained, crate trained, didn't chew, etc), I *still* made some beginner mistakes; books like this aren't going to solve training problems, but it should give readers a broader perspective that helps them think about the 'whole' dog when they are integrating a dog into the household, or trying to problem-solve issues do arise. "
264,1452652031,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1279767-nita,4,"The author's main premise is that as we continue to expect more and more obedience and human-like behavior from our dogs since our world continues to change into one where we have less and less time for them, we must spend more time breeding them to behave as the dogs we want as pets and less time worrying about what they look like. He has very strong opinions about how this should be done. And while I agree with the author that the old dominance-aggression based training methods used by popular dog trainers such as Cesar Millan need to go the way of the dinosaur, the author said it so many times in so many different ways that it got very old quickly. Still, I enjoyed the book and found his insights helpful in thinking about the way I have trained dogs in the past and how I might select and train a pet dog in the future. This is not a training manual, but a scientific study of canine evolution. I found it especially interesting that the dog did not evolve directly from the wolf, but rather more likely from a common ancestor. No wonder dog training methods that use wolf behavior as a foundation for training our highly domesticated pet dogs is so off base! He maintains that the dog's strongest evolutionary trait is to want to please us, but is often confused about how to go about it. It's our job not to punish bad behavior which the dog has likely forgotten as soon as we've entered the room, but to use positive techniques to teach and breed dogs to be the best companions possible."
265,1452652031,http://goodreads.com/user/show/975391-steven,3,"Bradshaw looks at dogs and their long interaction with our species, considering this relationship from scratch -- without all the baggage and traditionally-taught notions about what dogs are thinking. It's a good approach, although maybe not what readers might expect.He's upfront with stating that this is NOT a training manual. Rather, he looks at the trends and beliefs that have informed dog trainers, and holds up a mirror of genetics, evolution, and behavioral studies. One of his major goals is to debunk the idea that our modern dogs are just ""little wolves,"" vying for position in a pack, or a indeed, a human household. He points out that most studies of wolf behavior are either based on specifically local populations of modern wolves, or are based on captive groups, neither of which are typical. And in either case, their behavior doesn't have much to do with creatures that split from a common ancestor tens of thousands of years ago.Bradshaw discusses several ideas that I found intriguing, including the fact that dogs seem to be more focused on people than on other dogs, that we often overestimate dogs' ability to process information and their capacity for self-reflection. He also discusses their physiology and how it differs from humans, giving insight into how they see, hear and, of course, smell in very different ways from us. A good book. Quite sciencey, but there's nothing wrong with that. I certainly looked at the canine's I'm in charge of differently while reading this book. So much so, that the next book I plan to read is about dogs and their minds, too."
266,1452652031,http://goodreads.com/user/show/69313297-jina,2,"Honestly, Dr. John Bradshaw irritated me. He disagreed with a lot of the findings discussed in The Genius of Dogs (note that Dog Sense was published 2 years before), but that’s not what irritated me. He goes on and on and on in the first half of his book about why it doesn’t make any sense to look at wolves to understand dog behaviour. Then, in the second to last chapter of his book, he has the nerve to say that humans are ruining the way dogs can communicate with each other the more we breed them to look less like a wolf. Like -wait a minute. If we should not be looking at wolves to understand dog behaviour, why are we looking at how wolves communicate to make a statement that the less dogs look like the wolves, the less expressive their faces are, and, therefore, the less they are able to effectively communicate with their fellow dogs. This hypocrisy annoyed me mostly because of how much Dr. Bradshaw reiterates over and over and over again about how it doesn’t make any sense to compare dogs to wolves. “My view is that the key to understanding the domestic dog is, first and foremost, to understand the domestic dog… By analyzing the dog has its own animal rather than a lesser version of the wolf, we have the opportunity to understand it and refine our dealings with it as never before.” - Evidently, this statement doesn’t apply to how dogs communicate."
267,1452652031,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4689182-ronald,5,"A very well written book representing the evolution of the present day dog from a common ancestor with todays wolf. He points out that dogs did not evolve from the wolf. He postulates how todays canid became domesticated primarily to serve man primarily as a help in sheparding, hunting and other practical purposes. Man began breeding dogs for specific traits which enhanced these skills. Breeds have become increasingly inbred This inbreeding for physical attributes has become problematic to the health of some breed. Breed and show organizations have been the root cause of this problem. The role of dogs todays is providing a companion a to its owner more so then for practical work purpose. Some breeds still carry the work traits that they were originally bred. Those original work traits make certain breeds less suitable for companion purposes.Bradshaw speaks to the physical, perceptual and psychological make up of dogs such as their superior scent capability. He offers for consideration ideas of how people and more effectively interface with there dogs for the positive benefit of both.I enjoyed reading this book since I have had dogs since I was a young lad. I wish that I new then what I have learned now."
268,1452652031,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5041758-heather-hunter,3,"I was pretty intrigued by this title though I passed it over a few times initially at my local library before picking it up. (I'm always looking for ways to be a better friend to my pets.) Although portions of it, mainly on the evolutionary history of dogs, were interesting, I probably should have followed my gut on this one. I kept finding myself literally falling asleep after a few pages and, by a few weeks in, had only made it halfway through. Perhaps the second half is better, but I just couldn't bear it anymore and had to turn to something else. Parts of the theory on the behavior of domestic dogs as it relates to that of wolves was particularly confusing, in as much as the author states many times that the two should not be compared due to many distinct differences and, yet, continues to do so himself. I was kind of left feeling much like I do about politics- that comparisons were being made only when it was useful to support this point of view.I may try again someday since I can borrow it for free, but I think on this one I'd have to say I'd rather go with MY instincts about how to interact with my dogs."
269,1452652031,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4534004-chel,5,"This is not a how-to book for a dog owner. It's more of a book about how to evaluate all the other how-to books. Bradshaw looks at what researchers have learned about the evolution of domestic dogs; how they are and are not like their nearest relative, the wolf; what we know about how their senses perceive, how they learn, their intelligence, their emotions, and what the breeding of specific strains has meant for the wellbeing of dogs today. At times it's a little difficult to figure out who he is writing for -- the reading is a little heavy in places for the recreational reader, offering what seems to be a full literature review out of all the various studies, frequently noting what we don't know, as well as what we do know. But I imagine he is defending himself from criticisms of his conclusions from people who would cite the studies he did not.I most appreciated his strong refutation of the idea that the dog's world must have an ""alpha"" character, a boss, and if humans don't take pains to assume that role, then the dog will. Good riddance to that way of thinking -- now I am going to go play tug-of-war with my dog!"
270,1452652031,http://goodreads.com/user/show/923535-greg-pettit,3,"Very enjoyable, although the author had a tendency to repeat some points over and over again, such as ""Dogs are not Wolves"" and ""Dogs are not People."" Both points formed touchstones for arguments against a lot of currently accepted thought about dog behavior. There were a lot of informative takeaways from the book, without it getting to dense or technical."

276,1452652031,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6052204-tracey,4,"In Dog Sense: How the New Science of Dog Behavior Can Make You a Better Friend to Your Pet, Bradshaw includes scads of information about wolves, about the evolution of the dog from the wolf and into a relationship with human society, about modern scientific studies on dog behavior, and about modern dog breeding and in-breeding, etc. He also discusses the human/dog bond, common errors humans make in understanding their dogs, and some comparisons between our species. Bradshaw launches his book with an engaging preface, describing two of the dogs of his childhood, Ginger and Alexis, the first of which he knew only from family legends that outlasted her. It's a great start, but much of the book relies on a stiffer and more formal voice, perhaps due to the scientific nature of the content.Some of what Bradshaw includes in his book is also in Mark Derr's book, How the Dog Became the Dog: From Wolves to Our Best Friends-- a book I liked less well than Bradshaw's. A few of the studies cited have also aired in PBS or National Geographic shows. For example, those showing that dogs outperform chimpanzees in some tasks, including: interpretation of human facial expressions, responsiveness to human pointing, and the ability to use humans as resources when attempting to get to a desired object, such as a tasty bit of food. There's also the Siberian fox domestication experiment.But much in this book is new, to me anyway. And when Bradshaw gets on a roll, his writing can be lively and pleasurable, spotted here and there with the kind of facts and ideas that one wants to read out loud to whomever is in earshot. For example, puppies begin to learn their mother's scent while they're still in the womb. Unborn pups gestating within a bitch who's had aniseed in her diet will gravitate to the scent of aniseed after they're born. And cats can hear higher frequencies than dogs. Or how about this?: after watching a scripted interaction between a ""beggar"" person, a ""generous"" person (who gives the beggar food or whatever), and a ""selfish"" person (who turns the beggar away), dogs prefer to interact with the ""generous"" person. Fascinating stuff. However, long passages seem to exist for the purpose of refuting those who disagree with ""the new science."" These parts are less accessible, come across as argumentative, and are repetitive, too. For example, it seems that Chapters 1 through 3 could have been shortened considerably, in part by moving some of the more involved material to footnotes, a text box, or an appendix. The writing style and organization of these chapters, and their fit into the whole, also made me wonder if they were pulled from articles he'd previously written. My biggest complaint about the book is that it does not, I think,fully deliver on its subtitle, neither describing ""the new science of dog behavior"" clearly enough nor telling the reader how to apply this science to be ""a better friend"" to one's pet. (One exception is an excerpt giving instructions on how to a dog of separation anxiety.) The book does explain, repeatedly, what the new science is not: it is not the old science of seeing dogs as wolves in disguise, ambitious to gain alpha status in the household. It is not about owners claiming the alpha role and keeping the dog in its beta, or omega, place. And it does not employ physical punishment.But Dog Sense contains a lot of interesting material, is well written (if not always consistently accessible), and its author is a pleasant enough chap to spend time with --- humane, intelligent, sensible, compassionate. Knowledgeable, of course. If the reader has a little patience, this book may vastly enrich how you see the world of dogs."
277,1452652031,http://goodreads.com/user/show/9003269-meghan,3,"Although I knew, going in, that this book contradicts what I personally feel about dogs, I strive to keep my eyes and ears open and was willing to give this book a shot. I have done my best to review this book on it's own merits, and not based on my own personal bias.And.. it reminds me of listening to one of my relatives. You know the type: he's armed with a couple of real concrete scientific facts and then scrapes those along to cover his own opinions. By repeating himself several times, he thinks you will be too stupid to figure out that everything he says (minus the actual science) is really just his own opinion dressed up with scientific jargon. But the author's repetitions of ""we can assume"", ""it's obvious that"", and ""we can suppose"" were a dead giveaway to how much of this was just his own views. Rather disappointing from a biologist. This book, imho, has the nearly identical issues as The Wolf in the Parlor: The Eternal Connection between Humans and Dogs: too little actual data to cover the author's premise, and therefore the claims are all questionable. Mr. Bradshaw did, however, avoid the pitfall of describing his own dogs as his main proof. Unfortunately he made another mistake: getting on a soapbox about a popular dog trainer. It became a bit much, honestly, and came across as a bitch-fest instead of an intellectual discourse.It isn't that I think this book was entirely wrong or that I got nothing out of it. I did find the discussion on purebred dogs and having dogs bred specifically for the pet market interesting (. I found some of his dog science interesting, even if I didn't agree with his conclusions. I laughed out loud when he mentioned 'pee-mail'. I enjoyed his comments on how dogs see the world (even if I think most dog owners are aware how important smell is to our dogs), and did think this was relatively easy to listen to- the writing flowed smoothly and the sentence structure was never boring despite the scientific words. The studies he includes on puppies do give us insight into how dogs bond with humans, and there were a number of other studies included that I found interesting as well. The idea that temperament testing of puppies really tells us very little about grown dogs was new to me, and I will read more on that subject (as I have always put a lot of faith in this for choosing puppies).I do suggest this author Never Ever Ever write about domestic cats again. Ever. He clearly hasn't lived with or observed cats at all, and cats are a crappy example for what he was trying to prove. As always, this is only my own opinion. Clearly other readers were far more impressed than I was, and I invite you to read this book and form your own thoughts. Note: this is NOT a dog training manual. With the exception of a bit about helping dog separation anxiety (which he calls separation distress, for his own reasons that were a bit unclear to me), there is no training advice here. I'm not sure he really took much of a stand on what sort of training was best (other than that he hates dominance theory). "

282,1452652031,http://goodreads.com/user/show/24179583-evan,4,"I enjoyed this book and found the information helpful. The author speaks to how the environment for dogs has changed with our urbanization and higher expectations that dogs must be under their owners control at all times. Also dogs are used less and less as workers and more and more as companions. The most responsible dog owners usually neuter their pets so these companion dogs do not get to pass on their genetics. It is the working dogs, the show dogs, and the dogs of irresponsible owners who are most likely to pass on their genes. Dogs are not wolves and they are not little people. They have a strong urge to bond to people. They live in the moment. Except in rare cases physical punishment of a dog is counterproductive as it creates a less trusting, less bonded, more anxious animal. If punishment is used it must be immediate. The dog cannot understand being punished for something in the past. Reward based training generates a happy, trusting animal. Dogs naturally wish to please. Most of their negative behavior is the result of fear, not an urge to dominate. When selecting a companion dog stay away from the most popular and thus inbred breeds where genetic weaknesses are concentrated. The first eight weeks of the puppy’s life is very important in determining its personality. Look for a puppy who has been raised in a home and who has had a variety of experiences. A puppy who has lived isolated in a kennel or backroom somewhere is likely to be fearful and maladjusted. Taking a young dog to obedience training class exposes the dog to other dogs and people as well as teaching it important commands. Much of this information is commonsense, but I appreciate the reinforcement. The book could have shorter. As others have pointed out there was considerable repetition. The information that was repeated was important information so I did not find it overly annoying. Having dog companions for most of my life and having trained several of them in obedience and agility I can attest to the value of reward based training versus punishment based. Dogs just become fearful when they are hurt. Eventually a fearful dog may become aggressive out of self-defense. The author explains what dogs are capable of understanding. It is unfair to hold an animal responsible for something that is beyond its capability to comprehend. "
283,1452652031,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1356959-h-w,3,A mix of the author's conclusions regarding particular scientific studies on dogs mixed with his personal impressions of what makes dogs tick. It would have been nice if he had more actual animal training experience (like animal behaviorists Karen Pryor or Patricia McConnell) that would have given his ideas more credibility. I think the positive take away from this book is that you need to think critically about the things you've heard and assumed to be true about dog behavior since much of the conventional information out there is likely to be wrong.
284,1452652031,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5438598-don,5,"I enjoyed this book VERY much and highly recommend it to anyone who lives with a dog and wants to understand more of what's going on in their furry little heads. Understanding more of what dogs think and experience can only make your life with them better.Strangely, there are elements in this book which also apply to how we relate to our fellow humans. One huge theme in this book is rethinking the idea that we should treat dog ownership into a constant reassertion of our dominance because dogs inherit the drive for dominance from wolves. As it turns out, dogs left on their own form familial units, not rigid hierarchies. And wolves in the wild also form familial groups, unlike the stressed groups of unrelated wolves observed in captivity. So constantly browbeating your dog is only going to turn a potential loving family member into a stressed out roommate.Why does this apply to humans? Because we have also allowed ourselves to buy into the old dominance model ""wolf pack"" for human interactions. From the workplace and it's obsessively ""alpha"" managers to our interactions with government ""public servants"", we have gotten locked into a pathological system where we are increasingly told what to do and to shut up about what we really think. This is a situation in dire need of rethinking. But back to the book...Dogs are creatures who have been co-evolving with the human race for tens of thousands of years and are one of the few creatures capable of forming stronger bonds to another species than to their own.But if you have a dog around, you also need to understand how it thinks. While amazingly capable of predicting what humans they know are going to do, dogs do NOT have the capability to understandthe consequences of their actions. A crucial example offered is the dog with separation anxiety, who only knows that sometimes when his owner comes back, the owner gets REALLY angry...so he gets increasingly stressed and chews something to bits. And then the owner gets angry...Dogs love us and chances are, if you are thinking about reading this book, you love them too. I recommend this book as a tool to help make that relationship as good as it can possibly be."
285,1452652031,http://goodreads.com/user/show/21256356-jocelyn,4,"I was going to give this book three stars but in the end decided not to. It's hard to find dog behavior books that are based objectively off of scientific evidence, and Dog Sense came close.Now, I say ""close"" because an incident early on in my reading undermined a lot of the confidence I had in the author's sources--in chapter 3 (p.92 in my version), after spending a while bashing some rather well-known trainers' techniques, Bradshaw gives an example list of ""commandments"" that people of those training methods allegedly must follow.This list contains ridiculous elements such as ""Do not cuddle or stroke your dog"" and ""Do not allow your dog to climb your stairs,"" and eventually I decided to just check the source that it came from. It turns out that the list is idealized to portray the most exaggerated of those trainers' tenets and was written by a critic of the method in question; obviously the reader is not told about this in the text and show quite clearly that Bradshaw is extremely biased and in this case at least has cherry-picked his ""cases.""So I will say, be wary of the sources he cites, since they might be chosen out of fields of other data just to better prove his point. Nevertheless, everything else that I checked after that seemed to be on-target, and his points about dog psychology are valid. This was one of the more scientifically well-founded dog books that I've read, and as such was in some ways more enlightening than, say, a dog-raising manual or a book on methods of training.Dog Sense doesn't really impart any great knowledge about training techniques but only about how dogs might think and why they act the way they do. It talks about the origins of common problems in dogs (separation anxiety is a big one) but doesn't go into any depth about how to solve the problems, but that's acceptable since it never advertised that it would provide any solutions and since there are so many other great sources on the subject.Overall, it's mostly just an educational read with little practical importance. I enjoyed it despite my wariness after that sketchy-source incident."
286,1452652031,http://goodreads.com/user/show/399070-nick,3,"Dog Sense provides a valuable survey of what scientists currently know about dogs, and it illustrates how far behind lags the practice of owning and training dogs. For example, the first misconception that Bradshaw attacks is the characterization of dogs as essentially wolves always striving to achieve alpha status. Modern research into wolf packs in the wild – not those fabricated by captivity – reveals a social structure recognizable as a family unit, with younger wolves deferring naturally to their parents, not to the strongest and most dominant. And Bradshaw argues convincingly that dogs have come a long way from their wolf ancestors.Bradshaw is first and foremost a scientist. His book makes for disappointingly dry reading, as he earnestly attempts to present the facts and describe the methodology and results of individual experiments. Yet he clearly cares deeply about the welfare of dogs: his outrage at the ignorant mistreatment of dogs is palpable. When science cannot conclusively show whether dogs experience emotions as humans do, he makes a leap of faith, seeing no reason to deny that dogs experience something we would recognize as love.Despite the book's title, Bradshaw's focus is on enlightening readers about dogs as a species. Only in passing does he occasionally instruct readers on how to be better dog owners. His book would be most valuable to those who assume wrongly that dogs must be forced to submit, or that dogs always understand why you punish them, or that dogs perceive the world in basically the same way that we do.Like those scientists who are trying to convince people that yes, global warming is real and a real problem, Bradshaw's main goal is to raise awareness. But although many of the challenges facing dogs are societal, such as the growing expectations of canine discipline in urban areas, and the ongoing efforts of breeders to optimize for (brittle) appearances instead of suitability for companionship, this eye-opening book can revolutionize how you understand your dog. The rest is up to you."
287,1452652031,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7566522-ray-campbell,4,"I love dogs, thus my review of any discussion may be skewed - sorry. Bradshaw begins with a study of the origins of dogs which was nothing new, though fun to read again. The one point he makes on origins which I liked, and he builds on later in the book, is that while dogs are 99% genetically wolves, they are not wolves. The animal, which was a now extincted breed of grey wolf, has evolved into modern dogs and no longer exists as a unique animal. Thus, we can not understand dogs by studying wolves anymore than we can understand humans by studying chimps, though we share ancestors and are 99% genetically similar... dogs are dogs.The middle part of the book is a look at doggy psychology which is lots of fun. Bradshaw explores the research on training effectiveness, the emotional lives of our beloved fuzzy friends and the general benefits of positive versus negative training practices. I picked up some useful tips, but it mostly reinforced ideas I embrace.The last part of the book is commentary. Bradshaw becomes activist in his reflection on the purposes of breeding and the resulting dogs, the dangers and benefits of the various practices. As he explains problems and mismatches, he becomes increasingly passionate about issues with over-breeding, puppy-mills and his vision of the best direction we can take for the sake of dogs and the happiness of our lives with them.Lots of great insight and lots of fun while clearly based on solid research. This is not a ""how-to"" book. This is a look at our friends and an exploration of how they think and how we might use current research to understand them and make decisions about them. If you love dogs, you'll love this book. If you are having issues, you might find a helpful insight. If you are looking for step by step instructions or a study of a specific breed - not here. I liked this book and would like to recommend it, though I hope I've been clear on what it is. Woof."
288,1452652031,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1713788-sarah,4,"This book is a sort of guide to better understanding dogs. It made me appreciate my favorite animal even more.Bradshaw's take on dogs' social, emotional, and physical lives is based on an evolutionary perspective. He points out that many popular ideas on training and dealing with dogs are based on bad logic. We look to a not-directly-related specie of captive wolf to understand how our dogs, who have been selectively bred for thousands of years for life among humans, behave. I think Bradshaw's angle of looking at how and why humans have domesticated and bred dogs gives a much more realistic, useful interpretation.This book made me understand why dogs are ""man's best friend"". We are both social creatures who evolved in cooperative groups, not just domination hierarchies. We are well-adapted to learn and read each others' body language and to take pleasure in interacting with each other.It expanded my understanding of how dogs think, feel, and behave, and made me realize that they interpret and experience the world in very different ways than we do (particularly their sense of smell). So, while it's tempting to anthropomorphize our little buddies and assume that they feel and understand just like us, that's a dangerous assumption that asks too much of dogs.It also raises some concerns about the future of dogs in our society. By breeding for dogs who seek human companionship above any other kind, we are creating dogs prone to separation anxiety. By purchasing dogs based on appearance, we are putting dogs bred for certain kinds of lifestyles (e.g., hunting, herding) in incompatible environments, then wondering why they react negatively.This book was well-written with as much research as he could find to support his claims. Bradshaw obviously appreciates dogs and wants to educate others so we can all appreciate and treat them well."
289,1452652031,http://goodreads.com/user/show/537331-araminta-matthews,3,"I read this book hoping to learn some of my very own human tricks that would allow me to better relate to and interact with my dog. That isn't exactly what I received, though I'm enough of an amateur scientist to have gleaned, connected, and otherwise sussed out of this book what I needed to improve my whippet-rearing tactics (and before you ask, yes, my dog is a rescue; not a store-bought pedigree). This book does a great job laying out science, studies, and general observations of canine history, behavior, and socialization, but it falls short of recommending methods promised by its title that would ""make you a better friend to your pet."" At the same time, there were a few things I found interesting that I'll share. For one, research has found that negative reinforcers produce only 12% obedience rates, whereas positive reinforcers or rewards produce 60% obedience rates, according to Bradshaw. In addition, Bradshaw effectively debunks the notion that dogs experience the human emotion of ""guilt,"" and furthermore, demonstrates clear science to support the idea that Ddgs have a different brand of intelligence to primates (and thus can't be compared to us on emotional scales--they aren't the same). At the same time, he does argue that dogs consistently outperform even chimpanzees at reading human facial expressions, vocal tones, commands, and gestures. I'll leave my review on one note that struck me to the point of necessitating a full quotation. No tears, fellow-dog-moms: p.171: “Dogs really do miss their owners when they are separated from them. Many dogs also seem to become much more emotionally fragile under sudden shocks, such as the noise of fireworks going off. . . they find it difficult to cope without us.” "
290,1452652031,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1161667-shel,4,"While there's nothing earth-shattering here, the book makes an excellent point that in order to relate better to our canine companions we ought to invest more effort in thinking about how they perceive the world.Perhaps that's the most surprising revelation here: how little scientific and purposeful thought we've given to how our dogs friends think and what makes them happy. While, dogs on the other hand, watch and respond sensitively to our every move and mood.The book counters some conventional wisdom and wrong-thinking which has lead to misguided and harmful training techniques i.e. dogs do not behave like wolves. They do not need to be dominated and, in fact, this can cause them anxiety and fear.This book is part of a growing and useful trend toward delving more into the emotional lives of animals, not in the sense of anthropormorphizing, but rather in perceiving the world in the way another species would. Dogs, for example, have a huge olfactory world available to them.It's a helpful point of view. Bradshaw makes a strong case for the need to think about how to access and maximize the potential of the inner world of dogs to help them integrate and be our companions in modern society rather than simply breeding them to look a certain way - often to the detriment of their health and temperament.The book ends on a pessimistic note about the fate of dogs, if their needs are not taken into consideration. As a dog lover, I have to feel more hopeful about the future of dogs. What would we do without them? Loyal dog people will certainly read books like this and speak out to make changes (in training techniques, breeding, welfare) on the dogs' behalf. Won't they?"
291,1452652031,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2716223-julie,5,"This is, by far, one of the best books I've read on dog behavior and training. Bradshaw walks the reader through the previous held theories of wolf behavior and how dog training - based on captive wolf behavior (not wild wolves) can lead humans to train dogs in a manner that is not fair to the true nature of dogs. This book justified many of my gut reactions on my experiences training dogs. I've never been comfortable employing punishment or negative techniques preferring instead to observe the dog and work with the personality that each dog has. Many other trainers, such at Patricia McConnell and Pat Miller, practice positive dog training techniques and I'm a huge fan of their work. Bradshaw, however, adds more context - based on research - around the nature of dogs and their connectivity to humans. The research covers not only the ""lupomorph"" model but also tackles the breeding of dogs and how breeding for looks and not behavior has created dogs with far greater health and behavior problems than ever before. This book is a must read for anyone remotely interested in animal behavior. I'd even say that anyone who has a dog or is thinking of getting a dog should read this as the insight is invaluable as one works with (and even choses) a dog. Bradshaw ends the book with this line: ""Addressing the twin pressures of misguided breeding and poor understanding of canine psychology is crucial to ensuring that dogs remain as significant a part of human life as they have ben for the past ten millennia. My hope is that this book will make some contribution toward that goal."" I believe it has. "
292,1452652031,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1783712-kelly,5,"Absolutely fascinating book. It's a little slow in some parts but seems scientifically sound (in my not-especially-informed opinion) and provides compelling evidence for why looking at modern wolf behavior tells us precious little about domesticated dogs. The science makes a strong case for basing dog training in rewards rather than punishment. The book also covers the major problems caused by breeding for looks rather than companionship traits. The most shocking statistic: pedigree dogs have lost about 40 percent of their genetic variation due to inbreeding, which is the equivalent of a WHOLE BREED having a gene pool no more diverse than human first cousins (p. 255). This certainly explains some of the health problems we've had with our purebred golden retrievers. I also enjoyed the chapters on what the world is like from a dog's perspective--what emotions they are capable of feeling, what colors they see, how they make use of their heightened sense of smell, how they communicate with other dogs, etc. (Spoiler alert: there is no evidence that dogs can feel jealousy, guilt, pride, or shame. Yelling at your dog for chewing up a shoe while you were away just makes them confused and anxious, enough so that they may begin to associate your return home with anxiety and punishment. They don't have the presence of mind to connect the punishment with having chewed the shoe earlier, much less to feel guilty about it.)This really is a must-read for dog owners. I will keep this information in mind for future dog purchases as I consider breeds, training programs, and the way I interact with my pet."
293,1452652031,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2755825-ellen-broadhurst,5,"Dog Sense is an excellent read for someone interested in a layman's overview of dog behavior and psychology research. Basically offering evidence that refutes the ""dominant down"" sort of dog training (which I find puzzling: are there still people who subscribe to this??), the author offers insights into how dogs differ from wolves, how dogs interact with their environment, how dogs (probably) perceive their care-taker humans, their hearth and home, and how dogs (likely) interact with each other. As a half way intelligent dog owner who has already internalized much of the message Bradshaw is delivering, most of the book was not a revelation. That said, there were golden nuggets that made Dog Sense well worth a read. It is also exactly the sort of book I would give to a non-dog person considering getting a dog. One of the biggest, obvious mistakes people make in getting a ""first dog"" is not taking the time to understand what a dog really is, how they operate and how best to integrate a dog into your household. As someone who had done the research upfront, hired a trainer before getting the dog, and ultimately adopting a nearly-perfect 5 year old dog (who came, super polite, house trained, crate trained, didn't chew, etc), I *still* made some beginner mistakes; books like this aren't going to solve training problems, but it should give readers a broader perspective that helps them think about the 'whole' dog when they are integrating a dog into the household, or trying to problem-solve issues do arise. "
294,1452652031,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1279767-nita,4,"The author's main premise is that as we continue to expect more and more obedience and human-like behavior from our dogs since our world continues to change into one where we have less and less time for them, we must spend more time breeding them to behave as the dogs we want as pets and less time worrying about what they look like. He has very strong opinions about how this should be done. And while I agree with the author that the old dominance-aggression based training methods used by popular dog trainers such as Cesar Millan need to go the way of the dinosaur, the author said it so many times in so many different ways that it got very old quickly. Still, I enjoyed the book and found his insights helpful in thinking about the way I have trained dogs in the past and how I might select and train a pet dog in the future. This is not a training manual, but a scientific study of canine evolution. I found it especially interesting that the dog did not evolve directly from the wolf, but rather more likely from a common ancestor. No wonder dog training methods that use wolf behavior as a foundation for training our highly domesticated pet dogs is so off base! He maintains that the dog's strongest evolutionary trait is to want to please us, but is often confused about how to go about it. It's our job not to punish bad behavior which the dog has likely forgotten as soon as we've entered the room, but to use positive techniques to teach and breed dogs to be the best companions possible."
295,1452652031,http://goodreads.com/user/show/975391-steven,3,"Bradshaw looks at dogs and their long interaction with our species, considering this relationship from scratch -- without all the baggage and traditionally-taught notions about what dogs are thinking. It's a good approach, although maybe not what readers might expect.He's upfront with stating that this is NOT a training manual. Rather, he looks at the trends and beliefs that have informed dog trainers, and holds up a mirror of genetics, evolution, and behavioral studies. One of his major goals is to debunk the idea that our modern dogs are just ""little wolves,"" vying for position in a pack, or a indeed, a human household. He points out that most studies of wolf behavior are either based on specifically local populations of modern wolves, or are based on captive groups, neither of which are typical. And in either case, their behavior doesn't have much to do with creatures that split from a common ancestor tens of thousands of years ago.Bradshaw discusses several ideas that I found intriguing, including the fact that dogs seem to be more focused on people than on other dogs, that we often overestimate dogs' ability to process information and their capacity for self-reflection. He also discusses their physiology and how it differs from humans, giving insight into how they see, hear and, of course, smell in very different ways from us. A good book. Quite sciencey, but there's nothing wrong with that. I certainly looked at the canine's I'm in charge of differently while reading this book. So much so, that the next book I plan to read is about dogs and their minds, too."
296,1452652031,http://goodreads.com/user/show/69313297-jina,2,"Honestly, Dr. John Bradshaw irritated me. He disagreed with a lot of the findings discussed in The Genius of Dogs (note that Dog Sense was published 2 years before), but that’s not what irritated me. He goes on and on and on in the first half of his book about why it doesn’t make any sense to look at wolves to understand dog behaviour. Then, in the second to last chapter of his book, he has the nerve to say that humans are ruining the way dogs can communicate with each other the more we breed them to look less like a wolf. Like -wait a minute. If we should not be looking at wolves to understand dog behaviour, why are we looking at how wolves communicate to make a statement that the less dogs look like the wolves, the less expressive their faces are, and, therefore, the less they are able to effectively communicate with their fellow dogs. This hypocrisy annoyed me mostly because of how much Dr. Bradshaw reiterates over and over and over again about how it doesn’t make any sense to compare dogs to wolves. “My view is that the key to understanding the domestic dog is, first and foremost, to understand the domestic dog… By analyzing the dog has its own animal rather than a lesser version of the wolf, we have the opportunity to understand it and refine our dealings with it as never before.” - Evidently, this statement doesn’t apply to how dogs communicate."
297,1452652031,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4689182-ronald,5,"A very well written book representing the evolution of the present day dog from a common ancestor with todays wolf. He points out that dogs did not evolve from the wolf. He postulates how todays canid became domesticated primarily to serve man primarily as a help in sheparding, hunting and other practical purposes. Man began breeding dogs for specific traits which enhanced these skills. Breeds have become increasingly inbred This inbreeding for physical attributes has become problematic to the health of some breed. Breed and show organizations have been the root cause of this problem. The role of dogs todays is providing a companion a to its owner more so then for practical work purpose. Some breeds still carry the work traits that they were originally bred. Those original work traits make certain breeds less suitable for companion purposes.Bradshaw speaks to the physical, perceptual and psychological make up of dogs such as their superior scent capability. He offers for consideration ideas of how people and more effectively interface with there dogs for the positive benefit of both.I enjoyed reading this book since I have had dogs since I was a young lad. I wish that I new then what I have learned now."
298,1452652031,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5041758-heather-hunter,3,"I was pretty intrigued by this title though I passed it over a few times initially at my local library before picking it up. (I'm always looking for ways to be a better friend to my pets.) Although portions of it, mainly on the evolutionary history of dogs, were interesting, I probably should have followed my gut on this one. I kept finding myself literally falling asleep after a few pages and, by a few weeks in, had only made it halfway through. Perhaps the second half is better, but I just couldn't bear it anymore and had to turn to something else. Parts of the theory on the behavior of domestic dogs as it relates to that of wolves was particularly confusing, in as much as the author states many times that the two should not be compared due to many distinct differences and, yet, continues to do so himself. I was kind of left feeling much like I do about politics- that comparisons were being made only when it was useful to support this point of view.I may try again someday since I can borrow it for free, but I think on this one I'd have to say I'd rather go with MY instincts about how to interact with my dogs."
299,1452652031,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4534004-chel,5,"This is not a how-to book for a dog owner. It's more of a book about how to evaluate all the other how-to books. Bradshaw looks at what researchers have learned about the evolution of domestic dogs; how they are and are not like their nearest relative, the wolf; what we know about how their senses perceive, how they learn, their intelligence, their emotions, and what the breeding of specific strains has meant for the wellbeing of dogs today. At times it's a little difficult to figure out who he is writing for -- the reading is a little heavy in places for the recreational reader, offering what seems to be a full literature review out of all the various studies, frequently noting what we don't know, as well as what we do know. But I imagine he is defending himself from criticisms of his conclusions from people who would cite the studies he did not.I most appreciated his strong refutation of the idea that the dog's world must have an ""alpha"" character, a boss, and if humans don't take pains to assume that role, then the dog will. Good riddance to that way of thinking -- now I am going to go play tug-of-war with my dog!"
