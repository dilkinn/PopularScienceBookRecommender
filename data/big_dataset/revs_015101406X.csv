0,015101406X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6139949-david-jimenez,5,"From an Amazon user:By rbnn (Berkeley, CA United States) This is the first review on Amazon I've written for which I had difficulty determining whether the book merited one or five stars. Based purely on the information in the book and the story the book tells, it's easily a five-star book. The author beautifully weaves together fascinating strands of narrative: the bizarre yet powerful culture of mathematics education in the former Soviet Union; the extraordinary brilliance of Grisha Perelman; the deep mathematical questions underlying the problems he solves; and the culture of mathematics generally. (As to this aspect of the book, I might point out, I would have liked to have seen more detail on precisely what problems Grisha solved as a student - e.g. his curriculum, his mathematical Olympiad problems and answers, his final exams - and some photos would have been interesting too.) So that's the five star part of the book. The one star part of the book is that it's written, not as a dispassionate account, nor even from the supportive perspective most biographers take towards their subjects, but rather as if the author hates her subject with a passion. The author's contempt and distaste for Grisha seethes through her prose. Over and over, she takes the noblest, most selfless, and most understandable acts of Grisha and twists them into a pop-psychological narrative of Grisha's supposed mental illness or lack of ""understanding"" of society. It's a contemptible display, this attempted character assassination of a great man, but at the same time it's so ineptly done that Perelman comes out of it fine, at least for a careful reader. For example, the author criticizes Perelman (and in harsh personal terms, insinuating he's mentally ill or cannot understand others' point of view) for turning down an assistant professorship at Princeton prior to his solving the Poincare conjecture. But Perleman's rationale is absolutely valid: he had abundantly demonstrated he merited a tenured position, having already proven another major conjecture and demonstrated his supernal talent. Why should he struggle along having to worry about job security on some meager salary, when he deserved to be decently treated? Everyone understands when a good athlete or coach turns down a multimillion dollar salary because he thinks it's not merited; why inveigh against one of the most talented people on the planet when the best that's offered is pay maybe 3% of a top athlete's with no job security? It's a preposterous situation and Grisha was thus absolutely correct in turning down this insulting job offer. Similarly, the author all too typically criticizes Grisha for his insistence on ascribing proper credit to others and for his reluctance to work with others who are dishonest or corrupt. Her reasoning seems to be that because many, if not most, people lie and cheat, Grisha's insistence on not working with those who do is a sign of a failure to understand society. But it is not that at all: it's a sign of his strong ethical character. If more people took his stance, then corruption and dishonesty would be much less pervasive. It's not Grisha who misunderstands society - he understands it perfectly well; it's the author who doesn't understand Grisha. Likewise, the author seems to think Grisha's turning down the Field's medal was a sign of some sort of mental illness. But Perelman would have had to share that medal with two other mathematicians, whose work, although impressive, was not in the same class as his own. It would degrade the value of mathematical achievement for Perelman to give his imprimateur to such an obviously unfair award, particularly as a key justification for such awards is to incentivize mathematical achievement. Indeed, as meticulously documented in the book, what happened to Perelman is one of the great shames of the mathematical community, and even of the entire culture in which it's embedded. Perelman created a lasting, beautiful, and important contribution to human thought. In response, a group of mathematicians shamelessly tried to steal his work (and, abetted by a credulous press, nearly got away with it); he was shunted over and ignored for major prizes and recognition; mediocrities who have never done anything a millionth as useful spend their time complaining about his clothes or the length of his fingernails. Why should he participate in that farce? Why continue to spend his life helping the development of such a nasty and spiteful, group of ingrates? Given how he was treated, his retreat was entirely rational - but instead of criticizing Perelman's jealous enemies, the author spends most of her time criticizing Perelman. To some extent, the author attacks not just Perelman but great mathematicians generally. Her theory is that many of them have some sort of mental illness preventing them from understanding ordinary social interactions. To the contrary, the actual data in the book shows them to understand social interactions very well. Indeed, she herself notes that mathematicians were among the leaders in reforming and liberalizing some of the harsh practices of the former Soviet Union. Yet she never claims the bureaucrats who did their level best to imprison or destroy the lives of so many brilliant young Russian scientists were culpable - these, by her theory, one supposes understood social conventions. As long as they dressed well, they were justified, seems to be the subtext of her narrative. In conclusion, there's a great story underlying the viciousness and pettiness of the narrative: a story of a courageous, ruthlessly honest, deeply creative man who gave to humanity a wonderful gift, and has since been almost universally mocked and rejected. To the extent that this story emerges through the scum of authorial condescension, it's a book well worth reading - but to the extent that condescension occludes this story, it's a contemptible one. And that's why I did not know whether to give it 5 stars or 1 star. 5 stars for the actual facts; 1 star for its vicious presentation. But I reluctantly settled on 5 stars because, frankly, the story is interesting and there's nowhere else to get it. This book furthermore would be a very useful jumping off point for someone who wants to write a real biography of the man."

It might be interesting to read about him, provided the said material is trustworthy, adequate, non-judgmental and well-informed. And that's precisely where the contras come forward:Contra:-There is about zero information about G. Perelman in the public domain other than the very bare bones. He holds no court. Gives no interviews. So, the big Q: where did the author get the info and how reliable is it all? It must all be 2nd or 3d hand, at best. Or even imaginary.-Just how capable of understanding math of a level this advanced is the author? I am not aware of her math talent. So, Q is, what is this book about if the author's not qualified to understand the mathematical minutiae of what he did? About what he eats for breakfast or who he quarreled with as a kid or something equally mundane? -If the reliable info is scarce, how did the book come about? How much of it fantasy or watered down basic facts?Should I read it? - The million-dollar question. So, flipping through it proves that it's not really worth too much for me: - Too little math. (It must be invisible, there's a lot of talk about it but no math, where's it in all its unearthly beauty?)- Too much politics (I imagine that's Masha's trademark?). Pathetic. I'm sorry. - Skewed history perception. - Math is somehow supposed to be a political tool, which, in all seriousness, is just not right, since the 2 are different dimensions. - A lot more politics than could be considered healthy. Outright Russia-bashing. For example:Q:That Russia produced some of the twentieth century greatest mathematicians is, plainly, a miracle. (c) Actually, how about no? You take education where Mathematics, Physics, Chem and a lot of other stuff are not watered down into some Science. You don't go into the pragmaticism. You develop advanced schools for talented kids in every city and town (yep, Soviet school). Add to that the benefits from the Russian Empire leftover minds and you've got it! - All kinds of twisty twists. Some random people's mutual relations (?), like some random guy who fell out of favour with some Soviet leaders at some point? How's that relevant? What's he got to do with G. Perelman and his ideas and innovations and discoveries? Lots of what feels like conjecture (who does really remember in 20xx, who was thinking what about whom in the year that G. Perelman went to some or other mathematically gifted school? How reliable or relevant such memories can be? I would totally be damned to remember some or other fellow classmates from MY school, no matter who they or I became.) Ughhh…. DNF so far. No rating, since this one's really wishy-washy.I should remember not to invest too much of my time into this one, if I ever return to it. Or, as an alternative, read it heavily tranquilized so as not to become too irritated with the journalist-y twisty style of the book. "
2,015101406X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/655723-nick-black,3,"Ehhhh, I was expecting a good deal more than that. The New Yorker article from 2006 was better reading overall (""Manifold Destiny"", http://www.newyorker.com/archive/2006...).-----Ahhh, Perelman, you ultimate enigma. Upon this book's arrival, I will lock myself in the bathroom with a liter of homebrewed absinthe, a 24-pack of TaB, and my weight in Dover Mathematical Publishing. I will read it, probably several times. I will come away as confounded as I arrived, and likely several pounds lighter. I will refer to this as my ""detoxification diet"" and continue to laugh at people who eat natural foods. Gregori Perelman subsists on first-order differential equations and broken dreams, refracted through a prism and spread thinly on black bread. And vodka, vodka distilled in arbitrary closed 3-manifolds which Ricci-tighten and relax through all the phases of 3-sphere homeomorphy, like topological lava lamps. He credits his insights to this strict regimen, along with counting to infinity twice each morning."
3,015101406X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/11781529-doris,4,"This is the story of Grigori (Grisha) Perelman, the Russian mathematician who famously published a solution to the Poincaré conjecture at the beginning of the century, but rejected all the adulation that came with it and has apparently left mathematics. There's also a lot about the history of the mathematics community in the Soviet Union in the 20th century. I also learned that Anti-Semitism is still much more prevalent, and overt, in Russia than I had realized.My favorite line: ""To those who were seeing him for the first time, Perelman looked striking but entirely within the weirdness bounds of mathematicians."""
4,015101406X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3190991-david-buckley,5,"An engrossing and fascinating look at the mind and social milieu of the great Soviet mathematician, Grigory (""Grisha"") Perelman. That this exotic (and ""Greek"") mathematical culture could thrive in the midst of one of the Twentieth Century's most repressive regimes is astonishing in and of itself. That it could produce such extraordinary mathematical minds --driven as much by a love of aesthetic beauty in poetry or music as they were by the austere rigor of mathematical logic-- is a testament to the dedication and drive of the teachers who made it possible.Perelman is probably the greatest living mathematician and his singular achievement has been to solve the Poincaré Conjecture, one of the most difficult problems in modern math. Perelman, however, was less than pleased with what he has always regarded as a lack of integrity in the international community of mathematics scholars. In particular, he has felt slighted and undervalued by the failure of his intellectual peers to confirm and validate his work. Perelman has also felt sullied by the insinuation in the western media (particularly The New York Times) that his work was motivated less by the perfectionist drive of the pure mathematician than by the decision of the Clay Mathematics Institute (Boston) to award a million dollar prize to anyone who solved the Poincaré Conjecture, or one of six other math conundrums. This book is written by a mathematician with a keen eye for what makes Perelman so intriguing. Gessen, herself a product of the Soviet math system, is ideally suited to the task of introducing the rest of us to this phenomenally gifted mind. The book provides just enough math to make the Conjecture an interesting conundrum for the non-math reader; but this is not a book about math. It's about the mind of an undoubtedly Great Mathematician.I won't spoil the book by revealing Gessen intriguing ""clinical"" analysis of Perelman's psyche, but I will say that she has convinced at least one reader of the rightness of her diagnosis.---Mikhail Gromov's take on Perelman's refusal to deal with the ICM committee and to accept the Field's Medal, which would be awarded on behalf of the international math community by the king of Spain, is described wonderfully by Gessen on pp 195-196:""Most people are perfectly content to talk to committees. They are satisfied to travel to Beijing and accept a prize from the hands of Chairman Mao. Or the king of Spain, which is the same thing.""Why I pleaded was the king of Spain undeserving of the honor of hanging a medal around Perelman's neck?""Who the hell are kings?"" Gromov was really cranked up now. ""Kings are the same kind of crap as communists. Why should a king give a mathematician his prize? Who is he? He is nothing. From a mathematician's point of view, he is nothing. Same as Chairman Mao. So one of them seized power like a robber while the other got it from his father. That's no difference."" In contrast to these people, Gromov explained, Perelman had actually made a real contribution.--"
5,015101406X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7316023-ron,5,"Masha Gessen's book is a biography of a person who is quite alive - as far as we know. But it is written as one would write a biography for a subject who is dead, because the subject of the book, Grigory ""Grisha"" Perelman, has withdrawn himself from the world, mathematics and otherwise. This is then more of a story of how and why Perelman, the most accomplished mathematician of this new century, managed this withdrawal. It is a strange and at times infuriating story, but one told by a uniquely qualified individual in Ms. Gessen. I highly recommend this articulate and informative book: if you thought you knew the story of Grisha Perelman, you are probably wrong. Perelman after all is the man who has been acknowledged by the mathematics community as the man who proved the Poincare and Thurston conjectures and thus solved a century-old problem to which not a few professional mathematicians the world over dedicated their lives. But, as momentous an achievement as this is, Perelman is even more well-known for his rejections. Rejections of tenured faculty positions at the best universities in America, despite aggressive offers. Rejection of the Fields Medal, the highest prize the mathematics world has to offer. And, although only speculated in the book, the rejection last month of the first $1 million prize from the Clay Institute for the solution of one of its Millennium Problems. Gessen does what she has to do to get the answers and construct the story: she gets access to everyone who has taught, competed with, and collaborated with Perelman throughout his life. The story traces Perelman from before he was born: his mother was a mathematician herself, who was rejected for her pregnancy and her Jewishness. It was into her son Grisha that she poured her dreams of greatness. The story then winds its way through Perelman's Olympiad career, where he won first place at the International Math Olympiad in 1982, then University at the Mathmech in Leningrad, then graduate study at the Steklov Institute in Leningrad. Through this journey, we see how Perelman developed into the brilliant being he has become, as well as how he separated himself from the rest of the world. What Gessen accomplishes here is the weaving of a thread through the people in Perelman's life who worked to shield him from all of the distractions of the world so he could pursue the work that would make him - and them - famous. The distractions that could derail such a “pure” prodigy as Perelman were many and intense: being part of a community, maintaining the body as well as the mind [Perelman’s simple eating habits, long fingernails and curious smell are well-known], paperwork, admissions, etc. Girls seem to barely exist in his world – and Perelman is not tagged as homosexual. The major distraction from which Perelman was shielded was the brutal anti-Semitism of the Soviet regime. [When I read about this, I always wonder why so many of my fellow Jews got sucked into giving their lives over to these frauds.] Perelman was a Jew [a “zhid”] and therefore subject to the extreme quotas governing intellectual life in the bad old days of the Soviet Union. Perelman, however, was shielded from this abuse through the hard work of the influential professors who saw in Perelman someone who would do great things for mathematics. Perelman’s accomplishments are literally a testament to these professors who did yeoman’s work in getting Perelman into the right Institutes that would further his career. And it is shielding, the constant protection from the horrors of the world, that seem to shape Perelman into the being that would brook no distractions, ever. He had zero interests outside of not only mathematics, but outside of the very problem on which he was working. And once he was finished working and teaching, he had zero interest in communicating with anybody about it. Perelman’s career arc was such that his work in Alexandrov spaces won him recognition enough to be invited to postdoc in the US from 1991-1995 in various places [NYU, Stony Brook, Berkeley]. Then, suddenly, insulted that he did not instantly get an offer for a tenured faculty position, he returned to now St Petersburg and the Steklov Institute, where he literally disappeared for seven years. He would only return to his grand triumph, the posting of his proof of the conjectures in three papers on arXiv.org in 2002. Gessen spends a chapter on an attempt to describe Perelman’s achievement. Gessen, no stranger to Russian mathematics herself, does I think a decent job in laying out the problem and explaining why it evaded solution for so long. I liked her explanation of topology’s origins with Euler and the seven bridges of Koenigsberg, and how location rather than distance is what makes topology a special sort of geometry. That said, I think she fell into the trap into which what many mass-market mathematics authors fall, and that is the fear of the equation. English is not the best language for any branch of mathematics [if it were, then lawyers and mathematicians would be interchangeable], and more effort needs to be done than simply fobbing fancy terms at the reader [“Ricci flow”, “diffeomorphism”] after a certain level of difficulty has passed. This is likely not Gessen’s fault, but that of worrisome editors and publishers understandably worried about the impact of such discussions on sales. Those hoping for a slightly more detailed discussion of Perelman’s achievement should consult Donal O’Shea’s nice explanation of the Conjecture and the players involved, including Perelman. [Interestingly, O’Shea has zero interest in Perelman’s foibles; this is what makes Gessen’s book so good.] The world around Perelman grew increasingly incomprehensible to him and he became more withdrawn, sullen, and vicious. Gessen at this points spends a lot of time speculating on the role Asperger’s has had not only on Perelman, but on mathematicians, and Russian mathematicians in particular. In what could have been a debacle for the book, I think Gessen turns this discussion into a strength through her detailed discussions with the world’s leading experts in the field. One sees through what we have learned about Perelman that he makes for a classic case of Asperger’s, although Gessen reminds us that all this is mere speculation, as she – and we – have never even met Perelman. But this speculation, rather than drag the book into a Fox-Newsian assumption of reality from speculated “facts”, helps Gessen paint a portrait of a subject that refuses to sit. To be honest, I thought that such a portrait would get me to sympathize with Perelman’s plight. And what a plight. His rejections ironically made him much more of a celebrity than had he simply accepted the rewards he so richly deserved. Russian parazzi followed him around the clock and broke into the apartment he shared with his mother, snapping photos of his unmade bed. Nevertheless, I was horrified at Perelman’s behavior toward his fellow colleagues, most of whom were simply trying to help him, despite the fact that his master stroke more or less instantly altered or destroyed their careers. Gessen lays out evidence that Perelman’s behavior is more complex than that of a “Rain Man’ and many times, he knew perfectly well what he was doing. At the end, Gessen brilliantly makes the analogy that, like the rubber band on the three-dimensional manifold he uniquely understood, Perelman’s social universe shrunk to a point. He now lives, unemployed, with his mother in their St Petersburg apartment. All in all, this was a thoroughly enjoyable read from which I learned far more than what one can gather in existing New Yorker articles. I recommend in the strongest manner for those interested in this enigmatic genius and the work he did."
6,015101406X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/101006348-ansove,5,The book is certainly terrific.
7,015101406X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/90147-sarah,3,"An admirable attempt at writing about a mathematician who is more myth than man. Gessen also provides a fascinating inside look at the Russian system of training young mathematicians for competitions. Way different from the donuts and pseudo-cheerleading that accompanied my math club competitions. Still, I feel a better book could have -- and should have -- been written about Perelman. Maybe he'll open up some day and allow that to happen."
8,015101406X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2209582-ross,3,"I found this book fascinating on several levels because it touches on several areas of interest to me. First, the modern field of mathematics and the remaining great proofs to be solved. Second, the state of the USSR as it stumbled toward its demise in the 1980's as Reagan upped the ante on military strength and broke the back of the Soviet economy. Finally, the nature of human genius. How astounding it is that an infinitesimal fraction of humans have mental powers so far above the scale of the rest of us. The subject here, Grigory Perelman, is one of the Asperger Syndrome genius category, His achievement described by Ms. Gessen's book is providing the proof of a conjecture made 100 years earlier by a previous genius who was not smart enough to provide his own proof.For a period of 8 years no one knew what Grigory was doing. Then, suddenly 3 very short papers come forth which seem to contain the proof.These 3 papers are so short, in fact, that it is by no means obvious that they do contain the proof. Actually, two Japanese mathematicians have the gall to publish a paper claiming that it is they who have solved the proof. Whether the proof may have any practical value is unknown for now, but the book conveys the sense of how staggeringly difficult this work is.He was awarded a $1 million prize for his achievement in 2010 and refused the money because he explained he didn't want people staring at him. Once again nobody knows what Perelman is working on, if anything."
9,015101406X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/68316850-gavin,3,"Not so much a biography: instead a study of recent Russian anti-Semitism, the viciousness of Soviet academia, and but also the wonderful alternative subculture that lived uneasily within it. This subculture hid inside the superhuman apolitical dreamland, mathematics.* It could only exist because of the sacrifices of famous and decent men, Kolmogorov and Aleksandrov. Their selective maths schools seem to have been the only nice places to be in the entire empire, for any intellectual with a taste for actual discourse, or for the truth.(Reasons it can't be so much a biography: the subject refused to talk to her, does things that are very hard to explain, and doesn't go out much.)The teacher Ryzhik's story about the evil entrance exam he sat is so, so sad:
 “Coffins” were questions specially designed for the Jewish applicants... rejection was administered in a peculiarly sadistic way... if [Jews] succeeded in answering correctly the two or three questions on the ticket, then, alone in the room with the examiners, they would be casually issued an extra question... a problem not merely complex but unsolvable. The examiners would then nail the cover of the coffin shut: the Jewish applicant had failed the exam...""They did not even manage to find a problem I couldn't solve; I sat for three hours after the exam was over, I solved them all, and still they failed me. I was just a boy. I went home and cried.""
Gessen is well-placed to write this - she was a maths nerd in Soviet Russia around the same time. As far as I can tell (which isn't very far) her grasp of the maths (one chapter for the crown jewel) is fit for purpose. But Gessen is out to bust Perelman's reputation for hyper-individualism; so she focusses on the devoted teachers and functionaries that pulled strings to get an abrasive Jew into the heart of Soviet academia, and his incredible luck in starting graduate study just as Glasnost happened. She wants to highlight the poverty of his character - his antisocial withdrawal, his complete and intentional ignorance of politics, his naivete, his savantism. It doesn't work. Yes, he's rigid; maybe he is composed of a curiosity, a competitiveness, an ethics, and nothing else (no vanity, humour, romance, charisma, empathy, theory of mind, tolerance, compromise, doubt). So what? Why does everyone need to be rounded? Does she sneer at athletes, the other people with lives this seemingly contorted and simple? David Foster Wallace managed to get over himself, on this note:
 The restrictions on [pro tennis player's] life have been, in my opinion, grotesque; and in certain ways Joyce himself is a grotesque. But the radical compression of his attention and sense of himself have allowed him to become a transcendent practitioner of an art – something few of us get to be. They've allowed him to visit and test parts of his psychic reserves most of us do not even know for sure we have (courage, playing with violent nausea, not choking, et cetera).Joyce is, in other words, a complete man, though in a grotesquely limited way. 
 Gessen is, to be frank, quite cruel: she never passes up an opportunity to mention appearances - that that athletic boy of 1970 is ""now an overweight and balding computer scientist"", that the house of a man caring for his wife with late-stage dementia is ""a messy place, lived in awkwardly"" and he himself ""similarly unkempt""; that Perelman didn't change his underwear or clip his nails as a teen. This is the shallow side of the 
New Yorker
 style on show - or else the malign side of Russian honesty. Either way fuck it. (Though Perelman would probably approve.)
 [Perelman] sounded his voice only if a solution required his intervention; looked forward to Sundays, sighing happily and saying that he could ""finally solve some problems in peace""; and, if asked, patiently explained any math issue to any of his classmates though apparently utterly unable to conceive of anyone not comprehending such a simple thing. His classmates repaid him with kindness: they recalled his civility and his mathematics, and none ever mentioned to me that he walked around with his shoelaces undone...
The great mystery, which Gessen understandably can't touch, is why after 36 years of focus he suddenly stopped doing the only thing he'd ever done. How could he? How can that much momentum be shed? What does such a man do next?Subtract a star if you don't care about maths or if you can't abide people being mean to nerds (as both the old apparatchiks and Gessen were).---* One of the oddest things about Perelman, because it maybe explains him turning down a million quid and the highest honours the world can bestow, is that he'd disagree with that sentence: maths, the least animal and least irrational thing we have, is too political for him. There was a little bit of nasty jostling at the time of the announcement - but nothing compared to any other science, let alone any government. Maybe the bubble everyone set up for him was bad for him, because it robbed him of perspective and so made the mild case of fuckery seem like a complete invalidation of mathematical culture. But maybe a rigorous rule-based mind would always explode eventually even given a scale to measure instances of bias."
10,015101406X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/16766080-meg,1,The further I read the further I empathized with Perelman's withdrawl from public eye. The author makes a lot of big assumptions of Perelman's feelings/beliefs/knowledge (not backed up by any interviews she did) in order to turn him into a spectacle.
11,015101406X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/14196927-santiago-f-moreno-solana,4,"I bought this book eleven years ago. For reasons I cannot explain, intrigued maybe by another two books I am currently reading (The equation which was never solved by Mario Livio and The Poincaré Conjecture by Donal O'Shea) I thought the time was right to deepen into the life of Perelman.While surprised about his behaviour, we should learn a lot about this story. Because Perelman, a jew with an immense talent in solving mathematical problems, appears to be a man of principles, maybe brought to the extreme, but we should not play Groucho Marx here. Perelman never did. As a 'matemagician', he understood it from his very childhood perfectly and exploited until he decided to escape from this world. Neither Mathematics, nor the person who contribute to them, can be sold, money ruin everything. The whole parafernalia which may surroind Mathematics (Clay prize, Fields Medal) is (was in his eyes) all but superflous, unnecessary, not to be proud of. I understand Grigori very well.Then, of course, the modern society put a prize on everything. Grigori simply escaped from his destiny, the one waiting with hands wide open to embrace him. If he were to continue enclosed in the modern box of materialism he would have sold himself for moneny and solving problems is not about money. The merit cannot have a monetary compensation.Tragic in itself, maybe modern Mathematics (written with captital M) lost in a way a great mind, cause the mathematical world, the world per se, never again got to know anything about Grigori (apart from all the rejections as of contact, his retirement from society and a testimonial publication claiming to have demonstrated the existence of god).It felt kind of sad to read that around 2006 two chinese geometrists tried to claim they have solved what Perelman had done, correctly and in full (chapeau!!!) years before, a conjecture which one of the greatest mathematicians in the history (Poincaré) wrote when the XX century was just its childhood. It is just dirty, it is disgusting. Those very people should be excluded from making Mathematics or given the right to publish for the rest of their lifes. All in all, they just did it to claim a million dollar the real author did and would never claim. No words.Mr. Perelman has all my respect, as a mathematician and as a person for his integrity, despite his extreme attitude or exaggerated reaction. Money (and fame) ruin everything, I said. What a contradiction to be ruined by money... In the end not all souls can be taken away by the hand of the devil, despite its reach, size and length. At least not the one of Grigori Perelman. It is a kind of relief to know one can still find such kind of people in this world."
12,015101406X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/24737951-will-nelson,4,"This is an interesting book that tells the strange story of Grigory Perelman, who proved the famous Poincare Conjecture and then refused all subsequent awards. Along the way one also learns a lot about the Soviet method of training mathematicians and the mathematical communities in several different countries. Gessen clearly knows more mathematics than the average journalist, and is a good guide to these topics. I have to admit that after reading the book I found Perelman's reactions just as puzzling as ever. He turned down several fantastic faculty positions, the $1M Clay prize, and the Fields medal, which is a purely honorary award. In the case of the Clay prize it seems rather selfish since even if he didn't want the money, surely his mother (who he still lives with), or one of his relatives, or a math department someplace, could make good use of it. Regardless of outcome, it is an interesting story. However, I have one or two bones to pick with the author as well. The first is that she describes favorably the ""competition-based"" system of mathematical training, in which students train intensively at problem-solving to prepare for math contests such as the Olympiads or the Putnam. Perelman was the product of this kind of program, and was a fabulously quick and accurate problem solver. But is solving problems for a competition really a good preparation for a career in mathematical research? Or does this kind of intensive training instead both select and create warped personalities whose motivation for doing mathematics is based on schoolboy competitiveness rather than the desire to advance mathematical knowledge? The case of Perelman may or may not reflect problems with this kind of system, but it would have been nice to have some discussion. Secondly I want to highlight a passage which I found extremely gratuitous, unfounded, and pointless:""And professors shamelessly entered into salary negotiations, sometimes even making their plans contingent on the remuneration. Where was their love of science and their will to sacrifice material comforts for the common cause of mathematics?What this man was describing was the Americanization of French mathematics. And what I [Gessen] found invaluable about his perspective was that he still managed to see the money-centric, marketing-driven messages of the mathematical establishment as outrageous rather than obvious and expected, as they are in the United States.""Now, there have been many, many phenomenal American mathematicians, and many, many phenomenal non-American mathematicians who choose to practice at American universities. Gessen's offhand comment is an insult to all of these mathematicians and all of their institutions.Furthermore I would guess that ""money-centric"" and ""marketing-driven"" are about the last things that come to anyone's mind when thinking about mathematics departments in the U.S. Students focussed on their financial prospects do not seek out math departments, and the math departments don't seek them out. I have never seen an ad for a math department nor any evidence that anything which could remotely pass for ""marketing"" is being employed by them. And what evidence does Gessen provide for this horrible process of ""Americanizing"" mathematics? Well, apparently professors in the U.S. negotiate their salaries. Oh, the horror. Does Gessen consider that perhaps a mathematician might have a family to feed? Or perhaps she believes that serious mathematicians cannot marry or procreate? Well, also it's an American institute that gives out the $1M Clay prize, thereby corrupting mathematics throughout the world, except the incorruptible few like Perelman. Of course Perelman's own extensive training was focused not on math for its own sake, but on beating other boys at speed-solving competitions...but Gessen does not find it fitting to discuss or compare these sorts of motivations. I've read several books by Gessen now and I think this may be the last one. She chooses interesting topics but I am coming to see that her treatments can be superficial and that she brings certain attitudes to the topic which she neither justifies nor suppresses, but which appear rather in this kind of throwaway editorial commentary.

13,015101406X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/28559520-terri,5,"Grisha Perelman arrived at the Leningrad math club in the fall of 1976, a pudgy, awkward boy.Sergei Rukshin, a nineteen year old with no coaching or teaching experience and in fact a once troublesome youth, becomes Perelman's math coach.Russia, the poverty ridden communist country, was somehow able to produce mathematical genius. In the hopeless country, a pencil and paper were the keys to mathematical superiority in the world. ""So it is perhaps no accident that the founders of the dissident movement in the Soviet Union were mathematicians and physicists. The soviet Union was not a good place for people who took things literally and expected the world to function in predicable, logical and fair ways. But the math clubs, such as the one run by Rukshin, provided a refue. Rukshin saw it as his missiion to shelter the black sheep of Soviet schoolchildren, and he saw a certain posture of social withdrawal as the mark of a gifted mathematician.""Perelman was a perfect fit.The Poincaré Conjecture, is an innocent sounding question: if a three-dimensional manifold is smooth and simply connected, then is it diffeomorphic to a three-dimensional sphere?At the dawn of the 1960's, several mathematician's proved the Poincaré Conjecture for dimensions five and higher. In 1982, Michael Freedman published a proof of the conjecture for dimension four.Consider the enormity of solving the fourth dimension. Perhaps one of the problems with four-dimensional spaces is that, unlike higher dimensional ones, they are not quite abstractions; it seems that we humans may very well inhabit a three-dimensional space embedded in four dimensions, even if we can not wrap our minds around it.But... experts say there is one living man,the American geometer, William Thurston, who can imagine four dimensions, ""When you see him or talk to him, he is often staring out into space and you can see that he sees these pictures,"" said John Morgan, a professor at Columbia University. Morgan watched Thurston attempt to solve the Poincaré and when he didn't get it, Morgan was sure no one would.Enter Grisha Perelman.In almost a hundred years and with many, many mathematicians working on the conjecture no one had ever solved it. Perelman simply posted his proof for the Poincaré Conjecture in an open forum on the internet in 2002.Perelam had the ability to absorb a problem in its entirety and then boil it down to an essence that proved simpler than anyone assumed.The book also includes very interesting asides of other great mathameticians like Andrei Kolmogorov and Pavel Alexndro; Kolomogorov, a professor so loved, that when at 84, blind, mute, and ill with Parkinson's, his students took turns providing round-the-clock care for him at his house.Vikto Zalgaller was another interesting mathematician. The author, Masha Gessen, interviewed him in Tel Aviv in his apartment where he did all his work and his wife lay motionless in the final stages of Alzheimer's disease. Upon entering the messy, cluttered apartment, Zalgaller states apologetically, ""The woman no longer manages the house."""
14,015101406X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4258012-adam,4,"I thought this was a very interesting book to read. As a mathematician I certainly saw the faculty at my university abuzz over the solution of the Poincare Conjecturé. Then some odd circumstances happened and the author of the proof started to decline awards and accolades. This probably drew even more attention to him as he was trying to get away from world. It is somewhat of an unfortunate story in some respects, because it appears he has decided to leave the mathematical field altogether. Who could tell what else he could solve if he was just left to his own devices?The book does suffer from no firsthand accounts, but every reader should expect that going in. It was written after Mr. Perelman stopped talking to the media, so Gessen was unable to ever interview her subject. This must have been quite a challenging biography. Instead she had to go and speak with colleagues and friends to attempt to craft Perelman’s story. One of the most interesting parts of this story wasn’t in the discussion of Perelman’s solution, but the historical background of mathematics being done in the Soviet Union. During the Cold War the Soviet Union appears to have been a strange place, even in which to conduct mathematical research. I felt this book gave a rather penetrating account of the hardships these instructors and students endured as they tried to work in a field they were very passionate about.After Mr. Perelman provided his solution to the Poincaré Conjecture he did come to the U.S. to give some talks on the topic. According to Gessen he had odd habits, but as someone who has worked in the world of math and higher education, this is certainly not unusual to me. Even I have some very strange and what people would consider relatively strict habits. The only point that sort of bothered me in the book is her attempt to seemingly diagnose his weirdness. I am not sure if she was fully trying to do this, or just giving information to others about the nature of something like Aspergers, but I got the impression she was trying to explain him through a disorder. In any event, I did find it an incredibly fascinating read and I would highly recommend anyone read this. You certainly don’t have to be a mathematician to read it as the biography is quite well crafted. I walk away feeling as if Gessen achieved her goal of writing a biography without ever having to speak to the individual.P.S. And as a side note... I have to wonder if the graphic designer who made the cover was aware that the integral sign is an S. So I when I look at this book all I can see is ""Persect Rigor""."
15,015101406X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/88272483-hadia-hameed,4,"Grigory Perelman is the man who proved the Poincare Conjecture. He was nominated for the Fields Medal in 2006 which he rejected, along with 1 million dollars for solving one of the Millennium Prize Problems. The Millennium Prize Problems were introduced in 2000 by Clay Mathematics Institute for the sole purpose of making mathematics more fun and engaging for the public. The prize served to “record the problems of the twentieth century that resisted challenge most successfully and that we would most like to see resolved” (Andrew Wiles, British number theorist who proved Fermat’s Last Theorem). The seven problems up for the prize include the Poincare Conjecture, first conceived in 1904 by Henri Poincare. Several mathematical giants spent years finding a solution to the problem, to little or no avail. In 2002, Grigory Perelman posted his solution publicly on the internet instead of a refereed journal, and all hell broke loose in the mathematical community. This book makes mathematics come to life. It describes the back-stage stories, the filthy politics and the rigor that goes into scientific breakthroughs that we often know about only through the well-measured and guarded language of scientific publications, fully understood by only a handful. An interesting character in the book which has often been ignored in most of the accounts surrounding Grigory, is Lubov, Grigory’s mother who was a mathematician herself and was offered a graduate study-spot by one of her professors, Garold Natanson in 1960s. Lubov turned down the offer because she was recently married and was planning to start a family. Years later, she brought her son, Grigory to the same professor and asked him to take her ten-year old son, who showed a budding talent for mathematics, under his wing, as she believed that her son was “ready to take up where his mother had left off.” It makes one imagine an alternate reality, a sequence of events in a parallel universe perhaps, where Lubov had accepted the position, unencumbered by the burdens of giving birth and mothering a child, and had worked her way up to the top, solving the Poincare Conjecture herself, becoming the first woman to win a Fields Medal. Perhaps it might not have turned out like that and perhaps the Poincare Conjecture would have remained unsolved, but this is the stuff of alternate realities, the ones we can take the liberty of living over and over, in as many different configurations as we like, in the safe spaces of our minds.Complete review: https://theliteraryarchives.blogspot...."
16,015101406X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3767598-my-pseudonym,4,"A very good insight into the mind of the illusive genius: Grigori Perelman. Perelman comes across as a pure mathematician in every sense of the term. Perelman thought the discovery of the proof behind the Poincare Conjecture was important; not the person who discovered it. He regarded the pecuniary ($1 million dollar) reward for the discovery as an insult, and this seemed to deter him from the world of mathematics even further. Perelman comes across as a purely honest mathematician - too honest too even make a mistake. Basically, Grigori appears to operate on a different moral plane compared to most of us and this book demonstrates how Grigori places principle even before math. The book gets very exciting when Masha starts to explain how Perelman went about his proof, and humbly posted his finding on the internet in 2002 (I believe). Inevitably, this caused a lot of excitement amongst the world of mathematicians. There is an interesting section noting how different mathematicians reacted to his discovery. I imagine, some of these reactions, also contributed to the what may appear as, the 'eccentric' behaviour from Perelman.Worthwhile having a read, and is reader friendly (for the the non-mathematician like myself). I would give this read 5 stars if there was perhaps a little more content on Perelman himself. However, Masha does a great job conjuring up what she could through contacting direct friends and colleagues of Grisha. Thoroughly enjoyed it. There is absolutely no doubt Grigori Perelman is a genius. And to the best of my knowledge, could well be the greatest mathematician alive today."
17,015101406X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6392144-herve,5,"I had mentioned Grigori Perelman in a rather old post: 7 x 7 = (7-1) x (7+1) + 1. I discovered recently a new book about this exceptional mathematician, not so much about his achievements but more about his personality.About Asperger’s SyndromeI will not tell much Perelman here, Masha Gessen does it with talent. Let me just translate here form the French version I am reading: “It seems to me that many of the whistleblowers,” wrote Atwwod, “have Asperger’s Syndrome, I’ve met several who have applied the code of ethics of their company or government to their work and have reported wrongdoing and corruption in the workplace. All of them were surprised to see that their management and their colleagues did not understand their attitude. ”So it is perhaps not a coincidence that the founders of dissident movements in the Soviet Union were among mathematicians and physicists. The Soviet Union was not the place for people who took things literally and expected the world to work in a predictable, logical and fair way. [Pages 215-6, French edition][…]One can also interpret the difficulties he experienced when he presented his solutions. If Perelman was suffering from Asperger’s syndrome, this inability to see “the big picture” is perhaps one of the most surprising traits. British psychologists Uta Frith and Francesca Happe talked about what they call the “low central coherence” characteristic of autism spectrum disorders. Autistics focus on details, to the detriment of the overall picture. When they manage to reconstitute it, it is because they have arranged the various elements, a little like the elements of the periodic table, in a systemic scheme that satisfies them to the extreme. “… the most interesting facts, wrote Poincaré, one of the greatest systematizing minds of all time, more than a century ago, are those who can be used many times, those who have a chance to happen many times. We have had the good fortune to be born in a world where there is are many; suppose that instead of sixty chemical elements we have sixty billion, that they are not common ones and rare ones, but they would be evenly distributed, so every time we pick up a new pebble, there would be a high probability that it would be made up of some unknown substances… […] In such a world, there would be no no science, perhaps no thought and even life would be impossible because evolution could not have developed the conservative instincts; thanks to God it is not so.”People with Asperger’s syndrome apprehend the small pebble world by small pebble. Speaking of the existence of this syndrome in society, Attwood resorted to the metaphor of a five thousand-piece puzzle, “where normal people would have the full image on the lid” which would allow them to have global intuitions. Aspergers, they would not see this big picture and should try to nest the pieces one by one. So maybe rules like “never take off your hat” and 2lis all the books that are on the list “formed for Gricha Perelman a way to see the missing image on the lid, to encompass all the elements of the periodic table of the world It was only by clinging to these rules that he could live his life. [Pages 217-8, French edition]About powerAnother interesting topic addressed by Misha Gessen is on page 236 of the French edition again:– When he received the letter from the commission that invited him he replied that he did not speak with committees, said Gromov, and that is exactly what he did. They represent everything that one should never accept. And if this attitude seems extreme, it is only in relation to the conformism that characterizes the world of mathematics.– But why refuse to talk to committees?– We do not talk to committees, we talk to people! exclaimed Gromov, exasperated. How can we talk to a committee? Who knows who is on the committee? Who tells you that Yasser Arafat is not one of them?– But he was sent the list of members, and he continued to refuse.– The way it started, he was right not to answer, Gromov persisted. As soon as a community begins to behave like a machine, all that remains to do is to cut ties, and that’s all. The strangest thing is that there is no longer a mathematician who does the same. That’s what’s weird. Most people agree to deal with committees. They agree to go to Beijing and receive a prize from President Mao. Or the king of Spain, anyway, it’s the same!– And why, I asked, could not the King of Spain have the honor of hanging a medal around Perelman’s neck?– What is a king? Gromov asked, totally furious now. Kings are the same morons as the Communists. Why would a king award a medal to a mathematician? What allows it? It is nothing from a mathematical point of view. Same for the president. But there is one who has taken control of power like a thief and the other who inherited it from his father. It does not make any difference.Unlike them, Gromov explains to me, Perelman had made a real contribution to the world.It reminds me of a colleague’s quote: “There are not many statues for committees in public parks.”It’s also worth mentioning here an article from the New Yorker that Gessen mentions too: Manifold Destiny. A legendary problem and the battle over who solved it by Sylvia Nasar and David Gruber. On a related topic, the authors quote Perelman whom they met: He mentioned a dispute that he had had years earlier with a collaborator over how to credit the author of a particular proof, and said that he was dismayed by the discipline’s lax ethics. “It is not people who break ethical standards who are regarded as aliens,” he said. “It is people like me who are isolated.” We asked him whether he had read Cao and Zhu’s paper. “It is not clear to me what new contribution did they make,” he said. “Apparently, Zhu did not quite understand the argument and reworked it.” As for Yau, Perelman said, “I can’t say I’m outraged. Other people do worse . Of course, there are many mathematicians who are more or less honest. But almost all of them are conformists. They are more or less honest, but they tolerate those who are not honest.”"
18,015101406X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/777050-andrew-martin,4,"very good. insightful explication of the Russian educational system + a portrait of a exceptionally singular mind. writing a biography with no access to its subject is a difficult endeavor - one that Giessen handles with grace. there's a suggestion in some of the reviews below that the book is hostile in its treatment of Perelman, but I don't think anything could be further from the truth. Perelman is a difficult figure, possessed of a certain hostility toward the outside world. Gessen takes the principles and worldview behind this rejection seriously, replacing the media caricature of 'reclusive super genius' with something far more nuanced. the background and temperament that made him uniquely suited to tackle Poincare are the same beliefs that caused him to opt out of the hoopla and ceremony around the Fields and the Clay prize. Gessen's thesis is that you can't separate the two, and it is convincingly argued.five stars for the portrayal of the mathematical community and its workings; -1 stars for the actual treatment of the Poincaré conjecture."
19,015101406X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6834813-worm,4,"A fascinating read about one of the most stimulating mathematical journeys of recent times. In turns it is a detailed look at Grigory Perelman, a recent history of Russian mathematics and a more general look at the international mathematics community. This is more of a social history than anything; there are few mathematical details, and no real hard science. This is both a strength and a limitation. Personally, I would have, perhaps, liked more of the technical details but this would maybe have detracted from the real human insights. This reminded somewhat of The Man Who Loved Only Numbers: The Story of Paul Erdös and the Search for Mathematical Truth, and hits many of the same notes.A great read for mathematicians and those simply interested in the great eccentrics."
20,015101406X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/27016681-ishaan-sood,3,"A tragic tale, not recommended to those pursuing research interests and expecting the world to acknowledge the same with gratitude. Perelman would never enter the limelight and would only be known to the closed community of topology mathematicians- undeserving for someone who solved the Poincare conjecture. Gessen emphasises how his works are breakthrough and how little he received from the society, why he rejected the Fields Medal, why he rejected the Clay Institute reward of million dollars and finally what led him to break away into seclusion and possible retirement from mathematics. While she did make a very desperate attempt to open him to the masses, it is hard to get into the mind of a person, more so when that person prefers seclusion and there are few voids in the book that can only be filled by Perelman himself. "
21,015101406X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/31641302-helen,5,"What really struck me is that book is not really about Gregory Perelman. This is a book about time and place that creates a certain type of personality, a certain outlook on things, a certain character. If he might have had Asperger's, as Gessen points out, so might half the country. This is a case of plain, pure disgust with all sorts of politicking, maneuvering and manipulating. In a way, it's the start of a book about the ""lost generation"" that had to survive, do ten times better than anyone in their grade, get through entrance exams by miracle only, be head and shoulders above their peers in colleges, only to finally emigrate and survive again in USA, Germany, Israel, Australia and everywhere in between - and those were the best and the brightest. I really would like Gessen to write this book."

Using geometry, he tackled a 100-year old question about a four-dimensional sphere. His life leads up to his solution; after the solution, a dissolution into madness. As a bonus, Gessen has a very helpful connection to her subject: as a child, she belonged to Soviet math clubs and knows well the quirks and standards that emerge in their young participants."

What disappoints me a lot is the thing that she hardly gives a fact that is not coloured by her own judgement; and in case she misses to give out her interpretations, she has put someone else's opinions. This was like chewing on the cud... Nevertheless, she paints a near-perfect picture of the Russia that age."

27,015101406X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/55205816-alecsphys,5,"I was at high school when I discovered that one of the most challenging conjectures was demonstrated few years before; it was the nowadays called Fermat's Last Theorem. It was end of 90s, and the XX century was closed in mathematics with this breaking news! But something even more astonishing was going to happen. I have just finished my master degree and I was doing my PhD when I heard about Perel'man and the solution of the Poincare's conjecture. It was the beginning of the XXI century. I think that for the mathematicians the bridge between these two centuries built by that solutions was really incredible. Perel'man is a strange man to the eyes of common people, and this biography shows that even if the author never met him. The book was written totally based on what persons who were in touch with Perel'man described. The book is really captivating, and I like it also because it describes in a great way how was the Russian system of education in math, that is something unbelievable. You can grab also some other historical information about communist regime that are interesting. In these days (October 2018) there was a rumor about the solution of maybe the most important open problem in math, the Riemann's conjecture by Sir Atiyah. I do not know if it was a real proof, but one question one could ask: why Perel'man didn't solve it too? Perel'man is famous to have solved every problems he was provided. But maybe the Poincare's conjecture was his Last Theorem and since that time he left math. What is Perel'man doing today, nobody knows it."
28,015101406X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/9796424-sundar-raj,4,"3.5 stars. Proving Poincare conjecture is no small feat. Perelman occupies a God-like position in the mathematical universe now. His refusal to accept Field’s medal and Clay’s million-dollar prize really astounding. The book is written for a very general audience. In fact, there is literally no math. The author seems to be more interested in the psychological analysis of Perelman and what it takes for one to solve extraordinary mathematical problems. The book is full of interviews with people that knew and worked with Perelman. Some accounts are more interesting than others. Though the chapters about early life in Soviet Olympiad school set a perspective, and how Perelman could do what he did, but it drags after some time. I would have personally preferred more details about the conjecture itself in that place, even though it would possibly risk repelling general audience readers. The glaring negative about the book is lack of Perelman’s side of the story. The author makes it clear, in the beginning, that she tried her best to present his side of the story about all the drama that he created. But, upon reading the book, it's clear that Perelman is not ready to talk to anyone. So, can’t blame her for that. That apart, the book is immensely readable for anyone with a little to no background in math and presents a cohesive picture/story of what it takes to solve a incredible problem like Poincare conjecture. Recommended. "

The author has not met Pereleman but she is just collecting what his teachers, colleagues and professors have to say about him, so we are getting to know a living man third-handedly!His idiosyncrasies are so unique, yet still in the bounds of the mathematician's stereotype. He is a man of high principles who didn't want to be a ""rolling stone"" as Bob Dylan might have described. He saw what others regarded a recognition as an offense. Many geniuses in academia fall in the trap of compromising for money, status, or even power (especially, after accomplishing their greatest contributions) but Perelman did not, though he would have lived a much better material life than the one he is living right now with his mother. I deeply respect him, though without reading his work my respect is nothing to him. Eventually, his kind of people are the real people who should be regarded highly, and not the ones desperate to."

The book is more than the celebration of a genius. It talks about how peculiar character Perelman is. It also provides insights into how mathematics was practised so rigorously in Russia and Western countries. There is a philosophy of language involved in this story. Words aren't always sufficient to convey what we mean. Moreover, when it comes to mathematics, our language is nowhere adequate to understand the intricacies. So, mathematics itself a language to understand some of the complexes that our mind can never deal.Read this book to understand how beautiful language mathematics is."

It reveals the bizarre, and sometimes chaotic, world of russian mathematics. In the last chapters it is mentioned how mathematics is being comercialised and the shortcomings of this.

She decided not to become a research mathematician, and instead became a teacher and raised a family. In 1976, one of Lubov’s old teachers, Garold Natanson, arranged for Grisha to be tutored by a mathematics coach named Sergei Rukshin, a student at Leningrad State University. Rukshin had started a mathematics club called the Leningrad Palace of Pioneers (now called the Mathematics Education Center). Rukshin trained his youngsters for mathematics competitions. Leningrad Secondary School 239In 1980, Grisha entered Leningrad Secondary School 239. Valery Ryzhik taught mathematics to the students who had moved from Rukshin’s math club into Leningrad Secondary School 239, which specialized in mathematics. Ryzhik taught to the top of the class. Ryzhik thought it was more important that the very bright students were not bored, than to protect the moderately bright students from falling behind. Grisha sat quietly in the back of the classroom and did not show off. Gessen gives the back story of specialized secondary schools for budding young mathematicians. Andrei Kolmogorov, besides being a great mathematician, was a pioneer is identifying and nurturing mathematical talent. In 1935 Kolmogorov and Pavel Alexandrov (no relation to Alexander Alexandrov, below) started a mathematics competition in Moscow for secondary school students. It eventually developed into the International Mathematical Olympiad. In 1963 Kolmogorov and nuclear physicist Isaak Kikoin persuaded the government to set up a special school for mathematically talented youth, to help the Soviet Union in weapons research and development. International Mathematical OlympiadGrisha was part of the Russian team of four coached by Alexander Abramov that competed at the International Mathematical Olympiad in 1982 in Budapest. Grisha achieved a perfect score and won a gold medal. Leningrad State UniversityGrisha Perelman entered Leningrad State University in 1982. Grisha learned geometry from Alexander Danilovich Alexandrov. Alexandrov was a mathematical physicist who had earlier protected the science of genetics from Lysenkoism. Steklov Mathematics InstituteIn 1987, Grisha Perelman entered the Steklov Mathematics Institute (Leningrad Branch). He was able to obtain admission, in spite of the fact that he was Jewish and there was a Jewish quota. This was because he received political help from Alexander Alexandrov, Yuri Burago, Viktor Zalgaller and Mikhael Gromov. Alexandrov Spaces and the United StatesAfter leaving the Steklov, Grisha started working in the field of Alexandrov spaces at several different locations, including the Institut des Hautes Études Scientifiques (Paris), the Courant Institute at New York University, the State University of New York at Stony Brook and the University of California at Berkeley. Gromov arranged for Grisha to give a talk on his work on Alexandrov spaces at the 1991 Geometry Festival at Duke University. This is when Grisha’s talent first became known in the United States. In1994, Grisha proved an important result, the Soul Conjecture of Jeff Cheeger and Detlef Gromoll. He then turned to an even harder problem in geometric topology. Poincare ConjectureGrisha actually proved a more general result than the Poincare Conjecture, namely the Geometrization Conjecture of Bill Thurston. The Poincare Conjecture is a special case, the spherical case. Grisha extended the work of Richard Hamilton, who used Ricci flows to gradually change the curvature of a surface to become uniformly curved. This method runs into singularities that Hamilton was not able to find a way around. Grisha showed that the worst kinds of singularities will not happen (the non-collapsing theorem), and that the less serious singularities can be removed with surgery. ControversySylvia Nasar wrote an article in The New Yorker called “Manifold Destiny”, which described the work of two of the students S.T. Yau. Yau himself had contributed to the work of Richard Hamilton on Ricci flows when the two were both at the University of California at San Diego. Yau’s students had filled in many of the details in Grisha’s proof. Nasar accused Yau of attempting to claim more than his fair share of the credit for the solution of the Poincare Conjecture. Yau felt that he had been unjustly accused. Part of the problem appears to be that mathematicians themselves do not agree on how much detail in a proof is enough. Another part of the problem is that it is difficult for non-mathematicians to write about mathematics. PsychologyGessen believes that Grisha may suffer from Asperger’s Syndrome, which limits the individual’s ability to pick up on social cues. Because of the failure of the mathematics community to live up to Grisha’s strict code of moral values, he has withdrawn from the world. My personal opinion is that Grisha may also suffer from scrupulosity, a form of obsessive-compulsive personality disorder. Grisha’s colleague Mikhael Gromov describes Grisha as being a scrupulously honest person, someone who actually adheres to a strict professional code that many academics merely profess to adhere to. Having lead a sheltered early life, Grisha probably also suffers from unworldliness. He may believe that academia is more meritocratic than it actually is. "

Might take a while to appreciate some of the finer aspects of mathematics that Grigori Perelman dabbled with, and his reclusive nature might come across as cold and standoffish at times. But there's denying the genius of his mathematical ability, and the far fetched consequences this discovery has on the world of mathematics for years to come. "
36,015101406X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/215221-bria,2,"I sure would have liked to learn about Grigori Perelman, but given that he's so reclusive, Gessen had to fill up the pages with additional, useless sentences and information about herself. I suppose there's some genres of biographies where the author of the biography is a character, either by being connected to the person or something post-modern, but this one doesn't really pull it off. True, I did learn a decent amount about Perelman, not quite so much about the Poincare Conjecture, but it was a bit of a chore to read."
37,015101406X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/75096382-taniya-sah,4,"An amazing book about an even more amazing mathematician. Perelman is as esoteric and elusive a person as the mathematics he once practised. Accompanied by some good research, the author has sketched an enticing narrative about this wizard mathematician. I wistfully think of my grad years when I detested Mathematics, particularly real analysis. Had I read about these mathematicians and their obsessions then, maybe I would have enjoyed studying Mathematics and appreciated its beauty more often!"
38,015101406X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/110137597-sara,5,"I thought this book was excellently written and given the fact the author couldn’t see Grisha, he really provided an understanding of his life. For me this opens up a new perspective of mathematics and the inner workings of mathematicians. I was impressed by the details and interviews and the descriptions of every part, as well as the odd details like how Grisha forgets to tie his shoelaces or cut his nails."
39,015101406X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3815402-frank,3,"Really good. Appreciated the focus on the Soviet system. Wouldn't have minded a bit more discussion of the actual math, *but*, this is one of the very few pop math books that doesn't get bogged down in exposition so points to Gessen. Feels, especially reading it a few years later, like it could use a coda."
40,015101406X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/45392128-sam,5,"I really enjoyed this. It has a lot of details about the history and context in which Perelman grew up in the USSR from Gessen's unique perspective, and it also goes into quite a bit of depth on Perelman's early life in math clubs/competitions and college. There's plenty of information from the few people who were close to Perelman, and it's also very well-written."
41,015101406X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/60113502-charles-earl,4,"Another beautiful mindThe story of Perelman’s genius is fascinating if not tragic, but the story is of modern mathematics culture in many levels: the topology community, how mathematics in Russia and to a lesser extent the US is materialized."
42,015101406X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/26465405-paul,5,Really enjoyed this book. Well written and very engaging. Empathetic portrayal of a group of people who spend their lives in mathematics.

46,015101406X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/19174617-nguy-n-ng-khoa,5,Good read about genius Perelman and his solution to Poincare Conjecture (one of seven millenial problems).
47,015101406X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/434480-darrenglass,4,"[This review will also appear on MAA Online]The story of Grigory Perelman and the Poincare Conjecture is certainly one of the more compelling and, to most people, strange stories in modern mathematics. You start with a long-standing open conjecture and combine this with a genius who clearly has a conflicted relationship with the mathematical community and whether he wants to be a part of it. The genius may or may not have solved the problem and the story has all kinds of narrative tension as the rest of the mathematical community sorts out the details. There are other mathematicians who jump in and try to claim credit and still others who are filled with professional jealousy. And the whole story climaxes with an award ceremony that Perelman refuses to attend for reasons that most people find incomprehensible. There are so many interesting characters and pieces of the story that if I were a Hollywood executive, I would be trying to get the rights to make a movie of this story as quickly as possible. (Of course, many things would be different if I were a Hollywood executive...)There may not yet be a movie of the story of the Poincare Conjecture, but Masha Gessen has written a book about the story, Perfect Rigor: A Genius and the Mathematical Breakthrough of the Century and it certainly does not disappoint. While Gessen did not get to interview Perelman himself, she interviewed a large number of other people who knew Perelman or were involved in the story. Gessen does a good job of articulating the looming questions about Perelman: why would he refuse to submit his papers for publication? Why does he turn down the Fields medal and refuse to accept honors and positions at prestigious institutions? And while she never really 'solves' these questions, she gives a compelling portrait of Perelman, starting with his childhood and his early involvement with math competitions in Russia through the current day.I should be clear that Gessen has not written a math book, choosing to focus on the people and cultures in the story rather than on the mathematics itself. She keeps the description of the Poincare Conjecture and the various details of the proof at a very superficial level, and when she does describe mathematics, she often gets some of the small details wrong in a way that will cause many mathematicians to bristle. On the other hand, she seems to 'get' mathematicians, and does a good job of portraying our community and what motivates us, even in the opening lines of the book:As anyone who has attended grade school knows, mathematics is unlike anything else in the universe. Virtually every human being has experienced that sense of epiphany when an abstraction suddenly makes sense. And while grade-school arithmetic is to mathematics roughly what a spelling bee is to the art of novel writing, the desire to understand patterns -- and the childlike thrill of making an inscrutable or disobedient pattern conform to a set of logical rules -- is the driving force of all mathematics.In addition to being a biography of Perelman and of the mathematical community's response to the solution of the Poincare Conjecture, Perfect Rigor is a portrait of mathematics in Russia during the second half of the twentieth century. Knowing very little about this subject, I found her portrayal of a community filled with intense competition, strict rules, complicated bureaucracy, and not a small amount of anti-semitism, to be fascinating. Perfect Rigor is not a perfect book. The book would have benefitted from direct quotes from Perelman, and while I understand Gessen's choices I personally would have preferred a little more math. I also could have done without a section late in the book about Asperger's Syndrome, which tried to diagnose Perelman from a medical point of view, and which I found a bit condescending towards mathematicians. But given the choices that Gessen made and the parameters she had to work in, she wrote a very interesting and readable book about one of the more compelling stories of our time. "
48,015101406X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1394439-shrimp,4,"A highly enjoyable book about a fantastically capable man with a principal focus on mathematics. This focus then allowed him to solve a cornerstone conjecture in topology. His upbringing included a cast of people including Andrey Kolmogorov and other individuals who helped a Jewish boy, normally oppressed, to stay focused on mathematics. The focus did come at a cost of normal human interaction and he ultimately turned into a ascetic person when facing the realities of life that didn't fit his ideals. Although it's hard to say if he would have matured any differently due to his predisposition. His distaste for the overall mathematical establishment caused him to reject the Fields Medal (never done to this date) and a $1,000,000 prize from the Clay Mathematics Institute. His proof was correct and no other recognition was needed. Beautiful. "
49,015101406X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/21566627-kitty-jay,3,"In 2000, the Clay Institute announced the Millennium Problems: seven of the great mathematical mysteries. Anyone who solved one of these illustrious mysteries could lay claim to one of the greatest accomplishments in math history, as well as a prize of a million dollars. Two years later, a man named Grigory Perelman submitted what would later be established as the solution to the Poincare Conjecture – but rather than becoming an international superstar, Perelman rejected the fiscal prize and disappeared from the world of mathematics.Intrigued by the man who solved one of the great math questions of the age but rejected the fame and money to go along with it, Masha Gessen interviewed friends, teachers, and colleagues to track the trajectory of Perelman’s solution and uncover the reasons behind his self-imposed seclusion.While the back billed it more to be about the math, Perfect Rigor actually focuses more on Perelman himself. The first half of the book is largely about math culture in Soviet Russia, an interesting subject in and of itself – from the geniuses who built schools for the truly gifted and their constant fights and subterfuge with ideological politics to the prodigies who dedicated themselves to math in order to avoid being conscripted into the army. Gessen’s writing is brusque at points, in that particular style endemic to journalists, but also somewhat confusing. Having grown up in Soviet Russia herself, she often seems to assume the reader will know what she’s talking about – and I’ll admit to having to stop and look things up more than once. Not that I mind doing that – that’s what Google is for, after all – but it did interrupt the flow of the book. Other times her sentences can be awkward or confusing. Take, for instance, a section early in the book: “What made the school different was that the students’ talents and intellectual achievements made them more popular and significant” (45). The achievements more significant? Or the schools? Her writing can also be uncomfortable at points; she has not-very-flattering descriptions of some of the people she interviewed, she writes down one story from memory when it seemed rather obvious the person being interviewed didn’t want it shared, and at one point she states that one man she interviewed was flat-out wrong (based on her impressions gathered from others). While I appreciate the fact that journalists, particularly investigative ones, need to be aggressive, the lack of tact shown was enough to make me wince occasionally while reading it. Most authors who write these sorts of books, particularly books involving people still alive, write with a subtle grace that allows one to read between the lines; Gessen states what she believes with sometimes uncomfortable bluntness. It is also hard to follow her footnoting. There are no footnotes within the text itself, so you have to flip to the back to figure out if a source is cited or not. While this may keep the flow going within the book itself, it makes trying to verify or read more about certain things an absolute nightmare. It would have been much preferred if the book had stuck to the common academic practice of including the full list of footnotes at the end of each chapter. Still, the story she tells is an intriguing one, and a closer look at the culture, politics, and often eccentric characters in the world of math. She combines a narrative with personal anecdotes with a love for one of the great mathematical mysteries. Even non-math lovers will be fascinated by the book, the problem, and the man himself. "
50,015101406X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5861289-robert-boyd,4,"Grigory Perelman is a Russian who solved one of mathematics' thorniest problems, the Poincare Conjecture. With this achievement, Perelman could have taken his place on the faculty at any number of elite institutions with a tenured position, and he could have claimed the Clay prize ($1 million). Instead, he angrily closed off all contact with all his colleagues (and the rest of humanity), quit his position at a research institute in St. Petersburg, and retreated into his apartment where his only contact was with his mother.Masha Gessen has, to a certain extent, made Russian intellectuals and The intelligentsia her beat. And Perelman is certainly a supreme intellectual. But she is faced with the task of writing about an extremely hermetic misanthrope. She does a good job of recreating his childhood, where he was nurtured in hard-core Soviet mathematics clubs (which reminded me of what athletic children in the USSR probably went through). She seems to have spoken to everyone that Perelman ever knew. Her outline of his life is as good as it could be.But she has two difficulties. She has no access to his inner life, and that's what is most intriguing about Perelman. However, she suspects that he may have Asberger's Syndrome, which is a form of autism. She describes Pereleman's actions to experts in Asberger's, and they agree that this may be the explanation. But the reasoning is circular. Perelman acts in certain ways that indicate he has Asberger's, and his Asberger's explains why he acts the way he does. She's convincing as far as she can be without having contact with her subject.The other weakness of the book is unavoidable. The math it talks about is ferociously difficult and resistant to simplification. Poincare's Conjecture is a topology problem, which is a branch of mathematics that pretty much only professional mathematicians study. Contrast this with Fermat's Theorem, which can be understood by anyone who studied algebra in high school. And if Poincare's Conjecture is difficult, the means of solving the problem are far, far beyond what can be reasonably explained to a lay readership. Gessen obviously doesn't understand it (only a few people in the world do), so she doesn't try to explain. But for a reader, lacking this understanding makes the intellectual stakes a bit harder to understand."
51,015101406X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1866535-dave,4,"“Pefect Rigor” is an interesting look at the life and mind of a mathematical genius. Masha Geesen draws on her own experience as a math whiz in Russia, as well as the associates of Grigory Perelman to take a look at his life, and the unique character, ethics, and morals which have led him to turn down the Fields Medal. Masha Geesen had a difficult task in front of her, as Grigory Perelman was not likely to give her any information directly, and his associates were also hesitant to cause any additional friction between themselves and Perelman which disclosures to the media had caused in his past. The result is a short, but very interesting book, which helps the reader to understand the circumstances in the Soviet Union when Grigory Perelman was growing up and attending the specialized schools for mathematics. She provides wonderful insight into what Perelman may have experienced, and most importantly she does a good job of remaining objective and fair. Though it is clear that she has opinions throughout, she stays away from judging Perelman or any other of the people. The chapter which perhaps comes the closest to pushing a view is “The Madness”, in which Geesen discusses the possibility that Perelman suffers from Asperger’s Syndrome, but even her she is careful to insert the statement “Grigory Perelman, as far as I know, never took the AQ test and certainly cannot be diagnosed by someone who has not talked to him…”There is no doubt that the lack of any discussion with Perelman himself takes away from the overall result. However, one can still appreciate what Masha Geesen has done to pull together this book on the man who is probably the greatest mathematical genius of our time. One would guess after reading this book that Grigory Perelman would not appreciate the effort, after all who is Masha Geesen, and the focus is more on the man than the math. It will be interesting to see if Perelman accepts the Millennium Prize. Regardless of whether he accepts it or not, Perelman is the first to solve one of the seven problems which the Clay Institute selected as important classical questions that need solutions."
52,015101406X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2983742-daniel,4,I enjoyed reading the book. I had not know much about Russian mathematicians before I read the book. I wonder what its like to be a mathematician. To be able to be great with numbers and shapes. I am surprised there were any mathematicians in Russia after reading the struggles that some had to go through. What else can I write about the book. It was a page turner for me. 
53,015101406X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/11264113-chakresh,4,"Even though the author got no opportunity to interview Perelman, the book throws some light on a world of mathematics that revolved around him. Its a goodread. "
54,015101406X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3932035-moshe-zioni,3,"Full disclosure - i love mathematics and topology was one of the most eclectic, elegant and eccentric topics I have encountered during my very basic degree.I had to give that disclosure in order to properly apologizing on not giving this marvelous topic more than three star rating.Thing is that maybe I am the cause of not liking it as I have should, but mainly because this book is not about math, not really. It IS about Dr Perlman but heis left an outsider to this biography and psychological analysis, we get to know him through the eyes of his friends, peers and foes, albeit massive collection of thoughts, it is not merely the same thing.The second withdrawal from the book is the disproportionate focus on antisemitism that was confined in the soviet era and especially by soviet academia. It takes more than half the book to get to the point of involving Perlman and overall you constantly ask yourself when will we get to him and his work or psyche.Last mathematics and even the famous Poincare's is left unexplained through most of the book when it is popping out somewhere and even when finally getting to it, it lacks motivational paragraph.That said it was a fluent and fun read, but mostly felt like a miss to me."
55,015101406X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1849937-yofish,3,"Really 3.5A story about Perelman, his proof of Poincarre, and his gradual hermitting of himself. Really, too little math in it for me. And it was lacking in math in weird places---like showing a problem given to 7th-graders, but not following up or explaining. It was written by a Russian Jew about the same age as Perelman. And there was a lot about how math in the Soviet Union developed since Stalin or so. (It was a little bit isolated from politics simply because it was so necessary for war efforts.) And quite a bit about the difficulty of being Jewish (or even just having a Jewish name) in the Soviet Union at that time. And that stuff was pretty good. The author seems to have talked to everyone (except Perelman himself, of course). Seemed like it could have been longer, more comprehensive. Maybe a little too much speculation about what Perelman's motivations must have been. Pretty good explication of some of math's politics, and mathematician's thinking, and even some Asperger's stuff. I did learn stuff (about the history, not the math). "
56,015101406X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2715674-ken,5,"This book really took me by surprise. Masha Gessen did a really good job with the small amount of information that she had to go off of. Still it was more information than the subject of the book, Grigory Perelman would have liked her to have. This book is the story of a Russian mathematician who solved this centuries greatest mathematical problem and refused to play by the rules. When forced to try to be rewarded for his efforts, Perelman closed himself off from the world; leaving the mathematics community for good. Though she was left to speculate what may have been going on in his head, Gessen pulls together an intriguing tale about the mind of a genius through interviews with some of the people who knew him well. She starts off with the fortunate timing of Perelman's entrance into the world of mathematics and gets into the politics that surrounds his solution in a once benign world of overachievers. This book is a quick read, and well worth it!"
57,015101406X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1043080-jas,3,"Most of the book draws from accounts of Perelman from his closest circle. The second best thing, considering Perelman rarely agrees to being interviewed. Other than his interview with the New York Times (the excellent article titled Manifold Destiny)after solving Poincare and a few email messages, Perelman's actual thinking can only by inferred. The book paints a picture of an autistic genius, living like an ascetic with a fascinatingly unique take on life.His motives for not claiming the famous clay prize and withdrawing from mathematics are very interesting and are attributed to his sense of 'principles.' His ethics are severe, essentially black and white; the logic being undeniable and precise. He does not tolerate any breaches in these principles, and this is what sets him apart from most of his peers which he considers conformists. A very fascinating point of view, of a strange (relative to the rest of us or the bulk of society) man.  "
58,015101406X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7228323-raghu,3,"Gessen uses her keen reporter's eye and her experience of the Russian state and society to explain the life and motivations of Perelman leading to his proof of the Poincare conjecture and the sensational events thereafter. It is not a book on the mathematics of the proof but the sociology of mathematics and the institutions supporting it from the Academies, the Olympiads, and the big Prizes. Ultimately, it appears that Perelman's main complaint was that he only cared to engage with others on the basis of his ideas (at the deepest technical level; even the standard academic math level was insufficient) but everyone seemed more eager to engage with him as a person without completely, at the deepest level, understanding what he had done (from other mathematicians, to university hiring committees, to prize awarding committees, and of course the popular press and the public) -- of which I am definitely guilty as charged."
59,015101406X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/15975206-jacob-stutzman,4,"Overall, this was a phenomenal character study in how to build a nurture an anti-social genius, along with a look into the world of mathematics in general and Russian mathematics in particular. Gessen's writing was lucid and engaging down to the sentence level. Truly, at one point she used the word ""timeless"" in a more apt manner than any other writer I can think of.My only complaint came as the actual solution to the Poincarè Conjecture surfaced. As a not-mathematician, there was either too much focus on the technical elements of the solution or too little. Recognizing that there probably are and certainly will be books on Ricci flow with surgery and topology, I haven't read any of them. I needed more time spent explaining things, possibly some visuals to help, or much less time. It's a relatively small part of the book, but pulled me from the narrative and I got worried about the remainder.Regardless, this was a very good book."
