Mostly toxic plants, but some simply smell bad or disperse their seeds by attaching seed pods to you or your pet. I’m still not sure why they are wicked.About birthworts, I can't see a pipe.Birthworts (Aristolochia clematitis)Climbing vines that produce bizarre flowers that vaguely resemble pipes, which is how they got their other common name, Dutchman’s pipe. The Greeks looked at the flower and saw something else: a baby emerging from the birth canal. At that time, plants were often used to treat ailments of the body parts they most closely resembled. Birthwort was given to women to help with difficult labor, but the vine is very poisonous and carcinogenic. It certainly would have killed more women than it helped.  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aristol..."

The seeds are poisonous and indigenous to Asia and Africa. Victims get fever, trouble speaking, and vomit blood. Castor oil has the ricin removed and is often used for its laxative effect.Coyotillo shrub berries are quite sinister.  This plant is found in Texas and causes paralysis and death, but symptoms don't start until days or weeks later. The houseplant, Jerusalem cherry is beautiful. However, all parts of the plant cause weakness, drowsiness, nausea and vomiting, and harm the heart.Deadly nightshade, also known as atropa belladonna (""beautiful woman"").  All parts of the plant are poisonous. Even rubbing against it can blister skin. However, we also use it for several medicines – atropine, scopolamine, donnatol, and hyoscyamine. The plant can cause rapid heart rate, confusion, hallucinations, seizures. Italian women made mild tinctures of it to dilate pupils because they thought it made them more attractive. Some foods that humans consume have parts that are poisonous or poisonous if not prepared correctly. CORN of all things.  If eaten as a primary staple, can cause severe niacin deficiency. If eaten with lime it becomes safe. Typically, if you're eating a well rounded diet with plenty of other foods, you won't have a problem. Symptoms include dermatitis, dementia, diarrhea, and even death. Cashews –if the nut or a person touches the shell, it will cause a bad rash. Traditionally it is steamed open and makes them partially cooked, which makes them safe. Green potato skin – basically if it’s green and eaten raw in large enough quantities, it can cause burning and GI symptoms, coma, and death.  Potato is a part of the nightshade family. The green happens when exposed to light and creates high solanine levels. However, this isn't typically an issue, since most people cook their potatoes and don’t eat a ton of the green flesh all at once.The Habanero Chile:

“Strangely, the active ingredient in hot peppers, capsaicin, does not actually burn. It stimulates nerve endings to send a signal to the brain that mimics a burning sensation. Capsaicin does not dissolve in water, so grabbing for the water jug to put out the fire in your mouth is useless. However, it will bind to a fat like butter, milk, or cheese. A good stiff drink is also in order, as the alcohol works as a solvent.”“But nothing could protect you against the power of Blair’s 16 Million Reserve, a so-called pharmaceutical grade hot sauce made of pure capsaicin extract. A tiny one-milliliter bottle of the clear potion sells for $199 and comes with a warning that it must be used “for experimental/display purposes only” and never as a flavoring for food.” 

 Jimson Weed was found on Jamestown Island in 1607. Looking for food, settlers tried to add Jimson Weed to their diet. Death came by delusions, convulsions, and respiratory failure. 70 years later, British soldiers arrived and settlers secretly added it to their food. While they didn’t die, they went crazy for 11 days which gave settlers the upper hand. People started calling it the Jamestown weed and over time, became Jimson weed. Giant Hogweed causes severe blisters that worsen when exposed to sunlight. It's scary because I’d never heard of it, and it’s in the Washington/Oregon area of the United States, and in Canada. It sort of looks like a huge Queen Anne's Lace. If you're really into poisonous plants, you can visit the Alnwick poison gardens in Northumberland, England. If you go, let me know.  "

3,1565126831,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3453249-diana-book-of-secrets,4,"WICKED PLANTS was an Audible Daily Deal, and with that title and cover, I couldn't resist downloading it. The book is a curious and often unsettling encyclopedia of plants that have caused harm in one way or another throughout the centuries. I don't think a lot about plants being dangerous, but after reading this I definitely should. I was surprised that even some everyday foods can be harmful. (There's a reason cashews aren't sold in their shell.) However the most harmful of plants kills nearly 6 million people per year. (You can probably guess what it is.)The audiobook was narrated by Coleen Marlo, and she did a fabulous job making each culprit plant seem down right sinister. I will say that I also checked out the hardcover of this book so I could see the illustrations and read the scientific names of all the plants. There were many presented and they moved by quickly, so it was nice to have a physical copy to reference."

""We would never pick up a discarded coffee cup from the sidewalk and drink from it. But on a hike, we'll nibble unfamiliar berries as if they had been placed there for our appetites alone. We'll brew a medicinal tea from unrecognizable bark and leaves that a friend passes along, assuming that anything natural must be safe. And when a baby comes home, we rush to add safety caps to electrical outlets but ignore the houseplant in the kitchen and the shrub by the french door. This in spite of the fact that 3,900 people are injured annually by electrical outlets while 68,847 are poisoned by plants.""

 Writer Amy Stewart begins this book by saying that her intent is not to scare people away from the outdoors, but to encourage knowledge and respect. I for one have a new found respect for the power of plant life now. I do a fair share of gardening, and I have to admit that I typically plant what looks cosmetically appealing (for the exception of my must-have butterfly plants!). Of course, I knew about poison ivy and all the other commonly known skin irritating plants. I even knew about the dangers of oleander and certain berries. But did I know that two plants I have had in my backyard secrete toxins? No. Did I know the vine that is was randomly growing along my fence is poisonous? NO! But now I do. I have to admit, as knowledgeable as I feel right now, I'm also slightly paranoid in light of the fact me and my boy are doing some primitive camping next month (perfect timing huh?). But it's all good. My only regret is that I borrowed Wicked Plants via audio from the library and I don't have a physical copy to include in my camping pack...but that can be rectified. If you are a gardener, nature-lover, or even if you just enjoy nurturing houseplants, then expand your knowledge by reading this book.Note: If you are interested in this book, I'd recommend against the audiobook if you have the option. From what I understand, there are etchings and drawings to help with identifying each plant that Ms. Stewart discusses, and audio just can't deliver this component. I listened to the audio and then had to research the visuals when I thought I recognized the description of a few plants that were in my yard. So although the audio is still effective, save yourself some time and start with the paperbook/ebook to begin with. Just a thought.Extras!Check out Ms. Stewart's darkly comedic book trailer for Wicked Plants

5,1565126831,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2970379-manybooks,1,"I actually stopped reading Amy Stewart's Wicked Plants: The Weed That Killed Lincoln's Mother and Other Botanical Atrocities in utter frustration in September 2013 and really also in massive personal disgust, when I realised with a vehement sense of ""oh no"" that while the botanical information and details on the presented toxic, dangerous and destructive plant species are most definitely and indeed interestingly and even fascinatingly enough recounted, it simply bothered and continues to annoy me to no end that the author has made Wicked Plants: The Weed That Killed Lincoln's Mother and Other Botanical Atrocities appear almost like some kind of murder-mystery offering, with the included and featured toxic plants and noxious weeds appearing as though they were actually evilly cunning nasty villains or raging unbalanced psychopaths. However and sorry, Ms. Stewart, but plants are neither to be described as atrocities (what a terrible and cringeworthy concept that is in and of itself and the kind of attitude that in my opinion both condones and encourages the use of toxic weedkillers and so on and so on) nor are they personally evil, calculating or deliberately and nastily cruel. Honestly, please do stop with the anthropomorphism; plants are NOT human beings, and your insistence on making the included toxic and dangerous plant species appear as basically human type villains, this has really and truly utterly destroyed Wicked Plants: The Weed That Killed Lincoln's Mother and Other Botanical Atrocities for me, it has really and utterly ruined what might well have been a potentially enlightening and engaging reading experience (for just to point out the inherently obvious, even the most deadly, the most toxic plant species are as a general rule NOT poisonous out of inborn malice and/or evil intent, but due to the necessity of defence and protection, the need of trying to avoid being consumed, trying to avoid being destroyed).And finally, last but most surely and definitely not least, destructive invasive, non endemic plant species are also NOT by their general nature somehow nasty and of active offensive intent (which is how to and for me Amy Stewart seems to have textually described them in Wicked Plants: The Weed That Killed Lincoln's Mother and Other Botanical Atrocities). No, most invasive plant species like purple loosestrife and other similarly problematic, rapidly spreading weed-like entities are dangerous and destructive not really in and of themselves but due to the fact that they often have been callously and thoughtlessly introduced into fragile ecosystems by US, by humans (introduced into ecosystems where they have no naturally occurring checks and balances and could thus profligate and spread unhindered), a fact and I guess inconvenient truth that the author generally chooses to ignore in her striving to make her featured ""wicked"" plant species appear overdramstised, imbued with and full of natural evil, personal nastiness and wanton and deliberate destructiveness. And thus, I cannot really give more than one star to Wicked Plants: The Weed That Killed Lincoln's Mother and Other Botanical Atrocities since I can on a personal level neither accept nor in any way condone this type of for me textual annoyance, this type of callous and silly anthropomorphism (toxic plants being described as deliberately cruel, invasive non endemic plant species being labeled as deliberately destructive on a personal level, that goes simply and utterly too far for me, the interest engendered, the fact that I do find the subject matter of toxic plant species very readable totally and utterly notwithstanding). And I think I will also and yes gladly refrain from even considering the sequel, where Amy Stewart analyses bugs and other insects that might be, that are considered as pests, considering that in the title she is already clearly showing us her bias by calling them, by labelling these insect species as diabolical."

7,1565126831,http://goodreads.com/user/show/38471137-kathleen-bianchi,5,Very interesting and educational. Written well and with humor.
8,1565126831,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1053760-shelby-trains-flying-monkeys,3,Really interesting. I don't think I'll ever eat figs again though.
9,1565126831,http://goodreads.com/user/show/82987855-moonkiszt,3,"I love a book that gets me googling. . . . this has every plant you could think of. I remember playing in the heart of a huge hedge of oleanders in one of the backyards of my childhood. . . .the branches spread in a very straight, organized fashion to the leaves, making a ""space"" just perfect to play in. I remember placing the pretty flowers and leaves on plates and pretending I was fixing food for my siblings. Don't worry, they didn't die - picky eaters, both. This book mentioned oleanders. . . . In fact this book mentioned just about everything! Lantana, Callas, Camas, Trillium, Hydrangea, White Snakeroot. . . types heard of and not heard of. My biggest take away is contrary to all those who work so hard to convince us that we should trust nature in its environment. I will be buying all my produce in a brand named store for the foreseeable future! No lollygagging with grass stems twined about my fingers, chewing on stalks of green or gold. IT's POISON, I TELL YOU! IT'S POISON!Anyway. I liked this book. Was encyclopedic and very listy. 3 stars from me."
10,1565126831,http://goodreads.com/user/show/13126933-lata,4,"A quick and light review of numerous plants and their toxins. The author provides historical and anecdotal views and uses, as well as the physiological effects. Aieeee.The only thing I really have to say about the huge variety of plants that have developed a variety of passive methods to deter insects, fungi and herbivores is, how the heck did we ever manage to find so many different plants to eat safely?"
11,1565126831,http://goodreads.com/user/show/284410-beth,3,"Amy Stewart, a self-proclaimed gardener and writer (not a botanist or scientist) presents, in alphabetical order, mini-biographies of botanical villains, weaving in pop culture, mythology, history, folklore, medicine, and law with botanical and biological information. The most captivating entries are the topical ones that were interspersed in the encyclopedic style, themed with ""houseplants,"" ""ragweeds,"" and ""the devil's bartender,"" all about more common plants. While I love the concept, I was really bothered by the organization (maybe it's the librarian in me!). I would have found this more engaging arranged by the author's creative categories of Illegal, Painful, Intoxicating, Deadly...or even by plant family. There is no index, so the reader cannot get a list of all the nightshades, or search by a particular toxin. The writing is fine - Stewart's ability to pack in a lot of really fascinating information in a small amount of space reminds me a little of Kathleen Krull, but less engaging. A glossary is lacking, along with source notes; the bibliographies are limited to books. A list of poisonous gardens is a whimsical touch. From the poison green cover to the satiny maize colored bookmark, it's a nice package - good size, soft pages, consistent style, older fonts to give a grimoire sense to the volume. I love the botanical etchings by Briony Morrow-Cribbs, but these are much more successful than the images by Jonathan Rosen that are illustrative of the stories Stewart relays; the two styles didn't mesh for me. All in all, Wicked Plants has a great hook, a catchy title and is a pretty package, but this doesn't feel like a book to read straight through. It assumes some knowledge about plants (like what an angiosperm is) because it's really directed at ""gardeners & nature lovers."" The A-Z organization make it feel more like a reference book than it is. The writing is good, but not over the top great. Those with morbid curiosity will be drawn to it (I already know who I'm going to pass my copy along to!) and I envision some students using this as a secondary resource for a report for Health or Biology, but the casualness of the book creates reservations for me; I like sources cited."
12,1565126831,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1468458-lisa,2,"I really couldn't decide if this book was supposed to be farcical or not; it was so melodramatic and sensationalistic. Its claims of DANGER seem to be overrated. Consider elderberries and habanero peppers for example. Elderberries are the favored food of cedar waxwings and I've never seen a pile of these dead birds around a bush. I've eaten them raw many times and never had any problems. As a chemist I just couldn't see how cooking them would remove the cyanide. Curiousity got the better of me and I found this informative site: http://museum.gov.ns.ca/poison/?secti.... Seems it is the unripe fruit and the seeds that are toxic. It is not the cooking, but the fact that you remove the seeds from pie, jelly, and wine that removes the toxin. So spit out those seeds when you eat elderberries! So much for that danger. On to the peppers. ""A jalapeno pepper - generally considered to be the hottest pepper any sane person would attempt to chew and swallow"". Hello? Poppers? This common bar food is eaten by thousands daily, many of whom find them to be mild. Must be a lot of us insane people out there who enjoy habaneros, bannana peppers, and the like. I suspect some of the claims about other plants may be equally exaggerated. This is about as much a reference book as Wikipedia is an encyclopedia!The advice about poison ivy was interesting, but bad! The author recommends crusing the stem of a suspect plant between paper. If the paper turns brown it is poison ivy. Yikes! What ever happened to ""leaves of 3, let it be""? And contrary to the book, poison ivy is not difficult to recognize -- my 7-yr-old can identify it. So don't go digging up your yard and ditching your houseplants to remove these ""dangerous"" plants. The classification of non-fiction lends a great deal of credibility to the factuality of this book. Read it for what it is, an amusing over-the-top book about plants with great botanical drawings!"
13,1565126831,http://goodreads.com/user/show/611031-kater-cheek,3,"Stewart wrote FLOWER CONFIDENTIAL about the floral industry, so one can posit that like me, she loves plants. Like me, she's also fascinated with poison and murder. The book is lush with exquisitely beautiful (and sometimes exquisitely macabre) illustrations. With short chapters, plentiful illustrations, and a thorough table of contents, this is a fast read.(I'm not going to go so far as to say that this is the perfect book for the back of the toilet, but WICKED PLANTS does have short entries, each of which is interesting, and yet none of which will take longer than five or ten minutes to read. Just sayin...)It's a little light on the science for science fans, but at least there aren't a huge cast of organic chemicals clogging up the prose like characters in a Russian novel. It's a little light on the gardening tips for passionate botanists, but has enough new facts in both categories that you'll learn new things. I didn't realize that I had three of these plants in my own yard. I knew oleander was poisonous (everyone knows that) but sago palm?This is a good gateway book for people who aren't into non-fiction but would like to be. It's also a good book if you have anyone in your life who doesn't read much because they think novels are a waste of time."
14,1565126831,http://goodreads.com/user/show/11715683-amy,2," Stewart attempts to exhaustively catalogue toxic/medicinal plants and herbs using supposedly charming historical vignettes that illustrate and implicate the various species' morbidity and mortality on hapless folk. Humanity is the butt of the joke, all of us apparently being bumbling idiots or murderous half-wits in confrontation with our native flora. Not the most winning premise, and I was irritated by her tone right off the bat. Long on attempted wit and short on scientific detail, with most plants falling into multiple categories which are ill-defined and haphazard, this book fatigued but did not enlighten me.  Specifically, I was hoping for a clarification of botanical chemistry and pharmacodynamics nestled in charming anecdotes, legends and actual historical records (or at least etymology, basic mechanism of action and receptor affinity).  No dice. Frustratingly, there was little acknowledgement of the vital & beneficial role many of these plants played in folk medicine and the present-day development of life-saving cheap synthetic analogues by pharmacists-- e.g., digoxin, aspirin and coumadin are widely prescribed, affordable, effective and directly derived from ""wicked"" plants. Ditto for atropine, a mainstay of cardiac resuscitation and an essential antidote to nerve gas; or rocuronium, a curare analogue which is essential in modern surgical anesthesia.  It's sort of the ""pulp fiction"" of naughty plant history with minimal citations and slipshod evidence to support the ""atrocities."" Anything NOT lascivious about the subject was essentially discarded. Further, the pencil illustrations were lurid and childlike.  Bizarre and unsatisfying overall. "
15,1565126831,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2569271-mauoijenn,3,Insightful. Scary. Never touching anything in the woods again!!
16,1565126831,http://goodreads.com/user/show/147079-malia,1,"This book is exactly why I don't like to read science books written by non-scientists. Anyone who writes the sentence ""mushrooms aren't truly plants"" has no business writing a book about plants. Also, as far as writing style goes, this book is more like going on a wikipedia fugue than reading a book. I like the topic, but the execution is abyssmal."
17,1565126831,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5384739-pamela,4,Wonderfully informative and fascinating. Perhaps a bit dry here and there but balanced out with interesting anecdotes. I will never look at a cashew nut the same again. 
18,1565126831,http://goodreads.com/user/show/81718362-ann,3,"Actual rating: 3.5 stars This book might be a good choice for people who are a bit squeamish and would rather skip Stewart's Wicked Bugs: The Louse That Conquered Napoleon's Army and Other Diabolical Insects. After reading Wicked Plants, I was surprised how many houseplants and common garden plants are toxic and it made me wonder why there aren't clearer standards for labeling by growers and nurseries. Otherwise, it also made me wonder historically how many people lost their lives or became ill while trying to figure out which plants were safe to eat and which weren't. As with my similar criticism of Wicked Bugs, I wish the author had included photographs for identification purposes. In this case, I really did not care for the illustrations at all, even from an artistic perspective. Still I appreciate books I learn something useful from and knowing a few plants in my garden can potentially cause major skin irritation is definitely useful."
19,1565126831,http://goodreads.com/user/show/16212136-peter-pete-mcloughlin,4," Learning about some bad plants, poisonous, irritating, allergenic, pokey, stinky, nasty plants, plants that make you hallucinate, plants that make retch, plants that make you break out in blisters, plants that make sneeze, plants that can kill you. Lots of hazards some local some remote. "
20,1565126831,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3860127-melissa-bennett,4,"Great book with lots of interesting information. I ended up having the physical book and also had the book on Audible by accident. I found that it was nice to listen to the Audible version as I followed the book with it. With Audible, the pronunciations of all of the plants were nicely done but the book had lots of drawings that I wanted to look at as well. Some of the information I knew and some just blew me away. "
21,1565126831,http://goodreads.com/user/show/8253900-latasha,4,this book is really great and informative but maybe the audio book is not the way to go. no illustrations. 
22,1565126831,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3125317-je,4,"Who knew plants could be so wicked? This book contains the terrors of the plant world. Be afraid. Be very afraid. My favorite plant was the dangerous Jimsom weed. The Jamestown settlers used it against some British soldiers, to get the upper hand on ‘em. Clever colonists. Also interesting was the caster bean, whose poisonous extract was used to kill a communist in the 1970s. And how ‘bout those crazy poisonous ordeal beans, used to determine guilt within the West African criminal justice system? That’s what I liked about this book. It’s not a dry encyclopedia of wicked plants. Every plant has its own wicked story. Did you know there are male plants and female plants, and male plants are the ones responsible for all our allergy problems? Are we really surprised, ladies? Did you know atropine (extracted from plants like Deadly Nightshade), which causes various horrible symptoms when ingested, is sometimes added to addictive painkillers to keep patients from getting hooked? Well done, laboratory chemists! But I can’t help but wonder if there’s a better way… Anyhow, the plants in Wicked Plants are organized alphabetically, but I would have preferred if they had been organized categorically first, like Destructive, Illegal, Intoxicating, Offensive, Painful, Dangerous, Deadly… and then organized alphabetically within those categories. I like to read about my plants categorically. Also, it contains lots of cool drawings and etchings, but I still found myself Googling real pictures of the plants to get a better idea. On that note, I Googled this offensive plant called “slobber weed,” which, when ingested, causes a person to drool two or more pints of saliva, and Google gave me a bunch of pictures of hippies “drooling” over their marijuana. Slobber weed.Yes, this was a swell read. And I had no prior interest in plants. Recommend. "
23,1565126831,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3583076-sue-smith,4,"This is the nicest presentation of a 'fact' book that I've seen for a long time.First off .... I love the cover. That's just me- I love how it gives a sinister vibe, looks old and has a solemn, menacing appearance with the use of that intertwining thorny vine. Absolutely made me want to pick it up and open it. Also loved the golden ribbon stitched into the binding so you could mark your place - or the plant that you want to use on your next victim.Next, I love the beautiful illustrations and etchings. More the etchings. They were exquisite. Soooooo detailed it felt like you could reach out and touch them. Really helped to show the beauty and the beast in the plants - how deceptive the beauty can be. The illustrations were macabre, to say the least, but they certainly gave you the true understanding of the nature of the plant. I think my favorite one was the Botanical Crime Families - had a strong resemblance to the Godfather!! Mainly, I love how this little tome was laid out - alphabetical but broken up by small 'chapters' on groupings. The plants all were introduced with a small but interesting story that involved some poor unfortunate that had a run in with said plant that usually didn't end well. All plants were given a brief history and symptoms you should expect if you decide to ingest them, as well as the latin name and the other given names by locals,etc. It's a quick read actually, but would be really handy to have on your shelf on the off chance you decide to try that 'weed' that looks and smells just like celery in your next culinary creation. Me - I'll stick to the tried and true! But, it's always good to know!!"
24,1565126831,http://goodreads.com/user/show/883451-susan-in-nc,4,"I enjoyed this book, as an amateur but enthusiastic gardener, but also as an armchair popular science nerd. Amy Stewart’s entertaining, humorous yet informative style, and the layout of the Kindle book I read, allow readers to dip in and out of the information, and read as much or as little as they like each time. I will keep an eye out for a copy of this book to buy for my collection of gardening books, it is helpful and interesting. The author offers common sense advice like always wear gloves in the garden, never ingest berries or leaves you find or are given unless you can identify them (as she wisely points out, you wouldn’t drink from a cup of coffee you found sitting on the roadside!), and if you think you or a loved one or pet has ingested or rubbed against one of these potentially harmful plants, don’t leaf through the book for information, call poison control immediately!Her humor shines through, as does her fascination and respect for the natural world, as she guides readers through quick, short chapters like “This Houseplant Could be your last”, “Deadly Dinner” and “Botanical Crime Families”. Gardeners, indeed anyone who spends time outdoors, would benefit and learn a lot from this book, and be entertained in the process!"
25,1565126831,http://goodreads.com/user/show/223837-nicky,3,"Wicked Plants is one of those books which seems, to me, more like the sort of thing you dip into, flip through, and ultimately probably leave on the bookshop shelf. The illustrations are quite pretty, and some of the facts are entertaining, but all in all it becomes a list of facts, grouped into categories of varying usefulness/interest.If you’re fascinated by all the ways the natural world can kill us, this might well be your thing — and if you love plants in general, and spend a lot of time gardening, it might be a good idea to know the baddies hiding in the hedgerows, too. But for me it was more of a curiosity, and I only finished it because it happened to be what I had on hand when I couldn’t sleep.Reviewed for The Bibliophibian."

I am not likely to remember every plant and its toxin but its affect (no matter which genus) will likely be; nausea, vomiting, irritated bowel in the extreme, paralysis and respiratory failure. If there are others to note, by that time you won’t care! I was surprised at how many of these I have actually cultivated in my own garden and home. Some of which I gave a ""Jaundiced eye"" while reading this book!If your significant other has a copy of this book in your library, placed next to the Dieffenbachia and Philodendron, that are collecting the sun through the window, which overlooks your lovely Oleander, under which the Sweet Peas roam;…Don’t drink the freshly made tea!!!"

That's a vague summary, because there's a wide variety here, from poisonous to irritating to invasive. Each plant has a very short write up that describes what it is and what makes it so bad. There's also a few short ""feature"" sections that will have brief paragraphs about half a dozen or so plants that fit a theme (deadly to house pets, for example). The author is writing in a very conversational style. If I were to walk with her through her own poison garden, she'd probably say pretty much exactly the same things in exactly the same ways when talking about her plants. It's a quick and fascinating read.Oh, and it's so very pretty. Starting with that lovely green cover of entwining, thorny vines. Each plant is illustrated with an honest-to-God copper plate etching by Briony Morrow-Cribbs, every one so beautiful that I'd love to have them framed. This is the sort of book that can just be looked at appreciatively."
31,1565126831,http://goodreads.com/user/show/30276417-nancy-mills,4,"Fascinating. I listened to the audiobook and I think I might prefer the paper version, as this certainly SHOULD have illustrations. Some of the plants the author writes about are the stuff of nightmares, especially those which can make you fatally ill just by touching them. Makes one think twice about foraging and nibbling on unknown plants, assuming that if they taste ok, they're safe to eat. Generally though, as deliciously frightening as this book is, I would still assume that poisonous plants USUALLY taste nasty, otherwise we would have dead livestock littering the landscape.Fun to listen to but I would recommend the paper version."
32,1565126831,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1291915-lauren,4,"A very interesting little reference book - the plants are grouped by how ""wicked"" they are: dangerous, intoxicating, illegal, etc. I learned several tidbits from it. Did you know that Bayer drug company was the first distributor of heroin from the opium poppy? It was on the market for years before they completely realized the effects of the drug. The bit about the deadly nightshade berries crossed my mind when I went berry-picking this past weekend... "

It's a quick and readable introduction to the wide world of dangerous plants, with the fun and exciting (well, if you share some of my gallows humor) basics on the major ones plus the relatives of these dangerous plants.But that's not all this book offers. It's not just clever murder methods. It's also the stuff won't kill you (probably), but will make you sick and very uncomfortable. It's the stuff it would never occur to you to eat, but might kill your animals.It's the stuff you probably don't want to plant in your garden, especially if you have allergies, or care about people who do.It's the invasive plants that are choking waterways.It's the nasty stuff that global warming will help invade areas currently free of it.It's those fascinating carnivorous plants.

I enjoyed it - but be forewarned - the story about Lincoln's mother is very late in the book. I did learn to not randomly eat things growing in the wild that look like carrots. I also learned of a lot of plants I or my family have had or currently have growing in gardens and indoors are poisonous, like hydrangeas and azaleas, dumb cane and plumeria - but we don't eat them anyway. I loved the etchings and drawings throughout the book, the first are beautiful, and the second funny. The etchings reminded me of my mother painting flower pots with flowers from pictures in a book in my young teenage years - they were so beautiful. I liked the little true stories in the plants about instances of people being poisoned by the plants she describes. The one that sticks with me the most is the garden plant that resembles horseradish and the story when they were mixed up. While I enjoyed reading this, the vast majority of its knowledge will be lost to me, so it would be best used as a reference manual after your first read through.#abookyoupickedbecausethetitlecaughtyourattention"
36,1565126831,http://goodreads.com/user/show/13313122-kristen-merke,2,"I enjoyed this book overall; but it wasn't what I expected. I was hoping for more narrative non-fiction about plants who'd killed people (based on subtitle I gathered this impression). Instead it was some narrative and mostly just facts about the plants. Which is fine and I learned a thing or two, but it started to feel repetitive and I got tired of just reading symptoms of plant ingestion. I also wish there had been color photos of the plants, I found myself doing a lot of googling to see images of the plant in question. I don't think this is a bad book, per say but it's more of a general knowledge reference guide. If you know nothing about plants I suppose this is an okay start."
37,1565126831,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3082647-fabulousraye,3,Informative and surprisingly funny in parts. It does tell you about plants that can be used for murder and suicide purposes.

42,1565126831,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1444762-jill,4,"Amy Stewart’s Wicked Plants: The Weed That Killed Lincoln’s Mother and Other Botanical Atrocities takes readers on a tour of the serial killers of the botanical kingdom.Her preface sets the tone, and gives a sense of the interesting and exciting information contained in the book:""Some of the plants in this book have quite a scandalous history. A weed killed Abraham Lincoln’s mother. A shrub nearly blinded Frederick Law Olmsted, America’s most famous landscape architect. A flowering bulb sickened members of the Lewis and Clark expedition. Poison hemlock killed Socrates, and the most wicked weed of all tobacco - has claimed ninety million lives.”For each plant (characterized variously as “deadly,” “illegal,” “intoxicating,” “dangerous,” “destructive,” “offensive,” and “painful,” the author provides an explanation of what the plant does and anecdotes about its use or misuse. Scientific information (biological family, native habitat, and common names appear in sidebars).I learned so many fun things in this book (well, fun from a distance). For example, I knew kudzu was invasive, but had no idea that a single tap root can weigh up to four hundred pounds! The U.S. production of illegal cannabis has been estimated at $35 billion, while the value of the nation’s corn crop is only $22.6 billion, and even tobacco weighs in at only $1 billion. In 1898 Bayer started marketing heroin. It sold it as a cough syrup for children and adults, but took it off the market after ten years. (For fellow fans of the series “The Knick,” which is set in New York City in 1900, you may remember seeing Bayer’s heroin in the last, cliff-hanging scene of Season One.) The author provides evidence of why the bizarre behavior exhibited by young girls in Salem in 1691 was probably a result of Ergot, a toxic fungus that infects rye and contaminates bread. And she includes the latest research on what makes absinthe, the liquor made from wormwood, so lethal: it’s not, as previously thought, the chemical thujone in the wormwood. Apparently mass spectrometer analysis shows the level of thujone in absinthe is minimal; its deleterious effects are more likely due to the fact that it is a 130-proof spirit…..Many of the dangerous plants described are common in the American Southwest. I went to the emergency room at least twice when we lived there because of plant “attacks.” But after reading this book, I consider myself lucky!The author notes that some 68,000 people are poisoned annually by plants. She admonishes us to use reliable sources (not necessarily including those to be found on the internet) to identify poisonous, medicinal, and edible plants. She repeatedly stresses the importance of calling a poison control center if affected.There are beautiful etchings of all the plants discussed, created by Briony Morrow-Cribbs, and also occasional illustrations by Jonathan Rosen. At the end of the book, there is a brief list of some well-known poison gardens, a bibliography, and the address of the book’s website for more information. There is no index, however, which is a bit shocking, and unfortunately diminishes some of the usefulness of the book.Evaluation: This is such a fun, entertaining book. It would make a great tool for all the mothers who try, sometimes in vain, to convince their kids not to put everything in their mouths. "
43,1565126831,http://goodreads.com/user/show/633779-claire-greene,5,"This book was loaned to me from a friend and I admit at first I was a bit sketch about it. While I have begun to learn and enjoy the art of gardening in the last few years, I am not really into all things plants. However, after I began reading it, I really loved it. As a matter of fact, I am going to buy the book for myself AND buy one for my mother (who IS a gardening lover). The book is well written and doesn't get too bogged down in the tiny boring details. Instead, it more focuses on all the little facts and stories regarding plants that we are very familiar with and others that are pretty obscure. Every page is full of interesting facts that are perfect for cocktail party talk, trivial pursuit questions and general conversation starters. (Did you know that tomato plants are part of the Nightshade family?) Beyond the content and the writing, the actual book is beautiful. The cover design gives you a hint of the intricate and beautiful drawings that are on almost every page. This is a great read for doctors appointments, etc. as it is very easy to read a short chapter and put it down to pick up again later. Given that there isn't a true plot, etc. you can put it down for quite awhile and pick it up with no problems. I highly recommend this book to everyone - I guarantee even if you don't really like plants, this book will surprise and entertain you. "

The pages inside? Swoon. This book best resembles an old notebook kept by your talented artist/botanist/genius great-aunt. The pages have that faded, brown-edged look of an old book. (I know it's fake, but still.) The book is heavily illustrated; the etchings of each plant are just gorgeous. The illustrations are a little, well, eccentric. They're by an artist that once worked for Tim Burton, so that should give you an idea. But I love the way this book looks. The subject matter is interesting, to a point. About midway through the book, I felt like the book got a little repetitive as plant after plant induced nausea, heart failure and rashes. But it's an interesting read nonetheless, and if you forge on, the plants get a little more creative in their attempts to kill us all (impaling, exploding, devouring small creatures, etc.). I do have a residual feeling that maybe nature wants me dead, but I suppose I'll get over it. And the contents are divided into snippets, perfect for the busy mom that only has a few minutes at a time to read between catastrophes.Appearance: 5 stars.Contents: 3 stars. "
45,1565126831,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2148308-shawn-thrasher,2,"I was looking forward to Wicked Plants, but I was kind of disappointed. It wasn't what I wanted it to be at all. I once read this book called The Red Hourglass: Lives of the Predators, which was this magnificent book of essays all about spiders, particularly the poisonous kind. Gruesomely interesting, eloquently written, full of fascinating information delicately doled out like caviar at a wedding reception - it's been my touchstone for books of essays and books of information ever since. Wicked Plants was certainly a book of information, but there wasn't really any kind of narrative theme; it was just a series of short articles on poisonous and wicked plants around the world. It sort of felt like a book of school themes (albeit extremely well written ones). Individually interesting, but more for the information Stewart gathered, not for her writing style --and that disappoints.Now if I had wanted to murder someone and wanted to use poison found in the back yard a la Agatha Christie, then I think I would have been far more satisfied with Wicked Plants..."

Well, I was astonished how many plants in your garden can potentially be life threatening and cause severe damage to you and animals. Not only that, but how incredibly naive we are when it comes to handling these plants and we actually bring some of these things in our homes. I was amazed and shocked by just how powerfully potent some plants were. There's a tree in Australia that shoots poison darts at you and if you become impaled by one, you can suffer from months of excruciating pain, pain so unbearable, that the victims don't know what to do with themselves or pretty hyacinths can actually kill you and cause severe rashes if you handle them without gloves. Some of the stories from the Victorian ages and during the inception of the US were very entertaining. It's a quick read and the each chapter has great illustrations of the flowers and trees. I recommend this book to anyone interested in gardening or an avid gardener or if you're looking for a book that's pretty unique, you'll sure love this book. "

Its claims of danger seem to be overrated. It was not so much a narrative, but an encyclopedia with a story or two on some of the plants. I am not likely to remember every plant and its toxin but most of the effects were similar so I might remember those, so it was kind of pointless. I was surprised at how many of these I have actually cultivated in gardens and in life. This book frightened me, but in a good way. How could a book about lovely shrubs, trees and flowers scare you, you ask?

Not only that, but how incredibly naive we are when it comes to handling these plants and we actually bring some of these things in our homes. I found it a little interesting because I hike and it was cool to learn about some plants, but was not very helpful because it did not take about many plants we see in the United States. I recommend this book to anyone who like to learn about plants that are harmful even some we accounter in our daily lives."
48,1565126831,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1624588-bonny,2,"Wicked Plants is an interesting idea for a book, but one of the reasons for my 2 star rating is that I listened to the audiobook rather than reading the actual book. As an audiobook, this becomes just a list of possibly dangerous plants; in fact, I question why it was even released in audio format. Wicked Plants desperately needs pictures, and the actual book does contain etchings of some of the plants. I think the other big thing missing in this book is a better explanation of ""wicked"". The author does state that she is a gardener, not a scientist, but I wish she had discussed the whole topic of naturally occurring plant toxins more completely and accurately. She writes about specific instances of these toxins, but this book would have benefited from a better explanation of the many naturally occurring enzyme inhibitors, glycosides, lectins, alkaloids, etc., and why plants produce them in the first place. The purpose is not to harm humans, but rather to protect the plant, and that idea is missing from Wicked Plants. "

I find that I am more annoyed with this as I am currently reading The Drunken Botanist by the same author and she seems to have, at least somewhat, gotten her shit together. The DB still suffers from some of the same problems, but at least it's far better organized and is about booze so it gets more credit.This, however, is like talking to a guy who isn't a physicist at a party. He just read A Brief History of Time and he wants to tell you all about it.

Or how about the fact that Charles Julius Guiteau (who shot President James Garfield), was given a bouquet of flowers by his sister on the morning of his execution--and when prison officials looked at the flowers, they found arsenic tucked between the petals--with author Amy Stewart then going on to list a bunch of common flowers that can possibly kill you.

One of my complaints that will cause me to mark it down a star is I think the book can be better organized. I really didn’t see the rhyme or reason to the chapter layout or order. It’s possible this is a problem do to being put on Kindle but it seemed we were jumping all over the place chapter wise.All and all if you want to know more about the dangerous plants that surround us, no matter where in the world you happen to be this is a great read and you won’t need to get bogged down by having to read a textbook to get the same information."

She presents facts interspersed with anecdotes about the various plants and their methods of protecting themselves while harming others in the process.Ironically, many of the ""poisons"" are utilized as medicinal products in both the allopathic (traditional medicine) and homeopathic communities of healing. In other words, one man's poison may be another person's drug. The drawings and etchings throughout are particularly noteworthy.

I was hoping for a non-fiction book with chapters devoted to some fascinating plant or plant family. Unfortunately this is just like reading an encyclopedia, but lacks the depth and interest of even a Wikipedia article.

The book discusses the common and scientific name, the location the plant is found, the toxin that causes the damage/death, and misc other tidbits of information that authors like me love to collect.The biggest drawback is that I wish they would have shown more pictures of the actual plants themselves, rather than only using sketches of a few of them.

For a book that purports to reveal the hidden (and not so hidden) dangers of plants, it seems a waste to not include photographs to aid the reader in identification.

69,1565126831,http://goodreads.com/user/show/23785775-julia,2," After having read Amy Stewart's ""Wicked Bugs"" I chose to track down this particular book and see what would be included within its pages. Hoping for a somewhat nice repetition although with dangerous plants instead I was disappointed to find that for whatever reason my public library chose not to carry it and that it had to be from an international loan if I wanted to read it at all. The organization and format follow the same as the other book but unlike ""Wicked Bugs"" where the illustrations for the collective lists was cartoonish and a bit of comedic break-up this book's illustrations were a lot more macabre. As a result I wasn't thrilled with the portrayals that they gave although I do have to give them props for being creative while in the other actual plants themselves it would have been nice to have had them colored so the reader gets a chance to actually know the plant. Again like the other book the chapters each had a label such as dangerous, painful, etc and then included the plant's name followed by its scientific name. Although the label helps the reader to know the quick complication about the plant it did no other job to make the categorization easier for the reader. Furthermore for those who are interested other quick scientific information is included such as family for the plant, where it was originally found, relatives, etc.  The entries themselves seem to switch about where it acts like the plants are actual subjects while others try to implicate the plant as the actual villain. A quick skimming of entries, though, quickly disprove the fact while showing that although the plant naturally developed with these defenses it is the human who has come to use the plant whether by accidental misidentification or through their own dark schemes so although the plant could be considered actually evil it is more or less the scheming human at the core who ends up the actual villain or in some cases the tragic character.j For those who are interested, though, the best part was the inclusion of actual poison gardens and where to find them if you should be wanting to track them down. Other good information includes symptoms that result from these plants as well as the pressing reminders to call poison control or go to the ER if you feel that you have been poisoned and the actual. Plus readers will be strongly reminded to keep an eye on their children and pets, which are always great reminders.  In the end it was a good starter book and one that would prick the attention of those who are into plants although they should have a preference for some of the darker sides of flora. Otherwise the book just may be a little too much to deal with."

The book points out some misconceptions -- for example, the poinsettia plant does not deserve its reputation for being poisonous (something my cat could have told you!); but watch out for that Easter lily! These plants are found in a variety of continents and climates, although many have been introduced into the U.S. over the years. Along the way, there are such interesting byways as the first documented attempted murder by plants, the priests poisoned by what a servant presumed was horseradish (it was actually aconite/monkshood), the Scottish tailor who died as a result of eating a sandwich with wild greens his children had gathered for him (it wasn't parsley they pulled up, but poison hemlock), Harry Potter, poison gardens, and, yes, the death of Abraham Lincoln's mother, Nancy Hanks Lincoln, from milk sickness, caused by white snakeroot. The text is enhanced by nice artwork; I wonder, though, whether or not it might have been more effective to have color photographs of these plants, for easier identification. I found the book enlightening and terrifying in equal parts -- unfortunately, I probably won't remember most of what I read in these pages: it's almost too much information to assimilate. But it's a sober reminder (however gloomy) that death is all around us every day."

This alphabetical desk reference of diabolical plants, devious shrubs and murderous leaves left me wondering how many times I’ve been one flower seed away from going to the emergency room. For example, did you know the humble castor bean can be processed to a potent poison called ricin? Remember how Walter White killed Lydia from Madrigal by swapping out her Splenda for a packet of ricin he made from castor beans. (On Breaking Bad if you don’t recognize the names.)But I saved most of my gasping for a chapter on the charmingly named Australian Stinging Tree. This tree is covered with a fuzzy down that contains tiny hairs loaded with neurotoxin. Simply brush up against it, inhale some floating microscopic fuzz or even pick up a leaf that’s been dead for 50 years and you will be in agonizing pain. A soldier during WWII fell into one of these trees and was in such excruciating agony that he had to be tied to his hospital bed for three weeks. Hey Australia maybe go chop these trees down before they kill more people!"
72,1565126831,http://goodreads.com/user/show/21856003-samantha,3,"the organizational strategy for this book seemed to be random, and I think there was some hyperbole, but it was pretty informative. I feel lucky to be alive, really, considering the number of highly toxic plants there are out there! people have poisoned themselves by picking up the wrong stick to roast something over a campfire with! I've never given any thought to what kind of sticks I was picking up.I guess we must generally drill the whole don't eat random plants into our very young children pretty hard without really thinking about the extent of the risk. hydrangeas? poisonous. azaleas? poisonous. lantanas? poisonous. I knew that black locust flowers were edible - and I've eaten them - did not realize all the rest of the tree is poisonous. and there are so many things that cause significant skin irritation that I never knew about - like tulips. celery is phototoxic and can make you get a sunburn if you touch or eat a lot of it. I definitely feel like I've come away with more respect for plants I can't identify. "
73,1565126831,http://goodreads.com/user/show/13547148-olivia,2,"My favorite part was probably the authors instructions: If you suspect that someone has been poisoned by a plant, please do not spend precious time reading this book in search of symptoms or a diagnosis... call the poison control center..."" Because well... duh. I guess I was expecting a bit more on the atrocities end, but mostly this book is a long list of plants, their poisons, and what they do. Which is fine, it just ain't my bag. Some tidbits I found interesting:- Poison Ivy, Oak, and Sumac... only affect humans. Also, reactions get worse after each exposure. Also, this book includes a camper's ""test,"" which seems ridiculously tedious instead of just learning what the heck poison ivy looks like. - If cats eat your marijuana plant, they could die. Make sure to tell the vet what they actually ate so they can get treated properly. - There's a plant that will make you slobber... as in buckets. of. slobber. "
74,1565126831,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4225996-vfields-don-t-touch-my-happy,4,"Boy am I spoiled. I've read a few books by Mary Roach about the oddest subject matter and loved them very much because well basically I thought it was stuff I should know and well, she tells a funny story. Be that as it may, Wicked Plants with interesting enough and I was marvelously grossed out and titillated. Me, myself & I felt the book was screamed for more antidotal storytelling and history input. Again I'm not saying it was a bad book. I read it in two readings I just thought at time it felt like I was just reading lists. They're foods I will look at twice before I put in my mouth and giggle, thats's for sure but it could've been a richer read. "
75,1565126831,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6943083-emily,5,"Despite the fact that it took me over a month to read this book, I really liked it. After reading a few non-fiction books about physics, I came to the conclusion that I could not learn information over audiobook, but now that I've listened to this book, I found that this is not the case. I was bothering my family with random plant facts left and right. This book has almost a textbook format, which I actually preferred. It didn't give a ton of information for each plant, but enough to keep me interested and make me want to research more. I intend on reading a physical copy of this book soon that I can learn even more plant facts. "
76,1565126831,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3139134-melissa-mcgowan,4,"This would be a great reference book to keep around the house. I found it fascinating. It’s chock a block full of useful information such as, how to get high with the locals in foreign countries. Other fun facts include all the plants that are everywhere around us in our gardens, food supply, and floral arrangements, that will drop you, or your pets, like a lead anchor. Did you know that only 50% of people exhibit an allergic response to poison ivy and sumac? I did not but I do now. "
77,1565126831,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6027196-pam,3,"I listened to this book and it was basically an encyclopedia of plants that pose some kind of threat to humans. I learned some interesting plant facts. I like plants! I am a bit of a naturalist nerd. I enjoy learning about the natural world. I wish I had the book in hardback so I can look things up as needed and also to see the illustrations. That fact that I was able to stay with this as an audio book shows how interesting it actually was. If you want a better-suited-for-audio book by Amy Stewart, try The Earth Moved. I loved that little book about earthworms. "
78,1565126831,http://goodreads.com/user/show/8986097-lauren,2,"Don't know what I expected going into this, but this wasn't exactly it.Cool information and facts, I was just hoping for something more narrative. Also not super interesting on audio, harder to follow along."
79,1565126831,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5036642-john,2,"A somewhat inconsistently organized encyclopedia of dangerous plants. I listened to this on Audible; I learned some interesting factoids shallowly presented. Seems to argue that some plants are evil, which is ridiculous."
80,1565126831,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4105913-sara-habein,3,"I might have been more drawn in, had I been reading the print version of this book, to fully appreciate the illustrations, but this was just fine for me. Probably a very fascinating introduction to poisonous plants for someone else. I did learn a fair amount."
81,1565126831,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1025873-kiersta-barnes,5,"I came for the stories about Socrates and to see how much a real mandrake matched the Harry Potter version and I’m leaving with second thoughts about some of the plants in my yard. I loved it!I especially appreciated that she covered destructive plant and their effect on our planet. Most people hear destructive plants and they only imagine a weed ruining a garden. No one talks enough about the blue algae that kills animals within hours, the man-made killer algae mutation successfully killing all aquatic life in its path, or the plant that’s infested 16 million acres & costs $45 million attempting to eradicate it each year in the US alone!There’s a lot of interesting history factoids and the authors convey real empathy for the victims discussed. At the same time they aren’t trying to convince us that all plants are bad and we should hide forever.Highly recommend this!"
82,1565126831,http://goodreads.com/user/show/20235929-judy,4,"I quite enjoyed this one. The botanical and nomenclatural information is almost entirely accurate as far as I could tell, and the illustrations are delightful. I enjoyed mapping out the various plants to find where they grow in San Diego County, and daydreaming about...never mind."
83,1565126831,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5389954-melissa,3,I learned that the seeds a coworker gave me are highly toxic. Now I'm wondering if she was really trying to kill me. 
84,1565126831,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4746906-bon,4,"A really educating read, even if I may be afraid to step outdoors or eat ANYTHING now..."
85,1565126831,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4188636-kristina-sanchez,4,Good. Straight forward. Occasionally clever.
86,1565126831,http://goodreads.com/user/show/18043434-cassidy,4,"This was incredibly helpful, I purchased this to help with some research for my Nanowrimo project. This book was very helpful and fun to read but I found myself wanting more"
87,1565126831,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1397516-sophie,3,"What is wrong with people? Why are there so many dangerous plants that people keep around just because they're pretty? If touching the stem causes a rash, maybe it's not the best thing to put in a bouquet!(Also, there was some not-great wording in some places. Particularly noticeable: saying that tobacco was the reason for American slavery.)"
88,1565126831,http://goodreads.com/user/show/62022655-romeo,5,I loved the history behind each of the plants.
89,1565126831,http://goodreads.com/user/show/10119092-megan,0,I made it like 3/4 through and I'm saying I finished it. It was neither exactly a glossary of plants nor narrative about these plants history; it was disappointingly in between.
