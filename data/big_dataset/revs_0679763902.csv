0,0679763902,http://goodreads.com/user/show/8316749-katiemc,4,"What happens when you put lots of drunk male fruit flies together in a bottle. Gay fruit fly sex, of course! Enjoyable, well written, thought provoking with many details that I will probably forget.This history of behavioral genetics is primarily presented as professional biography Seymour Benzer, a scientist who rejected the more lucrative field of solid state electronics to study the behavior of fruit flies. Benzer comes off as a part quirky professor, part inventive genius, and truly driven by the love (?, is that right) of his chosen field. The title comes from reducing behavioral genetics into three essential components - time, love and memory. Time - we learn how the notion of clocks are built into our DNA Love - more like mating patterns, but ok. Memory - not just memory, but the ability to learn and change behavior because of itBehavior is complex and understanding it is difficult. There is quite a bit written about the experimental approaches used and how behavior was broken down. Aside from the science, you learn some charming quirks that brings back memories of reading The Double Helix in high school (man those guys played a lot of tennis!). There are many featured players, including Watson and Crick of DNA structure fame. Most important, it dances around the question of nature versus nurture. No conclusions are given, and as this was written 15 years ago, if any were they would probably be OBE by now. "
1,0679763902,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5925863-bastian-greshake-tzovaras,4,"The book quotes Sydney Brenner with 'I hold the somewhat weaker view that history does exist for the young, but is divided into two epochs: the past two years, and everything that went before' and I'm somewhat guilty of that, as I've never heard of Seymour Benzer before reading this book, even though I always thought to be somewhat interested in science history. Which having missed that out really is a shame. Benzer was a physicist-turned-molecular biologist-turned-behavioral geneticist and has ties to Feynman, Crick, Sturtevant (of fame for working with TH Morgan) and Delbrück, to just name a few. He did some groundbreaking work on bacteriophages while roaming the molecular biology field, before moving into (and somewhat founding) the field of behavioral genetics, where he worked on mating behavior, circadian rhythms and learning abilities with fruit flies. The book does a nice job of embedding Benzer into the greater context, along with the household names of the fields and how his work relates to it. So yes, you will read about Darwin, Mendel, Morgan, Watson/Crick et al. But in a way that illuminates the work of Benzer, which worked great for me. And of course you also will get the nature vs nurture debate, which probably isn't too surprising if you deal with behavioral genetics. That's another point where the book shows it age. It was published in a time where (at least based on my perception) the debate was pretty heavily on the nature-side of things, with people looking for ""genes for X"" even more than they do today. I would take those parts with a grain of salt. Recommended for: anyone with at least a minimal interest in the history of science, people who love great scientific debates (if you're by now bored by ""adaptionist vs neutralist evolution"" and ""inclusive fitness vs group selection"" give this a try!)"
2,0679763902,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1472897-laura,4,"I purchased Time, Love, Memory based on my fondness for Jonathan Weiner's Pulitzer Prize winning book, The Beak of the Finch. Like that book, Time, Love, Memory explores an important scientific theme through the lives and experiments of notable scientists. As a Brandeis alum, I especially enjoyed the portions of the book about Brandeis professors Jeff Hall and Michael Rosbash, but each scientist mentioned gets some character study as well as a description of his or her work. The book is a brief history of genetics, beginning with Gregor Mendel's pea plants and working up to the genetics of complex human behavior. Along the way we meet plenty of scientists, and Weiner portrays them as endearingly devoted to their work. When young Sturtevant stays up all night mapping the fruit fly chromosome at the age of 19 and gets hooked on genetics, I want to cheer for him. Enthralled by science and devoted to his mentor, Sturtevant stays with the same lab for the rest of his career. Nowadays such a practice would be considered too ""incestuous"" for any respectable scientist, but it warmed my heart as if over a bunsen burner to read about it. I really liked learning about Seymour Benzer's elegant experiments in fly behavior. With a simple device designed to track which flies move toward light and which stay in the darkness, he developed the first high-throughput behavioral screen. Others in his group went on to also become pioneers in genetics. A scientific family tree spreads its branches through Time, Love, Memory, and through it we see how a strong mentor can leave a mark on many other scientists. Weiner's prose is engaging and his personalization of something as unusual as Drosophila research draws even non-scientist readers into the plot. I enjoyed the book and even as an occasional genetics researcher I was able to learn from it. Time, Love, Memory is worth your time. I don't know if you'll love it, but you will remember it."
3,0679763902,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5562870-shweta-ramdas,5,"As a young geneticist, it's easy to forget how young our field is. While social scientists still cite primarily Freud, most of the pioneers whose work we think about are from the 20th century (what better testament could there be to the fast pace of genetics that a lot of paradigms the book holds true are now considered passe). This book is a narrative of their work, and the astonishing leaps genetics and molecular biology has made in the last century and a half, all through the prism of work done on the humble fruit fly: Drosophila.We start with Thoman Morgan's attempts to ""map"" genes on chromosomes, move on to those inspired by him: the physicist-turned-biologist Seymour Benzer who used bacteria-eating viruses to further refine these maps, his colleagues at Caltech, messrs Watson and Crick of double helix fame, and then to 2017 Nobel Laureates Jeff Hal & Michael Rosbach, whose work threw light upon circadian clocks, again in the fruit fly. Benzer, though, is the hero of the book, the connecting dot through all the different threads of work described. He's also a scientist of another time: choosing to switch to more 'interesting' questions every time it becomes too easy to answer a question. Too boring to publish too many papers on the same things!This book manages to be clear while being accurate and having enough detail to please even a geneticist, and really gives us a sense of the state of genetics before it exploded and the tools became so easy to use everyone was using them. This is a marvelous book. Highly recommended."
4,0679763902,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3394107-catina-martinez,5,"I don't know much about genetic research, beyond what I learned in high school - but I LOVED this book. It read like the drama of the ""Pirates of Silicon Valley,"" but with molecular biologists, who would create the field of genetic research. The drama, the break throughs, and the discovery of our behaviors being embedded in our genetic code, are mesmerizing. Weiner handles these geniuses with care, helping us to relate to an impossibly complex subject for the layman. Funny, poignant, educational - and important. Molecular science discoveries are going to force us to ask the hard questions about morality."
5,0679763902,http://goodreads.com/user/show/31580463-pat-cummings,5,"Not since the Age of Enlightenment had the world seen such a crew of intellectual cutthroats, divinely assured of their rights of succession and their place in history. The philosophes of the Enlightenment also had their share of tall, thin, prognathous young men, and many of their contemporaries found them (in the words of Horace Walpole) “solemn, arrogant, dictatorial coxcombs—I need not say superlatively disagreeable.”This book is the tale of the “intellectual cutthroats” who tracked down the mechanism of Mendelian inheritance, DNA. From Watson and Crick (whose names are famously linked to the discovery of the molecule's structure) to Brooklyn-born Seymour Benzer (whose name is virtually unknown, even in scientific circles outside DNA research), Weiner has put together a brilliant presentation of the unfolding of a new science.After the eureka of Watson and Crick, one of the challenges for the new science (which did not yet call itself molecular biology) was to connect these classical maps of the gene with the new model of the double helix. It was Benzer who thought of a way to do it. Not long after Watson and Crick announced their discovery, Benzer hit on a plan that might unite the old revolution and the new revolution: classical genetics and molecular biology.Weiner’s “cast of characters” reads like a Who’s Who of 20th century iconoclastic science: Richard Feynman, Max Delbrück, E.O. Wilson, geneticists Watson and Crick and Ronald Konopka, and the “Fly Room” scientists T.H. Morgan (whose name was given to the chromosome map unit “centimorgan”), Alfred Sturtevant and Ed Lewis. At the center of the tale, though, is Seymour Benzer, an innovative thinker who took the inheritance paradigm one step further, asking, can behavior be inherited?With the discovery of the clock gene, the sense of time, mysterious for so many centuries, was no longer a mystery that could be observed only from the outside. Now it could be explored as a mechanism from the inside. This discovery implied that behavior itself could now be charted and mapped as precisely as any other aspect of inheritance. Qualities that people had always thought of… as if they were supernatural, might be mapped right alongside qualities as mundane as eye pigment.Benzer’s band of “cutthroat intellectuals” would have to battle for the new paradigm, both within the scientific community and outside it. Weiner’s book is, therefore a war story; but one in which the victories are celebrated by all combatants, and coups are bloodless. For anyone interested in behavioral science, genetics, or the concept of paradigm change, it is a fascinating read.Liner Note:I was surprised that the ground-breaking crystallography of Rosalind Franklin, whose photographs of the helical structure supplied the data that Watson and Crick used to achieve their leap of insight, was scarcely mentioned. Of course, since Franklin died before the Nobel was awarded, she was not a recipient. And like Benzer, she might have been forgotten, aside from DNA researchers, had it not been for an amazing BBC Life Story episode usually referred to as The Race for the Double Helix. The movie, which gives full weight to Franklin's contribution, was only released on VHS, and is largely unavailable now."
6,0679763902,http://goodreads.com/user/show/27162910-dzmitry-kishylau,4,"Great description of a long way that molecular biology has come over a relatively short period of time. Even if you're not interested in genetics and atomic theory of behavior per se, it's still a fascinating read about experiment design - how to learn something from such inherently messy and non-deterministic thing like fly behavior. My only complaint about the book is the ""non-linear"" narrative where author jumps back and forth between decades, problems and scientists. It's also trying to be really metaphorical, often to no particular benefit."
7,0679763902,http://goodreads.com/user/show/864965-margaret,4,"Jonathan Weiner is a god-send to science idiots like me: He's a talented journalist who can take a complex scientific (in this case biological) subject and make it (a) comprehensible, and (b) gripping. His other books include ""The Beak of the Finch"" (focuses on the Galapagos Islands and evolutionary studies) and ""His Brother's Keeper"" (story of two brothers, one who develops ALS and the other who single-mindedly focuses on attempts to find a cure).""Time, Love, Memory"" relates the history, largely occurring in the 20th C. and continuing, of the development of and ongoing research into what the author terms ""the atomic theory of behavior,"" that is, research into genes that trigger behaviors in living creatures, behaviors such as internal awareness of time, inate mating behaviors, and ability to learn (or remember). Many of these studies use the ""drosophila"" fly (fruit fly) as their subject; others use various other ""low"" life forms that, upon study, turn out to be amazingly complex in their behaviors.The book also looks at how biologists studying in these fields in turn either do or do not, in both cases consciously, draw analogies to human behaviors and the extent to which human genes influence or even dictate behaviors in people - yes, nature versus nurture - and not just basic behaviors such as internal clocks, mating preferences, and ability to remember, but more complex or subtle behaviors or traits, such as shyness, patience, quick or slow tempered. It's a fascinating book, although best digested in smallish doses (I needed time after a chapter or three to mull over what I'd read before moving on), and even now it must be dated given its 1999 copyright date and how quickly the field is advancing. I highly recommend the book to anyone who enjoyed ""The Beak of the Finch."" ""His Brother's Keeper"" is also wonderful, albeit a bit lighter on the science and more focused on the drama."
8,0679763902,http://goodreads.com/user/show/12705925-shen-xu,5,"Although not entirely certain what is the genre of this book (popular science? biography?), but I thoroughly enjoyed it. The writing is descriptive and truthful, providing a vivid account of Seymour Benzer's scientific life.Before this good read, I have never heard of his name, but surprisingly neither has my biologist husband. It is probably because he kept changing (and excelling!!!) his fields, physics, molecular biology and behavioral genetics...Even you are not a biography reader, there are other numerous interesting things in this book. For example the views on eugenics are utterly fascinating! Not to mention all those fantastic names they give Drosophila mutants.One thing I don't know how to take is the experiment methods themselves. The way mutation is created seems rather cruel to me. And probably because fruit flies are not cute and cuddly like puppies... well you can fill out the rest.Nevertheless, very educational and informative read!"
9,0679763902,http://goodreads.com/user/show/53614356-michael-adamchuk,4,"Part biographical, part scientific exploration, Seymour Benzer pursues the genetic basis of behavior. He is credited with founding the the science of molecular biology. He built on the foundation established by Crick and Watson. He used fruit flies in his experiments and continually created genetic mutants. As progress was made, he and his teams eventually genetically engineered flies with qualities they wanted to study. Fascinating story. "
10,0679763902,http://goodreads.com/user/show/10859374-richp,5,"Well done. I never knew what these people were doing, just what some of their prominent names were, when I was at CIT in the 1970s. I was not in biology, of course."
11,0679763902,http://goodreads.com/user/show/56950965-peter-reczek,3,"Not as good as ""The Beak of the Finch"". This scientific biography is more about the field than about the scientist and only sketchy about the field. Read the ""Beak"" first."
12,0679763902,http://goodreads.com/user/show/105071703-andrew-dick,5,Excellent read about how world-class science is actually done.
13,0679763902,http://goodreads.com/user/show/8325737-philipp,4,"A good book if your into the history of biology (genetics to be exact), and want to learn more about nature vs. nurture - how much of behaviour can be attributed to genes? The book summarizes the beginnings of genetics in the fruitfly, and describes the beginnings of research into the genetic bases for the feeling of time, of sexuality, and for memory in fruitflies. Like Bastian I didn't know anything about Benzer before, so that was an eye-opening experience - and it's cool to read about how all the 'big names' like Watson, Feynman etc. fit into the history of genetics.Sometimes, the author looses a bit of control over his metaphors and, in my opinion, makes the gene -> phenotype connection too simplistic. All direct quotations of Benzer do it 'right' (if there is such a thing) - Benzer is very cautious in making any comparison between humans and fly behaviour, for example. Weiner on the other hand uses emotional formulations like 'Biologists who hate sociobiology maintain that we can learn very little about human nature by studying the instincts of other animals' (p 216) - it's not that I hate sociobiology, it's that I think that a lot of people (journalists more than scientists) hype it more than it deserves. Weiner presents some examples of genes in human behaviour that by now are outdated, and he gives them more merit than they deserve, even back then. For example, he links Xq28 stronger to human male homosexuality more than the evidence of the 90s allows for (IMHO). In these parts the book clearly shows its age, biology has become more cautious in the last decade. A very recent example is the discovery of how the mere presence of male researchers influences the behaviour of laboratory mice.The biggest annoyance to me was the treatment of Lewontin in this book, Weiner presents him as some kind of outdated cold war relic, something like the last Marxist, a unicorn of science - if I remember correctly, he's the only one given negative adjectives in the book ('he's loathed and feared', p 256). I've read other things by Lewontin - he had quite a bit of influence in evolutionary biology that this book omits, he published a bit with Stephen Jay Gould, and his thinking is still influential (and should be more widely spread). I don't think he deserves to be loathed - can someone be loathed who co-invented Isadore Nabi? [1]But it's still a good book, just take it with a grain of salt (as Bastian correctly says) - it pulls some of the 'quieter', maybe slightly forgotten characters of science into the foreground.Recommended for: - People who want to know what a single person can achieve in their life with inspiration and lots of hard work.- People interested in the history of science, especially genetics.[1] Now that I think about it, Isadore Nabi should have gotten the first statue of Darwin looking doubtful for his essay An Evolutionary Interpretation of the English Sonnet.-----------------------------------------------------------Update 2014-7-1:For those interested, one of the chapters describes how the period gene may have something to do with a supposed courtship song in Drosophila: last week research was published that showed this song is just an artefact of data binning. Here's the blog post by the lead author."
14,0679763902,http://goodreads.com/user/show/241691-kay,4,"While not as engrossing as Weiner's 
The Beak of the Finch
 (which he won a Pulitzer Prize for in 1995), this is a fairly absorbing account of how molecular biology got kick-started by a handful of scientists who marched to the beat of a different drummer, in particular Seymour Benzen, whose ingenious and painstaking work with bacteria and then fruit flies allowed the first gene mapping. Benzen's brilliantly simple experiments allowed him to focus on how successive generations of flies retained (or didn't) certain mutations, and eventually led to linking certain behaviors with certain genes. I couldn't help but admiring how single-mindedly Benzer and his associates pursued quite narrow channels of research which later proved to be unexpectedly fertile. Everyone thought Benzer had gone 'round the bend when first he left a potentially lucrative job in physics to take up working in biology, and then the biologists thought he was crazy to work on genetics with fruit flies. But today, according to Weiner, there are literally thousands of biologists diligently working with Drosophila, and the little flies have become (along with inbred mice) arguably the most useful research tools in modern science. Weiner does a good job of recreating the sense of wonder, insight and curiosity that the researchers needed to carry out their work, along with conveying their frustrations and the inevitable scientific infighting. However, at times he does lapse a bit too far into philosophizing or poetically pontificating than I think is really called for. I'd have preferred a little less philosophizing and more of the nitty-gritty of Benzer's fascinating fruit fly experiments. "
15,0679763902,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6020227-alex,5,"You can see why this guy won a Pulitzer. This is an incredibly intelligent science book that makes the dense field of behavioral genetics seem clear and inviting.I'd recommend this to anyone who doesn't understand behavioral genetics, but thinks it might be cool to know how we have discovered genes that alter a fly's perception of time (so they have a longer or shorter than 24-hour internal clock), a fly's sexuality (so that males become interested in performing a mating dance with other males), and memory (so that a fly cannot learn to avoid certain pheromones that lead to an electric shock). At a deeper level, though, this is a history of science and the people who do it. Focusing on the life of Seymour Benzer, an early behavioral geneticist, but tracing the scientific legacy of genetics to T.M. Morgan and the people who studied inheritance the Mendelian way at the turn of the last century--before we knew what DNA was--this is the story of a life and an idea. I liked reading about how Benzer was always trying strange new foods (like a 100-year-old fermented egg) and how he was always inspired by the novel ""Arrowsmith."" I liked reading about how popular press accounts tried to extrapolate from these genetics experiments to what genes might mean for humans. And I liked drawing on the author's own wide-ranging learning in this field, and the complementary perspectives he drew in. More than anything, I felt that I was in the hands of an intelligent, thoughtful, and compassionate guide to a very complex field. Yet under his guidance, I felt like the history of behavioral genetics was not complex--I found it accessible, interesting, and quirky. The ability to take one of the greatest scientific achievements of the 20th century and make it seem like a simple hike through a park is the mark of a real genius."
16,0679763902,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5855283-ronald-wise,5,"I anticipated this would be a rather boring update on the field of genetics — I had last studied this field at the University of Washington in the mid-1970s. What a surprise to find myself foregoing other responsibilities to read just a few more pages! Weiner examines recent genetic discoveries through the perspective of researcher Seymour Benzer, a maverick fruit-fly researcher. Curious mutations in the fruit fly end up raising fundamental questions about human existance: Consciousness, memory, romantic interests. The isolation of the genes responsible for behavioral oddities in the fruit fly are later found to exist in most other species including man! One — the fruitless mutation which causes male fruit flies to overcome their aversion to touching other males, and to spend their time conga dancing with other males instead of copulating with females — will be of interest to learn more about in cited books written by Dean H. Hamer, which have been added to my reading list. (You may recall sensational headlines in the media proclaiming it the ""homosexual gene"".) I learned of this book from a radio book review by librarian Nancy Pearl. It was also the recipient of the 1999 National Book Critics Cricle Award for General Nonfiction.P.S. - One of the most useful things I have ever learned from a book came from this one - the construction of an effective fruit fly trap."

A hundred thousand angels on it. Dancing.""- ""... the most intimate, the most immediate, in some ways the most intricate and the most important for our inquiring species will always be the origin of behavior.""- ""species store learning in chromosomes the way individuals store learning in their brains and societies store learning in books.""- ""the sense of time, mysterious for so many centuries, was no longer a mystery that could be observed only from the outside.""- ""Could it be that... we will see the answers to all these paradoxes when we have learned to think in new categories?"""
18,0679763902,http://goodreads.com/user/show/81564-sarah,4,"Another excellent book on the people behind the science from the author of ""The Beak of the Finch"". While not as tightly organized as ""Finch"", I'm once again enchanted by how wonderfully Weiner writes science without either baffling the layperson or dumbing it down to the point of irrelevance.An excellent look at the people and the experiments that underlie our current understanding of genetics, behavior, and the molecular-level connections between the two. There's also a strong understanding here of the limits of the science, as well as a recognition of how the popular press, as ignorant of basic science as the average American, often overstates the significance of a finding. When the research is a remarkable and groundbreaking as that of these molecular biologists, it needs no gilding -- just Weiner's splendid explanations."
19,0679763902,http://goodreads.com/user/show/76337-clark,4,"An interesting account of behavioral genetics and a kind of history of genetics over the course of about 100 years. As someone who researches clocks, it was interesting to read about the initial discoveries of a few clock genes and some of the characters behind those discoveries. The book feels a bit dated now, but the writing is wonderful. I was especially impressed with Weiner's ability to humanize a lot of the work that is done in labs. I also enjoyed the way that he brought out the conflict of trying to communicate discoveries to a public that doesn't fully understand the ramifications of those discoveries. We often try to simplify a discovery in order to make it easier for laymen to grasp, but that act can lead to confusion about what has been done and what it means. Certainly a problem worth thinking about."

For one thing, the story is more disjoint, involving a wider circle of biologists. Then, there is a wider variety of experiments and findings to keep straight... and the biochem is deeper (although left unexplored for the most part)Still highly recommending it to anybody who has been a worldwide guru of cacao pathologies (is that even close?)======================You will enjoy it... This one makes one ponder more than Beak of the Finch did.

Instead, it's about how the techniques of studying genes and behavior has begun to shed light on Time, Love and Memory. In particular, the work of Seymour Benzer is studied, who has made enormous contributions to the field with his work on Drosophila. Using this fortuitous model organism and simple but ingeniously clever experiments, Benzer and contemporaries have been able to find some of the important genes which are shared among most living things and help determine our internal clock, mating behaviors and how memories are stored.Highly recommended!"

32,0679763902,http://goodreads.com/user/show/229998-matt,5,"One of the best science books I've ever read. Jonathon Weiner is a phenomenal author capable of turning the story of the humble fruit fly into a biological thriller. The narrative weaves in and out between the history of the research, the conflict between different groups of scientists, and the meaningfulness of their breakthroughs. "
33,0679763902,http://goodreads.com/user/show/18932741-mike,5,"This book burns through 100 years of genetic discovery in 257 pages. The acceleration of knowledge is astounding. Throughout the story, Weiner pauses at major milestones to reflect on what the new knowledge and technologies mean, which can incredibly hopeful and drown right terrifying at the same time. "
34,0679763902,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2424596-luke,3,"Well, I believe this book to well written but in some cases it is a bit chaotic and the number of surnames is sometimes overwhelming. Still it it a very good position for someone who would like to learn something or anything about molecular biology and its history."
35,0679763902,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2827908-john-e,4,"Another winner by Weiner. His biography/science history style is an excellent way to discuss the development of knowledge. I'd read anything he writes. Not quite as engaging as Beak of the Finch, however."
36,0679763902,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1077801-kendra,5,"This is a fantastic book! it weaves philosophy, psychology, multiple realms of science into the story of one man. I highly recommend it for anyone interested in genetics, psychology or neuroscience. "
37,0679763902,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2485766-doug-peters,3,"Enjoyable read. But the author clearly wanted to claim more than the data permits. As a result, it ends up being a delightful romp through the laboratories of twentieth century molecular biology rather than being able to support any of the claims that the author continually hints at."
38,0679763902,http://goodreads.com/user/show/9837850-larry,4,"Even though I have not studied biology since 1963, I found this book quite interesting and engaging. I was amazed by how much we humans share with fruit flies. At the same time, I was appalled by what the scientists did to these beings with whom we share so much."

44,0679763902,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1574254-jacqueline,5,"It doesn't sound like it would be an interesting book, but if you are a science nerd like me, you will love it!"
45,0679763902,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1616130-roxy-gil,4,Molecular biology is only entertaining to the literary minded if the scientists are all mad. Which they are. I love them.
