Sokal is best known for the Sokal Affair, in which he submitted a deliberately absurd article to Social Text, a critical theory journal, and was able to get it published.تاریخ نخستین خوانش: روز یازدهم ماه اکتبر سال 2009 میلادیعنوان: چرندیات پست مدرن؛ نویسنده: آلن سوکال؛ ژان بریکمون؛ مترجم: عرفان ثابتی؛ تهران، ققنوس، چاپ دوم 1387؛ در 399 ص؛ شابک: 9789643116149؛ چاپ سوم 1392؛ کتابنامه، نمایه، موضو, سوء استفاده روشنفکران پست مدرن از علم؛ سده 21 مکتاب «چرندیات پست مدرن»، بنابه اظهارنظر نویسندگانش طوفان کوچکی در برخی حلقه‌ های روشنفکری به پا کرده است. آن‌ها نشان داده‌ اند که «فلسفه فرانسه‌ ی مدرن پر از مهملات قدیمی است» ولی جالب است بدانید که نویسندگان کتاب مدعی هستند، روشنفکران مشهوری از قبیل: لاکان، کریستوا، ایریگاری، و بودریار، بطور مکرر از مفاهیم و واژگان علمی سوء استفاده کرده‌ اند، یا ایده‌ های علمی را کاملاً خارج از بافت، و زمینه ی خود به کار برده‌ اند، و هیچگونه برهانی هم برای کار خود نیاورده‌ اند. نظر شما چیست؟ آیا به راستی آن‌ها می‌توانند این موضوع را ثابت کنند. این کتاب در واقع دو اثر مجزا – ولی مرتبط – در یک جلد است، که به پیچاندن مطلب، استفاده از زبانِ عمداً مبهم، فکر آشفته و پریشان، و سوء استفاده از مفاهیم علمی می‌پردازد. ا. شربیانی"
1,0312204078,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1107219-jimmy,5,"Assessing the usefulness or relevance of philosophy is a seemingly confounding endeavor. It becomes even trickier when approaching a specifically nuanced trend or style of philosophy. Since endless question-begging thought cycles are the genesis of any given philosophy, there is understandable difficulty in posing additional ones that might trump the foundation of that given philosopher's logic or reasoning. To add to that, there is the incessant theoretical backpedaling and earnest apologetics that are such a characteristic reaction to a critique of a particular philosopher's thought. The reason this is complicated is because said apologetics typically entail claims that the philosopher in question was being misread, misunderstood, or read or understood in the incorrect context. They might also claim that the translation of the work in question was a poor one, or that their critics have a very particular axe to grind against them, whether it be political, racial, or class-based. Of course, people usually question philosophers with good reason. These are, after all, academics that make a living out of composing texts full of ""deep questions"", ones that typically aren't steeped in methodologies that tend to provide reliable evidence or proof. So it's usually the soundness, logic, style, and originality of the philosopher's body of work and thought that tends to be revered or questioned in the end. The point here is that the importance or relevance of philosophy tends to be found in the act of posing big questions in unique ways, all the while offering something new to the theoretical ground that has been covered since the time of Thales and the pre-Socratics. In this sense, science, philosophy's clichéd adversary, often remains silent. What would be the point in questioning anyone’s philosophical system when it's more or less common knowledge that philosophy tends to be a contrived, and narrowly subjective purview of the basic questions of our purpose on this earth, how knowledge works, how perception works, and what way of life is the most morally sound? Well, probably when philosophers purport to understand actual science and implement it as a tool for understanding less scientifically observable phenomena such as the aforementioned types which are so inimical to the concerns of philosophy.At least this was the problem that Alan Sokal, professor of physics at New York University, seemed to have with an intrinsically French brand of thought which came to popularity in the early 1970’s that usually went by the name postmodernism. Well, it actually went by and/or came out of quite a few different names; structuralism, post-structuralism, deconstruction, etc. It also came to the attention of Western academics around the same time as the academic “discipline” of cultural studies did. Since the late sixties, postmodernity was (and continues to be) a vague moniker under which a variety of culture (in general) defined and questioned itself. Sokal was really just interested in what could roughly be considered postmodern philosophy; specifically the philosophies of Jacques Lacan, Julie Kristeva, Jean Baudrillard, Luce Irigaray, Bruno Latour, Gille Deleuze, Félix Guattari, and Paul Virilio. As an intellectual, Sokal probably found the writings of these particular philosophers to be nothing more than a lot of shallow, erudite poetics that, when analyzed on a grammatical and syntactical level, meant relatively little. Yet as a physicist, he struggled with the fact that the level of understanding displayed in the math and physics that these thinkers were employing in their respective philosophies was flat-out incorrect, when it wasn't simply banal. So in 1996, Sokal devised a devilishly clever intellectual prank: he contrived his own parody of a standard sort of postmodern essay, using the names of the aforementioned French (and Belgian) thinkers as references and source material; it was aptly entitled Transgressing the Boundaries; Toward a Transformative Hermeneutics of Quantum Gravity. Sokal submitted this essay to a prestigious American cultural studies journal by the name of Social Text. His fake essay was immediately lauded with praise from some of the intellectuals mentioned in it, as well as a number of American academics and philosophers who were influenced by the prominent postmodern thinkers. Naturally, at the realization that the essay was a parody, intended to reveal the lack of intellectual rigor on the part of the editors of Social Text, as well as that of cultural studies departments all over the world, the editors claimed that Sokal seemed like an earnest scientific academic interested bringing the disciplines of the natural sciences and the social sciences closer together, furthermore that the writing was bad and that, “its status as parody does not alter, substantially, our interest in the piece, itself, as a symptomatic document."" What Sokal’s intentions truly were, above all else, was to illustrate the fraudulence of postmodern approaches to critical thinking by submitting a sociological essay on the academic divide between the hard sciences and the social sciences - an essay that did so by flattering its references, using deliberately obscure and meaningless language, and making false scientific claims – he could show how this style of thinking was “fashionable nonsense” that caused more harm than good. In other words, these thinkers were frauds, through purporting an understanding of science that they didn’t possess, and possibly in various other aspects of their respective philosophies.A year later, Sokal collaborated with Jean Bricmont, a Belgian theoretical physicist, on a book covering the research and motivation for the Social Text essay entitled Fashionable Nonsense: Postmodern Intellectuals’ Abuse of Science. In it, the two run through the list of names, with fully researched analysis of writings illustrative of particular instances in which erroneous claims about science are made. The two also attempt to explain, to a popular audience, some of the theoretical arguments and discussions that have occurred throughout the history of the philosophy or sociology of science; thinkers such as Karl Popper, Thomas Kuhn, and Paul Feyeraband are taken into account. Sokal also devotes an entire chapter to the so-called “science wars” and offers suggestions, from a scientists point of view, of ways in which the two disciplines would benefit from a sort of academic synthesis. Much like Edward O. Wilson’s best-selling book Consilience, Fashionable Nonsense reveals that in fact there wouldn’t really be much need for philosophers in this hypothetical scenario. Or rather, if social scientists were still needed, their services would be required in a more poetic context, rather than one of research, or merely that of developing theories and methodologies for use in the field. Certain aspects of Fashionable Nonsense offer complications for the general reader uninitiated in technical physics, math, and science. On the one hand, if the technical explanations are over their head, much of the argument probably won’t make a great deal of sense. Or, if one is of an intellect not steeped in technical science, but more than capable of gleaning the thrust of the debate and controversy, then a little blind faith is required in order to trust Sokal’s explanations. Still, any rational person should be able to see that it’s quite unlikely that a professor of physics would utilize erroneous math and physics in order to debunk the fraudulence inherent in other writers who do the same. Not only would this be immediately revealed by even more outraged scientists, but what exactly would be the point?Of course, things continue to seem even more complicated thanks to something called epistemic relativism. This is the school of thought that suggests that any mode of knowing – usually what people refer to as an objective truth – is just as good as the next. In other words, what is commonly implied is that western science is just as solidly objective and reliable as tribal myth. Sokal discusses Feyeraband and his anarchic views on scientific method in discourse on the plausibility of epistemic relativism. Again, to the skeptical lay-reader, the entire argument might sound like two sides vociferously attempting to persuade and convince a neutral party. Such is the essence of discussion and argument really. To further complicate things, the Strong Programme is discussed as well, which makes the claim that “true” and “false” scientific theories should be treated equally, and that social status and culture play a role in influencing different scientific theories. Or to put it rather bluntly, the Strong Programme basically states that there is no such thing as observable rationality or reason. In a sense, epistemic relativism lies at the heart of what Sokal and Bricmont are criticizing. This sort of philosophical vagueness, coupled with an unfulfilled, question-begging prophecy are characteristic of what Jacques Derrida’s deconstruction attempted to do with language and writing. In fact, it’s quite characteristic of the analytical approach that most of the authors who are discussed in Fashionable Nonsense rely on in order to excuse the ostensible lack of meaning in their writings. There are some gargantuan debates and intellectual controversies discussed in Sokal and Bricmont’s incredibly layered book, which is why it should encourage the reader to investigate the verisimilitude of certain philosophies. The two physicists are very much aware of the apologetic arguments that might keep philosophical hucksters theoretically safe, but the basic question of why one would bandy about a very technical and specific scientific language to meet the ends of their philosophical means, remains inadequately answered. It most likely will for some time. The responses to Sokal’s Hoax from the writers in question were predictably incredulous. If it wasn’t the likes of Julie Kristeva accusing them of spreading “disinformation as part of an anti-French, politico-economic campaign”, it was Robert Maggiori in Libération saying that, “Sokal and Bricmont are Humorless scientific pedants who correct grammatical errors in love letters”. Along with this, accusations of right-wing politics and conservatism were made. In the face of such abysmal intellectual denial, scientific reason can only repeatedly make the claim that there are such things as facts, and that they are observable. This has much to do with why scientists aren’t attached to specific theories for terribly long; these theories are created with the intention of being exploded or discarded if they turn out to serve as unstable groundwork for method. Fashionable Nonsense is polemical, but only in the sense that Sokal feels an obligation to his notions of truth and fact as a scientist. He repeatedly mentions the point that these writers willfully chose to include specifically scientific terminology in their writings. As he mentions in the book, science doesn’t exactly have a monopoly on words such as chaos, velocity, or speed, but when used along with other well recognized terms clearly alluding to specific scientific facts, they cannot be construed as metaphors. Sokal set out to reveal how one aspect of postmodernism was fraudulent, and in doing so seemed to invariably reduce that particular style of thinking and writing to what it truly is: superficial erudition garnished with a lot of fancy-sounding technical language. He wasn't arguing against the usefulness or relevance of the social sciences, rather, he was arguing against pretentious nonsense promulgated as fact under the guise of science. "
2,0312204078,http://goodreads.com/user/show/84023-j-g-keely,0,"Why is it that whenever a theory of social science is found to be flawed, and loses the respect of the scientific community, it manages to find new success as a branch of literary criticism? Freud's theories are by this point laughable, and yet they persist as viable modes of literary analysis. Marx's tautological economic theories have gone the same way. If I had to predict, I'd say Chomsky is up next.There is a point at which ahistoricism and structuralism are willing to accept any method, any idea, any theory, and clasp it close, independent of whether it has any worth. Many literary critics seem to judge an idea good not due to its merit, but its novelty and outrageousness.Alan Sokal would go further and say that the upper echelon of Literary criticism, the tenured professors, the peer-reviewed journals, and the most successful critics are more interested in vague, garbled nonsense than in really sound or revolutionary ideas. Which is why he famously submitted an essay filled with jargon terms, popular ideas, and quotes from the right people, but comically nonsensical and scientifically childish, and of course it was accepted, printed and lauded.This book, like much of Sokal's work, is aimed at debunking the modern powerhouses of literary criticism, by the simple act of pointing out that their rhetoric, definitions, and understanding of the scientific principles they invoke are entirely flawed and amount to nonsense.Even to those of us without Sokal's scientific background, it quickly becomes clear that Lacan and Derrida (and to a lesser extent, Foucault and Barthes) are just sensationalist, erudite nonsense, and that they are only quoted so often because little they say has any foundation in reality, and hence, they can be used to support or refute anything.Hopefully the bloated, meandering heads of academia will soon be shamed into doing real work by the efforts of men like Sokal. It would be nice to return to some semblance of reason and rhetoric in the Lit Crit field.Hopefully I'll find a copy of this book to go through, myself. Though Dawkins isn't my favorite, I have to thank him for cluing me into Sokal, and to the Postmodernism Generator, which creates random postmodernist papers whenever you hit refresh, and which are surprisingly difficult to tell from the work of real postmodernists."
3,0312204078,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1711431-eric-w,4,"In 1996, Alan Sokal submitted an article to Social Text entitled ""Transgressing the Boundaries: Toward a Transformative Hermeneutics of Quantum Gravity."" If that title means little to you, that's OK because the article was, in fact, nonsense. It was part of an elaborate hoax and parody that Sokal was perpetrating on those who subscribe to ""epistemic relativism,"" i.e., the belief that modern science is nothing more than myth, a ""social construction."" This philosophy is particularly endemic to modern French philosophers who have attempted to appropriate the language of science in order to validate some of their thinking without understanding the science itself. Sokal, a renowned physicist, by filling his article with scientific balderdash and liberally citing the editors of Social Text (David Lodge's Law of Academic Life says ""It is impossible to be excessive in flattery of one's peers."") had his article gleefully accepted, revealing the ignorance and vacuity of the pseudo-thinkers. Fashionable Nonsense expands the revelations behind the parody and thoroughly reveals the emperor's nakedness. The authors, by analysis of several postmodernist French philosophers, show how they misuse, misrepresent, and misunderstand basic science. Sokal and Bricmont disclose how ""deliberately obscure language"" is used to hide confused thinking, that often if something is difficult to understand in the writings of these philosophers it's because they aren't saying anything.Postmodernism, a trend fashionable in some social science and humanist circles, adopts the view that rejects the rationalism of the enlightenment and proposes that science is a ""social construction"" or ""narration"" and that there is no need to look for empirical evidence.Unfortunately, much of postmodernist ""thinking"" has become associated with the left, a linkage Sokal abhors. He wants to defend the Left from a trendy segment of itself. As Michael Albert, wrote for Z Magazine, ""There is nothing truthful, wise, human, or strategic about confusing hostility with injustice and oppression, which is leftist, with hostility to science and rationality, which is nonsense.""A follow-up article, published as an appendix to the book, was submitted to Social Text but was rejected as not meeting their intellectual standards! It must have been understandable and made sense. In it Sokal wrote, ""I confess that I am an unabashed Old Leftist who never quite understood how deconstruction was supposed to help the working class. And I'm a stodgy old scientist who believes, naively, that there exists an external world, that there exist objective truths about that world, and that my job is to discover some of them."" This book is a delightful attack on intellectual confusion and a ringing call to obfuscate obfuscation.reposted with minor editing 1/15/10"
4,0312204078,http://goodreads.com/user/show/8178894-nostalgebraist,3,"This is a book that serves its modest purpose reasonably well, but after finishing it, I was left mostly wondering whether it was a purpose that needed to be served.First, a note on context -- this book was co-authored by Alan Sokal, the perpetrator of the (in)famous Sokal Hoax. I won't describe or weigh in on the hoax here, since there has been a lot said about it elsewhere (this article by Michael Bérubé is a good even-handed retrospective), and also because this book is a much less inherently contentious entity than the Hoax. In some ways, it's a shame that Sokal became famous for the Hoax first, because this book would probably have made a bigger impact if it weren't associated with an author already famous for contentious, partisan views.With that said, on to the book itself. Its purpose is to show that a number of well-regarded continental (mostly French) philosophers, as well as certain sociologists, have made invalid usage of mathematics and physics in their writing. ""Invalid"" here is meant in a strong sense -- this isn't mere pedantic nitpicking, like correcting someone's grammar. The errors are substantial ones, to the point of being fatal: Sokal and Bricmont claim that the errors made by these authors render their math-based arguments and judgments either wrong or meaningless.The book has a peculiar format: aside from a few interspersed philosophical essays (labelled ""Intermezzos""), it is essentially a very long list of quotations from the authors' targets, followed by brief explanations of how the targets have erred. The quotations are often very long, and are typically longer than the commentary; this may have the highest quotation-to-main-text ratio of any book I've ever read.I found myself agreeing with Sokal and Bricmont in almost every case. The quotations they choose are, to someone with a mathematical background, self-undermining: they clearly demonstrate a lack of facility with the concepts they invoke. I have to wonder how effective the book would be for someone without a math background -- often Sokal and Bricmont's commentary boils down things like to ""the author doesn't appear to understand relativity theory"" or ""the author states this theorem incorrectly,"" and while that's clear to me (because I'm familiar with the topics in question), I'm not sure S&B do a good enough job of explaining it. None of their criticisms are mere nitpicks, but many of them might sound like mere nitpicks to the uninitiated.There is also another, much more significant way in which this book feels like it's preaching to the choir. To describe it, let me first say that the mistakes catalogued here divide into two types. One type is misunderstanding of math or theoretical physics in itself -- say, when an author misquotes a mathematical definition. These errors are relatively clean-cut -- it is easy to say, definitively, that the targets really have erred -- although, again, those who don't know the math will just have to take this on faith from S&B.But there is another, second kind of error: erroneous use of math and physics concepts as parts of arguments or as metaphors. And it is in this case that the quoted authors really fall on their faces. It would be one thing to simply get a definition wrong (such errors can be produced by misprints, after all), but the way in which mathematical concepts are linked to topics like psychoanalysis or sociology by these authors is a very different and more bizarre sort of error. Often it feels, to someone who knows the math, like an absurd category mistake, roughly analogous to asserting (without explanation or justification) that ""modern telephones communicate by sending Leibnizian monads"" or ""political solidarity is properly categorized as a particular flavor of ice cream.""And this is where I worry that this book's very existence is kind of superfluous. It's not just that these sorts of bizarre claims -- say, that Cantor's infinities have something to do with psychoanalysis, or that the notion of ""lightlike intervals"" in special relativity theory can somehow explain modern society -- it's not just that these claims happen to be wrong. It's that I have a hard time imagining how anyone could think they weren't wrong. Even if I didn't happen to know anything about the mathematics of infinity, I imagine I would be confused if someone started telling me that it can help us understand the human subconscious; at the very least I would want an acknowledgement that this is an outlandish claim, and that it requires some legwork to get the reader ""on board."" Instead, these authors just barrel ahead.So the reason people don't object to these kinds of errors can't (just) be a lack of math and physics education. It must be something deeper: a greater tolerance for outlandish conceptual leaps, or a greater willingness to put one's faith in an author, to assume that if they make outlandish claims they must have good justifications for them hidden somewhere, although not explicitly stated in the text itself. (Why some authors get this lenient treatment and others don't is an interesting sociological question in itself.)This connects back to the fact that this book is composed largely of quotations: to someone like me or S&B, the fact that these people are making absurd category mistakes is evident from their writing itself, so that the commentary is almost superfluous. (Indeed, to someone with our cast of mind, reading Fashionable Nonsense provides essentially the same experience as just reading Lacan, Kristeva, Irigaray, et. al. directly; S&B's commentary simply echoes what I was already thinking when reading their quotations.)But of course if everyone had this cast of mind, then these authors would not have the renown they do. (S&B usefully quote a number of reviews that laud their targets' ""precision,"" etc., to make the point that people really do treat these authors as serious intellectuals, and not just as writers of an odd and awkward sort of academic poetry.) So what I'm left with is a sense of a huge and unbridgeable gulf. If you're like Sokal and Bricmont and me, you'll agree with Fashionable Nonsense, but you probably don't have to read it in the first place; if you're not like us, it probably won't convince you of anything, because it mainly argues by exhibiting its targets as though their flaws were self-evident. I do wonder what it's like on the other side of the bridge; this book gives little insight into that question."

 Fashionable Nonsense
. There is a reason that science and the humanities are administered by different departments in (almost) every university. Common-sense would dictate that physicists are not in the habit of teaching courses on Shakespeare, and English professors are not in the habit of teaching quantum mechanics. However, as Sokal shows us, the latter is no longer true in all cases. As a scientist, Sokal does not overstep his own areas of expertise, while showing that po-mo academics routinely overstep theirs. Keeping strictly to the scientific claims (and subsequent abuses) of several famous po-mo academics, Sokal shows both that post-modernism has created a parody of intellectual rigor, and that the post-modern methodology is in danger of undermining the once proud study of arts and letters.The results of Sokal's critique are often hilarious. That the theories of Irigiray, Guattari, Deleuze, et. al. are supposedly malleable enough to be applied to any topic whatsoever is almost a running gag. To wit, Sokal's discussion of Irigiray's bizarre combination of gender studies, feminist ethics, and special relativity is a comedic highpoint (E=mc^2 is a sexist equation?!). The underlying message is, of course, that po-mo theorists are intellectually dishonest insofar as they purport that a scientific theory is just another 'text' to be deconstructed. That 'special relativity' and 'cultural relativism' share the same etymological root does not mean they share the same epistemological foundation. The equivocation is blatant enough to be funny; though Sokal shows that we should temper our laughter.If Sokal is correct, the shibboleths 'hermeneutics', 'Lacanian' and 'desituationism' are sufficient for advanced degrees from premier universities, and this has lead to a crisis. This crisis is not so much a 'dumbing-down' of the humanities, but, rather, that the humanities are in danger of losing credibility. By making scientific claims from outside of the scientific method, post-modernists are coming across as the ivory-tower equivalents of Ann Coulter: incredibly bright but misguided to the point of parody. The credibility gap is perpetuated when po-mo academics couch their usually non-existent 'theories' in language so dense and difficult to read that those who cannot understand are looked down upon as intellectual inferiors and those who do understand are lying. In sum, post-modern theories are the epitome of the academic foolishness described by Pope: ""Such laboured nothings in so strange a style, / Amaze th' unlearn'd, and make the learned smile."" Unfortunately, if Sokal is correct about the humanities, a majority of English majors may not even know who Pope is. "

But if like me, you regularly have to encounter postmodernism in the flesh and just don't get it, this is a must-read. It will reassure you that incoherent sentences mixed shameless displays of (false) erudition--although extremely humorous--cannot change the fact that reason, evidence, and the truth do matter (even if rich, white men believe in them too).

8,0312204078,http://goodreads.com/user/show/9800512-mark,5,"I think it's crucial that respectable academics stop purveying semantically vacuous nonsense that egregiously expropriates terms that have precise scientific meanings, with demonstrably no understanding whatever of those meanings, for the purpose of furthering an atmosphere of moral equivalency for sense and nonsense. (I use the word ""respectable"" contextually: the perpetrators of this furtherance of discursive entropy are respected by many of the academics within their own fields.)"
9,0312204078,http://goodreads.com/user/show/26188-jafar,4,"This book started off as a prank when Sokal sent an article to Social Text which was full of nonsense, but used pomo's vague and pompous style and confirmed some of their social/political beliefs. The editors, excited that a physicist has converted to their side, promptly published the article. Once caught, they refused to publish the subsequent paper in which Sokal explained the reason for his prank and how absurd the first article had been. Richard Dawkins said it best in one of his essays in A Devil's Chaplin. These postmodern/poststructuralist/deconstructionist/whatever writers have ""physics complex"". Physics is a subject that is genuinely very difficult. Most of the things that the pomo camp is trying to say, if you have the patience to go through their pretentious and convoluted writing, are quite ordinary and can be said much more simply. (I've certainly had this impression from the few pomo books and articles that I had the patience to go through.) To give their ideas the impression of being involved and complicated, and impress their peers and readers and satisfy their vanity, they resort to mixing pomposity with nonsense. It used to be quite fashionable, and fortunately it's going out of fashion. One particular form of their pretentiousness is their (ab)use of scientific concepts and jargon in their writing. They not only don't understand the subject, a lot of them are against science and rationality and deny the very existence of any objective truth - which makes you wonder why they want to employ (pseudo)science in their arguments. The book has a lot of such examples from various prominent pomo thinkers. My favorite ones are Luce Irigaray's analysis of why Einstein's famous equation E=mc2 is a sexist equation; and Jaques Lacan's assertion that penis represents square root of minus one (only a deconstructionist psychoanalyst can come up with such a genius idea). As for the prank itself - vanity is something that afflicts all of us, including scientists. The prominent neuroscientist Ramachandran (Phantoms of the Brain) sent an article to a magazine specializing in evolutionary biology. He compiled a bunch of scientific-sounding arguments to prove why it make evolutionary sense for men to prefer blond women over brunettes. (Has such preference among men been statistically proven? I personally cast my vote for brunettes.) The editors got too excited that such a famous neuroscientist has discovered yet another minor detail about our nature to be the result of evolution and natural selection. They gladly published the article, and then Ramachandran told them, Hahaha, that was just a joke! "
10,0312204078,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1411444-ed-erwin,4,"For a long time I thought that Sokal's famous hoax publication, plus this book, were intended to show that modern philosophers, particularly in France, are spouting nothing but nonsense. But recently I saw a bit of a yootoobe video where some guy says that is not what Sokal was doing, and that Sokal himself said so.Well, the yootoober was right. Sokal and Bricmont are saying something more limited and more nuanced. They have two main points:1. Some (not all) journals publishing philosophical articles do horrible peer review, if any at all.2. Some (not all) philosophers sprinkle their texts with allusions to scientific or mathematical concepts that they do not appear to understand, and do not seem to care that they don't understand. Even when those allusions are meant to be taken as metaphors they often make no sense.The first problem, sadly, exists in scientific fields as well. The prestigious journals do a good job, but there are some that will publish anything.The second problem is more telling. If philosophers hold up Lacan and Kristeva (and some others) for praise after they write such garbage, there is a big problem there. It doesn't necessarily mean everything they've written is junk, but they need to be held responsible for the fact that some of what they write is non-sense."
11,0312204078,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4570415-janet,1,"I wanted to like this, I really did. It was completely relevant to my interests. I'm sick of the contempt for the sciences communicated by the humanities even after their post-60s dialogue with scientific language. I think that actually understanding the concepts one uses to break down the convention of analogy is interesting. I don't think that the doubts and complexities of actual science are fundamentally responsible for political and social damage. Sokal could have been moderate, understanding, and just as open to understanding the doubts and complexities of pomo gibberish. Instead, here are these assholes, and here's the joke, flying over them beyond the orbit of the moon. See, the whole point of cultural theorists ""abusing"" (that sure is some strong language, sure glad it's sworn to protect and serve) math and science is not to actually draw analogies, but to manifest the underlying absurdity of analogies, to create greater confusion and that unique feel of incomprehensibility. They write ABOUT the sensation of encountering the arcane, the gaps between realms of knowledge, the incommensurability of intellectual (and otherwise) cultures. When Sokal laments that they seem to at least know the sciences they ""abuse"" but are deliberately obfuscating to ""impress their readers"", he could use that same recognition of their trans-disciplinary research to guide him into fucking Getting It.I admit, I stopped reading when he started digging into Latour, a philosopher who has himself bridged the same gap, and sought to understand science in post-modern, intersubjective way, by moving from sociology of science through posthuman politics. Admittedly, he can be dry and Gallically smug, but Latour understands how science does and does not work, and how applying it to itself engages a worlds-enclosing-worlds-that-enclose-them dynamic that non-Euclidean mathematics has probably also gotten around to, no conceptual misuse accusations necessary. Claiming it to be outside of Latour's dissection and inversion of it indicates an enclosed dogmatism as thorough of that he thinks he sees in postmodern theory.When Sokal holes the literarizing of meta-literature up to the standards of scientific analysis, it's worse than the structuralism shown earlier by some of his targets. Postmodern theory aimed to establish a place in an academy based on Enlightenment (and prior) rationalism for irrationality. The potentialities of nonsense are a larger infinity than those of rationality, itself, as Sokal univentively connected, undermined within mathematics. The concept of an intellectual institution without a place for and vigorous exploration of nonsense horrifies me, as does Sokal's highly unscientific failure to self-examine. I speak as someone who understands and appreciates science, here, dammit, and I don't like the reputation he's giving it.When Sokal published his famous joke paper, the joke was really that he didn't realize it was all a joke already."

Being French, I know far too well how postmodernism/poststructuralism/social constructivism (or whatever other stupid name a certain intelligentsia wants to call itself) damaged a whole field of academics and, as such, modern intellectual life and debate. Stemming from the like of Lacan, Deleuze, Kristeva, Baudrillard, Irigaray, Latour, Virilio and co (to name just the ones targeted here) there is indeed a vague intellectual Zeitgeist corrupting a whole part of modern societies, one based on subjectivism, relativism and, all in all, a reject of the rationalism of the Enlightenment that needed to be addressed. If the impact of these intellectuals upon political issues, especially via their influence on part of the Left, is well known (cultural relativism, multiculturalism, political correctness etc.) politics however is not what Sokal and Bricmont are here interested in. Both scientists by trade, specialists in mathematics and physics, they are in fact coming back on their now famous hoax (the so-called 'Sokal Affair') to better expose how fallacious such philosophies are. Analysing the texts of some of these 'thinkers' that they quote at large (and gosh! what an heavy and pompous nausea their prose is!) they show that, their extensive use of scientific terminology (drawn from topology, chaos theory, quantum mechanics, relativity etc.) applied to fields of social sciences (psychoanalysis, linguistics, political philosophy etc.) is not only irrelevant but, more often than not based on a complete ignorance and/or misunderstanding of the hard sciences involved! Hence nonsensical verbiage, demonstrating that such philosophies are nothing more than 'mystification, deliberately obscure language, confused thinking, and the misuse of scientific concepts', the authors dismiss them for what they are: intellectual imposture and frauds. Of course, this is not an attack on Humanities as a whole, French academias, nor against the political Left (Sokal, deliciously, even actually define himself as 'an old Leftist who never quite understood how deconstruction was supposed to help the working class')! Such reading, beyond its denunciation of ignorant and incompetent nonsense, serves on the contrary as a warning against that so called 'postmodern Zeitgeist', a dangerous and irresponsible way of thinking in a world prey to obscurantism, fanaticism and superstition. In fact, even the causes these philosophical stances are supposed to help (feminism, gay rights, anti racism) would be far better off without such imbecilities! This book is thus a pure delight for anyone fed up and annoyed by pompous and farcical 'philosophers' being, dangerously enough, taken seriously among some pedantic leftist circles. Point fingers and laugh: the emperor at long last has been revealed naked."
14,0312204078,http://goodreads.com/user/show/30785064-harry-doble,5,"I give Fashionable Nonsense five stars because for all its shortcomings, it achieves exactly what Alan Sokal & Jean Bricmont set out to do. This book is a few things: a love letter to science, a critique of bad academic writing, a plea for clarity and reason in the political left. But to understand what this book is, you also have to understand what it is not. Contrary to popular belief, this is not an attack on postmodernism and the humanities at large by arrogant scientists who simply don't get it. The preface and introduction to my edition make this clear, and the care Sokal and Bricmont employ in defining terms and not overstepping their boundaries of expertise is commendable. This book is extremely charitible to the subject of its critique, in fact, but charity can only be taken so far. What we have here is a catalogue of some of the most blatantly stupid and lazy things ever written by an academic of some prestige, all of which have in common the tendency to invoke scientific and mathematic concepts the author does not understand. This is where Sokal and Bricmont step in, to offer commentary on misuses and explain the underlying concepts in layman's terms the best they can where they see them. There are chapters on Jacques Lacan, Julia Kristeva, Luce Irigaray, Bruno Latour, Jean Baudrillard, Gilles Deleuze and Felix Guattari, and Paul Virilio. I have read some criticism that Sokal and Bricmont's approach is little more than quoting a block of text from these writers and offering a short remark with some footnotes, but for their purposes, this is fine. It is the chapter on Epistemic Relativism in the Philosophy of Science that is the true highlight for me. Sokal and Bricmont help the reader contextualise several relativist threads within the philosophy of science that are frequently used to undermine its authority, namely underdetermination, the work of Thomas Kuhn and Paul Feyerabend, and the strong programme of sociology. I found their argument in this chapter an exhilarating defense of science as practice. There are also chapters on chaos theory and Gödel's incompleteness theorems, which are similarly terrific. Sokal's original essay on how gravity is a social construct is also included here with notes, and if you are anything like me, there is delight to be had in combing over it to see how he exploited common tropes of postmodernist writing for his prank. Fashionable Nonsense is a timely and necessary book, one I would recommend to both students of the sciences and humanities alike."
15,0312204078,http://goodreads.com/user/show/28825839-stephie-williams,3,"This book shows up some of the postmodernists and poststructuralists misuse and abuse of mathematics and science (especially physics). One of the authors, Alan Sokal, wrote a paper that mimics these types of scholars as a hoax, published in the postmodernist journal Social Text, which is included as appendix A, followed by some further comments in appendix B. The scholars, all I believe are tenured professors, hence why I am calling them scholars, are Jacques Lacan, Julia Kristeva, Luce Irigaray, Bruno Latour, Jean Baudrillard, Gilles Deleuze, Felix Guattari, and Paul Virilio. Intertwined are chapters on these scholars views on philosophy of science, chaos theory, Godel’s Incompleteness theorem and set theory, and how they are wrong in their interpretations. There is an afterword as appendix C. The following comments are based on notes I took while reading the book. Kindle locations are given in brackets [].[905] I have an objection to this line of thought - “We never have direct access to the world; we have direct access only to sensations.” This is accepted in the authors answer to “solipsism and radical skepticism.” I do not concede this to those that hold this position. We do have direct contact with the world. We see things because of light (made of photons) impinging on our nervous system; we touch many things directly; we smell because of contact with chemical molecules; we taste because of touch and chemical reactions, and we hear because of sound waves that enter our ears.[1003] “In a sense, we always return to Hume’s problem: No statement about the real world can ever literally be proven; but to use the eminently appropriate expression from Anglo-Saxon law, it can sometimes be proven beyond any reasonable doubt. The unreasonable doubt subsists.” (authors italics). I have been saying this for some years. If I hold a belief that is beyond a reasonable doubt, I should be willing to act on it, and for me a belief is not a belief until it is beyond a reasonable doubt. Otherwise, for me it is just a thought or feeling, something I think or feel about, but that I am not completely sure of, and when I write I say “I think or I feel.”*[1644] Within in a quote by Irigaray is “Neitzsche also perceived his ego as an atomic nucleus threatened with explosion,” trying to argue some fantastic idea. Neitzsche also was mentally ill, and finally cracked (or went insane) at the end of his life. Maybe that atom nucleus did explode.[1785] “Finally, it is hard to see what relation, besides a purely metaphorical one, fluid mechanics could have with psychoanalysis. Suppose tomorrow someone were to come up with a satisfactory theory of turbulence. In what way would (or should) that affect our theories of human psychology.” Brain fluid turbulence, maybe :-)[2307] Within a long quote by Baudrillard it says: “It combines in effect an inflation, a galloping acceleration, a dizzying whirl of mobility, an eccentricity of events and an excess of meaning and information with an exponential tendency towards total entropy.” (my italics) Besides the authors critique, I would add that besides its meaninglessness, if total entropy were reach there would be no reason to continue chuntering on. And, then: “It would seem that there will be no end . . .” Total entropy would be the end. Further on [2316] in the same quotation, there is this “. . . the potential hurricanes which end in the beating of a butterfly’s wings?” Should not this be the beginning if he is trying to use the popular analogy?[2388] From a quote by Deleuze and Guattari: “. . . they [endoreferences] are not relations but numbers, and the entire theory of functions depends on numbers.” First, I have no idea what “endoreferences” in brackets are. Second, functions depend not just on numbers; they are really relations of variables with the numbers occurring in them as constants that do not vary. It is okay if a functions have no constants at all, like: f(x) = y + y.[3494] Here is a sentence in a quote by Aronowitz: “Surely, the earth [sic] evolved long before life on earth.” First, the Earth does not evolve itself (at least not in the Darwinian sense as life does). Second if as stated previously in the quote: “natural objects are also socially constructed,” how can the earth (evolving or not) be anything other than a social construct, which as such could equally be socially constructed to not exist to be consistent?[4475] Note 52 states: “Bertrand Russell . . . tells the following amusing story. ‘I once received a letter from an eminent logician, Mrs. Christine Ladd Franklin, saying that she was a solipsist, and was surprised that there were not others.” This is somewhat a surprising thing to say if you are a solipsist because if you hold to such a belief there are no others to be solipsists, since as a solipsist you must hold that only you exist.[4507] Note 62 partially says: “Our [the authors] analysis in this section [‘Epistemology in Crisis’ in chapter four.] is inspired in part by Putnam (1974), Stove (1982), and Laudan (1990b). . . . Tim Burdon drew our attention to Newton-Smith (1981), where a similar critique of Popper’s epistemology can be found.” I am not sure how similar Susan Haack’s opposition to Popper in her Putting Philosophy to Work is with these others, but it could very well go on the list as well.The book was okay, but repetitive and way to many lengthy quotes. I tended to enjoy the authors “Intermezzos” on different common problems with postmodernist writers, but how much gobbledygook can one take. I mean it felt like I was drowning in it—give me some air please. As you can see from my comments I found other qualms other than what the authors provided, so in this case it was a little fun. Remember, it seems like I get my jollies (though not in a mean way, at least not ordinarily) figuring out critiques with what others’ think.If you are interested in critiques of postmodernist thought in the academy, you should enjoy the book, given my caveat above, but if you enjoy a dizzy head you may not have any issues with it. I think it would help if you are already familiar with some of the postmodernists’ positions to understand the book better.* See my blog post “Can You Believe That?” which discusses my scale of belief I tend to use when I write.

18,0312204078,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1304308-worthless-bum,4,"Alan Sokal is known for having written a splendid parody known as the ""Sokal Hoax"", a paper submitted and published in the journal ""Social Text"" which criticizes certain academic trends in literary criticism, philosophy, and sociology, such trends being largely influenced by certain French philosophers. Categorizing these trends and philosophies under the regrettably vague moniker ""postmodernism"" (a term whose vagueness owes itself in no small part to the tendency for obscurity, inconsistency, and incoherence of philosophies so called), Sokal and co-author Jean Bricmont take to task some of the most famous and influential of these so called postmodernist (PoMo) thinkers. Just about every chapter in the book is devoted to a particular PoMo thinker, the exceptions being a couple of fascinating ""intermezzo"" chapters dealing with epistemic relativism and chaos theory respectively. The criticisms of the PoMos was confined to abuses of concepts in math and science. The chapters dealing with the PoMo thinkers consist of textual excerpts analyzed by Sokal and Bricmont. These excerpts are painful to read. They exhibit what the authors call ""superficial erudition"", an obscure and technical verbiage laden form of writing that turns out to be either incoherent or trivial when unpacked. A person reading such passages who doesn't understand the technical math and science concepts invoked may well think ""wow, this is so profound that it goes over my head"", and that seems to be one of the motivations behind this kind of writing, to wow laypeople with superficial, pedantic intellectuality. In other words it is intellectual masturbation. In the quoted excerpts from the PoMos, it always turns out that they don't understand the technical concepts that are using, or that the use of them is gratuitous, that the comparisons and analogies made between a math or science concept and something in literature or sociology is not adequately justified.I found the first intermezzo chapter dealing with epistemic relativism to be the most interesting chapter in the book. Feyerabend's ""epistemic anarchy"" as put forward in his putative ""Against Method"" is analyzed, as is a radical interpretation of Quinean underdetermination and incomensurability, and Thomas Kuhn's ""The Structure of Scientific Revolutions"".

19,0312204078,http://goodreads.com/user/show/30180707-brett-williams,5,"Postmodern medicine that tastes good!This book will keep you laughing for hours. It’s about The Sokal Hoax, a phony article made up of esoteric scientific jargon applied to social issues through convolutions of logic and obfuscated language. Sokal then infiltrated postmodernist turf when he got his paper published in one of their premier journals, “Social Text: A daring and controversial leader in the field of cultural studies.” The paper was an instant smash throughout postmodern circles, later to win the 1996 Ig Noble Award – more than Sokal could hope for.Sokal, a professor of physics, canvassed what looks like hundreds of postmodern papers flushed in untreated torrents from academia. By pulling together this nasty set of aromas he creates a bouquet for those he drenches with praise throughout the hoax by applying Lodge’s maxim, “It is impossible to be excessive in flattery of one’s peers.” Like any good snake oil salesman, Sokal simply kludged the language into what postmoderns want to hear most, “that physical reality is at bottom a social and linguistic construct,” he writes. Thus science is mere politics, another Western bias, nothing whatsoever to do with the realities of nature. (Ignoring the curing of small pox, man on the moon, Voyager to Saturn, computers, TVs, cell phones, planes, trains and automobiles.) There is thus no objective truth, allowing postmoderns to tell us what it really is. At some point Sokal could bare no more praise heaped high, nor references to his “ground-breaking work” among postmodern publications, so he revealed the article for what it was. Not only did the kings and queens have no clothes, but their bodies looked so funny under the optic of Sokal’s glare. They’d been duped and they knew it. Wheels of postmodern correctness squealed into reverse to say they’d always known Sokal was a fake. Sokal makes postmodernism fun, and shows us there’s a good chance we’ve been misunderstanding these people for these last fifty years – they’re really comedians. And to think we took them seriously. If the public only knew what academic freedom protected at the university at their tax dollar’s expense, they might not be laughing."

22,0312204078,http://goodreads.com/user/show/971451-marshall,3,"Oh, how badly the Left needs more books like this, boldly championing scientific objectivity and facts over political or spiritual ideologies that abuse science to gain legitimacy and further their agendas.The story of the origin of this book is a playful one: the author submitted a parody article, called Transgressing the Boundaries, to a postmodern scientific journal. In it he demonstrates every abuse of science he's seen, conflating subjects that have nothing to do with each other, exaggerating, distorting, misunderstanding, and mis-stating scientific facts. He even ended it with a little political rant that had nothing whatsoever to do with science. Not only was the paper accepted by the journal, it was featured, and lauded by postmodern intellectuals. Needless to say, it was quite embarrassing for the journal and its readers when they found out it was a parody.He was trying to make a very serious point: science should not be abused as a tool to gain legitimacy for social, spiritual, or political agendas. The very fact that the paper was accepted and lauded shows how welcoming postmodern intellectuals are of such abuse. He points out that this isn't so much a danger to science as it is to the very social and political agendas it's twisted to serve. When concepts are abused like this, there tends to be a backlash when this comes to light, as it always does. Enemies of these agendas then use this as ammunition against them.Conservatives are notorious for being anti-science, but the Left has its own antagonisms. They're so focused on equality and tolerance that they sometimes ignore the hard facts, twist those facts to suit their agendas, or even go so far as to claim that there is no such thing as objective reality or facts at all. Each person gets to have their own reality. This makes all debate or criticism meaningless, and any attempt to do so can be classified as bullying, as it doesn't respect other people's realities. This is what this book means by postmodernism.This book basically picks up where the parody left off, displaying several examples of articles which abuse science in bizarre and sometimes meaningless ways. It meticulously examines these articles, and exposes the abuses. It's interesting to read the examples and feel confused and a little intimidated by all the jargon, and then watch the author pick it apart and show that, no, it really is meaningless, and probably written for the express purpose of intimidating or impressing readers. Seeing this done over and over really made me a more critical reader by strengthening my own ability to see through arguments that abuse science and distort the facts for the sake of ideology.However, this book does have a tendency to over-quote, which he said he does because he doesn't want to be accused of taking things out of context. But after a few chapters, this whole exercise started to get tiring and dull. In fact, he's not a very engaging writer. Nonetheless, I highly recommend skimming the appendix, which includes the original parody article and the author's comments on it, as well as a chapter or two from the book. Then read the Epilogue, which is very engaging, beautifully written, and does a fabulous job at summarizing his points. Though difficult to read, I do believe this book is important."
23,0312204078,http://goodreads.com/user/show/82232815-frank-kool,4,"It's sad to consider just how badly we still need books like this. More than two decades after its publication (1998) following the Sokal affaire (1996), ""fashionable nonsense"" still manages to lure people in by merging pseudo-scientific ramblings with grievances.When I first encountered texts from the likes of Deleuze, Lacan, and Irigaray as a philosophy student, my response was a mixture of puzzlement, amusement, and an overall ""not my cup of tea"" attitude. It seemed like harmless little fun, some literary practice of esoteric wordplay. But then, there were the red flags found among these texts and their vocal supporters. The constant flirtations with marxism, the grievances about injustice in capitalist societies (and the inability to see a moral contradiction between these two), the not-so subtle verbal attacks on anything that is white and male, the grandiose battle-cries about ""subverting"" and ""challenging"" social order, the almost fanatical devotion to whatever is or isn't the proper ""understanding"" of a text as obscure and seemingly meaningless as Mille Plateaux...Like the authors say: if this is a joke, it isn't funny.The authors make it clear that Fashionable Nonsense is not written to attack any political view, and it is with this mindset that the book is best read. From their background in physics and mathematics, Sokal and Bricmont dive into the works of Lacan, Kristeva, Latour, Baudrillard, Irigaray, Virilio, and Deleuze & Guattari and show just how preposterous many of their claims are. Though the absurdity of some of the quotations are self-evident, others require a more thorough scientific explanation. As such, this book is at times difficult reading, but the authors go to great lengths to bridge the gap between expert and layman (the opposite of what the people they criticize are doing).After these refutations, the book ends with Sokal's famous hoax article Transgressing the Boundaries: Towards a Transformative Hermeneutics of Quantum Gravity, which managed to fool the editors of Social Text. This thirty page rambling pushes all the right postmodern buttons: appeals to authority, an overabundance of footnotes, moral and ontological relativism, pompous claims about social implications of quantum physics, and leftist politics. It is a diatribe so insane that it could only be mistaken for the real thing by the supposed experts in the field.In the end, the joke is funny, but in a rather sad way."
24,0312204078,http://goodreads.com/user/show/913238-justin,3,"Although this is an important book, it is not a very enjoyable one to read, for the simple fact that the authors felt compelled to quote at length from some of the most disfigured and meaningless jumbles of words that I have ever seen sewn together in the guise of sentences.A major portion of the book is given over to reproductions of original 'postmodernist' sources that ramble for pages on end, with trifling comments by the authors on how the different scientific concepts have been misinterpreted or misused. However, the long barrage of academic verbiage is such manifest nonsense to begin with that there is little left for the sagacity of Sokal and Bricmont to say.If a reader is not convinced of the absurdity of the postmodern examples within the first two sentences of a quotation, they probably so completely lack of the discriminating facility that another twenty pages will not do them any more good.There are only so many ways to call a fraud a fraud, so many ways to point to a syntactic confusion of adjectives and say, 'this is gibberish.'Much more instructive were the sections between the criticisms of the individual postmodern authors, that dealt more broadly with the roles of science and reason in the humanities and politics. Despite what other reviewers have said, there is nothing in these parts which does not seem to me to be thoroughly reasonable and correct.Most incomprehensible is how anyone could have ever taken these postmodernist authors seriously in the first place - how entire segments of the academic world could have so completely taken leave of their senses as to give even one of these imposters an academic post - let alone legions of them spanning several generations.By sheer chance, I recently ran into this comment by Jonathan Swift which seems to have some bearing on the situation:""There are certain common Privileges of a Writer,the Benefit whereof, I hope, there will be no Reason to doubt;Particularly, that where I am not understood, it shall be concluded,that something very useful and profound is coucht underneath.""

I honestly don't understand how some of these ""intellectuals"" were/are taken seriously, Lacan and Baudrillard then, today in the form of Ronell and Zizek. Additionally and above all, the book provides very important lessons and critical analysis of issues regarding epistomology, which I think will make an important read for students of philosophy and social sciences in general. "

27,0312204078,http://goodreads.com/user/show/696973-leila-t,5,"as part of my online FUNDAEC course, i learnt about a hoax that was perpetrated against an American cultural studies journal in 1996. a physicist at the New York University, Alan Sokal, felt that the liberties the academic humanities and social sciences were taking with mathematics, science, scientific methodology, the history of science and reality itself were becoming postmodern parodies of postmodernism. he felt that offering advice, a critique, or a straightforward list of the mathematical and scientific mistakes that these academics were making would be dismissed out of hand; the way Sokal phrases it is: ""The targets of my critique have by now become a self-perpetuating academic subculture that typically ignores (or disdains) reasoned criticism from the outside.""so, feeling ""troubled by an apparent decline in the standards of intellectual rigor in certain precincts of the American academic humanities"", but wondering whether he could offer commentary as a ""mere physicist"" ("" if I find myself unable to make head or tail of jouissance and différance, perhaps that just reflects my own inadequacy""), he devised a little test to measure ""prevailing intellectual standards"": ""I decided to try a modest (though admittedly uncontrolled) experiment: Would a leading North American journal of cultural studies---whose editorial collective includes such luminaries as Fredric Jameson and Andrew Ross---publish an article liberally salted with nonsense if (a) it sounded good and (b) it flattered the editors' ideological preconceptions?""you already know the punchline: the journal, ""Social Text"", did publish the article in a special edition called ""Science Wars"". Sokal's was the only article written by a scientist, and he called it ""Transgressing the Boundaries: Toward a Transformative Hermeneutics of Quantum Gravity"". (yep, you can read it.) the article contained non sequiturs, neologisms, jargon, quotations from inter-disciplinary texts, assertions without argument, and, most mind-numbingly of all, long, convoluted, meaningless sentences. apparently the editors didn't realize it was a parody. here is an excerpt (i've left the footnotes in, because some of the juiciest stuff is there):At about the same time, in the social and psychological sciences Jacques Lacan pointed out the key role played by differential topology: This diagram [the Möbius strip:] can be considered the basis of a sort of essential inscription at the origin, in the knot which constitutes the subject. This goes much further than you may think at first, because you can search for the sort of surface able to receive such inscriptions. You can perhaps see that the sphere, that old symbol for totality, is unsuitable. A torus, a Klein bottle, a cross-cut surface, are able to receive such a cut. And this diversity is very important as it explains many things about the structure of mental disease. If one can symbolize the subject by this fundamental cut, in the same way one can show that a cut on a torus corresponds to the neurotic subject, and on a cross-cut surface to another sort of mental disease.57 58 As Althusser rightly commented, ``Lacan finally gives Freud's thinking the scientific concepts that it requires''.59 More recently, Lacan's topologie du sujet has been applied fruitfully to cinema criticism60 and to the psychoanalysis of AIDS.61 In mathematical terms, Lacan is here pointing out that the first homology group62 of the sphere is trivial, while those of the other surfaces are profound; and this homology is linked with the connectedness or disconnectedness of the surface after one or more cuts.63 Furthermore, as Lacan suspected, there is an intimate connection between the external structure of the physical world and its inner psychological representation qua knot theory: this hypothesis has recently been confirmed by Witten's derivation of knot invariants (in particular the Jones polynomial64) from three-dimensional Chern-Simons quantum field theory.65to read about all the different kinds of nonsense that's in there, you can sift through some of Sokal's papers on this ""affair"", since, of course, it became a big deal not only in academic circles (of both American and Europe) but also in the news. the American public became anxious that their tax dollars were being spent on universities and professors who were teaching their children not to believe in an external world.all of this is background, actually. i read ""Fashionable Nonsense"" by Sokal and Jean Bricmont (first published in French under the title ""Impostures Intellectuelles"") after reading ""The Sokal Hoax"", put together by another cultural studies' journal, ""Lingua Franca"". the first one looks at specific writers in the humanities who are the main offenders when it comes to writing about science without bothering to inform themselves of the basics of what they're talking about. (an example of this kind of writing: ""it now seems appropriate to reconsider the notions of acceleration and deceleration (what physicists call positive and negative speeds)""). the book quotes extensively from Kristeva, Lacan, Deleuze and others---all famous, familiar names to anyone who's done more than a semester of a sociology undergraduate---and points out exact transgressions of logic and outright falsities.my compelling interest in all of this stems from a few things, i worked out. one, i feel woefully undereducated in basic math and technology. i used to feel that this didn't really matter that much, because my interests and strengths lay elsewhere. now, i feel hungry to learn about general relativity and sub-atomic particles, and to make shaun talk to me about unification theory. (or whatever it's called.) an anecdote in ""Fashionable Nonsense"" solidified and gave motivation to this feeling i've had: A good many times I have been present at gatherings of people who, by the standards of the traditional culture, are thought highly educated and who have with considerable gusto been expressing their incredulity at the illiteracy of scientists. Once or twice I have been provoked and have asked the company how many of them could describe the Second Law of Thermodynamics. The response was cold: it was also negative. Yet I was asking something which is about the scientific equivalent of: Have you read a work of Shakespeare's? I now believe that if I had asked an even simpler question -- such as, What do you mean by mass, or acceleration, which is the scientific equivalent of saying, Can you read? -- not more than one in ten of the highly educated would have felt that I was speaking the same language. So the great edifice of modern physics goes up, and the majority of the cleverest people in the western world have about as much insight into it as their neolithic ancestors would have had.15two, i have a moral and intellectual conundrum about the importance of scientific method and the valuing of alternative, especially indigenous or traditional, stories about the world. maybe reading these books has enforced my feeling that they are in competition, which is usually inherent in a discussion that includes a ""variety of truths"". maybe there is not a competition. but what my opinion comes down to is that each culture and people of the world is contributing, and will contribute, to human civilization.three, i studied for three years for an undergraduate degree in the liberal arts. i was mad when i discovered that we were expected to read Heidegger's (incomprehensible) philosophising about Being without reference to his uncompromising Nazism, even after the war when everybody and their heil hitler were revoking allegiance to the regime that---it was being discovered---had perpetrated an unthinkable genocide. and when i say ""without reference"" i mean that not one of our lecturers or tutors mentioned his politics at any point, even when i asked.i was confused when i bush-wacked my way through polysyllabic linguistic contortions of esoteric articulation and realized that these writers were saying they thought that divisions between high and low class (or culture) and disparities between the rich and poor needed to be broken down so that we could have a more egalitarian society.and i was desparate when i tried to cram in knowledge and insight about society, culture, politics, literature, governance, and science from those writers who were the most obtuse, the most verbose, and the most self-involved.not all of the papers that i studied and researched were like the ones Sokal parodies and quotes in his hoax article. and for the most part i learned from and admired my teachers. but in reading these two books i felt vindicated for the questions and feelings i had as a student at university when i decided that there was no benefit in my attempting to understand a passage like "" Instead of a simple ""either/or'' structure, deconstruction attempts to elaborate a discourse that says neither ""either/or'', nor ""both/and'' nor even ""neither/nor'', while at the same time not totally abandoning these logics either.""and that's why i liked these books."

30,0312204078,http://goodreads.com/user/show/14115149-jaclynn,4,"Very good book to read if you want to dissect postmodern arguments. Not accessible for the beginner just being introduced to these concepts, and honestly, I skipped a lot of the writing dealing with advanced mathematics and scientific theory. What I found most useful were the tools to spot the general arguments postmodernist use to confuse, deflect and create nonsense with."
31,0312204078,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5695847-abyy,5,"Sokal and Bricmont launch a devastating critique of the pretentious and obscurantist tendencies of several authors in the pomo canon in this book. Their specific locus of attack is these philosophers' (and I use the term here in a very loose sense) misuse and deliberate abuse of scientific and mathematical concepts as a strategy to embellish and give an aura of credibility to very bad writing. [A caveat: I'm not a philosopher, physicist, mathematician, literary theorist, psychoanalyst or even well acquainted with any of these disciplines so everything I say about this can reasonably be seen as suspect.]Intellectual Impostures was an immensely enjoyable read. It confirmed what I've long suspected about the so-called ""radical"" thought of many pomo writers - that what appears prima facie to be incredibly profound ideas collapse under any sustained rational examination. While Sokal and Bricmont confine themselves to their areas of expertise (physics and mathematics), many of their observations are well taken and apply to the other works and to the other authors who 'do' pomo. As Sokal and Bricmont very ably point out, many of the ideas pomo authors proffer are deliberately written very ambiguously such that they can be read one of two ways - as either trivially true or surprising but false (or a third possibility: hopelessly confused). This book was published a decade ago. I wish I could report that their critiques are now merely of historical interest to a reinvigorated Left - but unfortunately I find their points to be as valid as they were when they were first published. I could go on in this vein for awhile but, to cut my vitriol short, suffice to say I'd strongly recommend to anyone with even a peripheral interest in science, pomo and the relation between them. Intellectual Impostures remains a very timely contribution that serves (hopefully) as a remedy for a Left that has increasingly become politically regressive, intellectually dishonest and, perhaps worst of all, not even wrong."
32,0312204078,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5805110-sweta-gupta,2,"I am in a dilemma in writing a review for this book. It inspired two extreme reactions. On one hand, I found the observations in the book to be hilarious and very well pointed out. On the other hand, I struggled through the 211 pages because the writing style was so dry and non-engaging and consisted largely of what the authors term “fashionable nonsense”: difficult language that sounds extremely profound and complex, but is in fact, meaningless. This book came as a result of Alan Sokal’s hoax, a nonsensical article that he submitted to an American culture studies journal, which was hailed by postmodernists. Of course, Sokal revealed the hoax and the praise of the postmodernists that had come in before the revelation clearly proved that the postmodernists really did not understand even their contemporaries but hailed each others’ work anyway. The book is all about deliberately obscure language and created confusion for the purpose of sounding profound. Needless to say, the writers have received a fair amount of criticism as well.Approximately half (or perhaps a bit more) of the book consists of long passages from the very works the authors are critiquing (ripping apart). And as the authors show in their commentary, those passages are mostly indecipherable gibberish. Reading those puts a serious strain on your mental capacities. I took more than a week to finish this 210 page book, and it was just a very, very painstaking effort.This book requires a fair understanding of conceptual physics and mathematics to understand that the passages reproduced are actually incomprehensible. I would not recommend it to someone who doesn’t have a decent understanding of those. In the epilogue, the authors lay out some broad lessons, which are useful for anyone: know what you are talking about instead of creating ambiguities by using flowery language to conceal your lack of understanding, not all that is obscure is necessarily profound and several others."
33,0312204078,http://goodreads.com/user/show/20247815-stephen,5,"Excellent discussion of the specific instances of postmodern writers in already-nebulous ""critical"" disciplines invoking scientific and mathematical concepts to equivocate (or spew outright gibberish!) under the guise of borrowing credence and rigor. Entertainingly written with a mind toward parsimony and specificity of argument that reflects the authors' backgrounds in scientific methodology without robbing the text of levity or accessibility. The epilogue is veers into op-ed territory - but in a good way: the authors emphasize the importance of precise, contextual, and intellectually honest articulation not only in academia, but as a discursive basis for broader social and intellectual projects that shape the course of society. A powerful read for anyone passionate about the sciences and chagrined by the creeping vacuity of the pseudo-intellectualism that infests the postmodern segment of the academy."
34,0312204078,http://goodreads.com/user/show/279997-llew,4,"By themselves, the quotes used in this book are some of the finest examples of academic horseshit one might ever hope to come across. I still love a good meandering philosophy tome, but there is something highly important about what Sokal and company are doing here. This idea that, at a certain point, abusing science and math to continue your ideas is dumbing down the populace. That relativism may be used for cultural anthropology, but it needs to be abandoned when used in scientific understanding. There's some leeway given to Baudrillard who is given his own chapter, yet I still appreciate, as i think people understand that he's being ridiculous and not necessarily putting across formal theses. Lacan on the other hand, where he's giving a formal argument based on flawed understanding of well-known scientific ideas, comes across as just sad. Sokal knows his science, and they give good counter-proof that, no Quantum Relativity of the mind doesn't make sense and that's not how topology works, although the book fails when they try to provide a proper philosophy of science and epistemology. They give some time try to argue down questions like, ""how do we know this is reality"", and it meanders like the texts they are critiquing. Still, very essential that they wrote this. "
35,0312204078,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1841544-chris,3,"On display is lots of nonsense written in the postmodern tradition, specifically by philosophers that can basically be classified as epistemic relativists. In the first several chapters, the responses by the authors to absurd passages from Lacan and Kristeva are quite detailed. As the book goes on, punctuated by several intermezzo chapters which give some background, much of the commentary becomes lazy. The authors begin to appeal to the self-evidence of the ridiculousness on display.Occasionally the authors' criticism seems like nitpicking, and I can't shake the feeling that the book would have benefitted from some back and forth, offering at least some defense of selected passages before a complete dismantling of the postmodern arguments. Don't get me wrong, I would NEVER defend any of the intellectual traditions the book lampoons. But you know the people that wrote these passages (or their disciples) would have responses to the obvious technical errors which the book frequently points out pepper their arguments. No doubt that these responses would be just as incomprehensible as the original arguments, buttressing the notion that they are just masters of manipulating erudite language and peddling pretentiousness.A fun read for the quote mining, but it probably could have been done better."
36,0312204078,http://goodreads.com/user/show/12638036-haaris-mateen,4,"Sokal and Bricmont bring balance to the Force. The overkill of relativism and scientism that had infected most of the social sciences and humanities couldn't have done with a better beneficial shock. Alas, the currents exposed still exist in the discourse of the Left, and it is perhaps one of the biggest flaws that exist in the battle against the poisonous populism insidiously rising the world over. The rise of the Post Truth world cannot be blamed solely on the ""other side"". This book (now almost twenty years old) reminds us of the pitfalls of choosing radical skepticism, a way of thought that isolates itself from reality and which allows dangerous deliverers to thrive; and a line of thinking which only university grads are equipped to even access (though not with any benefit to the world)."
37,0312204078,http://goodreads.com/user/show/44290999-jjonas,2,"2.5 stars.In the 'Afterword' to the original ""Sokal affair"" paper (which is the last item in this book), Sokal quotes C. P. Snow's view in Two cultures:""A good many times I have been present at gatherings of people who, by the standars of the traditional culture, are thought highly educated and who have with considerable gusto been expressing their incredulity at the illiteracy of scientists. Once or twice I have been provoked and have asked the company how many of them could describe the Second Law of Thermodynamics. The response was cold: it was also negative. Yet I was asking something which is about the scientific equivalent of: Have you read a work of Shakespeare's? [...] [T]he great edifice of modern physics goes up, and the majority of the cleverest people in the western world have about as much insight into it as their neolithic ancestors would have had."" (p. 276-277)Sokal notes:""One significant change has taken place since C. P. Snow's time: while humanist intellectuals' ignorance about (for example) mass and acceleration remains substantially unchanged, nowadays a significant minority of humanist intellectuals feels entitled to pontificate on these subjects in spite of their ignorance"" (p. 277).I take this to be the original motivation for writing the ""Sokal hoax paper"" and this book. And Sokal and Bricmont do make a good point about posturing intellectuals using frivolous analogies in their philosophy etc. texts to mathematics and physics which said authors don't really understand — and even if they did, do they really expect their likely readership to understand them without explicit clarification about why the chosen analogy is useful. I believe S & B demonstrate this satisfactorily and to good effect.(It should be noted in passing that it's not only some humanists and social scientists who are guilty of ignorance of other fields; e.g. someone like Steven Pinker has strayed ever further from his homebase in psychology and the study of language and written broad-stroke works with sweeping conclusions about history, liberalism etc. where he's not really the expert. Or consider economists, who get to be interviewed about politics, foreign relations, environmental issues etc., as if they've become some kind of universal intellectuals.)However, S & B are not on equally strong ground when they declare the quoted passages — which sure do look embarrassing — simply nonsense. I would agree they're nonsense as far as the language lifted from natural science and mathematics is concerned, but I think S & B might be guilty of somewhat comparable arrogance as their targets by proclaiming the quotes simply nonsensical, meaningless etc. — in all respects, not just in terms of the physics terminology etc.I think many people who praise this book are a bit too eager to strike at pomos with whatever they've got (something that I'm not totally unsympathetic towards, by the way) and disregard this side of the work. In fact, some seem to see the book (including people who probably haven't read it) as a wholesale condemnation of, if not a fatal blow to, postmodernism, which however is something that the authors don't even claim to do. Instead they've set themselves a far narrower task: to call out reckless use of concepts lifted from physics etc. with the intention of lending philosophical texts some rigour, respectability or whatever. That's a far cry from ""destroying postmodernism"" or whatever.Now, it does seem obvious to me that the ""pomo"" authors in questions are guilty of the most blatant kind of posturing, obfuscation and pretense one can imagine, and that stripped of the verbiage, what they have to say would turn out to be much less impressive than it appears (though not necessarily banal). So overall, I'm partial to what S & B are doing, for like them I'm a believer in objective physical reality independent of human (or other) consciousness, while — again, like them — not denying at all the sense in the moderate version of ""social construction of reality"" as a corrective to what S & B call ""naive modernism"" (p. 183).But I think S & B are wrong if they expect they can (or should) understand philosophical etc. texts as easily as if they were reading the newspaper. Personally I'm inclined to think that what Lacan, Kristeva etc. have to say is much more ordinary than it would appear at first sight (and much of it nonsense to boot), but I don't believe that S & B are significantly more qualified to make that call than I am. Our difference is that I didn't (and wouldn't) write a book about it.The chapters that picked apart scienced up pomo quotes were the least fun to read, and unfortunately that's more than half of the book. No doubt the chapters were necessary to drive the main point home, but reading it was hard work and the content was repetitive, and I confess I didn't read much of the quoted materials (some of the quotes were several pages long). In contrast, the ""intermezzo chapters"" that dealt with more general questions of philosophy of science and relativism were the most useful ones to me.The book ends with the original ""Sokal affair"" article and a chapter which explains what was fishy about it. While I believe that Social Text is to blame for publishing stuff the subject matter of which they didn't understand, I'm also somewhat sympathetic towards the argument that in a journal like Social Text it's not necessarily the editors' duty to weed out wild and unconventional ideas but instead let the readership judge for themselves whether (some of) the ideas in some article merit any attention."

40,0312204078,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1785447-david-glenn-dixon,4,"Washington City PaperArts & Entertainment : Book ReviewLiberté, Egalité, ObscuritéBy Glenn Dixon • March 12, 1999""If there's no math in it, it isn't science."" Thus went the rejoinder propellerheads offered religious enthusiasts when, in the '80s, hinterland zealots attempted to get Genesis taught in public schools under the rubric of ""creation science."" But what of the inverse? If there is math in it, is science an inevitability? As any kid who sat through the first month of Mr. Glahn's 9th-grade geometry class can tell you, the second statement doesn't necessarily follow from the first.Over the past 30 years or so, an entire generation of psychoanalysts, literary theorists, cult-studs, and other postmodern types has made hay by virtue of the fact that its readers lack the benefit of my math teacher's wisdom. By the mid-'90s the problem had gotten far enough out of hand that New York University physics prof Alan Sokal felt compelled to cook up a heady stew of anti-scientific pigheadedness and pseudotechnical misprision, season it liberally with quotes from such theoretical leading lights as Jacques Lacan, Gilles Deleuze and Félix Guattari, and Luce Irigaray, and set the steaming dish down in front of the editors of the Duke University Press cultural-studies journal ""Social Text""—who promptly served it up in their Spring/Summer 1996 issue.Sokal then outed himself, exposing his parody in an article rejected by ""Social Text,"" which judged the correction to the published goof beneath its ""intellectual standards."" ""Dissent"" and ""Philosophy and Literature"" picked up the second piece, but by the time they hit the stacks the popular press had already had a field day with Sokal's prank.Needless to say, ""Social Text"" editors Andrew Ross and Stanley Aronowitz weren't amused. Nor were the hordes of tenured radicals who had built their careers on what had been exposed as institutionally codified idiocy. They counterattacked, and now Sokal has teamed up with Belgium-based theoretical physicist Jean Bricmont (it helps to have a Francophone on your side in such matters) to respond with a book-length popular treatment of postmodern ideological excess and methodological madness.Chapter by chapter, Sokal and Bricmont calmly, meticulously tear new assholes for Lacan, Deleuze and Guattari, Irigaray, Julia Kristeva, Bruno Latour, Jean Baudrillard, and Paul Virilio. The physicists aren't staging some sort of anti-theoretical pogrom; they're just standing up for rationality. Jacques Derrida keeps his hands off science; Sokal and Bricmont keep their hands off Derrida. They refuse even to judge the theorists' overall programs, limiting their criticisms to their areas of expertise and suggesting that their targets could have benefited from similar circumspection.What they reveal is scandalous. Lacan indulges a fondness for topology, which he barely understands, and suffers a penchant for arbitrary metaphors, which he often refuses to acknowledge as anything other than literal truths. Kristeva does the same with set theory. Virilio misunderstands concepts that are covered in the first week of 11th-grade physics. Almost everybody jumps from one discipline to another with the mindless alacrity of a puppy visiting an unexplored row of lampposts.When they aren't picking apart the efforts of individual writers, Sokal and Bricmont go after entire subfields of bad thinking that have found widespread acceptance among intellectual poseurs. Between-chapters ""intermezzos"" are devoted to ""Epistemic Relativism in the Philosophy of Science"" (i.e., the notion that verifiable physical truth exists only as a cultural ""myth""), ""Chaos Theory and 'Postmodern Science'"" (in which precisely defined scientific notions about predictability and nonlinearity are confounded with their squirrelly linguistic kin), and the abuse of Gödel's theorem and set theory (where very specific mathematical results are generalized to shed light on areas to which they have no connection whatsoever).The literary drawbacks of an intensive debunking of heaps of nonsensical verbosity are immediately obvious. Heedless of the dictates of pleasure or readability, Sokal and Bricmont have selflessly, mercilessly larded their work with extensive quotes from their primary sources. It may be necessary, but the authors' assiduousness does not make for the ""thoroughly hilarious romp through the postmodernist academy"" promised by Barbara Ehrenreich's jacket blurb.There is no romping to speak of. There is true hilarity, but it is on the whole confined to the chapter concerning Irigaray's feminist critique of science. Even readers who have already made their minds up about Lacan and his ilk owe themselves a few minutes at the bookstore discovering such howlers as:""Is E=Mc2 a sexed equation? Perhaps it is. Let us make the hypothesis that it is insofar as it privileges the speed of light over other speeds that are vitally necessary to us. What seems to me to indicate the possibly sexed nature of the equation is not directly its uses by nuclear weapons, rather it is having privileged what goes the fastest...""What makes Irigaray so funny is that she exposes herself with clear writing. Her thinking may be utter hogwash, but her sentences are generally parsable. This is not commonly the case among her peers. Any educated reader who has attempted to skim a dense scientific work he knows he could understand given the time will recognize the appeal of scientific-sounding obfuscation to the nontechnical author. If you aren't proceeding through an equation term by term, your eyes simply bounce off it; its meaning is held in reserve until you take the time to extract it. Nontechnical readers as a rule can't distinguish between meaningful equations and sheer poppycock; their eyes bounce off both. Putting in the time to extract the meaning isn't an option open to them. An impenetrable equation signals erudition even if it has none to offer. And the same is true of a sentence composed of technical gibberish.Sokal and Bricmont are aware of the limits of the scientific purview, as they now stand, and acknowledge the difference between science and everything else. What the authors don't state explicitly (and perhaps do not believe) is that the scientific mind, which prefers precision to poetry, single meanings to double ones, and trudges to leaps, is fundamentally different from the nonscientific one, and that many a pomo misstep has been inspired by a refusal to accept this fact.It's natural to crave science's strengths and to shun its weaknesses; sadly, they come as a matched set. The authority and verifiability of the natural sciences are formidable, but science has been most successful with the simplest, most precisely defined problems. It's no accident that ""Fashionable Nonsense"" was penned by physicists. Physics is the hardest of the sciences; its successful theories have been established with greater mathematical precision than have concepts in any other field of endeavor. But physics works best with things that matter least to outsiders—the arcana of quantum mechanics, for example. Once sucked in by the elegant system presented in freshman physics classes, who isn't at least a little bit disappointed to find that nothing really works as cleanly as it does in its classical estimation? (Quantum mechanics may reveal a physical universe stranger than we could possibly have imagined, but it left this former physics student, at least, pining for the world of Newton. Since the 17th century is unlikely ever again to represent the cutting edge of scientific knowledge, I threw over science for art, dropping out of grad school after three semesters and trading a handful of correct answers for a wealth of pretty good ones.)The trouble with working among what my high school physics teacher called the ""fuzzies"" is that you may feel as if you are right, but you can never prove it. If the fuzzies in question are sociologists, psychologists, linguists, or other quasi-scientists, the temptation will be strong to hijack the certitude of hard science to serve ideas you wish you could be sure about. Although it may be tempting to ascribe malice or lunacy to traffickers in pseudoscience, their quest, however misguided, is really quite poignant. They crave adulation for discovering something demonstrably true about things that, at least when they idealistically set out on their intellectual journeys, were serious ""real-world"" problems.But, as Batman whispered to Lacan, when the theorist lost his grip and slipped away into the bottomless maelstrom of text: ""Poor, deluded child.""Sokal and Bricmont don't abandon all hope for a cross-fertilization of ideas, but I'm not sure that scientists and non-scientists really can talk to each other about the things that really matter to them. And I don't think such a development, because it forces a bit of humility on us, is all bad. Knowledge has fragmented to the point that a degree of specialization is necessary. I'm a generalist at heart, and it pains me to say it, but whenever someone today is called a ""Renaissance man,"" you can bet that the speaker holds a grossly inflated opinion of that person's intellect. The world has simply gotten too big for any one person to get his mind around it. It's been said that Coleridge was the last person to know everything, but I wonder if even he wasn't born too late.Sokal and Bricmont know the genie isn't going back into the bottle, and they dispassionately deliver a corrective to innocents (even belligerent innocents) who think they can sidestep the problem either by usurping the language of science or, having given up on certainty, by discounting science altogether. Tough-minded to a fault, the physicists not only establish the circumstances under which no reasonable interdisciplinary discussion can occur, they also tell us when nonscientists shouldn't be talking at all.

42,0312204078,http://goodreads.com/user/show/38719275-dale-grauman,3,"Read the introduction, both ""intermezzos,"" and the epilogue. These portions lay out good, popular-level critiques of radical skepticism and postmodern mumbo-jumbo. You can skip or skim the rest, which is comprised mostly of long quotations from academic ""theorists"" (i.e., mid-20th-century French philosophers or their disciples) alongside the author's commentary. All of these sections can be summarized as follows:French Academic: [Writes something entirely incomprehensible.]Sokal and Bricmont: ""The preceding passage was entirely incomprehensible. As professional scientists and mathematicians, we assure you that all references to science and mathematics are bogus.""Sometimes they take the time to explain the scientific or mathematical concepts in layman's terms so that readers can understand their critiques more deeply. Often, they do not. If you have already encountered ""theory""(in this particular sense of that term) and are perceptive (cynical?) enough to have concluded that it's willfully obscure, you won't get much out of reading these chapters.On a personal note, the authors made a couple claims that I had arrived at independently, and it was gratifying to see these notions in print:(1) ""Theory"" looks an awful lot like mysticism, and it may make sense to analyze it as a religious movement. (Page 37; they are especially referring to Lacan, here.)(2) Our inability to refute a position fully doesn't mean we have any reason to accept that position. (Page 54; they are especially referring to solipsism.)"
43,0312204078,http://goodreads.com/user/show/10174911-syed-ashrafulla,3,"The premise of the book is very sound. The authors are going after the improper use of fundamental mathematics and physics by philosophers who have run out of ways to confuse readers. Through a myriad of examples, the authors continually discredit the arguments given by postmodernists that try to employ modern physics. Those attacks are very solid. Postmodernists do misunderstand the link between science and philosophy. Sociologists do try to sweep scientific rigor under the rug when convenient.My problem with the book is its style. In an attempt to fortify the arguments against the lawyer-like retorts of the human sciences, they post far too much context. As a result I'm reading too much garbage. I prefer terser quotations with pointed rebuttals. I don't like the pasting of four paragraphs followed by a three line critique. Why not just break it up? Are you worried that the defenders will use the blunt critique of context? That critique is generally stupid anyway, but the authors spent a significant part of the book trying to answer that critique. People like me who don't have a dog in the fight then have to slog through terrible sentence after terrible sentence by philosophers who aim to confuse. Thanks, I thought we were going to avoid that.It's still an ok book. It's probably required reading for anyone in grad school. It's just not that pleasant or coherent a book to read."

I went in expecting more of a general-audience nonfiction work that aims to help lay-persons who are affected by the nonsense peddled by pseudo-mystics like Deepak Chopra whose particular brand of bullshit is hidden under a shiny candy coating of what appears to be a scientific basis.What this actually is reads much more like a scientific journal article. There is a very familiar cadence reminiscent of astrophysics papers I used to read regularly, and it has that exceptionally dry, ordered formatting that is desirable in objective scientific work.This was very enlightening, and it helped a great deal that I was once obsessed with post-modern philosophy and was able to keep up (though it underscores my decision to abandon that particular hobby long ago).If you are already well-versed in philosophical formalism, go for it, though don't expect a particular engaging read even then. It is what it is, there's no fluff. If you follow my reviews and updates, you know how quickly I read; this took me almost a week to get through, which about sums it up.It did work fantastically as a sleep aid on some nights where I found myself drifting off a full hour or more ahead of when I usually hit the wall.If you aren't into dry philosophy and formal logic, then this is definitely a hard pass for you."

I think I never recovered from the traumatic experience of reading the line: ""modern war takes place in Non-Euclidean Space"", the great Baudrillardian coinage.I would have said this book has officially run its course, but certain factions of the feminist movement who religiously hew to the ideas of Luce Irigaray restrain me from doing so. As much as I would like to believe otherwise, ideas such as ""modern science is a male construct"" or ""women are bullied out of a career in the natural sciences"" are still perniciously widespread. Thankfully, postmodernism as a philosophical practice has fallen out of favor in the academia. But the ideas put forth in the early 70s have percolated to the forefront of the public consciousness in the 2010s decade. I wish these ideas would eventually wither away. However, there is no such sign on the horizon. Keeping that in mind, I would say this book still retains its necessity. If not the whole thing, read at least a few chapters. These postmodern ideas are so freaking amusing; when they are not downright petrifying. For example, you can always find comic relief in feminist Julia Kristeva's endeavors to explain poetic language in terms of set theory."
46,0312204078,http://goodreads.com/user/show/44761402-jens,4,"There's a youtube clip in which John Searle talks to Foucault about why his writing is so atrocious, even though he can convey his reasonable ideas well in speech. Foucault answers that in France, in order to be taken seriously as an intellectual, at least 10% of what you write should be incomprehensible. Otherwise people just won't think it's ""deep"" or sophisticated. That's probably the biggest part of the problem with broadly postmodern writers, and 10% is a very conservative estimate in this case. Still, some of the philosophers discussed in this book have some genuinely interesting ideas (though not unequivocally true ones). In particular, I think Latour, Deleuze, and Derrida (not covered) have some valuable insights to contribute (though, again, I don't always agree with them, particularly in the case of Derrida). It is just too bad that they think they can score intellectual points in their writings by using scientific terms they don't understand. On the other hand, authors such as Lacan and Kristeva are completely vacuous, while Irigaray is just too ridiculous to be taken seriously. Also, relativism is dumb. No discourse of no length will ever make that a viable way out of a philosophical problem."

It's good to see scientists such as Sokal exposing this 'fashionable nonsense' for what it really is. I'm saddened to say, however, that even 22 years after the publication of his parody 'Transgressing the Boundaries,' we still see the same arguments and the same fashionable nonsense repeated today. What we need is to practice critical thinking, and really understand what it is we're reading and what we're talking about. The subchapter 'For a Dialogue Between the Two Cultures' in the epilogue, it is given some hints on how we are to do this, and is relevant as much now as it was then. The text was mainly structured to illustrate seperate persons who were obscuring their field of study, but I found the intermezzo chapters to be a lot more enlightening. The intermezzo parts and the epilogue were by far my favorite parts, but of course it was important to see how absurd certain individuals on the Left (especially in France) has written and tangled with information in desperate attempts to put their own names in their history books by achieving the paradigm shift of Thomas Kuhn."

FN aims specifically at the abuse of science by Continental theorists, and in so doing, is successful. In the introduction, it is said that they do not make judgments about the whole of anyone's work, only the misappropriations of science by the selected writers. And I applaud this. As for the rest of what these theorists have to say, they aren't wholly a waste of time. Mileage may vary. I find D&G's work stimulating for artists and, for example, their critique of capitalism out of Marx's Fragment on Machines is insightful, and unlike someone below/above, no, Marx is not irrelevant. Anyway, Sokol's points are spot-on and sorely needed. There's no doubt that the Continentals were often obtuse and obscurantist. It simply cannot be denied. But each one of the writers critiqued offer interesting insights and nuanced views on the world and its problems...as long as they spare us their misunderstanding of science. When they abuse that, it's natural that people will be skeptical of the rest of their work. Like David Foster Wallace, who misunderstood infinity, it's not fair to pan the remainder of the work only because of this. But it is a thorn in our sides. "

61,0312204078,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5695847-abyy,5,"Sokal and Bricmont launch a devastating critique of the pretentious and obscurantist tendencies of several authors in the pomo canon in this book. Their specific locus of attack is these philosophers' (and I use the term here in a very loose sense) misuse and deliberate abuse of scientific and mathematical concepts as a strategy to embellish and give an aura of credibility to very bad writing. [A caveat: I'm not a philosopher, physicist, mathematician, literary theorist, psychoanalyst or even well acquainted with any of these disciplines so everything I say about this can reasonably be seen as suspect.]Intellectual Impostures was an immensely enjoyable read. It confirmed what I've long suspected about the so-called ""radical"" thought of many pomo writers - that what appears prima facie to be incredibly profound ideas collapse under any sustained rational examination. While Sokal and Bricmont confine themselves to their areas of expertise (physics and mathematics), many of their observations are well taken and apply to the other works and to the other authors who 'do' pomo. As Sokal and Bricmont very ably point out, many of the ideas pomo authors proffer are deliberately written very ambiguously such that they can be read one of two ways - as either trivially true or surprising but false (or a third possibility: hopelessly confused). This book was published a decade ago. I wish I could report that their critiques are now merely of historical interest to a reinvigorated Left - but unfortunately I find their points to be as valid as they were when they were first published. I could go on in this vein for awhile but, to cut my vitriol short, suffice to say I'd strongly recommend to anyone with even a peripheral interest in science, pomo and the relation between them. Intellectual Impostures remains a very timely contribution that serves (hopefully) as a remedy for a Left that has increasingly become politically regressive, intellectually dishonest and, perhaps worst of all, not even wrong."
62,0312204078,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5805110-sweta-gupta,2,"I am in a dilemma in writing a review for this book. It inspired two extreme reactions. On one hand, I found the observations in the book to be hilarious and very well pointed out. On the other hand, I struggled through the 211 pages because the writing style was so dry and non-engaging and consisted largely of what the authors term “fashionable nonsense”: difficult language that sounds extremely profound and complex, but is in fact, meaningless. This book came as a result of Alan Sokal’s hoax, a nonsensical article that he submitted to an American culture studies journal, which was hailed by postmodernists. Of course, Sokal revealed the hoax and the praise of the postmodernists that had come in before the revelation clearly proved that the postmodernists really did not understand even their contemporaries but hailed each others’ work anyway. The book is all about deliberately obscure language and created confusion for the purpose of sounding profound. Needless to say, the writers have received a fair amount of criticism as well.Approximately half (or perhaps a bit more) of the book consists of long passages from the very works the authors are critiquing (ripping apart). And as the authors show in their commentary, those passages are mostly indecipherable gibberish. Reading those puts a serious strain on your mental capacities. I took more than a week to finish this 210 page book, and it was just a very, very painstaking effort.This book requires a fair understanding of conceptual physics and mathematics to understand that the passages reproduced are actually incomprehensible. I would not recommend it to someone who doesn’t have a decent understanding of those. In the epilogue, the authors lay out some broad lessons, which are useful for anyone: know what you are talking about instead of creating ambiguities by using flowery language to conceal your lack of understanding, not all that is obscure is necessarily profound and several others."
63,0312204078,http://goodreads.com/user/show/20247815-stephen,5,"Excellent discussion of the specific instances of postmodern writers in already-nebulous ""critical"" disciplines invoking scientific and mathematical concepts to equivocate (or spew outright gibberish!) under the guise of borrowing credence and rigor. Entertainingly written with a mind toward parsimony and specificity of argument that reflects the authors' backgrounds in scientific methodology without robbing the text of levity or accessibility. The epilogue is veers into op-ed territory - but in a good way: the authors emphasize the importance of precise, contextual, and intellectually honest articulation not only in academia, but as a discursive basis for broader social and intellectual projects that shape the course of society. A powerful read for anyone passionate about the sciences and chagrined by the creeping vacuity of the pseudo-intellectualism that infests the postmodern segment of the academy."
64,0312204078,http://goodreads.com/user/show/279997-llew,4,"By themselves, the quotes used in this book are some of the finest examples of academic horseshit one might ever hope to come across. I still love a good meandering philosophy tome, but there is something highly important about what Sokal and company are doing here. This idea that, at a certain point, abusing science and math to continue your ideas is dumbing down the populace. That relativism may be used for cultural anthropology, but it needs to be abandoned when used in scientific understanding. There's some leeway given to Baudrillard who is given his own chapter, yet I still appreciate, as i think people understand that he's being ridiculous and not necessarily putting across formal theses. Lacan on the other hand, where he's giving a formal argument based on flawed understanding of well-known scientific ideas, comes across as just sad. Sokal knows his science, and they give good counter-proof that, no Quantum Relativity of the mind doesn't make sense and that's not how topology works, although the book fails when they try to provide a proper philosophy of science and epistemology. They give some time try to argue down questions like, ""how do we know this is reality"", and it meanders like the texts they are critiquing. Still, very essential that they wrote this. "
65,0312204078,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1841544-chris,3,"On display is lots of nonsense written in the postmodern tradition, specifically by philosophers that can basically be classified as epistemic relativists. In the first several chapters, the responses by the authors to absurd passages from Lacan and Kristeva are quite detailed. As the book goes on, punctuated by several intermezzo chapters which give some background, much of the commentary becomes lazy. The authors begin to appeal to the self-evidence of the ridiculousness on display.Occasionally the authors' criticism seems like nitpicking, and I can't shake the feeling that the book would have benefitted from some back and forth, offering at least some defense of selected passages before a complete dismantling of the postmodern arguments. Don't get me wrong, I would NEVER defend any of the intellectual traditions the book lampoons. But you know the people that wrote these passages (or their disciples) would have responses to the obvious technical errors which the book frequently points out pepper their arguments. No doubt that these responses would be just as incomprehensible as the original arguments, buttressing the notion that they are just masters of manipulating erudite language and peddling pretentiousness.A fun read for the quote mining, but it probably could have been done better."
66,0312204078,http://goodreads.com/user/show/12638036-haaris-mateen,4,"Sokal and Bricmont bring balance to the Force. The overkill of relativism and scientism that had infected most of the social sciences and humanities couldn't have done with a better beneficial shock. Alas, the currents exposed still exist in the discourse of the Left, and it is perhaps one of the biggest flaws that exist in the battle against the poisonous populism insidiously rising the world over. The rise of the Post Truth world cannot be blamed solely on the ""other side"". This book (now almost twenty years old) reminds us of the pitfalls of choosing radical skepticism, a way of thought that isolates itself from reality and which allows dangerous deliverers to thrive; and a line of thinking which only university grads are equipped to even access (though not with any benefit to the world)."
67,0312204078,http://goodreads.com/user/show/44290999-jjonas,2,"2.5 stars.In the 'Afterword' to the original ""Sokal affair"" paper (which is the last item in this book), Sokal quotes C. P. Snow's view in Two cultures:""A good many times I have been present at gatherings of people who, by the standars of the traditional culture, are thought highly educated and who have with considerable gusto been expressing their incredulity at the illiteracy of scientists. Once or twice I have been provoked and have asked the company how many of them could describe the Second Law of Thermodynamics. The response was cold: it was also negative. Yet I was asking something which is about the scientific equivalent of: Have you read a work of Shakespeare's? [...] [T]he great edifice of modern physics goes up, and the majority of the cleverest people in the western world have about as much insight into it as their neolithic ancestors would have had."" (p. 276-277)Sokal notes:""One significant change has taken place since C. P. Snow's time: while humanist intellectuals' ignorance about (for example) mass and acceleration remains substantially unchanged, nowadays a significant minority of humanist intellectuals feels entitled to pontificate on these subjects in spite of their ignorance"" (p. 277).I take this to be the original motivation for writing the ""Sokal hoax paper"" and this book. And Sokal and Bricmont do make a good point about posturing intellectuals using frivolous analogies in their philosophy etc. texts to mathematics and physics which said authors don't really understand — and even if they did, do they really expect their likely readership to understand them without explicit clarification about why the chosen analogy is useful. I believe S & B demonstrate this satisfactorily and to good effect.(It should be noted in passing that it's not only some humanists and social scientists who are guilty of ignorance of other fields; e.g. someone like Steven Pinker has strayed ever further from his homebase in psychology and the study of language and written broad-stroke works with sweeping conclusions about history, liberalism etc. where he's not really the expert. Or consider economists, who get to be interviewed about politics, foreign relations, environmental issues etc., as if they've become some kind of universal intellectuals.)However, S & B are not on equally strong ground when they declare the quoted passages — which sure do look embarrassing — simply nonsense. I would agree they're nonsense as far as the language lifted from natural science and mathematics is concerned, but I think S & B might be guilty of somewhat comparable arrogance as their targets by proclaiming the quotes simply nonsensical, meaningless etc. — in all respects, not just in terms of the physics terminology etc.I think many people who praise this book are a bit too eager to strike at pomos with whatever they've got (something that I'm not totally unsympathetic towards, by the way) and disregard this side of the work. In fact, some seem to see the book (including people who probably haven't read it) as a wholesale condemnation of, if not a fatal blow to, postmodernism, which however is something that the authors don't even claim to do. Instead they've set themselves a far narrower task: to call out reckless use of concepts lifted from physics etc. with the intention of lending philosophical texts some rigour, respectability or whatever. That's a far cry from ""destroying postmodernism"" or whatever.Now, it does seem obvious to me that the ""pomo"" authors in questions are guilty of the most blatant kind of posturing, obfuscation and pretense one can imagine, and that stripped of the verbiage, what they have to say would turn out to be much less impressive than it appears (though not necessarily banal). So overall, I'm partial to what S & B are doing, for like them I'm a believer in objective physical reality independent of human (or other) consciousness, while — again, like them — not denying at all the sense in the moderate version of ""social construction of reality"" as a corrective to what S & B call ""naive modernism"" (p. 183).But I think S & B are wrong if they expect they can (or should) understand philosophical etc. texts as easily as if they were reading the newspaper. Personally I'm inclined to think that what Lacan, Kristeva etc. have to say is much more ordinary than it would appear at first sight (and much of it nonsense to boot), but I don't believe that S & B are significantly more qualified to make that call than I am. Our difference is that I didn't (and wouldn't) write a book about it.The chapters that picked apart scienced up pomo quotes were the least fun to read, and unfortunately that's more than half of the book. No doubt the chapters were necessary to drive the main point home, but reading it was hard work and the content was repetitive, and I confess I didn't read much of the quoted materials (some of the quotes were several pages long). In contrast, the ""intermezzo chapters"" that dealt with more general questions of philosophy of science and relativism were the most useful ones to me.The book ends with the original ""Sokal affair"" article and a chapter which explains what was fishy about it. While I believe that Social Text is to blame for publishing stuff the subject matter of which they didn't understand, I'm also somewhat sympathetic towards the argument that in a journal like Social Text it's not necessarily the editors' duty to weed out wild and unconventional ideas but instead let the readership judge for themselves whether (some of) the ideas in some article merit any attention."

70,0312204078,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1785447-david-glenn-dixon,4,"Washington City PaperArts & Entertainment : Book ReviewLiberté, Egalité, ObscuritéBy Glenn Dixon • March 12, 1999""If there's no math in it, it isn't science."" Thus went the rejoinder propellerheads offered religious enthusiasts when, in the '80s, hinterland zealots attempted to get Genesis taught in public schools under the rubric of ""creation science."" But what of the inverse? If there is math in it, is science an inevitability? As any kid who sat through the first month of Mr. Glahn's 9th-grade geometry class can tell you, the second statement doesn't necessarily follow from the first.Over the past 30 years or so, an entire generation of psychoanalysts, literary theorists, cult-studs, and other postmodern types has made hay by virtue of the fact that its readers lack the benefit of my math teacher's wisdom. By the mid-'90s the problem had gotten far enough out of hand that New York University physics prof Alan Sokal felt compelled to cook up a heady stew of anti-scientific pigheadedness and pseudotechnical misprision, season it liberally with quotes from such theoretical leading lights as Jacques Lacan, Gilles Deleuze and Félix Guattari, and Luce Irigaray, and set the steaming dish down in front of the editors of the Duke University Press cultural-studies journal ""Social Text""—who promptly served it up in their Spring/Summer 1996 issue.Sokal then outed himself, exposing his parody in an article rejected by ""Social Text,"" which judged the correction to the published goof beneath its ""intellectual standards."" ""Dissent"" and ""Philosophy and Literature"" picked up the second piece, but by the time they hit the stacks the popular press had already had a field day with Sokal's prank.Needless to say, ""Social Text"" editors Andrew Ross and Stanley Aronowitz weren't amused. Nor were the hordes of tenured radicals who had built their careers on what had been exposed as institutionally codified idiocy. They counterattacked, and now Sokal has teamed up with Belgium-based theoretical physicist Jean Bricmont (it helps to have a Francophone on your side in such matters) to respond with a book-length popular treatment of postmodern ideological excess and methodological madness.Chapter by chapter, Sokal and Bricmont calmly, meticulously tear new assholes for Lacan, Deleuze and Guattari, Irigaray, Julia Kristeva, Bruno Latour, Jean Baudrillard, and Paul Virilio. The physicists aren't staging some sort of anti-theoretical pogrom; they're just standing up for rationality. Jacques Derrida keeps his hands off science; Sokal and Bricmont keep their hands off Derrida. They refuse even to judge the theorists' overall programs, limiting their criticisms to their areas of expertise and suggesting that their targets could have benefited from similar circumspection.What they reveal is scandalous. Lacan indulges a fondness for topology, which he barely understands, and suffers a penchant for arbitrary metaphors, which he often refuses to acknowledge as anything other than literal truths. Kristeva does the same with set theory. Virilio misunderstands concepts that are covered in the first week of 11th-grade physics. Almost everybody jumps from one discipline to another with the mindless alacrity of a puppy visiting an unexplored row of lampposts.When they aren't picking apart the efforts of individual writers, Sokal and Bricmont go after entire subfields of bad thinking that have found widespread acceptance among intellectual poseurs. Between-chapters ""intermezzos"" are devoted to ""Epistemic Relativism in the Philosophy of Science"" (i.e., the notion that verifiable physical truth exists only as a cultural ""myth""), ""Chaos Theory and 'Postmodern Science'"" (in which precisely defined scientific notions about predictability and nonlinearity are confounded with their squirrelly linguistic kin), and the abuse of Gödel's theorem and set theory (where very specific mathematical results are generalized to shed light on areas to which they have no connection whatsoever).The literary drawbacks of an intensive debunking of heaps of nonsensical verbosity are immediately obvious. Heedless of the dictates of pleasure or readability, Sokal and Bricmont have selflessly, mercilessly larded their work with extensive quotes from their primary sources. It may be necessary, but the authors' assiduousness does not make for the ""thoroughly hilarious romp through the postmodernist academy"" promised by Barbara Ehrenreich's jacket blurb.There is no romping to speak of. There is true hilarity, but it is on the whole confined to the chapter concerning Irigaray's feminist critique of science. Even readers who have already made their minds up about Lacan and his ilk owe themselves a few minutes at the bookstore discovering such howlers as:""Is E=Mc2 a sexed equation? Perhaps it is. Let us make the hypothesis that it is insofar as it privileges the speed of light over other speeds that are vitally necessary to us. What seems to me to indicate the possibly sexed nature of the equation is not directly its uses by nuclear weapons, rather it is having privileged what goes the fastest...""What makes Irigaray so funny is that she exposes herself with clear writing. Her thinking may be utter hogwash, but her sentences are generally parsable. This is not commonly the case among her peers. Any educated reader who has attempted to skim a dense scientific work he knows he could understand given the time will recognize the appeal of scientific-sounding obfuscation to the nontechnical author. If you aren't proceeding through an equation term by term, your eyes simply bounce off it; its meaning is held in reserve until you take the time to extract it. Nontechnical readers as a rule can't distinguish between meaningful equations and sheer poppycock; their eyes bounce off both. Putting in the time to extract the meaning isn't an option open to them. An impenetrable equation signals erudition even if it has none to offer. And the same is true of a sentence composed of technical gibberish.Sokal and Bricmont are aware of the limits of the scientific purview, as they now stand, and acknowledge the difference between science and everything else. What the authors don't state explicitly (and perhaps do not believe) is that the scientific mind, which prefers precision to poetry, single meanings to double ones, and trudges to leaps, is fundamentally different from the nonscientific one, and that many a pomo misstep has been inspired by a refusal to accept this fact.It's natural to crave science's strengths and to shun its weaknesses; sadly, they come as a matched set. The authority and verifiability of the natural sciences are formidable, but science has been most successful with the simplest, most precisely defined problems. It's no accident that ""Fashionable Nonsense"" was penned by physicists. Physics is the hardest of the sciences; its successful theories have been established with greater mathematical precision than have concepts in any other field of endeavor. But physics works best with things that matter least to outsiders—the arcana of quantum mechanics, for example. Once sucked in by the elegant system presented in freshman physics classes, who isn't at least a little bit disappointed to find that nothing really works as cleanly as it does in its classical estimation? (Quantum mechanics may reveal a physical universe stranger than we could possibly have imagined, but it left this former physics student, at least, pining for the world of Newton. Since the 17th century is unlikely ever again to represent the cutting edge of scientific knowledge, I threw over science for art, dropping out of grad school after three semesters and trading a handful of correct answers for a wealth of pretty good ones.)The trouble with working among what my high school physics teacher called the ""fuzzies"" is that you may feel as if you are right, but you can never prove it. If the fuzzies in question are sociologists, psychologists, linguists, or other quasi-scientists, the temptation will be strong to hijack the certitude of hard science to serve ideas you wish you could be sure about. Although it may be tempting to ascribe malice or lunacy to traffickers in pseudoscience, their quest, however misguided, is really quite poignant. They crave adulation for discovering something demonstrably true about things that, at least when they idealistically set out on their intellectual journeys, were serious ""real-world"" problems.But, as Batman whispered to Lacan, when the theorist lost his grip and slipped away into the bottomless maelstrom of text: ""Poor, deluded child.""Sokal and Bricmont don't abandon all hope for a cross-fertilization of ideas, but I'm not sure that scientists and non-scientists really can talk to each other about the things that really matter to them. And I don't think such a development, because it forces a bit of humility on us, is all bad. Knowledge has fragmented to the point that a degree of specialization is necessary. I'm a generalist at heart, and it pains me to say it, but whenever someone today is called a ""Renaissance man,"" you can bet that the speaker holds a grossly inflated opinion of that person's intellect. The world has simply gotten too big for any one person to get his mind around it. It's been said that Coleridge was the last person to know everything, but I wonder if even he wasn't born too late.Sokal and Bricmont know the genie isn't going back into the bottle, and they dispassionately deliver a corrective to innocents (even belligerent innocents) who think they can sidestep the problem either by usurping the language of science or, having given up on certainty, by discounting science altogether.

72,0312204078,http://goodreads.com/user/show/38719275-dale-grauman,3,"Read the introduction, both ""intermezzos,"" and the epilogue. These portions lay out good, popular-level critiques of radical skepticism and postmodern mumbo-jumbo. You can skip or skim the rest, which is comprised mostly of long quotations from academic ""theorists"" (i.e., mid-20th-century French philosophers or their disciples) alongside the author's commentary. All of these sections can be summarized as follows:French Academic: [Writes something entirely incomprehensible.]Sokal and Bricmont: ""The preceding passage was entirely incomprehensible. As professional scientists and mathematicians, we assure you that all references to science and mathematics are bogus.""Sometimes they take the time to explain the scientific or mathematical concepts in layman's terms so that readers can understand their critiques more deeply. Often, they do not. If you have already encountered ""theory""(in this particular sense of that term) and are perceptive (cynical?) enough to have concluded that it's willfully obscure, you won't get much out of reading these chapters.On a personal note, the authors made a couple claims that I had arrived at independently, and it was gratifying to see these notions in print:(1) ""Theory"" looks an awful lot like mysticism, and it may make sense to analyze it as a religious movement. (Page 37; they are especially referring to Lacan, here.)(2) Our inability to refute a position fully doesn't mean we have any reason to accept that position. (Page 54; they are especially referring to solipsism.)"
73,0312204078,http://goodreads.com/user/show/10174911-syed-ashrafulla,3,"The premise of the book is very sound. The authors are going after the improper use of fundamental mathematics and physics by philosophers who have run out of ways to confuse readers. Through a myriad of examples, the authors continually discredit the arguments given by postmodernists that try to employ modern physics. Those attacks are very solid. Postmodernists do misunderstand the link between science and philosophy. Sociologists do try to sweep scientific rigor under the rug when convenient.My problem with the book is its style. In an attempt to fortify the arguments against the lawyer-like retorts of the human sciences, they post far too much context. As a result I'm reading too much garbage. I prefer terser quotations with pointed rebuttals. I don't like the pasting of four paragraphs followed by a three line critique. Why not just break it up? Are you worried that the defenders will use the blunt critique of context? That critique is generally stupid anyway, but the authors spent a significant part of the book trying to answer that critique. People like me who don't have a dog in the fight then have to slog through terrible sentence after terrible sentence by philosophers who aim to confuse. Thanks, I thought we were going to avoid that.It's still an ok book. It's probably required reading for anyone in grad school. It's just not that pleasant or coherent a book to read."

I went in expecting more of a general-audience nonfiction work that aims to help lay-persons who are affected by the nonsense peddled by pseudo-mystics like Deepak Chopra whose particular brand of bullshit is hidden under a shiny candy coating of what appears to be a scientific basis.What this actually is reads much more like a scientific journal article. There is a very familiar cadence reminiscent of astrophysics papers I used to read regularly, and it has that exceptionally dry, ordered formatting that is desirable in objective scientific work.This was very enlightening, and it helped a great deal that I was once obsessed with post-modern philosophy and was able to keep up (though it underscores my decision to abandon that particular hobby long ago).If you are already well-versed in philosophical formalism, go for it, though don't expect a particular engaging read even then. It is what it is, there's no fluff. If you follow my reviews and updates, you know how quickly I read; this took me almost a week to get through, which about sums it up.It did work fantastically as a sleep aid on some nights where I found myself drifting off a full hour or more ahead of when I usually hit the wall.If you aren't into dry philosophy and formal logic, then this is definitely a hard pass for you."
75,0312204078,http://goodreads.com/user/show/24452449-zihad-azad,5,"At places, my brain stopped working trying to figure out the meaning of certain excerpts quoted in this book. I think I never recovered from the traumatic experience of reading the line: ""modern war takes place in Non-Euclidean Space"", the great Baudrillardian coinage.I would have said this book has officially run its course, but certain factions of the feminist movement who religiously hew to the ideas of Luce Irigaray restrain me from doing so. As much as I would like to believe otherwise, ideas such as ""modern science is a male construct"" or ""women are bullied out of a career in the natural sciences"" are still perniciously widespread. Thankfully, postmodernism as a philosophical practice has fallen out of favor in the academia. But the ideas put forth in the early 70s have percolated to the forefront of the public consciousness in the 2010s decade. I wish these ideas would eventually wither away. However, there is no such sign on the horizon. Keeping that in mind, I would say this book still retains its necessity. If not the whole thing, read at least a few chapters. These postmodern ideas are so freaking amusing; when they are not downright petrifying. For example, you can always find comic relief in feminist Julia Kristeva's endeavors to explain poetic language in terms of set theory."
76,0312204078,http://goodreads.com/user/show/44761402-jens,4,"There's a youtube clip in which John Searle talks to Foucault about why his writing is so atrocious, even though he can convey his reasonable ideas well in speech. Foucault answers that in France, in order to be taken seriously as an intellectual, at least 10% of what you write should be incomprehensible. Otherwise people just won't think it's ""deep"" or sophisticated. That's probably the biggest part of the problem with broadly postmodern writers, and 10% is a very conservative estimate in this case. Still, some of the philosophers discussed in this book have some genuinely interesting ideas (though not unequivocally true ones). In particular, I think Latour, Deleuze, and Derrida (not covered) have some valuable insights to contribute (though, again, I don't always agree with them, particularly in the case of Derrida). It is just too bad that they think they can score intellectual points in their writings by using scientific terms they don't understand. On the other hand, authors such as Lacan and Kristeva are completely vacuous, while Irigaray is just too ridiculous to be taken seriously. Also, relativism is dumb. No discourse of no length will ever make that a viable way out of a philosophical problem."
77,0312204078,http://goodreads.com/user/show/51799238-stefan-matias,5,"A great illustration of the scientific frauds of the 20th century. It's good to see scientists such as Sokal exposing this 'fashionable nonsense' for what it really is. I'm saddened to say, however, that even 22 years after the publication of his parody 'Transgressing the Boundaries,' we still see the same arguments and the same fashionable nonsense repeated today. What we need is to practice critical thinking, and really understand what it is we're reading and what we're talking about. The subchapter 'For a Dialogue Between the Two Cultures' in the epilogue, it is given some hints on how we are to do this, and is relevant as much now as it was then. The text was mainly structured to illustrate seperate persons who were obscuring their field of study, but I found the intermezzo chapters to be a lot more enlightening. The intermezzo parts and the epilogue were by far my favorite parts, but of course it was important to see how absurd certain individuals on the Left (especially in France) has written and tangled with information in desperate attempts to put their own names in their history books by achieving the paradigm shift of Thomas Kuhn."

FN aims specifically at the abuse of science by Continental theorists, and in so doing, is successful. In the introduction, it is said that they do not make judgments about the whole of anyone's work, only the misappropriations of science by the selected writers. And I applaud this. As for the rest of what these theorists have to say, they aren't wholly a waste of time. Mileage may vary. I find D&G's work stimulating for artists and, for example, their critique of capitalism out of Marx's Fragment on Machines is insightful, and unlike someone below/above, no, Marx is not irrelevant. Anyway, Sokol's points are spot-on and sorely needed. There's no doubt that the Continentals were often obtuse and obscurantist. It simply cannot be denied. But each one of the writers critiqued offer interesting insights and nuanced views on the world and its problems...as long as they spare us their misunderstanding of science. When they abuse that, it's natural that people will be skeptical of the rest of their work. Like David Foster Wallace, who misunderstood infinity, it's not fair to pan the remainder of the work only because of this. But it is a thorn in our sides. "

The only problem I see (and is somewhat justified because Sokal is a physicist) is that he doesn´t seem to understand the concept of paradigm by Kuhn (paradigms don´t relativize, they explain the thought of society in a determined epoch; they mantain in its core the fundamental knowledge and previous advancements of scientific progress) and marxism (dialectical materialism is proven scientifically; it isn´t gibberish nor rethoric, Das Kapital is an entire landmark on economics).

91,0312204078,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5695847-abyy,5,"Sokal and Bricmont launch a devastating critique of the pretentious and obscurantist tendencies of several authors in the pomo canon in this book. Their specific locus of attack is these philosophers' (and I use the term here in a very loose sense) misuse and deliberate abuse of scientific and mathematical concepts as a strategy to embellish and give an aura of credibility to very bad writing. [A caveat: I'm not a philosopher, physicist, mathematician, literary theorist, psychoanalyst or even well acquainted with any of these disciplines so everything I say about this can reasonably be seen as suspect.]Intellectual Impostures was an immensely enjoyable read. It confirmed what I've long suspected about the so-called ""radical"" thought of many pomo writers - that what appears prima facie to be incredibly profound ideas collapse under any sustained rational examination. While Sokal and Bricmont confine themselves to their areas of expertise (physics and mathematics), many of their observations are well taken and apply to the other works and to the other authors who 'do' pomo. As Sokal and Bricmont very ably point out, many of the ideas pomo authors proffer are deliberately written very ambiguously such that they can be read one of two ways - as either trivially true or surprising but false (or a third possibility: hopelessly confused). This book was published a decade ago. I wish I could report that their critiques are now merely of historical interest to a reinvigorated Left - but unfortunately I find their points to be as valid as they were when they were first published. I could go on in this vein for awhile but, to cut my vitriol short, suffice to say I'd strongly recommend to anyone with even a peripheral interest in science, pomo and the relation between them. Intellectual Impostures remains a very timely contribution that serves (hopefully) as a remedy for a Left that has increasingly become politically regressive, intellectually dishonest and, perhaps worst of all, not even wrong."
92,0312204078,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5805110-sweta-gupta,2,"I am in a dilemma in writing a review for this book. It inspired two extreme reactions. On one hand, I found the observations in the book to be hilarious and very well pointed out. On the other hand, I struggled through the 211 pages because the writing style was so dry and non-engaging and consisted largely of what the authors term “fashionable nonsense”: difficult language that sounds extremely profound and complex, but is in fact, meaningless. This book came as a result of Alan Sokal’s hoax, a nonsensical article that he submitted to an American culture studies journal, which was hailed by postmodernists. Of course, Sokal revealed the hoax and the praise of the postmodernists that had come in before the revelation clearly proved that the postmodernists really did not understand even their contemporaries but hailed each others’ work anyway. The book is all about deliberately obscure language and created confusion for the purpose of sounding profound. Needless to say, the writers have received a fair amount of criticism as well.Approximately half (or perhaps a bit more) of the book consists of long passages from the very works the authors are critiquing (ripping apart). And as the authors show in their commentary, those passages are mostly indecipherable gibberish. Reading those puts a serious strain on your mental capacities. I took more than a week to finish this 210 page book, and it was just a very, very painstaking effort.This book requires a fair understanding of conceptual physics and mathematics to understand that the passages reproduced are actually incomprehensible. I would not recommend it to someone who doesn’t have a decent understanding of those. In the epilogue, the authors lay out some broad lessons, which are useful for anyone: know what you are talking about instead of creating ambiguities by using flowery language to conceal your lack of understanding, not all that is obscure is necessarily profound and several others."
93,0312204078,http://goodreads.com/user/show/20247815-stephen,5,"Excellent discussion of the specific instances of postmodern writers in already-nebulous ""critical"" disciplines invoking scientific and mathematical concepts to equivocate (or spew outright gibberish!) under the guise of borrowing credence and rigor. Entertainingly written with a mind toward parsimony and specificity of argument that reflects the authors' backgrounds in scientific methodology without robbing the text of levity or accessibility. The epilogue is veers into op-ed territory - but in a good way: the authors emphasize the importance of precise, contextual, and intellectually honest articulation not only in academia, but as a discursive basis for broader social and intellectual projects that shape the course of society. A powerful read for anyone passionate about the sciences and chagrined by the creeping vacuity of the pseudo-intellectualism that infests the postmodern segment of the academy."
94,0312204078,http://goodreads.com/user/show/279997-llew,4,"By themselves, the quotes used in this book are some of the finest examples of academic horseshit one might ever hope to come across. I still love a good meandering philosophy tome, but there is something highly important about what Sokal and company are doing here. This idea that, at a certain point, abusing science and math to continue your ideas is dumbing down the populace. That relativism may be used for cultural anthropology, but it needs to be abandoned when used in scientific understanding. There's some leeway given to Baudrillard who is given his own chapter, yet I still appreciate, as i think people understand that he's being ridiculous and not necessarily putting across formal theses. Lacan on the other hand, where he's giving a formal argument based on flawed understanding of well-known scientific ideas, comes across as just sad. Sokal knows his science, and they give good counter-proof that, no Quantum Relativity of the mind doesn't make sense and that's not how topology works, although the book fails when they try to provide a proper philosophy of science and epistemology. They give some time try to argue down questions like, ""how do we know this is reality"", and it meanders like the texts they are critiquing. Still, very essential that they wrote this. "
95,0312204078,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1841544-chris,3,"On display is lots of nonsense written in the postmodern tradition, specifically by philosophers that can basically be classified as epistemic relativists. In the first several chapters, the responses by the authors to absurd passages from Lacan and Kristeva are quite detailed. As the book goes on, punctuated by several intermezzo chapters which give some background, much of the commentary becomes lazy. The authors begin to appeal to the self-evidence of the ridiculousness on display.Occasionally the authors' criticism seems like nitpicking, and I can't shake the feeling that the book would have benefitted from some back and forth, offering at least some defense of selected passages before a complete dismantling of the postmodern arguments. Don't get me wrong, I would NEVER defend any of the intellectual traditions the book lampoons. But you know the people that wrote these passages (or their disciples) would have responses to the obvious technical errors which the book frequently points out pepper their arguments. No doubt that these responses would be just as incomprehensible as the original arguments, buttressing the notion that they are just masters of manipulating erudite language and peddling pretentiousness.A fun read for the quote mining, but it probably could have been done better."
96,0312204078,http://goodreads.com/user/show/12638036-haaris-mateen,4,"Sokal and Bricmont bring balance to the Force. The overkill of relativism and scientism that had infected most of the social sciences and humanities couldn't have done with a better beneficial shock. Alas, the currents exposed still exist in the discourse of the Left, and it is perhaps one of the biggest flaws that exist in the battle against the poisonous populism insidiously rising the world over. The rise of the Post Truth world cannot be blamed solely on the ""other side"". This book (now almost twenty years old) reminds us of the pitfalls of choosing radical skepticism, a way of thought that isolates itself from reality and which allows dangerous deliverers to thrive; and a line of thinking which only university grads are equipped to even access (though not with any benefit to the world)."
97,0312204078,http://goodreads.com/user/show/44290999-jjonas,2,"2.5 stars.In the 'Afterword' to the original ""Sokal affair"" paper (which is the last item in this book), Sokal quotes C. P. Snow's view in Two cultures:""A good many times I have been present at gatherings of people who, by the standars of the traditional culture, are thought highly educated and who have with considerable gusto been expressing their incredulity at the illiteracy of scientists. Once or twice I have been provoked and have asked the company how many of them could describe the Second Law of Thermodynamics. The response was cold: it was also negative. Yet I was asking something which is about the scientific equivalent of: Have you read a work of Shakespeare's? [...] [T]he great edifice of modern physics goes up, and the majority of the cleverest people in the western world have about as much insight into it as their neolithic ancestors would have had."" (p. 276-277)Sokal notes:""One significant change has taken place since C. P. Snow's time: while humanist intellectuals' ignorance about (for example) mass and acceleration remains substantially unchanged, nowadays a significant minority of humanist intellectuals feels entitled to pontificate on these subjects in spite of their ignorance"" (p. 277).I take this to be the original motivation for writing the ""Sokal hoax paper"" and this book. And Sokal and Bricmont do make a good point about posturing intellectuals using frivolous analogies in their philosophy etc. texts to mathematics and physics which said authors don't really understand — and even if they did, do they really expect their likely readership to understand them without explicit clarification about why the chosen analogy is useful. I believe S & B demonstrate this satisfactorily and to good effect.(It should be noted in passing that it's not only some humanists and social scientists who are guilty of ignorance of other fields; e.g. someone like Steven Pinker has strayed ever further from his homebase in psychology and the study of language and written broad-stroke works with sweeping conclusions about history, liberalism etc. where he's not really the expert. Or consider economists, who get to be interviewed about politics, foreign relations, environmental issues etc., as if they've become some kind of universal intellectuals.)However, S & B are not on equally strong ground when they declare the quoted passages — which sure do look embarrassing — simply nonsense. I would agree they're nonsense as far as the language lifted from natural science and mathematics is concerned, but I think S & B might be guilty of somewhat comparable arrogance as their targets by proclaiming the quotes simply nonsensical, meaningless etc. — in all respects, not just in terms of the physics terminology etc.I think many people who praise this book are a bit too eager to strike at pomos with whatever they've got (something that I'm not totally unsympathetic towards, by the way) and disregard this side of the work. In fact, some seem to see the book (including people who probably haven't read it) as a wholesale condemnation of, if not a fatal blow to, postmodernism, which however is something that the authors don't even claim to do. Instead they've set themselves a far narrower task: to call out reckless use of concepts lifted from physics etc. with the intention of lending philosophical texts some rigour, respectability or whatever. That's a far cry from ""destroying postmodernism"" or whatever.Now, it does seem obvious to me that the ""pomo"" authors in questions are guilty of the most blatant kind of posturing, obfuscation and pretense one can imagine, and that stripped of the verbiage, what they have to say would turn out to be much less impressive than it appears (though not necessarily banal). So overall, I'm partial to what S & B are doing, for like them I'm a believer in objective physical reality independent of human (or other) consciousness, while — again, like them — not denying at all the sense in the moderate version of ""social construction of reality"" as a corrective to what S & B call ""naive modernism"" (p. 183).But I think S & B are wrong if they expect they can (or should) understand philosophical etc. texts as easily as if they were reading the newspaper. Personally I'm inclined to think that what Lacan, Kristeva etc. have to say is much more ordinary than it would appear at first sight (and much of it nonsense to boot), but I don't believe that S & B are significantly more qualified to make that call than I am. Our difference is that I didn't (and wouldn't) write a book about it.The chapters that picked apart scienced up pomo quotes were the least fun to read, and unfortunately that's more than half of the book. No doubt the chapters were necessary to drive the main point home, but reading it was hard work and the content was repetitive, and I confess I didn't read much of the quoted materials (some of the quotes were several pages long). In contrast, the ""intermezzo chapters"" that dealt with more general questions of philosophy of science and relativism were the most useful ones to me.The book ends with the original ""Sokal affair"" article and a chapter which explains what was fishy about it. While I believe that Social Text is to blame for publishing stuff the subject matter of which they didn't understand, I'm also somewhat sympathetic towards the argument that in a journal like Social Text it's not necessarily the editors' duty to weed out wild and unconventional ideas but instead let the readership judge for themselves whether (some of) the ideas in some article merit any attention."

Thus went the rejoinder propellerheads offered religious enthusiasts when, in the '80s, hinterland zealots attempted to get Genesis taught in public schools under the rubric of ""creation science."" But what of the inverse? If there is math in it, is science an inevitability? As any kid who sat through the first month of Mr. Glahn's 9th-grade geometry class can tell you, the second statement doesn't necessarily follow from the first.Over the past 30 years or so, an entire generation of psychoanalysts, literary theorists, cult-studs, and other postmodern types has made hay by virtue of the fact that its readers lack the benefit of my math teacher's wisdom. By the mid-'90s the problem had gotten far enough out of hand that New York University physics prof Alan Sokal felt compelled to cook up a heady stew of anti-scientific pigheadedness and pseudotechnical misprision, season it liberally with quotes from such theoretical leading lights as Jacques Lacan, Gilles Deleuze and Félix Guattari, and Luce Irigaray, and set the steaming dish down in front of the editors of the Duke University Press cultural-studies journal ""Social Text""—who promptly served it up in their Spring/Summer 1996 issue.Sokal then outed himself, exposing his parody in an article rejected by ""Social Text,"" which judged the correction to the published goof beneath its ""intellectual standards."" ""Dissent"" and ""Philosophy and Literature"" picked up the second piece, but by the time they hit the stacks the popular press had already had a field day with Sokal's prank.Needless to say, ""Social Text"" editors Andrew Ross and Stanley Aronowitz weren't amused. Nor were the hordes of tenured radicals who had built their careers on what had been exposed as institutionally codified idiocy. They counterattacked, and now Sokal has teamed up with Belgium-based theoretical physicist Jean Bricmont (it helps to have a Francophone on your side in such matters) to respond with a book-length popular treatment of postmodern ideological excess and methodological madness.Chapter by chapter, Sokal and Bricmont calmly, meticulously tear new assholes for Lacan, Deleuze and Guattari, Irigaray, Julia Kristeva, Bruno Latour, Jean Baudrillard, and Paul Virilio. The physicists aren't staging some sort of anti-theoretical pogrom; they're just standing up for rationality. Jacques Derrida keeps his hands off science; Sokal and Bricmont keep their hands off Derrida. They refuse even to judge the theorists' overall programs, limiting their criticisms to their areas of expertise and suggesting that their targets could have benefited from similar circumspection.What they reveal is scandalous. Lacan indulges a fondness for topology, which he barely understands, and suffers a penchant for arbitrary metaphors, which he often refuses to acknowledge as anything other than literal truths. Kristeva does the same with set theory. Virilio misunderstands concepts that are covered in the first week of 11th-grade physics. Almost everybody jumps from one discipline to another with the mindless alacrity of a puppy visiting an unexplored row of lampposts.When they aren't picking apart the efforts of individual writers, Sokal and Bricmont go after entire subfields of bad thinking that have found widespread acceptance among intellectual poseurs. Between-chapters ""intermezzos"" are devoted to ""Epistemic Relativism in the Philosophy of Science"" (i.e., the notion that verifiable physical truth exists only as a cultural ""myth""), ""Chaos Theory and 'Postmodern Science'"" (in which precisely defined scientific notions about predictability and nonlinearity are confounded with their squirrelly linguistic kin), and the abuse of Gödel's theorem and set theory (where very specific mathematical results are generalized to shed light on areas to which they have no connection whatsoever).The literary drawbacks of an intensive debunking of heaps of nonsensical verbosity are immediately obvious. Heedless of the dictates of pleasure or readability, Sokal and Bricmont have selflessly, mercilessly larded their work with extensive quotes from their primary sources. It may be necessary, but the authors' assiduousness does not make for the ""thoroughly hilarious romp through the postmodernist academy"" promised by Barbara Ehrenreich's jacket blurb.There is no romping to speak of. There is true hilarity, but it is on the whole confined to the chapter concerning Irigaray's feminist critique of science. Even readers who have already made their minds up about Lacan and his ilk owe themselves a few minutes at the bookstore discovering such howlers as:""Is E=Mc2 a sexed equation? Perhaps it is. Let us make the hypothesis that it is insofar as it privileges the speed of light over other speeds that are vitally necessary to us. What seems to me to indicate the possibly sexed nature of the equation is not directly its uses by nuclear weapons, rather it is having privileged what goes the fastest...""What makes Irigaray so funny is that she exposes herself with clear writing. Her thinking may be utter hogwash, but her sentences are generally parsable. This is not commonly the case among her peers. Any educated reader who has attempted to skim a dense scientific work he knows he could understand given the time will recognize the appeal of scientific-sounding obfuscation to the nontechnical author. If you aren't proceeding through an equation term by term, your eyes simply bounce off it; its meaning is held in reserve until you take the time to extract it. Nontechnical readers as a rule can't distinguish between meaningful equations and sheer poppycock; their eyes bounce off both. Putting in the time to extract the meaning isn't an option open to them. An impenetrable equation signals erudition even if it has none to offer. And the same is true of a sentence composed of technical gibberish.Sokal and Bricmont are aware of the limits of the scientific purview, as they now stand, and acknowledge the difference between science and everything else. What the authors don't state explicitly (and perhaps do not believe) is that the scientific mind, which prefers precision to poetry, single meanings to double ones, and trudges to leaps, is fundamentally different from the nonscientific one, and that many a pomo misstep has been inspired by a refusal to accept this fact.It's natural to crave science's strengths and to shun its weaknesses; sadly, they come as a matched set. The authority and verifiability of the natural sciences are formidable, but science has been most successful with the simplest, most precisely defined problems. It's no accident that ""Fashionable Nonsense"" was penned by physicists. Physics is the hardest of the sciences; its successful theories have been established with greater mathematical precision than have concepts in any other field of endeavor. But physics works best with things that matter least to outsiders—the arcana of quantum mechanics, for example. Once sucked in by the elegant system presented in freshman physics classes, who isn't at least a little bit disappointed to find that nothing really works as cleanly as it does in its classical estimation? (Quantum mechanics may reveal a physical universe stranger than we could possibly have imagined, but it left this former physics student, at least, pining for the world of Newton. Since the 17th century is unlikely ever again to represent the cutting edge of scientific knowledge, I threw over science for art, dropping out of grad school after three semesters and trading a handful of correct answers for a wealth of pretty good ones.)The trouble with working among what my high school physics teacher called the ""fuzzies"" is that you may feel as if you are right, but you can never prove it. If the fuzzies in question are sociologists, psychologists, linguists, or other quasi-scientists, the temptation will be strong to hijack the certitude of hard science to serve ideas you wish you could be sure about. Although it may be tempting to ascribe malice or lunacy to traffickers in pseudoscience, their quest, however misguided, is really quite poignant. They crave adulation for discovering something demonstrably true about things that, at least when they idealistically set out on their intellectual journeys, were serious ""real-world"" problems.But, as Batman whispered to Lacan, when the theorist lost his grip and slipped away into the bottomless maelstrom of text: ""Poor, deluded child.""Sokal and Bricmont don't abandon all hope for a cross-fertilization of ideas, but I'm not sure that scientists and non-scientists really can talk to each other about the things that really matter to them. And I don't think such a development, because it forces a bit of humility on us, is all bad. Knowledge has fragmented to the point that a degree of specialization is necessary. I'm a generalist at heart, and it pains me to say it, but whenever someone today is called a ""Renaissance man,"" you can bet that the speaker holds a grossly inflated opinion of that person's intellect. The world has simply gotten too big for any one person to get his mind around it. It's been said that Coleridge was the last person to know everything, but I wonder if even he wasn't born too late.Sokal and Bricmont know the genie isn't going back into the bottle, and they dispassionately deliver a corrective to innocents (even belligerent innocents) who think they can sidestep the problem either by usurping the language of science or, having given up on certainty, by discounting science altogether. Tough-minded to a fault, the physicists not only establish the circumstances under which no reasonable interdisciplinary discussion can occur, they also tell us when nonscientists shouldn't be talking at all.

102,0312204078,http://goodreads.com/user/show/38719275-dale-grauman,3,"Read the introduction, both ""intermezzos,"" and the epilogue. These portions lay out good, popular-level critiques of radical skepticism and postmodern mumbo-jumbo. You can skip or skim the rest, which is comprised mostly of long quotations from academic ""theorists"" (i.e., mid-20th-century French philosophers or their disciples) alongside the author's commentary. All of these sections can be summarized as follows:French Academic: [Writes something entirely incomprehensible.]Sokal and Bricmont: ""The preceding passage was entirely incomprehensible. As professional scientists and mathematicians, we assure you that all references to science and mathematics are bogus.""Sometimes they take the time to explain the scientific or mathematical concepts in layman's terms so that readers can understand their critiques more deeply. Often, they do not. If you have already encountered ""theory""(in this particular sense of that term) and are perceptive (cynical?) enough to have concluded that it's willfully obscure, you won't get much out of reading these chapters.On a personal note, the authors made a couple claims that I had arrived at independently, and it was gratifying to see these notions in print:(1) ""Theory"" looks an awful lot like mysticism, and it may make sense to analyze it as a religious movement. (Page 37; they are especially referring to Lacan, here.)(2) Our inability to refute a position fully doesn't mean we have any reason to accept that position. (Page 54; they are especially referring to solipsism.)"
103,0312204078,http://goodreads.com/user/show/10174911-syed-ashrafulla,3,"The premise of the book is very sound. The authors are going after the improper use of fundamental mathematics and physics by philosophers who have run out of ways to confuse readers. Through a myriad of examples, the authors continually discredit the arguments given by postmodernists that try to employ modern physics. Those attacks are very solid. Postmodernists do misunderstand the link between science and philosophy. Sociologists do try to sweep scientific rigor under the rug when convenient.My problem with the book is its style. In an attempt to fortify the arguments against the lawyer-like retorts of the human sciences, they post far too much context. As a result I'm reading too much garbage. I prefer terser quotations with pointed rebuttals. I don't like the pasting of four paragraphs followed by a three line critique. Why not just break it up? Are you worried that the defenders will use the blunt critique of context? That critique is generally stupid anyway, but the authors spent a significant part of the book trying to answer that critique. People like me who don't have a dog in the fight then have to slog through terrible sentence after terrible sentence by philosophers who aim to confuse. Thanks, I thought we were going to avoid that.It's still an ok book. It's probably required reading for anyone in grad school. It's just not that pleasant or coherent a book to read."

I went in expecting more of a general-audience nonfiction work that aims to help lay-persons who are affected by the nonsense peddled by pseudo-mystics like Deepak Chopra whose particular brand of bullshit is hidden under a shiny candy coating of what appears to be a scientific basis.What this actually is reads much more like a scientific journal article. There is a very familiar cadence reminiscent of astrophysics papers I used to read regularly, and it has that exceptionally dry, ordered formatting that is desirable in objective scientific work.This was very enlightening, and it helped a great deal that I was once obsessed with post-modern philosophy and was able to keep up (though it underscores my decision to abandon that particular hobby long ago).If you are already well-versed in philosophical formalism, go for it, though don't expect a particular engaging read even then. It is what it is, there's no fluff. If you follow my reviews and updates, you know how quickly I read; this took me almost a week to get through, which about sums it up.It did work fantastically as a sleep aid on some nights where I found myself drifting off a full hour or more ahead of when I usually hit the wall.If you aren't into dry philosophy and formal logic, then this is definitely a hard pass for you."

I think I never recovered from the traumatic experience of reading the line: ""modern war takes place in Non-Euclidean Space"", the great Baudrillardian coinage.I would have said this book has officially run its course, but certain factions of the feminist movement who religiously hew to the ideas of Luce Irigaray restrain me from doing so. As much as I would like to believe otherwise, ideas such as ""modern science is a male construct"" or ""women are bullied out of a career in the natural sciences"" are still perniciously widespread. Thankfully, postmodernism as a philosophical practice has fallen out of favor in the academia. But the ideas put forth in the early 70s have percolated to the forefront of the public consciousness in the 2010s decade. I wish these ideas would eventually wither away. However, there is no such sign on the horizon. Keeping that in mind, I would say this book still retains its necessity. If not the whole thing, read at least a few chapters. These postmodern ideas are so freaking amusing; when they are not downright petrifying. For example, you can always find comic relief in feminist Julia Kristeva's endeavors to explain poetic language in terms of set theory."
106,0312204078,http://goodreads.com/user/show/44761402-jens,4,"There's a youtube clip in which John Searle talks to Foucault about why his writing is so atrocious, even though he can convey his reasonable ideas well in speech. Foucault answers that in France, in order to be taken seriously as an intellectual, at least 10% of what you write should be incomprehensible. Otherwise people just won't think it's ""deep"" or sophisticated. That's probably the biggest part of the problem with broadly postmodern writers, and 10% is a very conservative estimate in this case. Still, some of the philosophers discussed in this book have some genuinely interesting ideas (though not unequivocally true ones). In particular, I think Latour, Deleuze, and Derrida (not covered) have some valuable insights to contribute (though, again, I don't always agree with them, particularly in the case of Derrida). It is just too bad that they think they can score intellectual points in their writings by using scientific terms they don't understand. On the other hand, authors such as Lacan and Kristeva are completely vacuous, while Irigaray is just too ridiculous to be taken seriously. Also, relativism is dumb. No discourse of no length will ever make that a viable way out of a philosophical problem."
107,0312204078,http://goodreads.com/user/show/51799238-stefan-matias,5,"A great illustration of the scientific frauds of the 20th century. It's good to see scientists such as Sokal exposing this 'fashionable nonsense' for what it really is. I'm saddened to say, however, that even 22 years after the publication of his parody 'Transgressing the Boundaries,' we still see the same arguments and the same fashionable nonsense repeated today. What we need is to practice critical thinking, and really understand what it is we're reading and what we're talking about. The subchapter 'For a Dialogue Between the Two Cultures' in the epilogue, it is given some hints on how we are to do this, and is relevant as much now as it was then. The text was mainly structured to illustrate seperate persons who were obscuring their field of study, but I found the intermezzo chapters to be a lot more enlightening. The intermezzo parts and the epilogue were by far my favorite parts, but of course it was important to see how absurd certain individuals on the Left (especially in France) has written and tangled with information in desperate attempts to put their own names in their history books by achieving the paradigm shift of Thomas Kuhn."

FN aims specifically at the abuse of science by Continental theorists, and in so doing, is successful. In the introduction, it is said that they do not make judgments about the whole of anyone's work, only the misappropriations of science by the selected writers. And I applaud this. As for the rest of what these theorists have to say, they aren't wholly a waste of time. Mileage may vary. I find D&G's work stimulating for artists and, for example, their critique of capitalism out of Marx's Fragment on Machines is insightful, and unlike someone below/above, no, Marx is not irrelevant. Anyway, Sokol's points are spot-on and sorely needed. There's no doubt that the Continentals were often obtuse and obscurantist. It simply cannot be denied. But each one of the writers critiqued offer interesting insights and nuanced views on the world and its problems...as long as they spare us their misunderstanding of science. When they abuse that, it's natural that people will be skeptical of the rest of their work. Like David Foster Wallace, who misunderstood infinity, it's not fair to pan the remainder of the work only because of this. But it is a thorn in our sides. "

The only problem I see (and is somewhat justified because Sokal is a physicist) is that he doesn´t seem to understand the concept of paradigm by Kuhn (paradigms don´t relativize, they explain the thought of society in a determined epoch; they mantain in its core the fundamental knowledge and previous advancements of scientific progress) and marxism (dialectical materialism is proven scientifically; it isn´t gibberish nor rethoric, Das Kapital is an entire landmark on economics).

121,0312204078,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5695847-abyy,5,"Sokal and Bricmont launch a devastating critique of the pretentious and obscurantist tendencies of several authors in the pomo canon in this book. Their specific locus of attack is these philosophers' (and I use the term here in a very loose sense) misuse and deliberate abuse of scientific and mathematical concepts as a strategy to embellish and give an aura of credibility to very bad writing. [A caveat: I'm not a philosopher, physicist, mathematician, literary theorist, psychoanalyst or even well acquainted with any of these disciplines so everything I say about this can reasonably be seen as suspect.]Intellectual Impostures was an immensely enjoyable read. It confirmed what I've long suspected about the so-called ""radical"" thought of many pomo writers - that what appears prima facie to be incredibly profound ideas collapse under any sustained rational examination. While Sokal and Bricmont confine themselves to their areas of expertise (physics and mathematics), many of their observations are well taken and apply to the other works and to the other authors who 'do' pomo. As Sokal and Bricmont very ably point out, many of the ideas pomo authors proffer are deliberately written very ambiguously such that they can be read one of two ways - as either trivially true or surprising but false (or a third possibility: hopelessly confused). This book was published a decade ago. I wish I could report that their critiques are now merely of historical interest to a reinvigorated Left - but unfortunately I find their points to be as valid as they were when they were first published. I could go on in this vein for awhile but, to cut my vitriol short, suffice to say I'd strongly recommend to anyone with even a peripheral interest in science, pomo and the relation between them. Intellectual Impostures remains a very timely contribution that serves (hopefully) as a remedy for a Left that has increasingly become politically regressive, intellectually dishonest and, perhaps worst of all, not even wrong."
122,0312204078,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5805110-sweta-gupta,2,"I am in a dilemma in writing a review for this book. It inspired two extreme reactions. On one hand, I found the observations in the book to be hilarious and very well pointed out. On the other hand, I struggled through the 211 pages because the writing style was so dry and non-engaging and consisted largely of what the authors term “fashionable nonsense”: difficult language that sounds extremely profound and complex, but is in fact, meaningless. This book came as a result of Alan Sokal’s hoax, a nonsensical article that he submitted to an American culture studies journal, which was hailed by postmodernists. Of course, Sokal revealed the hoax and the praise of the postmodernists that had come in before the revelation clearly proved that the postmodernists really did not understand even their contemporaries but hailed each others’ work anyway. The book is all about deliberately obscure language and created confusion for the purpose of sounding profound. Needless to say, the writers have received a fair amount of criticism as well.Approximately half (or perhaps a bit more) of the book consists of long passages from the very works the authors are critiquing (ripping apart). And as the authors show in their commentary, those passages are mostly indecipherable gibberish. Reading those puts a serious strain on your mental capacities. I took more than a week to finish this 210 page book, and it was just a very, very painstaking effort.This book requires a fair understanding of conceptual physics and mathematics to understand that the passages reproduced are actually incomprehensible. I would not recommend it to someone who doesn’t have a decent understanding of those. In the epilogue, the authors lay out some broad lessons, which are useful for anyone: know what you are talking about instead of creating ambiguities by using flowery language to conceal your lack of understanding, not all that is obscure is necessarily profound and several others."
123,0312204078,http://goodreads.com/user/show/20247815-stephen,5,"Excellent discussion of the specific instances of postmodern writers in already-nebulous ""critical"" disciplines invoking scientific and mathematical concepts to equivocate (or spew outright gibberish!) under the guise of borrowing credence and rigor. Entertainingly written with a mind toward parsimony and specificity of argument that reflects the authors' backgrounds in scientific methodology without robbing the text of levity or accessibility. The epilogue is veers into op-ed territory - but in a good way: the authors emphasize the importance of precise, contextual, and intellectually honest articulation not only in academia, but as a discursive basis for broader social and intellectual projects that shape the course of society. A powerful read for anyone passionate about the sciences and chagrined by the creeping vacuity of the pseudo-intellectualism that infests the postmodern segment of the academy."
124,0312204078,http://goodreads.com/user/show/279997-llew,4,"By themselves, the quotes used in this book are some of the finest examples of academic horseshit one might ever hope to come across. I still love a good meandering philosophy tome, but there is something highly important about what Sokal and company are doing here. This idea that, at a certain point, abusing science and math to continue your ideas is dumbing down the populace. That relativism may be used for cultural anthropology, but it needs to be abandoned when used in scientific understanding. There's some leeway given to Baudrillard who is given his own chapter, yet I still appreciate, as i think people understand that he's being ridiculous and not necessarily putting across formal theses. Lacan on the other hand, where he's giving a formal argument based on flawed understanding of well-known scientific ideas, comes across as just sad. Sokal knows his science, and they give good counter-proof that, no Quantum Relativity of the mind doesn't make sense and that's not how topology works, although the book fails when they try to provide a proper philosophy of science and epistemology. They give some time try to argue down questions like, ""how do we know this is reality"", and it meanders like the texts they are critiquing. Still, very essential that they wrote this. "
125,0312204078,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1841544-chris,3,"On display is lots of nonsense written in the postmodern tradition, specifically by philosophers that can basically be classified as epistemic relativists. In the first several chapters, the responses by the authors to absurd passages from Lacan and Kristeva are quite detailed. As the book goes on, punctuated by several intermezzo chapters which give some background, much of the commentary becomes lazy. The authors begin to appeal to the self-evidence of the ridiculousness on display.Occasionally the authors' criticism seems like nitpicking, and I can't shake the feeling that the book would have benefitted from some back and forth, offering at least some defense of selected passages before a complete dismantling of the postmodern arguments. Don't get me wrong, I would NEVER defend any of the intellectual traditions the book lampoons. But you know the people that wrote these passages (or their disciples) would have responses to the obvious technical errors which the book frequently points out pepper their arguments. No doubt that these responses would be just as incomprehensible as the original arguments, buttressing the notion that they are just masters of manipulating erudite language and peddling pretentiousness.A fun read for the quote mining, but it probably could have been done better."

The overkill of relativism and scientism that had infected most of the social sciences and humanities couldn't have done with a better beneficial shock. Alas, the currents exposed still exist in the discourse of the Left, and it is perhaps one of the biggest flaws that exist in the battle against the poisonous populism insidiously rising the world over. The rise of the Post Truth world cannot be blamed solely on the ""other side"". This book (now almost twenty years old) reminds us of the pitfalls of choosing radical skepticism, a way of thought that isolates itself from reality and which allows dangerous deliverers to thrive; and a line of thinking which only university grads are equipped to even access (though not with any benefit to the world)."
127,0312204078,http://goodreads.com/user/show/44290999-jjonas,2,"2.5 stars.In the 'Afterword' to the original ""Sokal affair"" paper (which is the last item in this book), Sokal quotes C. P. Snow's view in Two cultures:""A good many times I have been present at gatherings of people who, by the standars of the traditional culture, are thought highly educated and who have with considerable gusto been expressing their incredulity at the illiteracy of scientists. Once or twice I have been provoked and have asked the company how many of them could describe the Second Law of Thermodynamics. The response was cold: it was also negative. Yet I was asking something which is about the scientific equivalent of: Have you read a work of Shakespeare's? [...] [T]he great edifice of modern physics goes up, and the majority of the cleverest people in the western world have about as much insight into it as their neolithic ancestors would have had."" (p. 276-277)Sokal notes:""One significant change has taken place since C. P. Snow's time: while humanist intellectuals' ignorance about (for example) mass and acceleration remains substantially unchanged, nowadays a significant minority of humanist intellectuals feels entitled to pontificate on these subjects in spite of their ignorance"" (p. 277).I take this to be the original motivation for writing the ""Sokal hoax paper"" and this book. And Sokal and Bricmont do make a good point about posturing intellectuals using frivolous analogies in their philosophy etc. texts to mathematics and physics which said authors don't really understand — and even if they did, do they really expect their likely readership to understand them without explicit clarification about why the chosen analogy is useful. I believe S & B demonstrate this satisfactorily and to good effect.(It should be noted in passing that it's not only some humanists and social scientists who are guilty of ignorance of other fields; e.g. someone like Steven Pinker has strayed ever further from his homebase in psychology and the study of language and written broad-stroke works with sweeping conclusions about history, liberalism etc. where he's not really the expert. Or consider economists, who get to be interviewed about politics, foreign relations, environmental issues etc., as if they've become some kind of universal intellectuals.)However, S & B are not on equally strong ground when they declare the quoted passages — which sure do look embarrassing — simply nonsense. I would agree they're nonsense as far as the language lifted from natural science and mathematics is concerned, but I think S & B might be guilty of somewhat comparable arrogance as their targets by proclaiming the quotes simply nonsensical, meaningless etc. — in all respects, not just in terms of the physics terminology etc.I think many people who praise this book are a bit too eager to strike at pomos with whatever they've got (something that I'm not totally unsympathetic towards, by the way) and disregard this side of the work. In fact, some seem to see the book (including people who probably haven't read it) as a wholesale condemnation of, if not a fatal blow to, postmodernism, which however is something that the authors don't even claim to do. Instead they've set themselves a far narrower task: to call out reckless use of concepts lifted from physics etc. with the intention of lending philosophical texts some rigour, respectability or whatever. That's a far cry from ""destroying postmodernism"" or whatever.Now, it does seem obvious to me that the ""pomo"" authors in questions are guilty of the most blatant kind of posturing, obfuscation and pretense one can imagine, and that stripped of the verbiage, what they have to say would turn out to be much less impressive than it appears (though not necessarily banal). So overall, I'm partial to what S & B are doing, for like them I'm a believer in objective physical reality independent of human (or other) consciousness, while — again, like them — not denying at all the sense in the moderate version of ""social construction of reality"" as a corrective to what S & B call ""naive modernism"" (p. 183).But I think S & B are wrong if they expect they can (or should) understand philosophical etc. texts as easily as if they were reading the newspaper. Personally I'm inclined to think that what Lacan, Kristeva etc. have to say is much more ordinary than it would appear at first sight (and much of it nonsense to boot), but I don't believe that S & B are significantly more qualified to make that call than I am. Our difference is that I didn't (and wouldn't) write a book about it.The chapters that picked apart scienced up pomo quotes were the least fun to read, and unfortunately that's more than half of the book. No doubt the chapters were necessary to drive the main point home, but reading it was hard work and the content was repetitive, and I confess I didn't read much of the quoted materials (some of the quotes were several pages long). In contrast, the ""intermezzo chapters"" that dealt with more general questions of philosophy of science and relativism were the most useful ones to me.The book ends with the original ""Sokal affair"" article and a chapter which explains what was fishy about it. While I believe that Social Text is to blame for publishing stuff the subject matter of which they didn't understand, I'm also somewhat sympathetic towards the argument that in a journal like Social Text it's not necessarily the editors' duty to weed out wild and unconventional ideas but instead let the readership judge for themselves whether (some of) the ideas in some article merit any attention."

130,0312204078,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1785447-david-glenn-dixon,4,"Washington City PaperArts & Entertainment : Book ReviewLiberté, Egalité, ObscuritéBy Glenn Dixon • March 12, 1999""If there's no math in it, it isn't science."" Thus went the rejoinder propellerheads offered religious enthusiasts when, in the '80s, hinterland zealots attempted to get Genesis taught in public schools under the rubric of ""creation science."" But what of the inverse? If there is math in it, is science an inevitability? As any kid who sat through the first month of Mr. Glahn's 9th-grade geometry class can tell you, the second statement doesn't necessarily follow from the first.Over the past 30 years or so, an entire generation of psychoanalysts, literary theorists, cult-studs, and other postmodern types has made hay by virtue of the fact that its readers lack the benefit of my math teacher's wisdom. By the mid-'90s the problem had gotten far enough out of hand that New York University physics prof Alan Sokal felt compelled to cook up a heady stew of anti-scientific pigheadedness and pseudotechnical misprision, season it liberally with quotes from such theoretical leading lights as Jacques Lacan, Gilles Deleuze and Félix Guattari, and Luce Irigaray, and set the steaming dish down in front of the editors of the Duke University Press cultural-studies journal ""Social Text""—who promptly served it up in their Spring/Summer 1996 issue.Sokal then outed himself, exposing his parody in an article rejected by ""Social Text,"" which judged the correction to the published goof beneath its ""intellectual standards."" ""Dissent"" and ""Philosophy and Literature"" picked up the second piece, but by the time they hit the stacks the popular press had already had a field day with Sokal's prank.Needless to say, ""Social Text"" editors Andrew Ross and Stanley Aronowitz weren't amused. Nor were the hordes of tenured radicals who had built their careers on what had been exposed as institutionally codified idiocy. They counterattacked, and now Sokal has teamed up with Belgium-based theoretical physicist Jean Bricmont (it helps to have a Francophone on your side in such matters) to respond with a book-length popular treatment of postmodern ideological excess and methodological madness.Chapter by chapter, Sokal and Bricmont calmly, meticulously tear new assholes for Lacan, Deleuze and Guattari, Irigaray, Julia Kristeva, Bruno Latour, Jean Baudrillard, and Paul Virilio. The physicists aren't staging some sort of anti-theoretical pogrom; they're just standing up for rationality. Jacques Derrida keeps his hands off science; Sokal and Bricmont keep their hands off Derrida. They refuse even to judge the theorists' overall programs, limiting their criticisms to their areas of expertise and suggesting that their targets could have benefited from similar circumspection.What they reveal is scandalous. Lacan indulges a fondness for topology, which he barely understands, and suffers a penchant for arbitrary metaphors, which he often refuses to acknowledge as anything other than literal truths. Kristeva does the same with set theory. Virilio misunderstands concepts that are covered in the first week of 11th-grade physics. Almost everybody jumps from one discipline to another with the mindless alacrity of a puppy visiting an unexplored row of lampposts.When they aren't picking apart the efforts of individual writers, Sokal and Bricmont go after entire subfields of bad thinking that have found widespread acceptance among intellectual poseurs. Between-chapters ""intermezzos"" are devoted to ""Epistemic Relativism in the Philosophy of Science"" (i.e., the notion that verifiable physical truth exists only as a cultural ""myth""), ""Chaos Theory and 'Postmodern Science'"" (in which precisely defined scientific notions about predictability and nonlinearity are confounded with their squirrelly linguistic kin), and the abuse of Gödel's theorem and set theory (where very specific mathematical results are generalized to shed light on areas to which they have no connection whatsoever).The literary drawbacks of an intensive debunking of heaps of nonsensical verbosity are immediately obvious. Heedless of the dictates of pleasure or readability, Sokal and Bricmont have selflessly, mercilessly larded their work with extensive quotes from their primary sources. It may be necessary, but the authors' assiduousness does not make for the ""thoroughly hilarious romp through the postmodernist academy"" promised by Barbara Ehrenreich's jacket blurb.There is no romping to speak of. There is true hilarity, but it is on the whole confined to the chapter concerning Irigaray's feminist critique of science. Even readers who have already made their minds up about Lacan and his ilk owe themselves a few minutes at the bookstore discovering such howlers as:""Is E=Mc2 a sexed equation? Perhaps it is. Let us make the hypothesis that it is insofar as it privileges the speed of light over other speeds that are vitally necessary to us. What seems to me to indicate the possibly sexed nature of the equation is not directly its uses by nuclear weapons, rather it is having privileged what goes the fastest...""What makes Irigaray so funny is that she exposes herself with clear writing. Her thinking may be utter hogwash, but her sentences are generally parsable. This is not commonly the case among her peers. Any educated reader who has attempted to skim a dense scientific work he knows he could understand given the time will recognize the appeal of scientific-sounding obfuscation to the nontechnical author. If you aren't proceeding through an equation term by term, your eyes simply bounce off it; its meaning is held in reserve until you take the time to extract it. Nontechnical readers as a rule can't distinguish between meaningful equations and sheer poppycock; their eyes bounce off both. Putting in the time to extract the meaning isn't an option open to them. An impenetrable equation signals erudition even if it has none to offer. And the same is true of a sentence composed of technical gibberish.Sokal and Bricmont are aware of the limits of the scientific purview, as they now stand, and acknowledge the difference between science and everything else. What the authors don't state explicitly (and perhaps do not believe) is that the scientific mind, which prefers precision to poetry, single meanings to double ones, and trudges to leaps, is fundamentally different from the nonscientific one, and that many a pomo misstep has been inspired by a refusal to accept this fact.It's natural to crave science's strengths and to shun its weaknesses; sadly, they come as a matched set. The authority and verifiability of the natural sciences are formidable, but science has been most successful with the simplest, most precisely defined problems. It's no accident that ""Fashionable Nonsense"" was penned by physicists. Physics is the hardest of the sciences; its successful theories have been established with greater mathematical precision than have concepts in any other field of endeavor. But physics works best with things that matter least to outsiders—the arcana of quantum mechanics, for example. Once sucked in by the elegant system presented in freshman physics classes, who isn't at least a little bit disappointed to find that nothing really works as cleanly as it does in its classical estimation? (Quantum mechanics may reveal a physical universe stranger than we could possibly have imagined, but it left this former physics student, at least, pining for the world of Newton. Since the 17th century is unlikely ever again to represent the cutting edge of scientific knowledge, I threw over science for art, dropping out of grad school after three semesters and trading a handful of correct answers for a wealth of pretty good ones.)The trouble with working among what my high school physics teacher called the ""fuzzies"" is that you may feel as if you are right, but you can never prove it. If the fuzzies in question are sociologists, psychologists, linguists, or other quasi-scientists, the temptation will be strong to hijack the certitude of hard science to serve ideas you wish you could be sure about. Although it may be tempting to ascribe malice or lunacy to traffickers in pseudoscience, their quest, however misguided, is really quite poignant. They crave adulation for discovering something demonstrably true about things that, at least when they idealistically set out on their intellectual journeys, were serious ""real-world"" problems.But, as Batman whispered to Lacan, when the theorist lost his grip and slipped away into the bottomless maelstrom of text: ""Poor, deluded child.""Sokal and Bricmont don't abandon all hope for a cross-fertilization of ideas, but I'm not sure that scientists and non-scientists really can talk to each other about the things that really matter to them. And I don't think such a development, because it forces a bit of humility on us, is all bad. Knowledge has fragmented to the point that a degree of specialization is necessary. I'm a generalist at heart, and it pains me to say it, but whenever someone today is called a ""Renaissance man,"" you can bet that the speaker holds a grossly inflated opinion of that person's intellect. The world has simply gotten too big for any one person to get his mind around it. It's been said that Coleridge was the last person to know everything, but I wonder if even he wasn't born too late.Sokal and Bricmont know the genie isn't going back into the bottle, and they dispassionately deliver a corrective to innocents (even belligerent innocents) who think they can sidestep the problem either by usurping the language of science or, having given up on certainty, by discounting science altogether. Tough-minded to a fault, the physicists not only establish the circumstances under which no reasonable interdisciplinary discussion can occur, they also tell us when nonscientists shouldn't be talking at all.

132,0312204078,http://goodreads.com/user/show/38719275-dale-grauman,3,"Read the introduction, both ""intermezzos,"" and the epilogue. These portions lay out good, popular-level critiques of radical skepticism and postmodern mumbo-jumbo. You can skip or skim the rest, which is comprised mostly of long quotations from academic ""theorists"" (i.e., mid-20th-century French philosophers or their disciples) alongside the author's commentary. All of these sections can be summarized as follows:French Academic: [Writes something entirely incomprehensible.]Sokal and Bricmont: ""The preceding passage was entirely incomprehensible. As professional scientists and mathematicians, we assure you that all references to science and mathematics are bogus.""Sometimes they take the time to explain the scientific or mathematical concepts in layman's terms so that readers can understand their critiques more deeply. Often, they do not. If you have already encountered ""theory""(in this particular sense of that term) and are perceptive (cynical?) enough to have concluded that it's willfully obscure, you won't get much out of reading these chapters.On a personal note, the authors made a couple claims that I had arrived at independently, and it was gratifying to see these notions in print:(1) ""Theory"" looks an awful lot like mysticism, and it may make sense to analyze it as a religious movement. (Page 37; they are especially referring to Lacan, here.)(2) Our inability to refute a position fully doesn't mean we have any reason to accept that position. (Page 54; they are especially referring to solipsism.)"
133,0312204078,http://goodreads.com/user/show/10174911-syed-ashrafulla,3,"The premise of the book is very sound. The authors are going after the improper use of fundamental mathematics and physics by philosophers who have run out of ways to confuse readers. Through a myriad of examples, the authors continually discredit the arguments given by postmodernists that try to employ modern physics. Those attacks are very solid. Postmodernists do misunderstand the link between science and philosophy. Sociologists do try to sweep scientific rigor under the rug when convenient.My problem with the book is its style. In an attempt to fortify the arguments against the lawyer-like retorts of the human sciences, they post far too much context. As a result I'm reading too much garbage. I prefer terser quotations with pointed rebuttals. I don't like the pasting of four paragraphs followed by a three line critique. Why not just break it up? Are you worried that the defenders will use the blunt critique of context? That critique is generally stupid anyway, but the authors spent a significant part of the book trying to answer that critique. People like me who don't have a dog in the fight then have to slog through terrible sentence after terrible sentence by philosophers who aim to confuse. Thanks, I thought we were going to avoid that.It's still an ok book. It's probably required reading for anyone in grad school. It's just not that pleasant or coherent a book to read."

I went in expecting more of a general-audience nonfiction work that aims to help lay-persons who are affected by the nonsense peddled by pseudo-mystics like Deepak Chopra whose particular brand of bullshit is hidden under a shiny candy coating of what appears to be a scientific basis.What this actually is reads much more like a scientific journal article. There is a very familiar cadence reminiscent of astrophysics papers I used to read regularly, and it has that exceptionally dry, ordered formatting that is desirable in objective scientific work.This was very enlightening, and it helped a great deal that I was once obsessed with post-modern philosophy and was able to keep up (though it underscores my decision to abandon that particular hobby long ago).If you are already well-versed in philosophical formalism, go for it, though don't expect a particular engaging read even then. It is what it is, there's no fluff. If you follow my reviews and updates, you know how quickly I read; this took me almost a week to get through, which about sums it up.It did work fantastically as a sleep aid on some nights where I found myself drifting off a full hour or more ahead of when I usually hit the wall.If you aren't into dry philosophy and formal logic, then this is definitely a hard pass for you."
135,0312204078,http://goodreads.com/user/show/24452449-zihad-azad,5,"At places, my brain stopped working trying to figure out the meaning of certain excerpts quoted in this book. I think I never recovered from the traumatic experience of reading the line: ""modern war takes place in Non-Euclidean Space"", the great Baudrillardian coinage.I would have said this book has officially run its course, but certain factions of the feminist movement who religiously hew to the ideas of Luce Irigaray restrain me from doing so. As much as I would like to believe otherwise, ideas such as ""modern science is a male construct"" or ""women are bullied out of a career in the natural sciences"" are still perniciously widespread. Thankfully, postmodernism as a philosophical practice has fallen out of favor in the academia. But the ideas put forth in the early 70s have percolated to the forefront of the public consciousness in the 2010s decade. I wish these ideas would eventually wither away. However, there is no such sign on the horizon. Keeping that in mind, I would say this book still retains its necessity. If not the whole thing, read at least a few chapters. These postmodern ideas are so freaking amusing; when they are not downright petrifying. For example, you can always find comic relief in feminist Julia Kristeva's endeavors to explain poetic language in terms of set theory."
136,0312204078,http://goodreads.com/user/show/44761402-jens,4,"There's a youtube clip in which John Searle talks to Foucault about why his writing is so atrocious, even though he can convey his reasonable ideas well in speech. Foucault answers that in France, in order to be taken seriously as an intellectual, at least 10% of what you write should be incomprehensible. Otherwise people just won't think it's ""deep"" or sophisticated. That's probably the biggest part of the problem with broadly postmodern writers, and 10% is a very conservative estimate in this case. Still, some of the philosophers discussed in this book have some genuinely interesting ideas (though not unequivocally true ones). In particular, I think Latour, Deleuze, and Derrida (not covered) have some valuable insights to contribute (though, again, I don't always agree with them, particularly in the case of Derrida). It is just too bad that they think they can score intellectual points in their writings by using scientific terms they don't understand. On the other hand, authors such as Lacan and Kristeva are completely vacuous, while Irigaray is just too ridiculous to be taken seriously. Also, relativism is dumb. No discourse of no length will ever make that a viable way out of a philosophical problem."
137,0312204078,http://goodreads.com/user/show/51799238-stefan-matias,5,"A great illustration of the scientific frauds of the 20th century. It's good to see scientists such as Sokal exposing this 'fashionable nonsense' for what it really is. I'm saddened to say, however, that even 22 years after the publication of his parody 'Transgressing the Boundaries,' we still see the same arguments and the same fashionable nonsense repeated today. What we need is to practice critical thinking, and really understand what it is we're reading and what we're talking about. The subchapter 'For a Dialogue Between the Two Cultures' in the epilogue, it is given some hints on how we are to do this, and is relevant as much now as it was then. The text was mainly structured to illustrate seperate persons who were obscuring their field of study, but I found the intermezzo chapters to be a lot more enlightening. The intermezzo parts and the epilogue were by far my favorite parts, but of course it was important to see how absurd certain individuals on the Left (especially in France) has written and tangled with information in desperate attempts to put their own names in their history books by achieving the paradigm shift of Thomas Kuhn."

FN aims specifically at the abuse of science by Continental theorists, and in so doing, is successful. In the introduction, it is said that they do not make judgments about the whole of anyone's work, only the misappropriations of science by the selected writers. And I applaud this. As for the rest of what these theorists have to say, they aren't wholly a waste of time. Mileage may vary. I find D&G's work stimulating for artists and, for example, their critique of capitalism out of Marx's Fragment on Machines is insightful, and unlike someone below/above, no, Marx is not irrelevant. Anyway, Sokol's points are spot-on and sorely needed. There's no doubt that the Continentals were often obtuse and obscurantist. It simply cannot be denied. But each one of the writers critiqued offer interesting insights and nuanced views on the world and its problems...as long as they spare us their misunderstanding of science. When they abuse that, it's natural that people will be skeptical of the rest of their work. Like David Foster Wallace, who misunderstood infinity, it's not fair to pan the remainder of the work only because of this. But it is a thorn in our sides. "

The only problem I see (and is somewhat justified because Sokal is a physicist) is that he doesn´t seem to understand the concept of paradigm by Kuhn (paradigms don´t relativize, they explain the thought of society in a determined epoch; they mantain in its core the fundamental knowledge and previous advancements of scientific progress) and marxism (dialectical materialism is proven scientifically; it isn´t gibberish nor rethoric, Das Kapital is an entire landmark on economics).

151,0312204078,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5695847-abyy,5,"Sokal and Bricmont launch a devastating critique of the pretentious and obscurantist tendencies of several authors in the pomo canon in this book. Their specific locus of attack is these philosophers' (and I use the term here in a very loose sense) misuse and deliberate abuse of scientific and mathematical concepts as a strategy to embellish and give an aura of credibility to very bad writing. [A caveat: I'm not a philosopher, physicist, mathematician, literary theorist, psychoanalyst or even well acquainted with any of these disciplines so everything I say about this can reasonably be seen as suspect.]Intellectual Impostures was an immensely enjoyable read. It confirmed what I've long suspected about the so-called ""radical"" thought of many pomo writers - that what appears prima facie to be incredibly profound ideas collapse under any sustained rational examination. While Sokal and Bricmont confine themselves to their areas of expertise (physics and mathematics), many of their observations are well taken and apply to the other works and to the other authors who 'do' pomo. As Sokal and Bricmont very ably point out, many of the ideas pomo authors proffer are deliberately written very ambiguously such that they can be read one of two ways - as either trivially true or surprising but false (or a third possibility: hopelessly confused). This book was published a decade ago. I wish I could report that their critiques are now merely of historical interest to a reinvigorated Left - but unfortunately I find their points to be as valid as they were when they were first published. I could go on in this vein for awhile but, to cut my vitriol short, suffice to say I'd strongly recommend to anyone with even a peripheral interest in science, pomo and the relation between them. Intellectual Impostures remains a very timely contribution that serves (hopefully) as a remedy for a Left that has increasingly become politically regressive, intellectually dishonest and, perhaps worst of all, not even wrong."
152,0312204078,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5805110-sweta-gupta,2,"I am in a dilemma in writing a review for this book. It inspired two extreme reactions. On one hand, I found the observations in the book to be hilarious and very well pointed out. On the other hand, I struggled through the 211 pages because the writing style was so dry and non-engaging and consisted largely of what the authors term “fashionable nonsense”: difficult language that sounds extremely profound and complex, but is in fact, meaningless. This book came as a result of Alan Sokal’s hoax, a nonsensical article that he submitted to an American culture studies journal, which was hailed by postmodernists. Of course, Sokal revealed the hoax and the praise of the postmodernists that had come in before the revelation clearly proved that the postmodernists really did not understand even their contemporaries but hailed each others’ work anyway. The book is all about deliberately obscure language and created confusion for the purpose of sounding profound. Needless to say, the writers have received a fair amount of criticism as well.Approximately half (or perhaps a bit more) of the book consists of long passages from the very works the authors are critiquing (ripping apart). And as the authors show in their commentary, those passages are mostly indecipherable gibberish. Reading those puts a serious strain on your mental capacities. I took more than a week to finish this 210 page book, and it was just a very, very painstaking effort.This book requires a fair understanding of conceptual physics and mathematics to understand that the passages reproduced are actually incomprehensible. I would not recommend it to someone who doesn’t have a decent understanding of those. In the epilogue, the authors lay out some broad lessons, which are useful for anyone: know what you are talking about instead of creating ambiguities by using flowery language to conceal your lack of understanding, not all that is obscure is necessarily profound and several others."
153,0312204078,http://goodreads.com/user/show/20247815-stephen,5,"Excellent discussion of the specific instances of postmodern writers in already-nebulous ""critical"" disciplines invoking scientific and mathematical concepts to equivocate (or spew outright gibberish!) under the guise of borrowing credence and rigor. Entertainingly written with a mind toward parsimony and specificity of argument that reflects the authors' backgrounds in scientific methodology without robbing the text of levity or accessibility. The epilogue is veers into op-ed territory - but in a good way: the authors emphasize the importance of precise, contextual, and intellectually honest articulation not only in academia, but as a discursive basis for broader social and intellectual projects that shape the course of society. A powerful read for anyone passionate about the sciences and chagrined by the creeping vacuity of the pseudo-intellectualism that infests the postmodern segment of the academy."
154,0312204078,http://goodreads.com/user/show/279997-llew,4,"By themselves, the quotes used in this book are some of the finest examples of academic horseshit one might ever hope to come across. I still love a good meandering philosophy tome, but there is something highly important about what Sokal and company are doing here. This idea that, at a certain point, abusing science and math to continue your ideas is dumbing down the populace. That relativism may be used for cultural anthropology, but it needs to be abandoned when used in scientific understanding. There's some leeway given to Baudrillard who is given his own chapter, yet I still appreciate, as i think people understand that he's being ridiculous and not necessarily putting across formal theses. Lacan on the other hand, where he's giving a formal argument based on flawed understanding of well-known scientific ideas, comes across as just sad. Sokal knows his science, and they give good counter-proof that, no Quantum Relativity of the mind doesn't make sense and that's not how topology works, although the book fails when they try to provide a proper philosophy of science and epistemology. They give some time try to argue down questions like, ""how do we know this is reality"", and it meanders like the texts they are critiquing. Still, very essential that they wrote this. "
155,0312204078,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1841544-chris,3,"On display is lots of nonsense written in the postmodern tradition, specifically by philosophers that can basically be classified as epistemic relativists. In the first several chapters, the responses by the authors to absurd passages from Lacan and Kristeva are quite detailed. As the book goes on, punctuated by several intermezzo chapters which give some background, much of the commentary becomes lazy. The authors begin to appeal to the self-evidence of the ridiculousness on display.Occasionally the authors' criticism seems like nitpicking, and I can't shake the feeling that the book would have benefitted from some back and forth, offering at least some defense of selected passages before a complete dismantling of the postmodern arguments. Don't get me wrong, I would NEVER defend any of the intellectual traditions the book lampoons. But you know the people that wrote these passages (or their disciples) would have responses to the obvious technical errors which the book frequently points out pepper their arguments. No doubt that these responses would be just as incomprehensible as the original arguments, buttressing the notion that they are just masters of manipulating erudite language and peddling pretentiousness.A fun read for the quote mining, but it probably could have been done better."
156,0312204078,http://goodreads.com/user/show/12638036-haaris-mateen,4,"Sokal and Bricmont bring balance to the Force. The overkill of relativism and scientism that had infected most of the social sciences and humanities couldn't have done with a better beneficial shock. Alas, the currents exposed still exist in the discourse of the Left, and it is perhaps one of the biggest flaws that exist in the battle against the poisonous populism insidiously rising the world over. The rise of the Post Truth world cannot be blamed solely on the ""other side"". This book (now almost twenty years old) reminds us of the pitfalls of choosing radical skepticism, a way of thought that isolates itself from reality and which allows dangerous deliverers to thrive; and a line of thinking which only university grads are equipped to even access (though not with any benefit to the world)."
157,0312204078,http://goodreads.com/user/show/44290999-jjonas,2,"2.5 stars.In the 'Afterword' to the original ""Sokal affair"" paper (which is the last item in this book), Sokal quotes C. P. Snow's view in Two cultures:""A good many times I have been present at gatherings of people who, by the standars of the traditional culture, are thought highly educated and who have with considerable gusto been expressing their incredulity at the illiteracy of scientists. Once or twice I have been provoked and have asked the company how many of them could describe the Second Law of Thermodynamics. The response was cold: it was also negative. Yet I was asking something which is about the scientific equivalent of: Have you read a work of Shakespeare's? [...] [T]he great edifice of modern physics goes up, and the majority of the cleverest people in the western world have about as much insight into it as their neolithic ancestors would have had."" (p. 276-277)Sokal notes:""One significant change has taken place since C. P. Snow's time: while humanist intellectuals' ignorance about (for example) mass and acceleration remains substantially unchanged, nowadays a significant minority of humanist intellectuals feels entitled to pontificate on these subjects in spite of their ignorance"" (p. 277).I take this to be the original motivation for writing the ""Sokal hoax paper"" and this book. And Sokal and Bricmont do make a good point about posturing intellectuals using frivolous analogies in their philosophy etc. texts to mathematics and physics which said authors don't really understand — and even if they did, do they really expect their likely readership to understand them without explicit clarification about why the chosen analogy is useful. I believe S & B demonstrate this satisfactorily and to good effect.(It should be noted in passing that it's not only some humanists and social scientists who are guilty of ignorance of other fields; e.g. someone like Steven Pinker has strayed ever further from his homebase in psychology and the study of language and written broad-stroke works with sweeping conclusions about history, liberalism etc. where he's not really the expert. Or consider economists, who get to be interviewed about politics, foreign relations, environmental issues etc., as if they've become some kind of universal intellectuals.)However, S & B are not on equally strong ground when they declare the quoted passages — which sure do look embarrassing — simply nonsense. I would agree they're nonsense as far as the language lifted from natural science and mathematics is concerned, but I think S & B might be guilty of somewhat comparable arrogance as their targets by proclaiming the quotes simply nonsensical, meaningless etc. — in all respects, not just in terms of the physics terminology etc.I think many people who praise this book are a bit too eager to strike at pomos with whatever they've got (something that I'm not totally unsympathetic towards, by the way) and disregard this side of the work. In fact, some seem to see the book (including people who probably haven't read it) as a wholesale condemnation of, if not a fatal blow to, postmodernism, which however is something that the authors don't even claim to do. Instead they've set themselves a far narrower task: to call out reckless use of concepts lifted from physics etc. with the intention of lending philosophical texts some rigour, respectability or whatever. That's a far cry from ""destroying postmodernism"" or whatever.Now, it does seem obvious to me that the ""pomo"" authors in questions are guilty of the most blatant kind of posturing, obfuscation and pretense one can imagine, and that stripped of the verbiage, what they have to say would turn out to be much less impressive than it appears (though not necessarily banal). So overall, I'm partial to what S & B are doing, for like them I'm a believer in objective physical reality independent of human (or other) consciousness, while — again, like them — not denying at all the sense in the moderate version of ""social construction of reality"" as a corrective to what S & B call ""naive modernism"" (p. 183).But I think S & B are wrong if they expect they can (or should) understand philosophical etc. texts as easily as if they were reading the newspaper. Personally I'm inclined to think that what Lacan, Kristeva etc. have to say is much more ordinary than it would appear at first sight (and much of it nonsense to boot), but I don't believe that S & B are significantly more qualified to make that call than I am. Our difference is that I didn't (and wouldn't) write a book about it.The chapters that picked apart scienced up pomo quotes were the least fun to read, and unfortunately that's more than half of the book. No doubt the chapters were necessary to drive the main point home, but reading it was hard work and the content was repetitive, and I confess I didn't read much of the quoted materials (some of the quotes were several pages long). In contrast, the ""intermezzo chapters"" that dealt with more general questions of philosophy of science and relativism were the most useful ones to me.The book ends with the original ""Sokal affair"" article and a chapter which explains what was fishy about it. While I believe that Social Text is to blame for publishing stuff the subject matter of which they didn't understand, I'm also somewhat sympathetic towards the argument that in a journal like Social Text it's not necessarily the editors' duty to weed out wild and unconventional ideas but instead let the readership judge for themselves whether (some of) the ideas in some article merit any attention."

160,0312204078,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1785447-david-glenn-dixon,4,"Washington City PaperArts & Entertainment : Book ReviewLiberté, Egalité, ObscuritéBy Glenn Dixon • March 12, 1999""If there's no math in it, it isn't science."" Thus went the rejoinder propellerheads offered religious enthusiasts when, in the '80s, hinterland zealots attempted to get Genesis taught in public schools under the rubric of ""creation science."" But what of the inverse? If there is math in it, is science an inevitability? As any kid who sat through the first month of Mr. Glahn's 9th-grade geometry class can tell you, the second statement doesn't necessarily follow from the first.Over the past 30 years or so, an entire generation of psychoanalysts, literary theorists, cult-studs, and other postmodern types has made hay by virtue of the fact that its readers lack the benefit of my math teacher's wisdom. By the mid-'90s the problem had gotten far enough out of hand that New York University physics prof Alan Sokal felt compelled to cook up a heady stew of anti-scientific pigheadedness and pseudotechnical misprision, season it liberally with quotes from such theoretical leading lights as Jacques Lacan, Gilles Deleuze and Félix Guattari, and Luce Irigaray, and set the steaming dish down in front of the editors of the Duke University Press cultural-studies journal ""Social Text""—who promptly served it up in their Spring/Summer 1996 issue.Sokal then outed himself, exposing his parody in an article rejected by ""Social Text,"" which judged the correction to the published goof beneath its ""intellectual standards."" ""Dissent"" and ""Philosophy and Literature"" picked up the second piece, but by the time they hit the stacks the popular press had already had a field day with Sokal's prank.Needless to say, ""Social Text"" editors Andrew Ross and Stanley Aronowitz weren't amused. Nor were the hordes of tenured radicals who had built their careers on what had been exposed as institutionally codified idiocy. They counterattacked, and now Sokal has teamed up with Belgium-based theoretical physicist Jean Bricmont (it helps to have a Francophone on your side in such matters) to respond with a book-length popular treatment of postmodern ideological excess and methodological madness.Chapter by chapter, Sokal and Bricmont calmly, meticulously tear new assholes for Lacan, Deleuze and Guattari, Irigaray, Julia Kristeva, Bruno Latour, Jean Baudrillard, and Paul Virilio. The physicists aren't staging some sort of anti-theoretical pogrom; they're just standing up for rationality. Jacques Derrida keeps his hands off science; Sokal and Bricmont keep their hands off Derrida. They refuse even to judge the theorists' overall programs, limiting their criticisms to their areas of expertise and suggesting that their targets could have benefited from similar circumspection.What they reveal is scandalous. Lacan indulges a fondness for topology, which he barely understands, and suffers a penchant for arbitrary metaphors, which he often refuses to acknowledge as anything other than literal truths. Kristeva does the same with set theory. Virilio misunderstands concepts that are covered in the first week of 11th-grade physics. Almost everybody jumps from one discipline to another with the mindless alacrity of a puppy visiting an unexplored row of lampposts.When they aren't picking apart the efforts of individual writers, Sokal and Bricmont go after entire subfields of bad thinking that have found widespread acceptance among intellectual poseurs. Between-chapters ""intermezzos"" are devoted to ""Epistemic Relativism in the Philosophy of Science"" (i.e., the notion that verifiable physical truth exists only as a cultural ""myth""), ""Chaos Theory and 'Postmodern Science'"" (in which precisely defined scientific notions about predictability and nonlinearity are confounded with their squirrelly linguistic kin), and the abuse of Gödel's theorem and set theory (where very specific mathematical results are generalized to shed light on areas to which they have no connection whatsoever).The literary drawbacks of an intensive debunking of heaps of nonsensical verbosity are immediately obvious. Heedless of the dictates of pleasure or readability, Sokal and Bricmont have selflessly, mercilessly larded their work with extensive quotes from their primary sources. It may be necessary, but the authors' assiduousness does not make for the ""thoroughly hilarious romp through the postmodernist academy"" promised by Barbara Ehrenreich's jacket blurb.There is no romping to speak of. There is true hilarity, but it is on the whole confined to the chapter concerning Irigaray's feminist critique of science. Even readers who have already made their minds up about Lacan and his ilk owe themselves a few minutes at the bookstore discovering such howlers as:""Is E=Mc2 a sexed equation? Perhaps it is. Let us make the hypothesis that it is insofar as it privileges the speed of light over other speeds that are vitally necessary to us. What seems to me to indicate the possibly sexed nature of the equation is not directly its uses by nuclear weapons, rather it is having privileged what goes the fastest...""What makes Irigaray so funny is that she exposes herself with clear writing. Her thinking may be utter hogwash, but her sentences are generally parsable. This is not commonly the case among her peers. Any educated reader who has attempted to skim a dense scientific work he knows he could understand given the time will recognize the appeal of scientific-sounding obfuscation to the nontechnical author. If you aren't proceeding through an equation term by term, your eyes simply bounce off it; its meaning is held in reserve until you take the time to extract it. Nontechnical readers as a rule can't distinguish between meaningful equations and sheer poppycock; their eyes bounce off both. Putting in the time to extract the meaning isn't an option open to them. An impenetrable equation signals erudition even if it has none to offer. And the same is true of a sentence composed of technical gibberish.Sokal and Bricmont are aware of the limits of the scientific purview, as they now stand, and acknowledge the difference between science and everything else. What the authors don't state explicitly (and perhaps do not believe) is that the scientific mind, which prefers precision to poetry, single meanings to double ones, and trudges to leaps, is fundamentally different from the nonscientific one, and that many a pomo misstep has been inspired by a refusal to accept this fact.It's natural to crave science's strengths and to shun its weaknesses; sadly, they come as a matched set. The authority and verifiability of the natural sciences are formidable, but science has been most successful with the simplest, most precisely defined problems. It's no accident that ""Fashionable Nonsense"" was penned by physicists. Physics is the hardest of the sciences; its successful theories have been established with greater mathematical precision than have concepts in any other field of endeavor. But physics works best with things that matter least to outsiders—the arcana of quantum mechanics, for example. Once sucked in by the elegant system presented in freshman physics classes, who isn't at least a little bit disappointed to find that nothing really works as cleanly as it does in its classical estimation? (Quantum mechanics may reveal a physical universe stranger than we could possibly have imagined, but it left this former physics student, at least, pining for the world of Newton. Since the 17th century is unlikely ever again to represent the cutting edge of scientific knowledge, I threw over science for art, dropping out of grad school after three semesters and trading a handful of correct answers for a wealth of pretty good ones.)The trouble with working among what my high school physics teacher called the ""fuzzies"" is that you may feel as if you are right, but you can never prove it. If the fuzzies in question are sociologists, psychologists, linguists, or other quasi-scientists, the temptation will be strong to hijack the certitude of hard science to serve ideas you wish you could be sure about. Although it may be tempting to ascribe malice or lunacy to traffickers in pseudoscience, their quest, however misguided, is really quite poignant. They crave adulation for discovering something demonstrably true about things that, at least when they idealistically set out on their intellectual journeys, were serious ""real-world"" problems.But, as Batman whispered to Lacan, when the theorist lost his grip and slipped away into the bottomless maelstrom of text: ""Poor, deluded child.""Sokal and Bricmont don't abandon all hope for a cross-fertilization of ideas, but I'm not sure that scientists and non-scientists really can talk to each other about the things that really matter to them. And I don't think such a development, because it forces a bit of humility on us, is all bad. Knowledge has fragmented to the point that a degree of specialization is necessary. I'm a generalist at heart, and it pains me to say it, but whenever someone today is called a ""Renaissance man,"" you can bet that the speaker holds a grossly inflated opinion of that person's intellect. The world has simply gotten too big for any one person to get his mind around it. It's been said that Coleridge was the last person to know everything, but I wonder if even he wasn't born too late.Sokal and Bricmont know the genie isn't going back into the bottle, and they dispassionately deliver a corrective to innocents (even belligerent innocents) who think they can sidestep the problem either by usurping the language of science or, having given up on certainty, by discounting science altogether. Tough-minded to a fault, the physicists not only establish the circumstances under which no reasonable interdisciplinary discussion can occur, they also tell us when nonscientists shouldn't be talking at all.

162,0312204078,http://goodreads.com/user/show/38719275-dale-grauman,3,"Read the introduction, both ""intermezzos,"" and the epilogue. These portions lay out good, popular-level critiques of radical skepticism and postmodern mumbo-jumbo. You can skip or skim the rest, which is comprised mostly of long quotations from academic ""theorists"" (i.e., mid-20th-century French philosophers or their disciples) alongside the author's commentary. All of these sections can be summarized as follows:French Academic: [Writes something entirely incomprehensible.]Sokal and Bricmont: ""The preceding passage was entirely incomprehensible. As professional scientists and mathematicians, we assure you that all references to science and mathematics are bogus.""Sometimes they take the time to explain the scientific or mathematical concepts in layman's terms so that readers can understand their critiques more deeply. Often, they do not. If you have already encountered ""theory""(in this particular sense of that term) and are perceptive (cynical?) enough to have concluded that it's willfully obscure, you won't get much out of reading these chapters.On a personal note, the authors made a couple claims that I had arrived at independently, and it was gratifying to see these notions in print:(1) ""Theory"" looks an awful lot like mysticism, and it may make sense to analyze it as a religious movement. (Page 37; they are especially referring to Lacan, here.)(2) Our inability to refute a position fully doesn't mean we have any reason to accept that position. (Page 54; they are especially referring to solipsism.)"
163,0312204078,http://goodreads.com/user/show/10174911-syed-ashrafulla,3,"The premise of the book is very sound. The authors are going after the improper use of fundamental mathematics and physics by philosophers who have run out of ways to confuse readers. Through a myriad of examples, the authors continually discredit the arguments given by postmodernists that try to employ modern physics. Those attacks are very solid. Postmodernists do misunderstand the link between science and philosophy. Sociologists do try to sweep scientific rigor under the rug when convenient.My problem with the book is its style. In an attempt to fortify the arguments against the lawyer-like retorts of the human sciences, they post far too much context. As a result I'm reading too much garbage. I prefer terser quotations with pointed rebuttals. I don't like the pasting of four paragraphs followed by a three line critique. Why not just break it up? Are you worried that the defenders will use the blunt critique of context? That critique is generally stupid anyway, but the authors spent a significant part of the book trying to answer that critique. People like me who don't have a dog in the fight then have to slog through terrible sentence after terrible sentence by philosophers who aim to confuse. Thanks, I thought we were going to avoid that.It's still an ok book. It's probably required reading for anyone in grad school. It's just not that pleasant or coherent a book to read."

I went in expecting more of a general-audience nonfiction work that aims to help lay-persons who are affected by the nonsense peddled by pseudo-mystics like Deepak Chopra whose particular brand of bullshit is hidden under a shiny candy coating of what appears to be a scientific basis.What this actually is reads much more like a scientific journal article. There is a very familiar cadence reminiscent of astrophysics papers I used to read regularly, and it has that exceptionally dry, ordered formatting that is desirable in objective scientific work.This was very enlightening, and it helped a great deal that I was once obsessed with post-modern philosophy and was able to keep up (though it underscores my decision to abandon that particular hobby long ago).If you are already well-versed in philosophical formalism, go for it, though don't expect a particular engaging read even then. It is what it is, there's no fluff. If you follow my reviews and updates, you know how quickly I read; this took me almost a week to get through, which about sums it up.It did work fantastically as a sleep aid on some nights where I found myself drifting off a full hour or more ahead of when I usually hit the wall.If you aren't into dry philosophy and formal logic, then this is definitely a hard pass for you."

I think I never recovered from the traumatic experience of reading the line: ""modern war takes place in Non-Euclidean Space"", the great Baudrillardian coinage.I would have said this book has officially run its course, but certain factions of the feminist movement who religiously hew to the ideas of Luce Irigaray restrain me from doing so. As much as I would like to believe otherwise, ideas such as ""modern science is a male construct"" or ""women are bullied out of a career in the natural sciences"" are still perniciously widespread. Thankfully, postmodernism as a philosophical practice has fallen out of favor in the academia. But the ideas put forth in the early 70s have percolated to the forefront of the public consciousness in the 2010s decade. I wish these ideas would eventually wither away. However, there is no such sign on the horizon. Keeping that in mind, I would say this book still retains its necessity. If not the whole thing, read at least a few chapters. These postmodern ideas are so freaking amusing; when they are not downright petrifying. For example, you can always find comic relief in feminist Julia Kristeva's endeavors to explain poetic language in terms of set theory."
166,0312204078,http://goodreads.com/user/show/44761402-jens,4,"There's a youtube clip in which John Searle talks to Foucault about why his writing is so atrocious, even though he can convey his reasonable ideas well in speech. Foucault answers that in France, in order to be taken seriously as an intellectual, at least 10% of what you write should be incomprehensible. Otherwise people just won't think it's ""deep"" or sophisticated. That's probably the biggest part of the problem with broadly postmodern writers, and 10% is a very conservative estimate in this case. Still, some of the philosophers discussed in this book have some genuinely interesting ideas (though not unequivocally true ones). In particular, I think Latour, Deleuze, and Derrida (not covered) have some valuable insights to contribute (though, again, I don't always agree with them, particularly in the case of Derrida). It is just too bad that they think they can score intellectual points in their writings by using scientific terms they don't understand. On the other hand, authors such as Lacan and Kristeva are completely vacuous, while Irigaray is just too ridiculous to be taken seriously. Also, relativism is dumb. No discourse of no length will ever make that a viable way out of a philosophical problem."

It's good to see scientists such as Sokal exposing this 'fashionable nonsense' for what it really is. I'm saddened to say, however, that even 22 years after the publication of his parody 'Transgressing the Boundaries,' we still see the same arguments and the same fashionable nonsense repeated today. What we need is to practice critical thinking, and really understand what it is we're reading and what we're talking about. The subchapter 'For a Dialogue Between the Two Cultures' in the epilogue, it is given some hints on how we are to do this, and is relevant as much now as it was then. The text was mainly structured to illustrate seperate persons who were obscuring their field of study, but I found the intermezzo chapters to be a lot more enlightening. The intermezzo parts and the epilogue were by far my favorite parts, but of course it was important to see how absurd certain individuals on the Left (especially in France) has written and tangled with information in desperate attempts to put their own names in their history books by achieving the paradigm shift of Thomas Kuhn."

FN aims specifically at the abuse of science by Continental theorists, and in so doing, is successful. In the introduction, it is said that they do not make judgments about the whole of anyone's work, only the misappropriations of science by the selected writers. And I applaud this. As for the rest of what these theorists have to say, they aren't wholly a waste of time. Mileage may vary. I find D&G's work stimulating for artists and, for example, their critique of capitalism out of Marx's Fragment on Machines is insightful, and unlike someone below/above, no, Marx is not irrelevant. Anyway, Sokol's points are spot-on and sorely needed. There's no doubt that the Continentals were often obtuse and obscurantist. It simply cannot be denied. But each one of the writers critiqued offer interesting insights and nuanced views on the world and its problems...as long as they spare us their misunderstanding of science. When they abuse that, it's natural that people will be skeptical of the rest of their work. Like David Foster Wallace, who misunderstood infinity, it's not fair to pan the remainder of the work only because of this. But it is a thorn in our sides. "

180,0312204078,http://goodreads.com/user/show/14115149-jaclynn,4,"Very good book to read if you want to dissect postmodern arguments. Not accessible for the beginner just being introduced to these concepts, and honestly, I skipped a lot of the writing dealing with advanced mathematics and scientific theory. What I found most useful were the tools to spot the general arguments postmodernist use to confuse, deflect and create nonsense with."
181,0312204078,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5695847-abyy,5,"Sokal and Bricmont launch a devastating critique of the pretentious and obscurantist tendencies of several authors in the pomo canon in this book. Their specific locus of attack is these philosophers' (and I use the term here in a very loose sense) misuse and deliberate abuse of scientific and mathematical concepts as a strategy to embellish and give an aura of credibility to very bad writing. [A caveat: I'm not a philosopher, physicist, mathematician, literary theorist, psychoanalyst or even well acquainted with any of these disciplines so everything I say about this can reasonably be seen as suspect.]Intellectual Impostures was an immensely enjoyable read. It confirmed what I've long suspected about the so-called ""radical"" thought of many pomo writers - that what appears prima facie to be incredibly profound ideas collapse under any sustained rational examination. While Sokal and Bricmont confine themselves to their areas of expertise (physics and mathematics), many of their observations are well taken and apply to the other works and to the other authors who 'do' pomo. As Sokal and Bricmont very ably point out, many of the ideas pomo authors proffer are deliberately written very ambiguously such that they can be read one of two ways - as either trivially true or surprising but false (or a third possibility: hopelessly confused). This book was published a decade ago. I wish I could report that their critiques are now merely of historical interest to a reinvigorated Left - but unfortunately I find their points to be as valid as they were when they were first published. I could go on in this vein for awhile but, to cut my vitriol short, suffice to say I'd strongly recommend to anyone with even a peripheral interest in science, pomo and the relation between them. Intellectual Impostures remains a very timely contribution that serves (hopefully) as a remedy for a Left that has increasingly become politically regressive, intellectually dishonest and, perhaps worst of all, not even wrong."
182,0312204078,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5805110-sweta-gupta,2,"I am in a dilemma in writing a review for this book. It inspired two extreme reactions. On one hand, I found the observations in the book to be hilarious and very well pointed out. On the other hand, I struggled through the 211 pages because the writing style was so dry and non-engaging and consisted largely of what the authors term “fashionable nonsense”: difficult language that sounds extremely profound and complex, but is in fact, meaningless. This book came as a result of Alan Sokal’s hoax, a nonsensical article that he submitted to an American culture studies journal, which was hailed by postmodernists. Of course, Sokal revealed the hoax and the praise of the postmodernists that had come in before the revelation clearly proved that the postmodernists really did not understand even their contemporaries but hailed each others’ work anyway. The book is all about deliberately obscure language and created confusion for the purpose of sounding profound. Needless to say, the writers have received a fair amount of criticism as well.Approximately half (or perhaps a bit more) of the book consists of long passages from the very works the authors are critiquing (ripping apart). And as the authors show in their commentary, those passages are mostly indecipherable gibberish. Reading those puts a serious strain on your mental capacities. I took more than a week to finish this 210 page book, and it was just a very, very painstaking effort.This book requires a fair understanding of conceptual physics and mathematics to understand that the passages reproduced are actually incomprehensible. I would not recommend it to someone who doesn’t have a decent understanding of those. In the epilogue, the authors lay out some broad lessons, which are useful for anyone: know what you are talking about instead of creating ambiguities by using flowery language to conceal your lack of understanding, not all that is obscure is necessarily profound and several others."
183,0312204078,http://goodreads.com/user/show/20247815-stephen,5,"Excellent discussion of the specific instances of postmodern writers in already-nebulous ""critical"" disciplines invoking scientific and mathematical concepts to equivocate (or spew outright gibberish!) under the guise of borrowing credence and rigor. Entertainingly written with a mind toward parsimony and specificity of argument that reflects the authors' backgrounds in scientific methodology without robbing the text of levity or accessibility. The epilogue is veers into op-ed territory - but in a good way: the authors emphasize the importance of precise, contextual, and intellectually honest articulation not only in academia, but as a discursive basis for broader social and intellectual projects that shape the course of society. A powerful read for anyone passionate about the sciences and chagrined by the creeping vacuity of the pseudo-intellectualism that infests the postmodern segment of the academy."
184,0312204078,http://goodreads.com/user/show/279997-llew,4,"By themselves, the quotes used in this book are some of the finest examples of academic horseshit one might ever hope to come across. I still love a good meandering philosophy tome, but there is something highly important about what Sokal and company are doing here. This idea that, at a certain point, abusing science and math to continue your ideas is dumbing down the populace. That relativism may be used for cultural anthropology, but it needs to be abandoned when used in scientific understanding. There's some leeway given to Baudrillard who is given his own chapter, yet I still appreciate, as i think people understand that he's being ridiculous and not necessarily putting across formal theses. Lacan on the other hand, where he's giving a formal argument based on flawed understanding of well-known scientific ideas, comes across as just sad. Sokal knows his science, and they give good counter-proof that, no Quantum Relativity of the mind doesn't make sense and that's not how topology works, although the book fails when they try to provide a proper philosophy of science and epistemology. They give some time try to argue down questions like, ""how do we know this is reality"", and it meanders like the texts they are critiquing. Still, very essential that they wrote this. "
185,0312204078,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1841544-chris,3,"On display is lots of nonsense written in the postmodern tradition, specifically by philosophers that can basically be classified as epistemic relativists. In the first several chapters, the responses by the authors to absurd passages from Lacan and Kristeva are quite detailed. As the book goes on, punctuated by several intermezzo chapters which give some background, much of the commentary becomes lazy. The authors begin to appeal to the self-evidence of the ridiculousness on display.Occasionally the authors' criticism seems like nitpicking, and I can't shake the feeling that the book would have benefitted from some back and forth, offering at least some defense of selected passages before a complete dismantling of the postmodern arguments. Don't get me wrong, I would NEVER defend any of the intellectual traditions the book lampoons. But you know the people that wrote these passages (or their disciples) would have responses to the obvious technical errors which the book frequently points out pepper their arguments. No doubt that these responses would be just as incomprehensible as the original arguments, buttressing the notion that they are just masters of manipulating erudite language and peddling pretentiousness.A fun read for the quote mining, but it probably could have been done better."
186,0312204078,http://goodreads.com/user/show/12638036-haaris-mateen,4,"Sokal and Bricmont bring balance to the Force. The overkill of relativism and scientism that had infected most of the social sciences and humanities couldn't have done with a better beneficial shock. Alas, the currents exposed still exist in the discourse of the Left, and it is perhaps one of the biggest flaws that exist in the battle against the poisonous populism insidiously rising the world over. The rise of the Post Truth world cannot be blamed solely on the ""other side"". This book (now almost twenty years old) reminds us of the pitfalls of choosing radical skepticism, a way of thought that isolates itself from reality and which allows dangerous deliverers to thrive; and a line of thinking which only university grads are equipped to even access (though not with any benefit to the world)."
187,0312204078,http://goodreads.com/user/show/44290999-jjonas,2,"2.5 stars.In the 'Afterword' to the original ""Sokal affair"" paper (which is the last item in this book), Sokal quotes C. P. Snow's view in Two cultures:""A good many times I have been present at gatherings of people who, by the standars of the traditional culture, are thought highly educated and who have with considerable gusto been expressing their incredulity at the illiteracy of scientists. Once or twice I have been provoked and have asked the company how many of them could describe the Second Law of Thermodynamics. The response was cold: it was also negative. Yet I was asking something which is about the scientific equivalent of: Have you read a work of Shakespeare's? [...] [T]he great edifice of modern physics goes up, and the majority of the cleverest people in the western world have about as much insight into it as their neolithic ancestors would have had."" (p. 276-277)Sokal notes:""One significant change has taken place since C. P. Snow's time: while humanist intellectuals' ignorance about (for example) mass and acceleration remains substantially unchanged, nowadays a significant minority of humanist intellectuals feels entitled to pontificate on these subjects in spite of their ignorance"" (p. 277).I take this to be the original motivation for writing the ""Sokal hoax paper"" and this book. And Sokal and Bricmont do make a good point about posturing intellectuals using frivolous analogies in their philosophy etc. texts to mathematics and physics which said authors don't really understand — and even if they did, do they really expect their likely readership to understand them without explicit clarification about why the chosen analogy is useful. I believe S & B demonstrate this satisfactorily and to good effect.(It should be noted in passing that it's not only some humanists and social scientists who are guilty of ignorance of other fields; e.g. someone like Steven Pinker has strayed ever further from his homebase in psychology and the study of language and written broad-stroke works with sweeping conclusions about history, liberalism etc. where he's not really the expert. Or consider economists, who get to be interviewed about politics, foreign relations, environmental issues etc., as if they've become some kind of universal intellectuals.)However, S & B are not on equally strong ground when they declare the quoted passages — which sure do look embarrassing — simply nonsense. I would agree they're nonsense as far as the language lifted from natural science and mathematics is concerned, but I think S & B might be guilty of somewhat comparable arrogance as their targets by proclaiming the quotes simply nonsensical, meaningless etc. — in all respects, not just in terms of the physics terminology etc.I think many people who praise this book are a bit too eager to strike at pomos with whatever they've got (something that I'm not totally unsympathetic towards, by the way) and disregard this side of the work. In fact, some seem to see the book (including people who probably haven't read it) as a wholesale condemnation of, if not a fatal blow to, postmodernism, which however is something that the authors don't even claim to do. Instead they've set themselves a far narrower task: to call out reckless use of concepts lifted from physics etc. with the intention of lending philosophical texts some rigour, respectability or whatever. That's a far cry from ""destroying postmodernism"" or whatever.Now, it does seem obvious to me that the ""pomo"" authors in questions are guilty of the most blatant kind of posturing, obfuscation and pretense one can imagine, and that stripped of the verbiage, what they have to say would turn out to be much less impressive than it appears (though not necessarily banal). So overall, I'm partial to what S & B are doing, for like them I'm a believer in objective physical reality independent of human (or other) consciousness, while — again, like them — not denying at all the sense in the moderate version of ""social construction of reality"" as a corrective to what S & B call ""naive modernism"" (p. 183).But I think S & B are wrong if they expect they can (or should) understand philosophical etc. texts as easily as if they were reading the newspaper. Personally I'm inclined to think that what Lacan, Kristeva etc. have to say is much more ordinary than it would appear at first sight (and much of it nonsense to boot), but I don't believe that S & B are significantly more qualified to make that call than I am. Our difference is that I didn't (and wouldn't) write a book about it.The chapters that picked apart scienced up pomo quotes were the least fun to read, and unfortunately that's more than half of the book. No doubt the chapters were necessary to drive the main point home, but reading it was hard work and the content was repetitive, and I confess I didn't read much of the quoted materials (some of the quotes were several pages long). In contrast, the ""intermezzo chapters"" that dealt with more general questions of philosophy of science and relativism were the most useful ones to me.The book ends with the original ""Sokal affair"" article and a chapter which explains what was fishy about it. While I believe that Social Text is to blame for publishing stuff the subject matter of which they didn't understand, I'm also somewhat sympathetic towards the argument that in a journal like Social Text it's not necessarily the editors' duty to weed out wild and unconventional ideas but instead let the readership judge for themselves whether (some of) the ideas in some article merit any attention."

190,0312204078,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1785447-david-glenn-dixon,4,"Washington City PaperArts & Entertainment : Book ReviewLiberté, Egalité, ObscuritéBy Glenn Dixon • March 12, 1999""If there's no math in it, it isn't science."" Thus went the rejoinder propellerheads offered religious enthusiasts when, in the '80s, hinterland zealots attempted to get Genesis taught in public schools under the rubric of ""creation science."" But what of the inverse? If there is math in it, is science an inevitability? As any kid who sat through the first month of Mr. Glahn's 9th-grade geometry class can tell you, the second statement doesn't necessarily follow from the first.Over the past 30 years or so, an entire generation of psychoanalysts, literary theorists, cult-studs, and other postmodern types has made hay by virtue of the fact that its readers lack the benefit of my math teacher's wisdom. By the mid-'90s the problem had gotten far enough out of hand that New York University physics prof Alan Sokal felt compelled to cook up a heady stew of anti-scientific pigheadedness and pseudotechnical misprision, season it liberally with quotes from such theoretical leading lights as Jacques Lacan, Gilles Deleuze and Félix Guattari, and Luce Irigaray, and set the steaming dish down in front of the editors of the Duke University Press cultural-studies journal ""Social Text""—who promptly served it up in their Spring/Summer 1996 issue.Sokal then outed himself, exposing his parody in an article rejected by ""Social Text,"" which judged the correction to the published goof beneath its ""intellectual standards."" ""Dissent"" and ""Philosophy and Literature"" picked up the second piece, but by the time they hit the stacks the popular press had already had a field day with Sokal's prank.Needless to say, ""Social Text"" editors Andrew Ross and Stanley Aronowitz weren't amused. Nor were the hordes of tenured radicals who had built their careers on what had been exposed as institutionally codified idiocy. They counterattacked, and now Sokal has teamed up with Belgium-based theoretical physicist Jean Bricmont (it helps to have a Francophone on your side in such matters) to respond with a book-length popular treatment of postmodern ideological excess and methodological madness.Chapter by chapter, Sokal and Bricmont calmly, meticulously tear new assholes for Lacan, Deleuze and Guattari, Irigaray, Julia Kristeva, Bruno Latour, Jean Baudrillard, and Paul Virilio. The physicists aren't staging some sort of anti-theoretical pogrom; they're just standing up for rationality. Jacques Derrida keeps his hands off science; Sokal and Bricmont keep their hands off Derrida. They refuse even to judge the theorists' overall programs, limiting their criticisms to their areas of expertise and suggesting that their targets could have benefited from similar circumspection.What they reveal is scandalous. Lacan indulges a fondness for topology, which he barely understands, and suffers a penchant for arbitrary metaphors, which he often refuses to acknowledge as anything other than literal truths. Kristeva does the same with set theory. Virilio misunderstands concepts that are covered in the first week of 11th-grade physics. Almost everybody jumps from one discipline to another with the mindless alacrity of a puppy visiting an unexplored row of lampposts.When they aren't picking apart the efforts of individual writers, Sokal and Bricmont go after entire subfields of bad thinking that have found widespread acceptance among intellectual poseurs. Between-chapters ""intermezzos"" are devoted to ""Epistemic Relativism in the Philosophy of Science"" (i.e., the notion that verifiable physical truth exists only as a cultural ""myth""), ""Chaos Theory and 'Postmodern Science'"" (in which precisely defined scientific notions about predictability and nonlinearity are confounded with their squirrelly linguistic kin), and the abuse of Gödel's theorem and set theory (where very specific mathematical results are generalized to shed light on areas to which they have no connection whatsoever).The literary drawbacks of an intensive debunking of heaps of nonsensical verbosity are immediately obvious. Heedless of the dictates of pleasure or readability, Sokal and Bricmont have selflessly, mercilessly larded their work with extensive quotes from their primary sources. It may be necessary, but the authors' assiduousness does not make for the ""thoroughly hilarious romp through the postmodernist academy"" promised by Barbara Ehrenreich's jacket blurb.There is no romping to speak of. There is true hilarity, but it is on the whole confined to the chapter concerning Irigaray's feminist critique of science. Even readers who have already made their minds up about Lacan and his ilk owe themselves a few minutes at the bookstore discovering such howlers as:""Is E=Mc2 a sexed equation? Perhaps it is. Let us make the hypothesis that it is insofar as it privileges the speed of light over other speeds that are vitally necessary to us. What seems to me to indicate the possibly sexed nature of the equation is not directly its uses by nuclear weapons, rather it is having privileged what goes the fastest...""What makes Irigaray so funny is that she exposes herself with clear writing. Her thinking may be utter hogwash, but her sentences are generally parsable. This is not commonly the case among her peers. Any educated reader who has attempted to skim a dense scientific work he knows he could understand given the time will recognize the appeal of scientific-sounding obfuscation to the nontechnical author. If you aren't proceeding through an equation term by term, your eyes simply bounce off it; its meaning is held in reserve until you take the time to extract it. Nontechnical readers as a rule can't distinguish between meaningful equations and sheer poppycock; their eyes bounce off both. Putting in the time to extract the meaning isn't an option open to them. An impenetrable equation signals erudition even if it has none to offer. And the same is true of a sentence composed of technical gibberish.Sokal and Bricmont are aware of the limits of the scientific purview, as they now stand, and acknowledge the difference between science and everything else. What the authors don't state explicitly (and perhaps do not believe) is that the scientific mind, which prefers precision to poetry, single meanings to double ones, and trudges to leaps, is fundamentally different from the nonscientific one, and that many a pomo misstep has been inspired by a refusal to accept this fact.It's natural to crave science's strengths and to shun its weaknesses; sadly, they come as a matched set. The authority and verifiability of the natural sciences are formidable, but science has been most successful with the simplest, most precisely defined problems. It's no accident that ""Fashionable Nonsense"" was penned by physicists. Physics is the hardest of the sciences; its successful theories have been established with greater mathematical precision than have concepts in any other field of endeavor. But physics works best with things that matter least to outsiders—the arcana of quantum mechanics, for example. Once sucked in by the elegant system presented in freshman physics classes, who isn't at least a little bit disappointed to find that nothing really works as cleanly as it does in its classical estimation? (Quantum mechanics may reveal a physical universe stranger than we could possibly have imagined, but it left this former physics student, at least, pining for the world of Newton. Since the 17th century is unlikely ever again to represent the cutting edge of scientific knowledge, I threw over science for art, dropping out of grad school after three semesters and trading a handful of correct answers for a wealth of pretty good ones.)The trouble with working among what my high school physics teacher called the ""fuzzies"" is that you may feel as if you are right, but you can never prove it. If the fuzzies in question are sociologists, psychologists, linguists, or other quasi-scientists, the temptation will be strong to hijack the certitude of hard science to serve ideas you wish you could be sure about. Although it may be tempting to ascribe malice or lunacy to traffickers in pseudoscience, their quest, however misguided, is really quite poignant. They crave adulation for discovering something demonstrably true about things that, at least when they idealistically set out on their intellectual journeys, were serious ""real-world"" problems.But, as Batman whispered to Lacan, when the theorist lost his grip and slipped away into the bottomless maelstrom of text: ""Poor, deluded child.""Sokal and Bricmont don't abandon all hope for a cross-fertilization of ideas, but I'm not sure that scientists and non-scientists really can talk to each other about the things that really matter to them. And I don't think such a development, because it forces a bit of humility on us, is all bad. Knowledge has fragmented to the point that a degree of specialization is necessary. I'm a generalist at heart, and it pains me to say it, but whenever someone today is called a ""Renaissance man,"" you can bet that the speaker holds a grossly inflated opinion of that person's intellect. The world has simply gotten too big for any one person to get his mind around it. It's been said that Coleridge was the last person to know everything, but I wonder if even he wasn't born too late.Sokal and Bricmont know the genie isn't going back into the bottle, and they dispassionately deliver a corrective to innocents (even belligerent innocents) who think they can sidestep the problem either by usurping the language of science or, having given up on certainty, by discounting science altogether. Tough-minded to a fault, the physicists not only establish the circumstances under which no reasonable interdisciplinary discussion can occur, they also tell us when nonscientists shouldn't be talking at all.

192,0312204078,http://goodreads.com/user/show/38719275-dale-grauman,3,"Read the introduction, both ""intermezzos,"" and the epilogue. These portions lay out good, popular-level critiques of radical skepticism and postmodern mumbo-jumbo. You can skip or skim the rest, which is comprised mostly of long quotations from academic ""theorists"" (i.e., mid-20th-century French philosophers or their disciples) alongside the author's commentary. All of these sections can be summarized as follows:French Academic: [Writes something entirely incomprehensible.]Sokal and Bricmont: ""The preceding passage was entirely incomprehensible. As professional scientists and mathematicians, we assure you that all references to science and mathematics are bogus.""Sometimes they take the time to explain the scientific or mathematical concepts in layman's terms so that readers can understand their critiques more deeply. Often, they do not. If you have already encountered ""theory""(in this particular sense of that term) and are perceptive (cynical?) enough to have concluded that it's willfully obscure, you won't get much out of reading these chapters.On a personal note, the authors made a couple claims that I had arrived at independently, and it was gratifying to see these notions in print:(1) ""Theory"" looks an awful lot like mysticism, and it may make sense to analyze it as a religious movement. (Page 37; they are especially referring to Lacan, here.)(2) Our inability to refute a position fully doesn't mean we have any reason to accept that position. (Page 54; they are especially referring to solipsism.)"
193,0312204078,http://goodreads.com/user/show/10174911-syed-ashrafulla,3,"The premise of the book is very sound. The authors are going after the improper use of fundamental mathematics and physics by philosophers who have run out of ways to confuse readers. Through a myriad of examples, the authors continually discredit the arguments given by postmodernists that try to employ modern physics. Those attacks are very solid. Postmodernists do misunderstand the link between science and philosophy. Sociologists do try to sweep scientific rigor under the rug when convenient.My problem with the book is its style. In an attempt to fortify the arguments against the lawyer-like retorts of the human sciences, they post far too much context. As a result I'm reading too much garbage. I prefer terser quotations with pointed rebuttals. I don't like the pasting of four paragraphs followed by a three line critique. Why not just break it up? Are you worried that the defenders will use the blunt critique of context? That critique is generally stupid anyway, but the authors spent a significant part of the book trying to answer that critique. People like me who don't have a dog in the fight then have to slog through terrible sentence after terrible sentence by philosophers who aim to confuse. Thanks, I thought we were going to avoid that.It's still an ok book. It's probably required reading for anyone in grad school. It's just not that pleasant or coherent a book to read."

I went in expecting more of a general-audience nonfiction work that aims to help lay-persons who are affected by the nonsense peddled by pseudo-mystics like Deepak Chopra whose particular brand of bullshit is hidden under a shiny candy coating of what appears to be a scientific basis.What this actually is reads much more like a scientific journal article. There is a very familiar cadence reminiscent of astrophysics papers I used to read regularly, and it has that exceptionally dry, ordered formatting that is desirable in objective scientific work.This was very enlightening, and it helped a great deal that I was once obsessed with post-modern philosophy and was able to keep up (though it underscores my decision to abandon that particular hobby long ago).If you are already well-versed in philosophical formalism, go for it, though don't expect a particular engaging read even then. It is what it is, there's no fluff. If you follow my reviews and updates, you know how quickly I read; this took me almost a week to get through, which about sums it up.It did work fantastically as a sleep aid on some nights where I found myself drifting off a full hour or more ahead of when I usually hit the wall.If you aren't into dry philosophy and formal logic, then this is definitely a hard pass for you."

I think I never recovered from the traumatic experience of reading the line: ""modern war takes place in Non-Euclidean Space"", the great Baudrillardian coinage.I would have said this book has officially run its course, but certain factions of the feminist movement who religiously hew to the ideas of Luce Irigaray restrain me from doing so. As much as I would like to believe otherwise, ideas such as ""modern science is a male construct"" or ""women are bullied out of a career in the natural sciences"" are still perniciously widespread. Thankfully, postmodernism as a philosophical practice has fallen out of favor in the academia. But the ideas put forth in the early 70s have percolated to the forefront of the public consciousness in the 2010s decade. I wish these ideas would eventually wither away. However, there is no such sign on the horizon. Keeping that in mind, I would say this book still retains its necessity. If not the whole thing, read at least a few chapters. These postmodern ideas are so freaking amusing; when they are not downright petrifying. For example, you can always find comic relief in feminist Julia Kristeva's endeavors to explain poetic language in terms of set theory."
196,0312204078,http://goodreads.com/user/show/44761402-jens,4,"There's a youtube clip in which John Searle talks to Foucault about why his writing is so atrocious, even though he can convey his reasonable ideas well in speech. Foucault answers that in France, in order to be taken seriously as an intellectual, at least 10% of what you write should be incomprehensible. Otherwise people just won't think it's ""deep"" or sophisticated. That's probably the biggest part of the problem with broadly postmodern writers, and 10% is a very conservative estimate in this case. Still, some of the philosophers discussed in this book have some genuinely interesting ideas (though not unequivocally true ones). In particular, I think Latour, Deleuze, and Derrida (not covered) have some valuable insights to contribute (though, again, I don't always agree with them, particularly in the case of Derrida). It is just too bad that they think they can score intellectual points in their writings by using scientific terms they don't understand. On the other hand, authors such as Lacan and Kristeva are completely vacuous, while Irigaray is just too ridiculous to be taken seriously. Also, relativism is dumb. No discourse of no length will ever make that a viable way out of a philosophical problem."

It's good to see scientists such as Sokal exposing this 'fashionable nonsense' for what it really is. I'm saddened to say, however, that even 22 years after the publication of his parody 'Transgressing the Boundaries,' we still see the same arguments and the same fashionable nonsense repeated today. What we need is to practice critical thinking, and really understand what it is we're reading and what we're talking about. The subchapter 'For a Dialogue Between the Two Cultures' in the epilogue, it is given some hints on how we are to do this, and is relevant as much now as it was then. The text was mainly structured to illustrate seperate persons who were obscuring their field of study, but I found the intermezzo chapters to be a lot more enlightening. The intermezzo parts and the epilogue were by far my favorite parts, but of course it was important to see how absurd certain individuals on the Left (especially in France) has written and tangled with information in desperate attempts to put their own names in their history books by achieving the paradigm shift of Thomas Kuhn."

FN aims specifically at the abuse of science by Continental theorists, and in so doing, is successful. In the introduction, it is said that they do not make judgments about the whole of anyone's work, only the misappropriations of science by the selected writers. And I applaud this. As for the rest of what these theorists have to say, they aren't wholly a waste of time. Mileage may vary. I find D&G's work stimulating for artists and, for example, their critique of capitalism out of Marx's Fragment on Machines is insightful, and unlike someone below/above, no, Marx is not irrelevant. Anyway, Sokol's points are spot-on and sorely needed. There's no doubt that the Continentals were often obtuse and obscurantist. It simply cannot be denied. But each one of the writers critiqued offer interesting insights and nuanced views on the world and its problems...as long as they spare us their misunderstanding of science. When they abuse that, it's natural that people will be skeptical of the rest of their work. Like David Foster Wallace, who misunderstood infinity, it's not fair to pan the remainder of the work only because of this. But it is a thorn in our sides. "

211,0312204078,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5695847-abyy,5,"Sokal and Bricmont launch a devastating critique of the pretentious and obscurantist tendencies of several authors in the pomo canon in this book. Their specific locus of attack is these philosophers' (and I use the term here in a very loose sense) misuse and deliberate abuse of scientific and mathematical concepts as a strategy to embellish and give an aura of credibility to very bad writing. [A caveat: I'm not a philosopher, physicist, mathematician, literary theorist, psychoanalyst or even well acquainted with any of these disciplines so everything I say about this can reasonably be seen as suspect.]Intellectual Impostures was an immensely enjoyable read. It confirmed what I've long suspected about the so-called ""radical"" thought of many pomo writers - that what appears prima facie to be incredibly profound ideas collapse under any sustained rational examination. While Sokal and Bricmont confine themselves to their areas of expertise (physics and mathematics), many of their observations are well taken and apply to the other works and to the other authors who 'do' pomo. As Sokal and Bricmont very ably point out, many of the ideas pomo authors proffer are deliberately written very ambiguously such that they can be read one of two ways - as either trivially true or surprising but false (or a third possibility: hopelessly confused). This book was published a decade ago. I wish I could report that their critiques are now merely of historical interest to a reinvigorated Left - but unfortunately I find their points to be as valid as they were when they were first published. I could go on in this vein for awhile but, to cut my vitriol short, suffice to say I'd strongly recommend to anyone with even a peripheral interest in science, pomo and the relation between them. Intellectual Impostures remains a very timely contribution that serves (hopefully) as a remedy for a Left that has increasingly become politically regressive, intellectually dishonest and, perhaps worst of all, not even wrong."
212,0312204078,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5805110-sweta-gupta,2,"I am in a dilemma in writing a review for this book. It inspired two extreme reactions. On one hand, I found the observations in the book to be hilarious and very well pointed out. On the other hand, I struggled through the 211 pages because the writing style was so dry and non-engaging and consisted largely of what the authors term “fashionable nonsense”: difficult language that sounds extremely profound and complex, but is in fact, meaningless. This book came as a result of Alan Sokal’s hoax, a nonsensical article that he submitted to an American culture studies journal, which was hailed by postmodernists. Of course, Sokal revealed the hoax and the praise of the postmodernists that had come in before the revelation clearly proved that the postmodernists really did not understand even their contemporaries but hailed each others’ work anyway. The book is all about deliberately obscure language and created confusion for the purpose of sounding profound. Needless to say, the writers have received a fair amount of criticism as well.Approximately half (or perhaps a bit more) of the book consists of long passages from the very works the authors are critiquing (ripping apart). And as the authors show in their commentary, those passages are mostly indecipherable gibberish. Reading those puts a serious strain on your mental capacities. I took more than a week to finish this 210 page book, and it was just a very, very painstaking effort.This book requires a fair understanding of conceptual physics and mathematics to understand that the passages reproduced are actually incomprehensible. I would not recommend it to someone who doesn’t have a decent understanding of those. In the epilogue, the authors lay out some broad lessons, which are useful for anyone: know what you are talking about instead of creating ambiguities by using flowery language to conceal your lack of understanding, not all that is obscure is necessarily profound and several others."
213,0312204078,http://goodreads.com/user/show/20247815-stephen,5,"Excellent discussion of the specific instances of postmodern writers in already-nebulous ""critical"" disciplines invoking scientific and mathematical concepts to equivocate (or spew outright gibberish!) under the guise of borrowing credence and rigor. Entertainingly written with a mind toward parsimony and specificity of argument that reflects the authors' backgrounds in scientific methodology without robbing the text of levity or accessibility. The epilogue is veers into op-ed territory - but in a good way: the authors emphasize the importance of precise, contextual, and intellectually honest articulation not only in academia, but as a discursive basis for broader social and intellectual projects that shape the course of society. A powerful read for anyone passionate about the sciences and chagrined by the creeping vacuity of the pseudo-intellectualism that infests the postmodern segment of the academy."
214,0312204078,http://goodreads.com/user/show/279997-llew,4,"By themselves, the quotes used in this book are some of the finest examples of academic horseshit one might ever hope to come across. I still love a good meandering philosophy tome, but there is something highly important about what Sokal and company are doing here. This idea that, at a certain point, abusing science and math to continue your ideas is dumbing down the populace. That relativism may be used for cultural anthropology, but it needs to be abandoned when used in scientific understanding. There's some leeway given to Baudrillard who is given his own chapter, yet I still appreciate, as i think people understand that he's being ridiculous and not necessarily putting across formal theses. Lacan on the other hand, where he's giving a formal argument based on flawed understanding of well-known scientific ideas, comes across as just sad. Sokal knows his science, and they give good counter-proof that, no Quantum Relativity of the mind doesn't make sense and that's not how topology works, although the book fails when they try to provide a proper philosophy of science and epistemology. They give some time try to argue down questions like, ""how do we know this is reality"", and it meanders like the texts they are critiquing. Still, very essential that they wrote this. "
215,0312204078,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1841544-chris,3,"On display is lots of nonsense written in the postmodern tradition, specifically by philosophers that can basically be classified as epistemic relativists. In the first several chapters, the responses by the authors to absurd passages from Lacan and Kristeva are quite detailed. As the book goes on, punctuated by several intermezzo chapters which give some background, much of the commentary becomes lazy. The authors begin to appeal to the self-evidence of the ridiculousness on display.Occasionally the authors' criticism seems like nitpicking, and I can't shake the feeling that the book would have benefitted from some back and forth, offering at least some defense of selected passages before a complete dismantling of the postmodern arguments. Don't get me wrong, I would NEVER defend any of the intellectual traditions the book lampoons. But you know the people that wrote these passages (or their disciples) would have responses to the obvious technical errors which the book frequently points out pepper their arguments. No doubt that these responses would be just as incomprehensible as the original arguments, buttressing the notion that they are just masters of manipulating erudite language and peddling pretentiousness.A fun read for the quote mining, but it probably could have been done better."
216,0312204078,http://goodreads.com/user/show/12638036-haaris-mateen,4,"Sokal and Bricmont bring balance to the Force. The overkill of relativism and scientism that had infected most of the social sciences and humanities couldn't have done with a better beneficial shock. Alas, the currents exposed still exist in the discourse of the Left, and it is perhaps one of the biggest flaws that exist in the battle against the poisonous populism insidiously rising the world over. The rise of the Post Truth world cannot be blamed solely on the ""other side"". This book (now almost twenty years old) reminds us of the pitfalls of choosing radical skepticism, a way of thought that isolates itself from reality and which allows dangerous deliverers to thrive; and a line of thinking which only university grads are equipped to even access (though not with any benefit to the world)."
217,0312204078,http://goodreads.com/user/show/44290999-jjonas,2,"2.5 stars.In the 'Afterword' to the original ""Sokal affair"" paper (which is the last item in this book), Sokal quotes C. P. Snow's view in Two cultures:""A good many times I have been present at gatherings of people who, by the standars of the traditional culture, are thought highly educated and who have with considerable gusto been expressing their incredulity at the illiteracy of scientists. Once or twice I have been provoked and have asked the company how many of them could describe the Second Law of Thermodynamics. The response was cold: it was also negative. Yet I was asking something which is about the scientific equivalent of: Have you read a work of Shakespeare's? [...] [T]he great edifice of modern physics goes up, and the majority of the cleverest people in the western world have about as much insight into it as their neolithic ancestors would have had."" (p. 276-277)Sokal notes:""One significant change has taken place since C. P. Snow's time: while humanist intellectuals' ignorance about (for example) mass and acceleration remains substantially unchanged, nowadays a significant minority of humanist intellectuals feels entitled to pontificate on these subjects in spite of their ignorance"" (p. 277).I take this to be the original motivation for writing the ""Sokal hoax paper"" and this book. And Sokal and Bricmont do make a good point about posturing intellectuals using frivolous analogies in their philosophy etc. texts to mathematics and physics which said authors don't really understand — and even if they did, do they really expect their likely readership to understand them without explicit clarification about why the chosen analogy is useful. I believe S & B demonstrate this satisfactorily and to good effect.(It should be noted in passing that it's not only some humanists and social scientists who are guilty of ignorance of other fields; e.g. someone like Steven Pinker has strayed ever further from his homebase in psychology and the study of language and written broad-stroke works with sweeping conclusions about history, liberalism etc. where he's not really the expert. Or consider economists, who get to be interviewed about politics, foreign relations, environmental issues etc., as if they've become some kind of universal intellectuals.)However, S & B are not on equally strong ground when they declare the quoted passages — which sure do look embarrassing — simply nonsense. I would agree they're nonsense as far as the language lifted from natural science and mathematics is concerned, but I think S & B might be guilty of somewhat comparable arrogance as their targets by proclaiming the quotes simply nonsensical, meaningless etc. — in all respects, not just in terms of the physics terminology etc.I think many people who praise this book are a bit too eager to strike at pomos with whatever they've got (something that I'm not totally unsympathetic towards, by the way) and disregard this side of the work. In fact, some seem to see the book (including people who probably haven't read it) as a wholesale condemnation of, if not a fatal blow to, postmodernism, which however is something that the authors don't even claim to do. Instead they've set themselves a far narrower task: to call out reckless use of concepts lifted from physics etc. with the intention of lending philosophical texts some rigour, respectability or whatever. That's a far cry from ""destroying postmodernism"" or whatever.Now, it does seem obvious to me that the ""pomo"" authors in questions are guilty of the most blatant kind of posturing, obfuscation and pretense one can imagine, and that stripped of the verbiage, what they have to say would turn out to be much less impressive than it appears (though not necessarily banal). So overall, I'm partial to what S & B are doing, for like them I'm a believer in objective physical reality independent of human (or other) consciousness, while — again, like them — not denying at all the sense in the moderate version of ""social construction of reality"" as a corrective to what S & B call ""naive modernism"" (p. 183).But I think S & B are wrong if they expect they can (or should) understand philosophical etc. texts as easily as if they were reading the newspaper. Personally I'm inclined to think that what Lacan, Kristeva etc. have to say is much more ordinary than it would appear at first sight (and much of it nonsense to boot), but I don't believe that S & B are significantly more qualified to make that call than I am. Our difference is that I didn't (and wouldn't) write a book about it.The chapters that picked apart scienced up pomo quotes were the least fun to read, and unfortunately that's more than half of the book. No doubt the chapters were necessary to drive the main point home, but reading it was hard work and the content was repetitive, and I confess I didn't read much of the quoted materials (some of the quotes were several pages long). In contrast, the ""intermezzo chapters"" that dealt with more general questions of philosophy of science and relativism were the most useful ones to me.The book ends with the original ""Sokal affair"" article and a chapter which explains what was fishy about it. While I believe that Social Text is to blame for publishing stuff the subject matter of which they didn't understand, I'm also somewhat sympathetic towards the argument that in a journal like Social Text it's not necessarily the editors' duty to weed out wild and unconventional ideas but instead let the readership judge for themselves whether (some of) the ideas in some article merit any attention."

220,0312204078,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1785447-david-glenn-dixon,4,"Washington City PaperArts & Entertainment : Book ReviewLiberté, Egalité, ObscuritéBy Glenn Dixon • March 12, 1999""If there's no math in it, it isn't science."" Thus went the rejoinder propellerheads offered religious enthusiasts when, in the '80s, hinterland zealots attempted to get Genesis taught in public schools under the rubric of ""creation science."" But what of the inverse? If there is math in it, is science an inevitability? As any kid who sat through the first month of Mr. Glahn's 9th-grade geometry class can tell you, the second statement doesn't necessarily follow from the first.Over the past 30 years or so, an entire generation of psychoanalysts, literary theorists, cult-studs, and other postmodern types has made hay by virtue of the fact that its readers lack the benefit of my math teacher's wisdom. By the mid-'90s the problem had gotten far enough out of hand that New York University physics prof Alan Sokal felt compelled to cook up a heady stew of anti-scientific pigheadedness and pseudotechnical misprision, season it liberally with quotes from such theoretical leading lights as Jacques Lacan, Gilles Deleuze and Félix Guattari, and Luce Irigaray, and set the steaming dish down in front of the editors of the Duke University Press cultural-studies journal ""Social Text""—who promptly served it up in their Spring/Summer 1996 issue.Sokal then outed himself, exposing his parody in an article rejected by ""Social Text,"" which judged the correction to the published goof beneath its ""intellectual standards."" ""Dissent"" and ""Philosophy and Literature"" picked up the second piece, but by the time they hit the stacks the popular press had already had a field day with Sokal's prank.Needless to say, ""Social Text"" editors Andrew Ross and Stanley Aronowitz weren't amused. Nor were the hordes of tenured radicals who had built their careers on what had been exposed as institutionally codified idiocy. They counterattacked, and now Sokal has teamed up with Belgium-based theoretical physicist Jean Bricmont (it helps to have a Francophone on your side in such matters) to respond with a book-length popular treatment of postmodern ideological excess and methodological madness.Chapter by chapter, Sokal and Bricmont calmly, meticulously tear new assholes for Lacan, Deleuze and Guattari, Irigaray, Julia Kristeva, Bruno Latour, Jean Baudrillard, and Paul Virilio. The physicists aren't staging some sort of anti-theoretical pogrom; they're just standing up for rationality. Jacques Derrida keeps his hands off science; Sokal and Bricmont keep their hands off Derrida. They refuse even to judge the theorists' overall programs, limiting their criticisms to their areas of expertise and suggesting that their targets could have benefited from similar circumspection.What they reveal is scandalous. Lacan indulges a fondness for topology, which he barely understands, and suffers a penchant for arbitrary metaphors, which he often refuses to acknowledge as anything other than literal truths. Kristeva does the same with set theory. Virilio misunderstands concepts that are covered in the first week of 11th-grade physics. Almost everybody jumps from one discipline to another with the mindless alacrity of a puppy visiting an unexplored row of lampposts.When they aren't picking apart the efforts of individual writers, Sokal and Bricmont go after entire subfields of bad thinking that have found widespread acceptance among intellectual poseurs. Between-chapters ""intermezzos"" are devoted to ""Epistemic Relativism in the Philosophy of Science"" (i.e., the notion that verifiable physical truth exists only as a cultural ""myth""), ""Chaos Theory and 'Postmodern Science'"" (in which precisely defined scientific notions about predictability and nonlinearity are confounded with their squirrelly linguistic kin), and the abuse of Gödel's theorem and set theory (where very specific mathematical results are generalized to shed light on areas to which they have no connection whatsoever).The literary drawbacks of an intensive debunking of heaps of nonsensical verbosity are immediately obvious. Heedless of the dictates of pleasure or readability, Sokal and Bricmont have selflessly, mercilessly larded their work with extensive quotes from their primary sources. It may be necessary, but the authors' assiduousness does not make for the ""thoroughly hilarious romp through the postmodernist academy"" promised by Barbara Ehrenreich's jacket blurb.There is no romping to speak of. There is true hilarity, but it is on the whole confined to the chapter concerning Irigaray's feminist critique of science. Even readers who have already made their minds up about Lacan and his ilk owe themselves a few minutes at the bookstore discovering such howlers as:""Is E=Mc2 a sexed equation? Perhaps it is. Let us make the hypothesis that it is insofar as it privileges the speed of light over other speeds that are vitally necessary to us. What seems to me to indicate the possibly sexed nature of the equation is not directly its uses by nuclear weapons, rather it is having privileged what goes the fastest...""What makes Irigaray so funny is that she exposes herself with clear writing. Her thinking may be utter hogwash, but her sentences are generally parsable. This is not commonly the case among her peers. Any educated reader who has attempted to skim a dense scientific work he knows he could understand given the time will recognize the appeal of scientific-sounding obfuscation to the nontechnical author. If you aren't proceeding through an equation term by term, your eyes simply bounce off it; its meaning is held in reserve until you take the time to extract it. Nontechnical readers as a rule can't distinguish between meaningful equations and sheer poppycock; their eyes bounce off both. Putting in the time to extract the meaning isn't an option open to them. An impenetrable equation signals erudition even if it has none to offer. And the same is true of a sentence composed of technical gibberish.Sokal and Bricmont are aware of the limits of the scientific purview, as they now stand, and acknowledge the difference between science and everything else. What the authors don't state explicitly (and perhaps do not believe) is that the scientific mind, which prefers precision to poetry, single meanings to double ones, and trudges to leaps, is fundamentally different from the nonscientific one, and that many a pomo misstep has been inspired by a refusal to accept this fact.It's natural to crave science's strengths and to shun its weaknesses; sadly, they come as a matched set. The authority and verifiability of the natural sciences are formidable, but science has been most successful with the simplest, most precisely defined problems. It's no accident that ""Fashionable Nonsense"" was penned by physicists. Physics is the hardest of the sciences; its successful theories have been established with greater mathematical precision than have concepts in any other field of endeavor. But physics works best with things that matter least to outsiders—the arcana of quantum mechanics, for example. Once sucked in by the elegant system presented in freshman physics classes, who isn't at least a little bit disappointed to find that nothing really works as cleanly as it does in its classical estimation? (Quantum mechanics may reveal a physical universe stranger than we could possibly have imagined, but it left this former physics student, at least, pining for the world of Newton. Since the 17th century is unlikely ever again to represent the cutting edge of scientific knowledge, I threw over science for art, dropping out of grad school after three semesters and trading a handful of correct answers for a wealth of pretty good ones.)The trouble with working among what my high school physics teacher called the ""fuzzies"" is that you may feel as if you are right, but you can never prove it. If the fuzzies in question are sociologists, psychologists, linguists, or other quasi-scientists, the temptation will be strong to hijack the certitude of hard science to serve ideas you wish you could be sure about. Although it may be tempting to ascribe malice or lunacy to traffickers in pseudoscience, their quest, however misguided, is really quite poignant. They crave adulation for discovering something demonstrably true about things that, at least when they idealistically set out on their intellectual journeys, were serious ""real-world"" problems.But, as Batman whispered to Lacan, when the theorist lost his grip and slipped away into the bottomless maelstrom of text: ""Poor, deluded child.""Sokal and Bricmont don't abandon all hope for a cross-fertilization of ideas, but I'm not sure that scientists and non-scientists really can talk to each other about the things that really matter to them. And I don't think such a development, because it forces a bit of humility on us, is all bad. Knowledge has fragmented to the point that a degree of specialization is necessary. I'm a generalist at heart, and it pains me to say it, but whenever someone today is called a ""Renaissance man,"" you can bet that the speaker holds a grossly inflated opinion of that person's intellect. The world has simply gotten too big for any one person to get his mind around it. It's been said that Coleridge was the last person to know everything, but I wonder if even he wasn't born too late.Sokal and Bricmont know the genie isn't going back into the bottle, and they dispassionately deliver a corrective to innocents (even belligerent innocents) who think they can sidestep the problem either by usurping the language of science or, having given up on certainty, by discounting science altogether. Tough-minded to a fault, the physicists not only establish the circumstances under which no reasonable interdisciplinary discussion can occur, they also tell us when nonscientists shouldn't be talking at all.

These portions lay out good, popular-level critiques of radical skepticism and postmodern mumbo-jumbo. You can skip or skim the rest, which is comprised mostly of long quotations from academic ""theorists"" (i.e., mid-20th-century French philosophers or their disciples) alongside the author's commentary. All of these sections can be summarized as follows:French Academic: [Writes something entirely incomprehensible.]Sokal and Bricmont: ""The preceding passage was entirely incomprehensible. As professional scientists and mathematicians, we assure you that all references to science and mathematics are bogus.""Sometimes they take the time to explain the scientific or mathematical concepts in layman's terms so that readers can understand their critiques more deeply. Often, they do not. If you have already encountered ""theory""(in this particular sense of that term) and are perceptive (cynical?) enough to have concluded that it's willfully obscure, you won't get much out of reading these chapters.On a personal note, the authors made a couple claims that I had arrived at independently, and it was gratifying to see these notions in print:(1) ""Theory"" looks an awful lot like mysticism, and it may make sense to analyze it as a religious movement. (Page 37; they are especially referring to Lacan, here.)(2) Our inability to refute a position fully doesn't mean we have any reason to accept that position. (Page 54; they are especially referring to solipsism.)"
223,0312204078,http://goodreads.com/user/show/10174911-syed-ashrafulla,3,"The premise of the book is very sound. The authors are going after the improper use of fundamental mathematics and physics by philosophers who have run out of ways to confuse readers. Through a myriad of examples, the authors continually discredit the arguments given by postmodernists that try to employ modern physics. Those attacks are very solid. Postmodernists do misunderstand the link between science and philosophy. Sociologists do try to sweep scientific rigor under the rug when convenient.My problem with the book is its style. In an attempt to fortify the arguments against the lawyer-like retorts of the human sciences, they post far too much context. As a result I'm reading too much garbage. I prefer terser quotations with pointed rebuttals. I don't like the pasting of four paragraphs followed by a three line critique. Why not just break it up? Are you worried that the defenders will use the blunt critique of context? That critique is generally stupid anyway, but the authors spent a significant part of the book trying to answer that critique. People like me who don't have a dog in the fight then have to slog through terrible sentence after terrible sentence by philosophers who aim to confuse. Thanks, I thought we were going to avoid that.It's still an ok book. It's probably required reading for anyone in grad school. It's just not that pleasant or coherent a book to read."

I went in expecting more of a general-audience nonfiction work that aims to help lay-persons who are affected by the nonsense peddled by pseudo-mystics like Deepak Chopra whose particular brand of bullshit is hidden under a shiny candy coating of what appears to be a scientific basis.What this actually is reads much more like a scientific journal article. There is a very familiar cadence reminiscent of astrophysics papers I used to read regularly, and it has that exceptionally dry, ordered formatting that is desirable in objective scientific work.This was very enlightening, and it helped a great deal that I was once obsessed with post-modern philosophy and was able to keep up (though it underscores my decision to abandon that particular hobby long ago).If you are already well-versed in philosophical formalism, go for it, though don't expect a particular engaging read even then. It is what it is, there's no fluff. If you follow my reviews and updates, you know how quickly I read; this took me almost a week to get through, which about sums it up.It did work fantastically as a sleep aid on some nights where I found myself drifting off a full hour or more ahead of when I usually hit the wall.If you aren't into dry philosophy and formal logic, then this is definitely a hard pass for you."

I think I never recovered from the traumatic experience of reading the line: ""modern war takes place in Non-Euclidean Space"", the great Baudrillardian coinage.I would have said this book has officially run its course, but certain factions of the feminist movement who religiously hew to the ideas of Luce Irigaray restrain me from doing so. As much as I would like to believe otherwise, ideas such as ""modern science is a male construct"" or ""women are bullied out of a career in the natural sciences"" are still perniciously widespread. Thankfully, postmodernism as a philosophical practice has fallen out of favor in the academia. But the ideas put forth in the early 70s have percolated to the forefront of the public consciousness in the 2010s decade. I wish these ideas would eventually wither away. However, there is no such sign on the horizon. Keeping that in mind, I would say this book still retains its necessity. If not the whole thing, read at least a few chapters. These postmodern ideas are so freaking amusing; when they are not downright petrifying. For example, you can always find comic relief in feminist Julia Kristeva's endeavors to explain poetic language in terms of set theory."

Foucault answers that in France, in order to be taken seriously as an intellectual, at least 10% of what you write should be incomprehensible. Otherwise people just won't think it's ""deep"" or sophisticated. That's probably the biggest part of the problem with broadly postmodern writers, and 10% is a very conservative estimate in this case. Still, some of the philosophers discussed in this book have some genuinely interesting ideas (though not unequivocally true ones). In particular, I think Latour, Deleuze, and Derrida (not covered) have some valuable insights to contribute (though, again, I don't always agree with them, particularly in the case of Derrida). It is just too bad that they think they can score intellectual points in their writings by using scientific terms they don't understand. On the other hand, authors such as Lacan and Kristeva are completely vacuous, while Irigaray is just too ridiculous to be taken seriously. Also, relativism is dumb. No discourse of no length will ever make that a viable way out of a philosophical problem."

It's good to see scientists such as Sokal exposing this 'fashionable nonsense' for what it really is. I'm saddened to say, however, that even 22 years after the publication of his parody 'Transgressing the Boundaries,' we still see the same arguments and the same fashionable nonsense repeated today. What we need is to practice critical thinking, and really understand what it is we're reading and what we're talking about. The subchapter 'For a Dialogue Between the Two Cultures' in the epilogue, it is given some hints on how we are to do this, and is relevant as much now as it was then. The text was mainly structured to illustrate seperate persons who were obscuring their field of study, but I found the intermezzo chapters to be a lot more enlightening. The intermezzo parts and the epilogue were by far my favorite parts, but of course it was important to see how absurd certain individuals on the Left (especially in France) has written and tangled with information in desperate attempts to put their own names in their history books by achieving the paradigm shift of Thomas Kuhn."

FN aims specifically at the abuse of science by Continental theorists, and in so doing, is successful. In the introduction, it is said that they do not make judgments about the whole of anyone's work, only the misappropriations of science by the selected writers. And I applaud this. As for the rest of what these theorists have to say, they aren't wholly a waste of time. Mileage may vary. I find D&G's work stimulating for artists and, for example, their critique of capitalism out of Marx's Fragment on Machines is insightful, and unlike someone below/above, no, Marx is not irrelevant. Anyway, Sokol's points are spot-on and sorely needed. There's no doubt that the Continentals were often obtuse and obscurantist. It simply cannot be denied. But each one of the writers critiqued offer interesting insights and nuanced views on the world and its problems...as long as they spare us their misunderstanding of science. When they abuse that, it's natural that people will be skeptical of the rest of their work. Like David Foster Wallace, who misunderstood infinity, it's not fair to pan the remainder of the work only because of this. But it is a thorn in our sides. "

241,0312204078,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5695847-abyy,5,"Sokal and Bricmont launch a devastating critique of the pretentious and obscurantist tendencies of several authors in the pomo canon in this book. Their specific locus of attack is these philosophers' (and I use the term here in a very loose sense) misuse and deliberate abuse of scientific and mathematical concepts as a strategy to embellish and give an aura of credibility to very bad writing. [A caveat: I'm not a philosopher, physicist, mathematician, literary theorist, psychoanalyst or even well acquainted with any of these disciplines so everything I say about this can reasonably be seen as suspect.]Intellectual Impostures was an immensely enjoyable read. It confirmed what I've long suspected about the so-called ""radical"" thought of many pomo writers - that what appears prima facie to be incredibly profound ideas collapse under any sustained rational examination. While Sokal and Bricmont confine themselves to their areas of expertise (physics and mathematics), many of their observations are well taken and apply to the other works and to the other authors who 'do' pomo. As Sokal and Bricmont very ably point out, many of the ideas pomo authors proffer are deliberately written very ambiguously such that they can be read one of two ways - as either trivially true or surprising but false (or a third possibility: hopelessly confused). This book was published a decade ago. I wish I could report that their critiques are now merely of historical interest to a reinvigorated Left - but unfortunately I find their points to be as valid as they were when they were first published. I could go on in this vein for awhile but, to cut my vitriol short, suffice to say I'd strongly recommend to anyone with even a peripheral interest in science, pomo and the relation between them. Intellectual Impostures remains a very timely contribution that serves (hopefully) as a remedy for a Left that has increasingly become politically regressive, intellectually dishonest and, perhaps worst of all, not even wrong."
242,0312204078,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5805110-sweta-gupta,2,"I am in a dilemma in writing a review for this book. It inspired two extreme reactions. On one hand, I found the observations in the book to be hilarious and very well pointed out. On the other hand, I struggled through the 211 pages because the writing style was so dry and non-engaging and consisted largely of what the authors term “fashionable nonsense”: difficult language that sounds extremely profound and complex, but is in fact, meaningless. This book came as a result of Alan Sokal’s hoax, a nonsensical article that he submitted to an American culture studies journal, which was hailed by postmodernists. Of course, Sokal revealed the hoax and the praise of the postmodernists that had come in before the revelation clearly proved that the postmodernists really did not understand even their contemporaries but hailed each others’ work anyway. The book is all about deliberately obscure language and created confusion for the purpose of sounding profound. Needless to say, the writers have received a fair amount of criticism as well.Approximately half (or perhaps a bit more) of the book consists of long passages from the very works the authors are critiquing (ripping apart). And as the authors show in their commentary, those passages are mostly indecipherable gibberish. Reading those puts a serious strain on your mental capacities. I took more than a week to finish this 210 page book, and it was just a very, very painstaking effort.This book requires a fair understanding of conceptual physics and mathematics to understand that the passages reproduced are actually incomprehensible. I would not recommend it to someone who doesn’t have a decent understanding of those. In the epilogue, the authors lay out some broad lessons, which are useful for anyone: know what you are talking about instead of creating ambiguities by using flowery language to conceal your lack of understanding, not all that is obscure is necessarily profound and several others."
243,0312204078,http://goodreads.com/user/show/20247815-stephen,5,"Excellent discussion of the specific instances of postmodern writers in already-nebulous ""critical"" disciplines invoking scientific and mathematical concepts to equivocate (or spew outright gibberish!) under the guise of borrowing credence and rigor. Entertainingly written with a mind toward parsimony and specificity of argument that reflects the authors' backgrounds in scientific methodology without robbing the text of levity or accessibility. The epilogue is veers into op-ed territory - but in a good way: the authors emphasize the importance of precise, contextual, and intellectually honest articulation not only in academia, but as a discursive basis for broader social and intellectual projects that shape the course of society. A powerful read for anyone passionate about the sciences and chagrined by the creeping vacuity of the pseudo-intellectualism that infests the postmodern segment of the academy."
244,0312204078,http://goodreads.com/user/show/279997-llew,4,"By themselves, the quotes used in this book are some of the finest examples of academic horseshit one might ever hope to come across. I still love a good meandering philosophy tome, but there is something highly important about what Sokal and company are doing here. This idea that, at a certain point, abusing science and math to continue your ideas is dumbing down the populace. That relativism may be used for cultural anthropology, but it needs to be abandoned when used in scientific understanding. There's some leeway given to Baudrillard who is given his own chapter, yet I still appreciate, as i think people understand that he's being ridiculous and not necessarily putting across formal theses. Lacan on the other hand, where he's giving a formal argument based on flawed understanding of well-known scientific ideas, comes across as just sad. Sokal knows his science, and they give good counter-proof that, no Quantum Relativity of the mind doesn't make sense and that's not how topology works, although the book fails when they try to provide a proper philosophy of science and epistemology. They give some time try to argue down questions like, ""how do we know this is reality"", and it meanders like the texts they are critiquing. Still, very essential that they wrote this. "
245,0312204078,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1841544-chris,3,"On display is lots of nonsense written in the postmodern tradition, specifically by philosophers that can basically be classified as epistemic relativists. In the first several chapters, the responses by the authors to absurd passages from Lacan and Kristeva are quite detailed. As the book goes on, punctuated by several intermezzo chapters which give some background, much of the commentary becomes lazy. The authors begin to appeal to the self-evidence of the ridiculousness on display.Occasionally the authors' criticism seems like nitpicking, and I can't shake the feeling that the book would have benefitted from some back and forth, offering at least some defense of selected passages before a complete dismantling of the postmodern arguments. Don't get me wrong, I would NEVER defend any of the intellectual traditions the book lampoons. But you know the people that wrote these passages (or their disciples) would have responses to the obvious technical errors which the book frequently points out pepper their arguments. No doubt that these responses would be just as incomprehensible as the original arguments, buttressing the notion that they are just masters of manipulating erudite language and peddling pretentiousness.A fun read for the quote mining, but it probably could have been done better."
246,0312204078,http://goodreads.com/user/show/12638036-haaris-mateen,4,"Sokal and Bricmont bring balance to the Force. The overkill of relativism and scientism that had infected most of the social sciences and humanities couldn't have done with a better beneficial shock. Alas, the currents exposed still exist in the discourse of the Left, and it is perhaps one of the biggest flaws that exist in the battle against the poisonous populism insidiously rising the world over. The rise of the Post Truth world cannot be blamed solely on the ""other side"". This book (now almost twenty years old) reminds us of the pitfalls of choosing radical skepticism, a way of thought that isolates itself from reality and which allows dangerous deliverers to thrive; and a line of thinking which only university grads are equipped to even access (though not with any benefit to the world)."
247,0312204078,http://goodreads.com/user/show/44290999-jjonas,2,"2.5 stars.In the 'Afterword' to the original ""Sokal affair"" paper (which is the last item in this book), Sokal quotes C. P. Snow's view in Two cultures:""A good many times I have been present at gatherings of people who, by the standars of the traditional culture, are thought highly educated and who have with considerable gusto been expressing their incredulity at the illiteracy of scientists. Once or twice I have been provoked and have asked the company how many of them could describe the Second Law of Thermodynamics. The response was cold: it was also negative. Yet I was asking something which is about the scientific equivalent of: Have you read a work of Shakespeare's? [...] [T]he great edifice of modern physics goes up, and the majority of the cleverest people in the western world have about as much insight into it as their neolithic ancestors would have had."" (p. 276-277)Sokal notes:""One significant change has taken place since C. P. Snow's time: while humanist intellectuals' ignorance about (for example) mass and acceleration remains substantially unchanged, nowadays a significant minority of humanist intellectuals feels entitled to pontificate on these subjects in spite of their ignorance"" (p. 277).I take this to be the original motivation for writing the ""Sokal hoax paper"" and this book. And Sokal and Bricmont do make a good point about posturing intellectuals using frivolous analogies in their philosophy etc. texts to mathematics and physics which said authors don't really understand — and even if they did, do they really expect their likely readership to understand them without explicit clarification about why the chosen analogy is useful. I believe S & B demonstrate this satisfactorily and to good effect.(It should be noted in passing that it's not only some humanists and social scientists who are guilty of ignorance of other fields; e.g. someone like Steven Pinker has strayed ever further from his homebase in psychology and the study of language and written broad-stroke works with sweeping conclusions about history, liberalism etc. where he's not really the expert. Or consider economists, who get to be interviewed about politics, foreign relations, environmental issues etc., as if they've become some kind of universal intellectuals.)However, S & B are not on equally strong ground when they declare the quoted passages — which sure do look embarrassing — simply nonsense. I would agree they're nonsense as far as the language lifted from natural science and mathematics is concerned, but I think S & B might be guilty of somewhat comparable arrogance as their targets by proclaiming the quotes simply nonsensical, meaningless etc. — in all respects, not just in terms of the physics terminology etc.I think many people who praise this book are a bit too eager to strike at pomos with whatever they've got (something that I'm not totally unsympathetic towards, by the way) and disregard this side of the work. In fact, some seem to see the book (including people who probably haven't read it) as a wholesale condemnation of, if not a fatal blow to, postmodernism, which however is something that the authors don't even claim to do. Instead they've set themselves a far narrower task: to call out reckless use of concepts lifted from physics etc. with the intention of lending philosophical texts some rigour, respectability or whatever. That's a far cry from ""destroying postmodernism"" or whatever.Now, it does seem obvious to me that the ""pomo"" authors in questions are guilty of the most blatant kind of posturing, obfuscation and pretense one can imagine, and that stripped of the verbiage, what they have to say would turn out to be much less impressive than it appears (though not necessarily banal). So overall, I'm partial to what S & B are doing, for like them I'm a believer in objective physical reality independent of human (or other) consciousness, while — again, like them — not denying at all the sense in the moderate version of ""social construction of reality"" as a corrective to what S & B call ""naive modernism"" (p. 183).But I think S & B are wrong if they expect they can (or should) understand philosophical etc. texts as easily as if they were reading the newspaper. Personally I'm inclined to think that what Lacan, Kristeva etc. have to say is much more ordinary than it would appear at first sight (and much of it nonsense to boot), but I don't believe that S & B are significantly more qualified to make that call than I am. Our difference is that I didn't (and wouldn't) write a book about it.The chapters that picked apart scienced up pomo quotes were the least fun to read, and unfortunately that's more than half of the book. No doubt the chapters were necessary to drive the main point home, but reading it was hard work and the content was repetitive, and I confess I didn't read much of the quoted materials (some of the quotes were several pages long). In contrast, the ""intermezzo chapters"" that dealt with more general questions of philosophy of science and relativism were the most useful ones to me.The book ends with the original ""Sokal affair"" article and a chapter which explains what was fishy about it. While I believe that Social Text is to blame for publishing stuff the subject matter of which they didn't understand, I'm also somewhat sympathetic towards the argument that in a journal like Social Text it's not necessarily the editors' duty to weed out wild and unconventional ideas but instead let the readership judge for themselves whether (some of) the ideas in some article merit any attention."

250,0312204078,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1785447-david-glenn-dixon,4,"Washington City PaperArts & Entertainment : Book ReviewLiberté, Egalité, ObscuritéBy Glenn Dixon • March 12, 1999""If there's no math in it, it isn't science."" Thus went the rejoinder propellerheads offered religious enthusiasts when, in the '80s, hinterland zealots attempted to get Genesis taught in public schools under the rubric of ""creation science."" But what of the inverse? If there is math in it, is science an inevitability? As any kid who sat through the first month of Mr. Glahn's 9th-grade geometry class can tell you, the second statement doesn't necessarily follow from the first.Over the past 30 years or so, an entire generation of psychoanalysts, literary theorists, cult-studs, and other postmodern types has made hay by virtue of the fact that its readers lack the benefit of my math teacher's wisdom. By the mid-'90s the problem had gotten far enough out of hand that New York University physics prof Alan Sokal felt compelled to cook up a heady stew of anti-scientific pigheadedness and pseudotechnical misprision, season it liberally with quotes from such theoretical leading lights as Jacques Lacan, Gilles Deleuze and Félix Guattari, and Luce Irigaray, and set the steaming dish down in front of the editors of the Duke University Press cultural-studies journal ""Social Text""—who promptly served it up in their Spring/Summer 1996 issue.Sokal then outed himself, exposing his parody in an article rejected by ""Social Text,"" which judged the correction to the published goof beneath its ""intellectual standards."" ""Dissent"" and ""Philosophy and Literature"" picked up the second piece, but by the time they hit the stacks the popular press had already had a field day with Sokal's prank.Needless to say, ""Social Text"" editors Andrew Ross and Stanley Aronowitz weren't amused. Nor were the hordes of tenured radicals who had built their careers on what had been exposed as institutionally codified idiocy. They counterattacked, and now Sokal has teamed up with Belgium-based theoretical physicist Jean Bricmont (it helps to have a Francophone on your side in such matters) to respond with a book-length popular treatment of postmodern ideological excess and methodological madness.Chapter by chapter, Sokal and Bricmont calmly, meticulously tear new assholes for Lacan, Deleuze and Guattari, Irigaray, Julia Kristeva, Bruno Latour, Jean Baudrillard, and Paul Virilio. The physicists aren't staging some sort of anti-theoretical pogrom; they're just standing up for rationality. Jacques Derrida keeps his hands off science; Sokal and Bricmont keep their hands off Derrida. They refuse even to judge the theorists' overall programs, limiting their criticisms to their areas of expertise and suggesting that their targets could have benefited from similar circumspection.What they reveal is scandalous. Lacan indulges a fondness for topology, which he barely understands, and suffers a penchant for arbitrary metaphors, which he often refuses to acknowledge as anything other than literal truths. Kristeva does the same with set theory. Virilio misunderstands concepts that are covered in the first week of 11th-grade physics. Almost everybody jumps from one discipline to another with the mindless alacrity of a puppy visiting an unexplored row of lampposts.When they aren't picking apart the efforts of individual writers, Sokal and Bricmont go after entire subfields of bad thinking that have found widespread acceptance among intellectual poseurs. Between-chapters ""intermezzos"" are devoted to ""Epistemic Relativism in the Philosophy of Science"" (i.e., the notion that verifiable physical truth exists only as a cultural ""myth""), ""Chaos Theory and 'Postmodern Science'"" (in which precisely defined scientific notions about predictability and nonlinearity are confounded with their squirrelly linguistic kin), and the abuse of Gödel's theorem and set theory (where very specific mathematical results are generalized to shed light on areas to which they have no connection whatsoever).The literary drawbacks of an intensive debunking of heaps of nonsensical verbosity are immediately obvious. Heedless of the dictates of pleasure or readability, Sokal and Bricmont have selflessly, mercilessly larded their work with extensive quotes from their primary sources. It may be necessary, but the authors' assiduousness does not make for the ""thoroughly hilarious romp through the postmodernist academy"" promised by Barbara Ehrenreich's jacket blurb.There is no romping to speak of. There is true hilarity, but it is on the whole confined to the chapter concerning Irigaray's feminist critique of science. Even readers who have already made their minds up about Lacan and his ilk owe themselves a few minutes at the bookstore discovering such howlers as:""Is E=Mc2 a sexed equation? Perhaps it is. Let us make the hypothesis that it is insofar as it privileges the speed of light over other speeds that are vitally necessary to us. What seems to me to indicate the possibly sexed nature of the equation is not directly its uses by nuclear weapons, rather it is having privileged what goes the fastest...""What makes Irigaray so funny is that she exposes herself with clear writing. Her thinking may be utter hogwash, but her sentences are generally parsable. This is not commonly the case among her peers. Any educated reader who has attempted to skim a dense scientific work he knows he could understand given the time will recognize the appeal of scientific-sounding obfuscation to the nontechnical author. If you aren't proceeding through an equation term by term, your eyes simply bounce off it; its meaning is held in reserve until you take the time to extract it. Nontechnical readers as a rule can't distinguish between meaningful equations and sheer poppycock; their eyes bounce off both. Putting in the time to extract the meaning isn't an option open to them. An impenetrable equation signals erudition even if it has none to offer. And the same is true of a sentence composed of technical gibberish.Sokal and Bricmont are aware of the limits of the scientific purview, as they now stand, and acknowledge the difference between science and everything else. What the authors don't state explicitly (and perhaps do not believe) is that the scientific mind, which prefers precision to poetry, single meanings to double ones, and trudges to leaps, is fundamentally different from the nonscientific one, and that many a pomo misstep has been inspired by a refusal to accept this fact.It's natural to crave science's strengths and to shun its weaknesses; sadly, they come as a matched set. The authority and verifiability of the natural sciences are formidable, but science has been most successful with the simplest, most precisely defined problems. It's no accident that ""Fashionable Nonsense"" was penned by physicists. Physics is the hardest of the sciences; its successful theories have been established with greater mathematical precision than have concepts in any other field of endeavor. But physics works best with things that matter least to outsiders—the arcana of quantum mechanics, for example. Once sucked in by the elegant system presented in freshman physics classes, who isn't at least a little bit disappointed to find that nothing really works as cleanly as it does in its classical estimation? (Quantum mechanics may reveal a physical universe stranger than we could possibly have imagined, but it left this former physics student, at least, pining for the world of Newton. Since the 17th century is unlikely ever again to represent the cutting edge of scientific knowledge, I threw over science for art, dropping out of grad school after three semesters and trading a handful of correct answers for a wealth of pretty good ones.)The trouble with working among what my high school physics teacher called the ""fuzzies"" is that you may feel as if you are right, but you can never prove it. If the fuzzies in question are sociologists, psychologists, linguists, or other quasi-scientists, the temptation will be strong to hijack the certitude of hard science to serve ideas you wish you could be sure about. Although it may be tempting to ascribe malice or lunacy to traffickers in pseudoscience, their quest, however misguided, is really quite poignant. They crave adulation for discovering something demonstrably true about things that, at least when they idealistically set out on their intellectual journeys, were serious ""real-world"" problems.But, as Batman whispered to Lacan, when the theorist lost his grip and slipped away into the bottomless maelstrom of text: ""Poor, deluded child.""Sokal and Bricmont don't abandon all hope for a cross-fertilization of ideas, but I'm not sure that scientists and non-scientists really can talk to each other about the things that really matter to them. And I don't think such a development, because it forces a bit of humility on us, is all bad. Knowledge has fragmented to the point that a degree of specialization is necessary. I'm a generalist at heart, and it pains me to say it, but whenever someone today is called a ""Renaissance man,"" you can bet that the speaker holds a grossly inflated opinion of that person's intellect. The world has simply gotten too big for any one person to get his mind around it. It's been said that Coleridge was the last person to know everything, but I wonder if even he wasn't born too late.Sokal and Bricmont know the genie isn't going back into the bottle, and they dispassionately deliver a corrective to innocents (even belligerent innocents) who think they can sidestep the problem either by usurping the language of science or, having given up on certainty, by discounting science altogether. Tough-minded to a fault, the physicists not only establish the circumstances under which no reasonable interdisciplinary discussion can occur, they also tell us when nonscientists shouldn't be talking at all.

These portions lay out good, popular-level critiques of radical skepticism and postmodern mumbo-jumbo. You can skip or skim the rest, which is comprised mostly of long quotations from academic ""theorists"" (i.e., mid-20th-century French philosophers or their disciples) alongside the author's commentary. All of these sections can be summarized as follows:French Academic: [Writes something entirely incomprehensible.]Sokal and Bricmont: ""The preceding passage was entirely incomprehensible. As professional scientists and mathematicians, we assure you that all references to science and mathematics are bogus.""Sometimes they take the time to explain the scientific or mathematical concepts in layman's terms so that readers can understand their critiques more deeply. Often, they do not. If you have already encountered ""theory""(in this particular sense of that term) and are perceptive (cynical?) enough to have concluded that it's willfully obscure, you won't get much out of reading these chapters.On a personal note, the authors made a couple claims that I had arrived at independently, and it was gratifying to see these notions in print:(1) ""Theory"" looks an awful lot like mysticism, and it may make sense to analyze it as a religious movement. (Page 37; they are especially referring to Lacan, here.)(2) Our inability to refute a position fully doesn't mean we have any reason to accept that position. (Page 54; they are especially referring to solipsism.)"
253,0312204078,http://goodreads.com/user/show/10174911-syed-ashrafulla,3,"The premise of the book is very sound. The authors are going after the improper use of fundamental mathematics and physics by philosophers who have run out of ways to confuse readers. Through a myriad of examples, the authors continually discredit the arguments given by postmodernists that try to employ modern physics. Those attacks are very solid. Postmodernists do misunderstand the link between science and philosophy. Sociologists do try to sweep scientific rigor under the rug when convenient.My problem with the book is its style. In an attempt to fortify the arguments against the lawyer-like retorts of the human sciences, they post far too much context. As a result I'm reading too much garbage. I prefer terser quotations with pointed rebuttals. I don't like the pasting of four paragraphs followed by a three line critique. Why not just break it up? Are you worried that the defenders will use the blunt critique of context? That critique is generally stupid anyway, but the authors spent a significant part of the book trying to answer that critique. People like me who don't have a dog in the fight then have to slog through terrible sentence after terrible sentence by philosophers who aim to confuse. Thanks, I thought we were going to avoid that.It's still an ok book. It's probably required reading for anyone in grad school. It's just not that pleasant or coherent a book to read."

I went in expecting more of a general-audience nonfiction work that aims to help lay-persons who are affected by the nonsense peddled by pseudo-mystics like Deepak Chopra whose particular brand of bullshit is hidden under a shiny candy coating of what appears to be a scientific basis.What this actually is reads much more like a scientific journal article. There is a very familiar cadence reminiscent of astrophysics papers I used to read regularly, and it has that exceptionally dry, ordered formatting that is desirable in objective scientific work.This was very enlightening, and it helped a great deal that I was once obsessed with post-modern philosophy and was able to keep up (though it underscores my decision to abandon that particular hobby long ago).If you are already well-versed in philosophical formalism, go for it, though don't expect a particular engaging read even then. It is what it is, there's no fluff. If you follow my reviews and updates, you know how quickly I read; this took me almost a week to get through, which about sums it up.It did work fantastically as a sleep aid on some nights where I found myself drifting off a full hour or more ahead of when I usually hit the wall.If you aren't into dry philosophy and formal logic, then this is definitely a hard pass for you."

I think I never recovered from the traumatic experience of reading the line: ""modern war takes place in Non-Euclidean Space"", the great Baudrillardian coinage.I would have said this book has officially run its course, but certain factions of the feminist movement who religiously hew to the ideas of Luce Irigaray restrain me from doing so. As much as I would like to believe otherwise, ideas such as ""modern science is a male construct"" or ""women are bullied out of a career in the natural sciences"" are still perniciously widespread. Thankfully, postmodernism as a philosophical practice has fallen out of favor in the academia. But the ideas put forth in the early 70s have percolated to the forefront of the public consciousness in the 2010s decade. I wish these ideas would eventually wither away. However, there is no such sign on the horizon. Keeping that in mind, I would say this book still retains its necessity. If not the whole thing, read at least a few chapters. These postmodern ideas are so freaking amusing; when they are not downright petrifying. For example, you can always find comic relief in feminist Julia Kristeva's endeavors to explain poetic language in terms of set theory."

Foucault answers that in France, in order to be taken seriously as an intellectual, at least 10% of what you write should be incomprehensible. Otherwise people just won't think it's ""deep"" or sophisticated. That's probably the biggest part of the problem with broadly postmodern writers, and 10% is a very conservative estimate in this case. Still, some of the philosophers discussed in this book have some genuinely interesting ideas (though not unequivocally true ones). In particular, I think Latour, Deleuze, and Derrida (not covered) have some valuable insights to contribute (though, again, I don't always agree with them, particularly in the case of Derrida). It is just too bad that they think they can score intellectual points in their writings by using scientific terms they don't understand. On the other hand, authors such as Lacan and Kristeva are completely vacuous, while Irigaray is just too ridiculous to be taken seriously. Also, relativism is dumb. No discourse of no length will ever make that a viable way out of a philosophical problem."

It's good to see scientists such as Sokal exposing this 'fashionable nonsense' for what it really is. I'm saddened to say, however, that even 22 years after the publication of his parody 'Transgressing the Boundaries,' we still see the same arguments and the same fashionable nonsense repeated today. What we need is to practice critical thinking, and really understand what it is we're reading and what we're talking about. The subchapter 'For a Dialogue Between the Two Cultures' in the epilogue, it is given some hints on how we are to do this, and is relevant as much now as it was then. The text was mainly structured to illustrate seperate persons who were obscuring their field of study, but I found the intermezzo chapters to be a lot more enlightening. The intermezzo parts and the epilogue were by far my favorite parts, but of course it was important to see how absurd certain individuals on the Left (especially in France) has written and tangled with information in desperate attempts to put their own names in their history books by achieving the paradigm shift of Thomas Kuhn."

FN aims specifically at the abuse of science by Continental theorists, and in so doing, is successful. In the introduction, it is said that they do not make judgments about the whole of anyone's work, only the misappropriations of science by the selected writers. And I applaud this. As for the rest of what these theorists have to say, they aren't wholly a waste of time. Mileage may vary. I find D&G's work stimulating for artists and, for example, their critique of capitalism out of Marx's Fragment on Machines is insightful, and unlike someone below/above, no, Marx is not irrelevant. Anyway, Sokol's points are spot-on and sorely needed. There's no doubt that the Continentals were often obtuse and obscurantist. It simply cannot be denied. But each one of the writers critiqued offer interesting insights and nuanced views on the world and its problems...as long as they spare us their misunderstanding of science. When they abuse that, it's natural that people will be skeptical of the rest of their work. Like David Foster Wallace, who misunderstood infinity, it's not fair to pan the remainder of the work only because of this. But it is a thorn in our sides. "

271,0312204078,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5695847-abyy,5,"Sokal and Bricmont launch a devastating critique of the pretentious and obscurantist tendencies of several authors in the pomo canon in this book. Their specific locus of attack is these philosophers' (and I use the term here in a very loose sense) misuse and deliberate abuse of scientific and mathematical concepts as a strategy to embellish and give an aura of credibility to very bad writing. [A caveat: I'm not a philosopher, physicist, mathematician, literary theorist, psychoanalyst or even well acquainted with any of these disciplines so everything I say about this can reasonably be seen as suspect.]Intellectual Impostures was an immensely enjoyable read. It confirmed what I've long suspected about the so-called ""radical"" thought of many pomo writers - that what appears prima facie to be incredibly profound ideas collapse under any sustained rational examination. While Sokal and Bricmont confine themselves to their areas of expertise (physics and mathematics), many of their observations are well taken and apply to the other works and to the other authors who 'do' pomo. As Sokal and Bricmont very ably point out, many of the ideas pomo authors proffer are deliberately written very ambiguously such that they can be read one of two ways - as either trivially true or surprising but false (or a third possibility: hopelessly confused). This book was published a decade ago. I wish I could report that their critiques are now merely of historical interest to a reinvigorated Left - but unfortunately I find their points to be as valid as they were when they were first published. I could go on in this vein for awhile but, to cut my vitriol short, suffice to say I'd strongly recommend to anyone with even a peripheral interest in science, pomo and the relation between them. Intellectual Impostures remains a very timely contribution that serves (hopefully) as a remedy for a Left that has increasingly become politically regressive, intellectually dishonest and, perhaps worst of all, not even wrong."
272,0312204078,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5805110-sweta-gupta,2,"I am in a dilemma in writing a review for this book. It inspired two extreme reactions. On one hand, I found the observations in the book to be hilarious and very well pointed out. On the other hand, I struggled through the 211 pages because the writing style was so dry and non-engaging and consisted largely of what the authors term “fashionable nonsense”: difficult language that sounds extremely profound and complex, but is in fact, meaningless. This book came as a result of Alan Sokal’s hoax, a nonsensical article that he submitted to an American culture studies journal, which was hailed by postmodernists. Of course, Sokal revealed the hoax and the praise of the postmodernists that had come in before the revelation clearly proved that the postmodernists really did not understand even their contemporaries but hailed each others’ work anyway. The book is all about deliberately obscure language and created confusion for the purpose of sounding profound. Needless to say, the writers have received a fair amount of criticism as well.Approximately half (or perhaps a bit more) of the book consists of long passages from the very works the authors are critiquing (ripping apart). And as the authors show in their commentary, those passages are mostly indecipherable gibberish. Reading those puts a serious strain on your mental capacities. I took more than a week to finish this 210 page book, and it was just a very, very painstaking effort.This book requires a fair understanding of conceptual physics and mathematics to understand that the passages reproduced are actually incomprehensible. I would not recommend it to someone who doesn’t have a decent understanding of those. In the epilogue, the authors lay out some broad lessons, which are useful for anyone: know what you are talking about instead of creating ambiguities by using flowery language to conceal your lack of understanding, not all that is obscure is necessarily profound and several others."
273,0312204078,http://goodreads.com/user/show/20247815-stephen,5,"Excellent discussion of the specific instances of postmodern writers in already-nebulous ""critical"" disciplines invoking scientific and mathematical concepts to equivocate (or spew outright gibberish!) under the guise of borrowing credence and rigor. Entertainingly written with a mind toward parsimony and specificity of argument that reflects the authors' backgrounds in scientific methodology without robbing the text of levity or accessibility. The epilogue is veers into op-ed territory - but in a good way: the authors emphasize the importance of precise, contextual, and intellectually honest articulation not only in academia, but as a discursive basis for broader social and intellectual projects that shape the course of society. A powerful read for anyone passionate about the sciences and chagrined by the creeping vacuity of the pseudo-intellectualism that infests the postmodern segment of the academy."
274,0312204078,http://goodreads.com/user/show/279997-llew,4,"By themselves, the quotes used in this book are some of the finest examples of academic horseshit one might ever hope to come across. I still love a good meandering philosophy tome, but there is something highly important about what Sokal and company are doing here. This idea that, at a certain point, abusing science and math to continue your ideas is dumbing down the populace. That relativism may be used for cultural anthropology, but it needs to be abandoned when used in scientific understanding. There's some leeway given to Baudrillard who is given his own chapter, yet I still appreciate, as i think people understand that he's being ridiculous and not necessarily putting across formal theses. Lacan on the other hand, where he's giving a formal argument based on flawed understanding of well-known scientific ideas, comes across as just sad. Sokal knows his science, and they give good counter-proof that, no Quantum Relativity of the mind doesn't make sense and that's not how topology works, although the book fails when they try to provide a proper philosophy of science and epistemology. They give some time try to argue down questions like, ""how do we know this is reality"", and it meanders like the texts they are critiquing. Still, very essential that they wrote this. "
275,0312204078,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1841544-chris,3,"On display is lots of nonsense written in the postmodern tradition, specifically by philosophers that can basically be classified as epistemic relativists. In the first several chapters, the responses by the authors to absurd passages from Lacan and Kristeva are quite detailed. As the book goes on, punctuated by several intermezzo chapters which give some background, much of the commentary becomes lazy. The authors begin to appeal to the self-evidence of the ridiculousness on display.Occasionally the authors' criticism seems like nitpicking, and I can't shake the feeling that the book would have benefitted from some back and forth, offering at least some defense of selected passages before a complete dismantling of the postmodern arguments. Don't get me wrong, I would NEVER defend any of the intellectual traditions the book lampoons. But you know the people that wrote these passages (or their disciples) would have responses to the obvious technical errors which the book frequently points out pepper their arguments. No doubt that these responses would be just as incomprehensible as the original arguments, buttressing the notion that they are just masters of manipulating erudite language and peddling pretentiousness.A fun read for the quote mining, but it probably could have been done better."
276,0312204078,http://goodreads.com/user/show/12638036-haaris-mateen,4,"Sokal and Bricmont bring balance to the Force. The overkill of relativism and scientism that had infected most of the social sciences and humanities couldn't have done with a better beneficial shock. Alas, the currents exposed still exist in the discourse of the Left, and it is perhaps one of the biggest flaws that exist in the battle against the poisonous populism insidiously rising the world over. The rise of the Post Truth world cannot be blamed solely on the ""other side"". This book (now almost twenty years old) reminds us of the pitfalls of choosing radical skepticism, a way of thought that isolates itself from reality and which allows dangerous deliverers to thrive; and a line of thinking which only university grads are equipped to even access (though not with any benefit to the world)."
277,0312204078,http://goodreads.com/user/show/44290999-jjonas,2,"2.5 stars.In the 'Afterword' to the original ""Sokal affair"" paper (which is the last item in this book), Sokal quotes C. P. Snow's view in Two cultures:""A good many times I have been present at gatherings of people who, by the standars of the traditional culture, are thought highly educated and who have with considerable gusto been expressing their incredulity at the illiteracy of scientists. Once or twice I have been provoked and have asked the company how many of them could describe the Second Law of Thermodynamics. The response was cold: it was also negative. Yet I was asking something which is about the scientific equivalent of: Have you read a work of Shakespeare's? [...] [T]he great edifice of modern physics goes up, and the majority of the cleverest people in the western world have about as much insight into it as their neolithic ancestors would have had."" (p. 276-277)Sokal notes:""One significant change has taken place since C. P. Snow's time: while humanist intellectuals' ignorance about (for example) mass and acceleration remains substantially unchanged, nowadays a significant minority of humanist intellectuals feels entitled to pontificate on these subjects in spite of their ignorance"" (p. 277).I take this to be the original motivation for writing the ""Sokal hoax paper"" and this book. And Sokal and Bricmont do make a good point about posturing intellectuals using frivolous analogies in their philosophy etc. texts to mathematics and physics which said authors don't really understand — and even if they did, do they really expect their likely readership to understand them without explicit clarification about why the chosen analogy is useful. I believe S & B demonstrate this satisfactorily and to good effect.(It should be noted in passing that it's not only some humanists and social scientists who are guilty of ignorance of other fields; e.g. someone like Steven Pinker has strayed ever further from his homebase in psychology and the study of language and written broad-stroke works with sweeping conclusions about history, liberalism etc. where he's not really the expert. Or consider economists, who get to be interviewed about politics, foreign relations, environmental issues etc., as if they've become some kind of universal intellectuals.)However, S & B are not on equally strong ground when they declare the quoted passages — which sure do look embarrassing — simply nonsense. I would agree they're nonsense as far as the language lifted from natural science and mathematics is concerned, but I think S & B might be guilty of somewhat comparable arrogance as their targets by proclaiming the quotes simply nonsensical, meaningless etc. — in all respects, not just in terms of the physics terminology etc.I think many people who praise this book are a bit too eager to strike at pomos with whatever they've got (something that I'm not totally unsympathetic towards, by the way) and disregard this side of the work. In fact, some seem to see the book (including people who probably haven't read it) as a wholesale condemnation of, if not a fatal blow to, postmodernism, which however is something that the authors don't even claim to do. Instead they've set themselves a far narrower task: to call out reckless use of concepts lifted from physics etc. with the intention of lending philosophical texts some rigour, respectability or whatever. That's a far cry from ""destroying postmodernism"" or whatever.Now, it does seem obvious to me that the ""pomo"" authors in questions are guilty of the most blatant kind of posturing, obfuscation and pretense one can imagine, and that stripped of the verbiage, what they have to say would turn out to be much less impressive than it appears (though not necessarily banal). So overall, I'm partial to what S & B are doing, for like them I'm a believer in objective physical reality independent of human (or other) consciousness, while — again, like them — not denying at all the sense in the moderate version of ""social construction of reality"" as a corrective to what S & B call ""naive modernism"" (p. 183).But I think S & B are wrong if they expect they can (or should) understand philosophical etc. texts as easily as if they were reading the newspaper. Personally I'm inclined to think that what Lacan, Kristeva etc. have to say is much more ordinary than it would appear at first sight (and much of it nonsense to boot), but I don't believe that S & B are significantly more qualified to make that call than I am. Our difference is that I didn't (and wouldn't) write a book about it.The chapters that picked apart scienced up pomo quotes were the least fun to read, and unfortunately that's more than half of the book. No doubt the chapters were necessary to drive the main point home, but reading it was hard work and the content was repetitive, and I confess I didn't read much of the quoted materials (some of the quotes were several pages long). In contrast, the ""intermezzo chapters"" that dealt with more general questions of philosophy of science and relativism were the most useful ones to me.The book ends with the original ""Sokal affair"" article and a chapter which explains what was fishy about it. While I believe that Social Text is to blame for publishing stuff the subject matter of which they didn't understand, I'm also somewhat sympathetic towards the argument that in a journal like Social Text it's not necessarily the editors' duty to weed out wild and unconventional ideas but instead let the readership judge for themselves whether (some of) the ideas in some article merit any attention."

By the mid-'90s the problem had gotten far enough out of hand that New York University physics prof Alan Sokal felt compelled to cook up a heady stew of anti-scientific pigheadedness and pseudotechnical misprision, season it liberally with quotes from such theoretical leading lights as Jacques Lacan, Gilles Deleuze and Félix Guattari, and Luce Irigaray, and set the steaming dish down in front of the editors of the Duke University Press cultural-studies journal ""Social Text""—who promptly served it up in their Spring/Summer 1996 issue.Sokal then outed himself, exposing his parody in an article rejected by ""Social Text,"" which judged the correction to the published goof beneath its ""intellectual standards."" ""Dissent"" and ""Philosophy and Literature"" picked up the second piece, but by the time they hit the stacks the popular press had already had a field day with Sokal's prank.Needless to say, ""Social Text"" editors Andrew Ross and Stanley Aronowitz weren't amused. Nor were the hordes of tenured radicals who had built their careers on what had been exposed as institutionally codified idiocy. They counterattacked, and now Sokal has teamed up with Belgium-based theoretical physicist Jean Bricmont (it helps to have a Francophone on your side in such matters) to respond with a book-length popular treatment of postmodern ideological excess and methodological madness.Chapter by chapter, Sokal and Bricmont calmly, meticulously tear new assholes for Lacan, Deleuze and Guattari, Irigaray, Julia Kristeva, Bruno Latour, Jean Baudrillard, and Paul Virilio. The physicists aren't staging some sort of anti-theoretical pogrom; they're just standing up for rationality. Jacques Derrida keeps his hands off science; Sokal and Bricmont keep their hands off Derrida. They refuse even to judge the theorists' overall programs, limiting their criticisms to their areas of expertise and suggesting that their targets could have benefited from similar circumspection.What they reveal is scandalous. Lacan indulges a fondness for topology, which he barely understands, and suffers a penchant for arbitrary metaphors, which he often refuses to acknowledge as anything other than literal truths. Kristeva does the same with set theory. Virilio misunderstands concepts that are covered in the first week of 11th-grade physics. Almost everybody jumps from one discipline to another with the mindless alacrity of a puppy visiting an unexplored row of lampposts.When they aren't picking apart the efforts of individual writers, Sokal and Bricmont go after entire subfields of bad thinking that have found widespread acceptance among intellectual poseurs. Between-chapters ""intermezzos"" are devoted to ""Epistemic Relativism in the Philosophy of Science"" (i.e., the notion that verifiable physical truth exists only as a cultural ""myth""), ""Chaos Theory and 'Postmodern Science'"" (in which precisely defined scientific notions about predictability and nonlinearity are confounded with their squirrelly linguistic kin), and the abuse of Gödel's theorem and set theory (where very specific mathematical results are generalized to shed light on areas to which they have no connection whatsoever).The literary drawbacks of an intensive debunking of heaps of nonsensical verbosity are immediately obvious. Heedless of the dictates of pleasure or readability, Sokal and Bricmont have selflessly, mercilessly larded their work with extensive quotes from their primary sources. It may be necessary, but the authors' assiduousness does not make for the ""thoroughly hilarious romp through the postmodernist academy"" promised by Barbara Ehrenreich's jacket blurb.There is no romping to speak of. There is true hilarity, but it is on the whole confined to the chapter concerning Irigaray's feminist critique of science. Even readers who have already made their minds up about Lacan and his ilk owe themselves a few minutes at the bookstore discovering such howlers as:""Is E=Mc2 a sexed equation? Perhaps it is. Let us make the hypothesis that it is insofar as it privileges the speed of light over other speeds that are vitally necessary to us. What seems to me to indicate the possibly sexed nature of the equation is not directly its uses by nuclear weapons, rather it is having privileged what goes the fastest...""What makes Irigaray so funny is that she exposes herself with clear writing. Her thinking may be utter hogwash, but her sentences are generally parsable. This is not commonly the case among her peers. Any educated reader who has attempted to skim a dense scientific work he knows he could understand given the time will recognize the appeal of scientific-sounding obfuscation to the nontechnical author. If you aren't proceeding through an equation term by term, your eyes simply bounce off it; its meaning is held in reserve until you take the time to extract it. Nontechnical readers as a rule can't distinguish between meaningful equations and sheer poppycock; their eyes bounce off both. Putting in the time to extract the meaning isn't an option open to them. An impenetrable equation signals erudition even if it has none to offer. And the same is true of a sentence composed of technical gibberish.Sokal and Bricmont are aware of the limits of the scientific purview, as they now stand, and acknowledge the difference between science and everything else. What the authors don't state explicitly (and perhaps do not believe) is that the scientific mind, which prefers precision to poetry, single meanings to double ones, and trudges to leaps, is fundamentally different from the nonscientific one, and that many a pomo misstep has been inspired by a refusal to accept this fact.It's natural to crave science's strengths and to shun its weaknesses; sadly, they come as a matched set. The authority and verifiability of the natural sciences are formidable, but science has been most successful with the simplest, most precisely defined problems. It's no accident that ""Fashionable Nonsense"" was penned by physicists. Physics is the hardest of the sciences; its successful theories have been established with greater mathematical precision than have concepts in any other field of endeavor. But physics works best with things that matter least to outsiders—the arcana of quantum mechanics, for example. Once sucked in by the elegant system presented in freshman physics classes, who isn't at least a little bit disappointed to find that nothing really works as cleanly as it does in its classical estimation? (Quantum mechanics may reveal a physical universe stranger than we could possibly have imagined, but it left this former physics student, at least, pining for the world of Newton. Since the 17th century is unlikely ever again to represent the cutting edge of scientific knowledge, I threw over science for art, dropping out of grad school after three semesters and trading a handful of correct answers for a wealth of pretty good ones.)The trouble with working among what my high school physics teacher called the ""fuzzies"" is that you may feel as if you are right, but you can never prove it. If the fuzzies in question are sociologists, psychologists, linguists, or other quasi-scientists, the temptation will be strong to hijack the certitude of hard science to serve ideas you wish you could be sure about. Although it may be tempting to ascribe malice or lunacy to traffickers in pseudoscience, their quest, however misguided, is really quite poignant. They crave adulation for discovering something demonstrably true about things that, at least when they idealistically set out on their intellectual journeys, were serious ""real-world"" problems.But, as Batman whispered to Lacan, when the theorist lost his grip and slipped away into the bottomless maelstrom of text: ""Poor, deluded child.""Sokal and Bricmont don't abandon all hope for a cross-fertilization of ideas, but I'm not sure that scientists and non-scientists really can talk to each other about the things that really matter to them. And I don't think such a development, because it forces a bit of humility on us, is all bad. Knowledge has fragmented to the point that a degree of specialization is necessary. I'm a generalist at heart, and it pains me to say it, but whenever someone today is called a ""Renaissance man,"" you can bet that the speaker holds a grossly inflated opinion of that person's intellect. The world has simply gotten too big for any one person to get his mind around it. It's been said that Coleridge was the last person to know everything, but I wonder if even he wasn't born too late.Sokal and Bricmont know the genie isn't going back into the bottle, and they dispassionately deliver a corrective to innocents (even belligerent innocents) who think they can sidestep the problem either by usurping the language of science or, having given up on certainty, by discounting science altogether. Tough-minded to a fault, the physicists not only establish the circumstances under which no reasonable interdisciplinary discussion can occur, they also tell us when nonscientists shouldn't be talking at all.

282,0312204078,http://goodreads.com/user/show/38719275-dale-grauman,3,"Read the introduction, both ""intermezzos,"" and the epilogue. These portions lay out good, popular-level critiques of radical skepticism and postmodern mumbo-jumbo. You can skip or skim the rest, which is comprised mostly of long quotations from academic ""theorists"" (i.e., mid-20th-century French philosophers or their disciples) alongside the author's commentary. All of these sections can be summarized as follows:French Academic: [Writes something entirely incomprehensible.]Sokal and Bricmont: ""The preceding passage was entirely incomprehensible. As professional scientists and mathematicians, we assure you that all references to science and mathematics are bogus.""Sometimes they take the time to explain the scientific or mathematical concepts in layman's terms so that readers can understand their critiques more deeply. Often, they do not. If you have already encountered ""theory""(in this particular sense of that term) and are perceptive (cynical?) enough to have concluded that it's willfully obscure, you won't get much out of reading these chapters.On a personal note, the authors made a couple claims that I had arrived at independently, and it was gratifying to see these notions in print:(1) ""Theory"" looks an awful lot like mysticism, and it may make sense to analyze it as a religious movement. (Page 37; they are especially referring to Lacan, here.)(2) Our inability to refute a position fully doesn't mean we have any reason to accept that position. (Page 54; they are especially referring to solipsism.)"
283,0312204078,http://goodreads.com/user/show/10174911-syed-ashrafulla,3,"The premise of the book is very sound. The authors are going after the improper use of fundamental mathematics and physics by philosophers who have run out of ways to confuse readers. Through a myriad of examples, the authors continually discredit the arguments given by postmodernists that try to employ modern physics. Those attacks are very solid. Postmodernists do misunderstand the link between science and philosophy. Sociologists do try to sweep scientific rigor under the rug when convenient.My problem with the book is its style. In an attempt to fortify the arguments against the lawyer-like retorts of the human sciences, they post far too much context. As a result I'm reading too much garbage. I prefer terser quotations with pointed rebuttals. I don't like the pasting of four paragraphs followed by a three line critique. Why not just break it up? Are you worried that the defenders will use the blunt critique of context? That critique is generally stupid anyway, but the authors spent a significant part of the book trying to answer that critique. People like me who don't have a dog in the fight then have to slog through terrible sentence after terrible sentence by philosophers who aim to confuse. Thanks, I thought we were going to avoid that.It's still an ok book. It's probably required reading for anyone in grad school. It's just not that pleasant or coherent a book to read."
284,0312204078,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4606766-scott-johnson,3,"This was....something.While I learned a lot and agree with the message, it was like trying to drink from a fire hose. I went in expecting more of a general-audience nonfiction work that aims to help lay-persons who are affected by the nonsense peddled by pseudo-mystics like Deepak Chopra whose particular brand of bullshit is hidden under a shiny candy coating of what appears to be a scientific basis.What this actually is reads much more like a scientific journal article. There is a very familiar cadence reminiscent of astrophysics papers I used to read regularly, and it has that exceptionally dry, ordered formatting that is desirable in objective scientific work.This was very enlightening, and it helped a great deal that I was once obsessed with post-modern philosophy and was able to keep up (though it underscores my decision to abandon that particular hobby long ago).If you are already well-versed in philosophical formalism, go for it, though don't expect a particular engaging read even then. It is what it is, there's no fluff. If you follow my reviews and updates, you know how quickly I read; this took me almost a week to get through, which about sums it up.It did work fantastically as a sleep aid on some nights where I found myself drifting off a full hour or more ahead of when I usually hit the wall.If you aren't into dry philosophy and formal logic, then this is definitely a hard pass for you."
285,0312204078,http://goodreads.com/user/show/24452449-zihad-azad,5,"At places, my brain stopped working trying to figure out the meaning of certain excerpts quoted in this book. I think I never recovered from the traumatic experience of reading the line: ""modern war takes place in Non-Euclidean Space"", the great Baudrillardian coinage.I would have said this book has officially run its course, but certain factions of the feminist movement who religiously hew to the ideas of Luce Irigaray restrain me from doing so. As much as I would like to believe otherwise, ideas such as ""modern science is a male construct"" or ""women are bullied out of a career in the natural sciences"" are still perniciously widespread. Thankfully, postmodernism as a philosophical practice has fallen out of favor in the academia. But the ideas put forth in the early 70s have percolated to the forefront of the public consciousness in the 2010s decade. I wish these ideas would eventually wither away. However, there is no such sign on the horizon. Keeping that in mind, I would say this book still retains its necessity. If not the whole thing, read at least a few chapters. These postmodern ideas are so freaking amusing; when they are not downright petrifying. For example, you can always find comic relief in feminist Julia Kristeva's endeavors to explain poetic language in terms of set theory."
286,0312204078,http://goodreads.com/user/show/44761402-jens,4,"There's a youtube clip in which John Searle talks to Foucault about why his writing is so atrocious, even though he can convey his reasonable ideas well in speech. Foucault answers that in France, in order to be taken seriously as an intellectual, at least 10% of what you write should be incomprehensible. Otherwise people just won't think it's ""deep"" or sophisticated. That's probably the biggest part of the problem with broadly postmodern writers, and 10% is a very conservative estimate in this case. Still, some of the philosophers discussed in this book have some genuinely interesting ideas (though not unequivocally true ones). In particular, I think Latour, Deleuze, and Derrida (not covered) have some valuable insights to contribute (though, again, I don't always agree with them, particularly in the case of Derrida). It is just too bad that they think they can score intellectual points in their writings by using scientific terms they don't understand. On the other hand, authors such as Lacan and Kristeva are completely vacuous, while Irigaray is just too ridiculous to be taken seriously. Also, relativism is dumb. No discourse of no length will ever make that a viable way out of a philosophical problem."
287,0312204078,http://goodreads.com/user/show/51799238-stefan-matias,5,"A great illustration of the scientific frauds of the 20th century. It's good to see scientists such as Sokal exposing this 'fashionable nonsense' for what it really is. I'm saddened to say, however, that even 22 years after the publication of his parody 'Transgressing the Boundaries,' we still see the same arguments and the same fashionable nonsense repeated today. What we need is to practice critical thinking, and really understand what it is we're reading and what we're talking about. The subchapter 'For a Dialogue Between the Two Cultures' in the epilogue, it is given some hints on how we are to do this, and is relevant as much now as it was then. The text was mainly structured to illustrate seperate persons who were obscuring their field of study, but I found the intermezzo chapters to be a lot more enlightening. The intermezzo parts and the epilogue were by far my favorite parts, but of course it was important to see how absurd certain individuals on the Left (especially in France) has written and tangled with information in desperate attempts to put their own names in their history books by achieving the paradigm shift of Thomas Kuhn."

FN aims specifically at the abuse of science by Continental theorists, and in so doing, is successful. In the introduction, it is said that they do not make judgments about the whole of anyone's work, only the misappropriations of science by the selected writers. And I applaud this. As for the rest of what these theorists have to say, they aren't wholly a waste of time. Mileage may vary. I find D&G's work stimulating for artists and, for example, their critique of capitalism out of Marx's Fragment on Machines is insightful, and unlike someone below/above, no, Marx is not irrelevant. Anyway, Sokol's points are spot-on and sorely needed. There's no doubt that the Continentals were often obtuse and obscurantist. It simply cannot be denied. But each one of the writers critiqued offer interesting insights and nuanced views on the world and its problems...as long as they spare us their misunderstanding of science. When they abuse that, it's natural that people will be skeptical of the rest of their work. Like David Foster Wallace, who misunderstood infinity, it's not fair to pan the remainder of the work only because of this. But it is a thorn in our sides. "

The only problem I see (and is somewhat justified because Sokal is a physicist) is that he doesn´t seem to understand the concept of paradigm by Kuhn (paradigms don´t relativize, they explain the thought of society in a determined epoch; they mantain in its core the fundamental knowledge and previous advancements of scientific progress) and marxism (dialectical materialism is proven scientifically; it isn´t gibberish nor rethoric, Das Kapital is an entire landmark on economics).
