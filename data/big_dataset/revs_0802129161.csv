0,0802129161,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5067228-marianne,4,"Europe: A Natural History is a non-fiction book by Australian scientist, explorer and conservationist, Tim Flannery. In his introduction he says he aims to “answer three great questions. How was Europe formed? How was its extraordinary history discovered? And why did Europe come to be so important in the world?” To achieve this, Flannery needs to give the reader a LOT of information. It is quickly apparent that he is an expert in this field, so distilling the wealth of his knowledge into a manageable 300 pages (excluding comprehensive Endnotes and Index) would have been no enviable task. And the information is accessible: relatively easy to follow for a novice, with abundant references should the reader's interest is piqued by a certain topic.This could all be terribly dry, dusty and maybe a bit boring, but this is Tim Flannery, so readers shouldn’t be surprised to find themselves laughing out loud fairly regularly: “Between 30 million and one million years ago painted frogs abounded in Europe, but then they became extinct. In 1940 biologists collected two adult frogs and two tadpoles in the vicinity of Lake Hula, in what is now Israel. To everyone’s astonishment, they were painted frogs. The larger of the two promptly ate its smaller companion…”If many of the creatures that Flannery writes about are incredibly bizarre, then no less odd and frequently quirky are some of the people who discover, investigate, study and write about all those rocks, fossils and life forms. For example, Hans Stehlin who “…had become something of a legend for his dogged pursuit of palaeontology, but it seems there was more to his dedication than scientific interest. According to museum folklore he had been thwarted in love, and to forget his misfortune had poured all his energy and passion into his work. Handsome, with a Freud-like beard and piercing eyes, it was also said that he had perfected the death stare. Whenever he required the skeleton of some exotic beast to compare with his fossil bones, he would visit Basel Zoo and stare at the appropriate animal, which would soon thereafter shuffle off its mortal coil.”As Flannery works through the answers to those questions he poses, he gives plenty of examples, but be prepared also for lots of migration, and not just of people and fauna, but also of flora and ice caps and land masses. And the pronunciation of some of some of those species and genus names may prove a challenge to the tongue and possibly the brain. This is an interesting, informative, often thought-provoking and ultimately hopeful read."

I read this book while in the Flinders Ranges where some of the rocks are 500 million years old so matched the timespan included in Flannery’s latest work. The author makes what could have been a very dry subject into an enjoyable romp full of unusual characters who put together the various pieces of the puzzles that deciphered what grew and lived when, what climatic conditions existed and how the landmass changed. A brilliant book full of unusual facts, written in a Bill Bryson style, this was an enjoyable read."
2,0802129161,http://goodreads.com/user/show/23233462-clare-o-beara,5,"What a fun book!We emerge from a time machine to see islands where today there is a massive continent. Some parts of the land host dinosaurs, made smaller by islandisation, and leather-winged avians grown bigger for the same reason, like the moa; other parts are mountains composed of sea snail shells. We're looking at Albania and Romania, of the far past. The animals found here, including crocodiles and large turtles, went on to live in Australia and nearby islands for thousands more years, until people arrived on first one shore and then another where they left behind massive deposits of turtle bones. This is a clear sign that the lands were once joined and sheltered a common ancestor of each creature. As well as such unusual sights, we are shown the eccentric and moneyed early palaeontologists, what mad ideas they produced, where they were right. The Tethys Sea had been to the south, warm and full of ammonites, and the Bering Sea had been a cold neighbour to the north, full of coccolithophores laying down calcium to form limestone. The fossils thus stored were a source of endless fascination to the wealthy and new fields of study were emerging. The Turgei Strait kept Europe apart from Asia so at the time they shared few animal species. But volcanic islands rising above sea made stepping stones, and these were crossed. Something I hadn't previously heard was that rivers flowed from Africa to Europe at times, bringing fish and frogs. Another migration corridor (cold and dark much of the year) was a land bridge almost to the North Pole called the De Geer Corridor, from Europe to America. While Europe is not known to have sent species out from its islands at that time, says the author, some creatures used it on the route from Asia to America during the late age of dinosaurs. Amphibians are Europe's living fossils. Salamandrids evolved in Europe 90 million years ago and went to America as the dinosaurs died out, later to Asia. One nice tale is about the midwife toad on Majorca, first described from fossils then rediscovered in a valley where the survivors escaped introduced rats and dogs. With protection the species is being successfully reintroduced to other sites. We also learn of the Hula painted frog, thought extinct for a million years before being picked up in Israel in 1940. The species vanished again but now lives in a nature reserve. Up to then, the only painted frogs were in a museum. Relatives, the ancient tailed frog species, are in Africa, New Zealand and North America.That's by Page 42. I could go on producing these fascinating facts all day with this book to hand. I find 'Europe' well written and clear, to a keen naturalist, though not perhaps a school student, due to long scientific terms given to species or processes. The author does explain as he goes but a basic knowledge of natural sciences from geology to botany and zoology is assumed. For me the pages are full of interest. Chapter 7 looks at the meteor (or bolide) impact 66 million years ago and shocked quartz; the iridium layer was first identified in Italy's Apennines. Chapter 8 shows us a world of ferns, shouldered aside by tree seeds sprouting and un-nibbled by giant herbivores. Chapter 9 - due to a series of climate changes the European landmass was unifying and deep in old forest, just right for giant herbivores which invaded from North America. We meet Dr Jerry Hooker, whose career to date has yielded tiny fossils that have created much of our knowledge of the fauna of the lands. With invasions from all lands, the local fauna were devastated. And Asian animals went to America, including the horse, dog, camel.We are told that while the oldest known bat fossils are in Australia, no likely ancestors lived there. The origin of bats is thus a mystery even today. I'm glad there is something left to discover. Chapter 10 - the fossil pit at Messen, a carbon-dioxide belching lake at earlier times. And so on, a rich tapestry of places, people and fossil hunting. Even oil drillers in the Arctic Sea have contributed. We see extinctions caused by climate changes and caused by a mass invasion of species. As the author is Australian we consistently get the Aus - NZ viewpoint, such as the world's oldest songbirds having originated in Australia, which adds a rounded dimension to a book on Europe and adds even more fun facts. Including the tree species which thrived, moved and died out or replaced others. Then we learn of the largest hedgehog ever to exist, grabbing a fawn. The fun never stops. Oh, and everything you know about where apes and humanoids evolved and apes being superior to monkeys? Think again after reading the events of 17 -13 million years ago. Africa moving north allowed monkeys, which had evolved first in Asia and moved, to enter Europe and then isolated them for a time; by the time apes were found in Africa they had existed in Europe for a million years. Finds from history, from war years, from 2017, along with DNA analysis, CT scans and computer modelling are helping us to discover more, faster, than ever before. The bipedal footprints left on a Cretan beach are one recent find. A handy chart is at the end of that chapter. And then come the Ice Ages. I just had to mention that hybrids of brown bears and polar bears account for 8.8% of the brown bear genome. In this chapter, we're told Haldane's rule finds male hybrid mammals less fertile than female - certainly true of the mule. But where hybrids survive and are fertile, they bring new useful genes that assist species survival in changing times or new habitats. This is by way of introducing us to the concepts in an upcoming chapter on a Neanderthal-human family in Romania and the Denisovans, which spread to Asia, blending with humans.I'll just mention that the final section is called Europe's Silent Spring, which is not cheerful; but the book ends with rewilding and possibly re-creating ancient environments and beasts. Maybe the time machine user will see a mammoth-like beast on the steppe in the future. I did not get a map in my ARC but space is earmarked for one at the start of each section, which would help. As would some illustrations or photos, but these may be in the final version. 'Europe' is admirably suited to students of ecology, geology, botany, zoology, prehistory and history; the later chapters to geopolitics and conservation.Notes P329 - 356 in my e-ARC. As first initials were used instead of names I was unable to say how many women's names were present, apart from Flora and Europa. The author may be a palaeontologist, but I'm sure he'd agree with me that this book is not a dry recital of lists, and a good step in making science books more accessible to the populace would be, in my opinion, giving first names to scientists, which would also enable women to be seen and credited for their work. I downloaded an e-copy from Net Galley (but I'll have to get my own). This is an unbiased review."
3,0802129161,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1413571-william-lawrence,5,"Fantastic read on natural history! The timelines are great (38,000 years ago: ""Europe is colonised by humans from Africa forming a hybrid human- Neanderthal population."") Amazing facts on everything from the very first mammals of Europe to more recent humans. I particularly found a section interesting on how and when humans turned cows into milk factories. This book is a collection keeper. A time capsule work that tells THE story. "
4,0802129161,http://goodreads.com/user/show/15965497-girl,3,"I received an e-book copy of this title from the publisher via NetGalley in exchange for my honest opinion. Thank you!Tim Flannery's Europe describes the natural story of the European continent in its many senses. There is the geological history, the history of biological life - of both flora and fauna - over the millennia, even a brief history of the humankind's ventures into Europe over the course of human evolution. The final chapters describe the latest events in Europe's natural history, namely, the extinctions of subsequent animal species living in Europe. The subject matter is very interesting, and there are many separate fragments of the book that I found very engaging and intriguing. However, as a whole, the book doesn't quite work for me. It might be partly the fault of the e-book, which had no maps or illustrations that could help the reader to better imagine the issues one is reading about. But I also thought that the book could be a little chaotic at times, and the progression from one topic to another wasn't always intuitive. In particular, I found the part of the book devoted to Neanderthal and early human presence in Europe lacking -- especially since I have recently read Karin Bojs's ""My European Family"", treating on the same subject in much greater detail. And then, towards the end, in a discussion on wisent's near-extinction in Europe, Flannery writes that prior to World War One, wisents were protected by Polish kings, but given the hardships of WW One, people started to hunt wisents down for their meat. And I'm like ... but at that time Poland hadn't had kings since 1798? Like... wtf?  And maybe it's just shorthand for tsars and whatnot, or maybe it's just jumping over the entire nineteenth century, but-- if this is a mistake I caught because I'm familiar with this particular subject, there might be many more such omissions and shorthands that I didn't catch in this book. Well, hopefully there aren't, but now I can't be sure.TL;DR is that it's an interesting book and a good primer but you might want to check out the facts in independent sources if you want to share some tidbits with your friends."
5,0802129161,http://goodreads.com/user/show/23195904-radiantflux,5,42nd book for 2019.A remarkably ambitious environmental history of Europe covering a period of time when miniature dinosaurs lived on islands in Transylvania till the present day. A very enjoyable and well written book.5-stars.
6,0802129161,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3285053-kim,5,"A triumph of Natural History that spans from 100 million years ago all the way to a peek into the future. Any book that stuffs that span of time into 357 pages is going to be densely packed with fascinating information. It also has only a small section for images, so having google handy to look up unfamiliar beasts works quite well while reading this book. It's a very open-minded approach and introduced me to a whole new way of looking at conservation with a very long term view. Fascinating. Had to dedicate blocks of 20 mins of reading time (in multiple amounts) to it, because I found it took quite a bit of concentration to absorb the small amount of it that I feel I did. Quite an eye-opener and a really great read. Will be considering getting my own secondhand copy after returning this one to the library so I can have a more indepth look at the many pages of footnotes. "
7,0802129161,http://goodreads.com/user/show/17629329-leah,5,"From fossils to the future...Starting roughly 100 million years ago, Flannery sets out to tell the story of Europe – how it formed, the species that have lived, survived or become extinct in it, the rise of humanity, and the possible future impacts of our current galloping climate change. Along the way, he tells us of the many men and women who have contributed to uncovering this history or who have in some way affected it.There’s so much in this fascinating book that it’s hard to know how to summarise it in a few hundred words. It gives a panoramic view, bringing together and linking all the bits of natural history that are often covered separately, such as the formation of the continent, or current rewilding projects, or the origins of humanity. It’s surprisingly compact, considering its huge scope, and yet never feels superficial or rushed. And Flannery is a master of the art of converting scientific information into language easily understandable by the non-scientist.Flannery starts by explaining how the landmass formed and changed over time and how this impacted on the development and spread of species, or conversely on their isolation to single geographic areas. He explains the various climate changes over the aeons – why they happened and how they affected both environment and fauna. He describes the various land corridors that have existed at points between what are now separate continents, and the flow of species along these. I was reading a review copy without maps, but it indicated that maps will be available in the final version – I didn’t find the lack of them seriously affected my understanding of what he was describing, but they would undoubtedly be an enhancement.Personally I’m very human-centric, so I found the sections where he discussed the early hominids, the Neanderthals and the early humans particularly interesting. Flannery seems to have a good deal of admiration for the Neanderthals, seeing them not in any way as a lower form of species to humanity. In fact, he often gives the impression that in some ways he thinks they were superior in terms of intelligence and innovation, and that humanity’s main advantage, and the reason why we survived and they didn’t, is that humans can exist on foods other than meat, which enabled us to adapt better to changing environments. There’s a fascinating chapter on hybridisation between pale-skinned European Neanderthals and the early black African humans to create the first European humans. He doesn’t specifically say so, but I got the distinct feeling that he thinks the infusion of Neanderthal DNA was advantageous to the humans. Certainly he suspects that female Neanderthal mothers may have passed tips to their hybrid offspring on how to survive in the cold European climate, such as cave-dwelling. Apparently indigenous Europeans (and their descendants throughout the diaspora) still have a small but significant percentage of Neanderthal DNA. Once into the human phase of history, he shows how man began to impact on the environment and on other species, hunting some to extinction, destroying the habitats of some through farming, and domesticating some as farm animals or working animals. He talks of the European reliance on the cow as a source of food, and how that advantaged those with high lactose tolerance. He discusses the domestication of dogs, horses, cats, and explains how repeated selection and breeding of those with the most suitable temperaments for living domestically eventually changed them fundamentally from their wilder forebears. And he shows how human activities led to the introduction of species from (and to) other regions of the world, sometimes deliberately, sometimes accidentally, and often with unforeseen effects on indigenous species.As well as being a naturalist, Flannery is a renowned name in the field of climate change, so his final section looks to a future where change is happening so fast some species are unlikely to be able to adapt quickly enough to survive without human intervention. However, it’s not all bleak – the warming of Europe allows scope for reintroduction of species who emigrated during the ice ages, and Flannery sees this as a possible means of survival for some of the species who will be under threat in warmer parts of the world. He makes a strong case for Europe reintroducing some of the large species from Africa, including the predators, arguing that it’s unfair for Europeans to expect a turbulent, growing Africa to have to bear all the risks and costs of preserving these species if we are all to enjoy the benefits of their survival. He’s less clear about his support for the reintroduction of extinct species, possible now with genetic science, but suggests that society should form a view on this (presumably, though he doesn’t say so, before the mad scientists make the decisions for us). Thankfully, he draws the line at the idea of reintroducing the Neanderthal, although the survival of Neanderthal DNA makes this possible, concluding that the genetic manipulation of humans is immoral. I can only hope the wider scientific community agrees with him on that one.As always with these science-based books, I feel I’ve give only a superficial flavour of this one, concentrating on the bits that most interested me. But I found the whole thing fascinating, bringing together lots of disparate bits of things I’ve read about over the years into one coherent whole. Flannery writes clearly and entertainingly, including lots of anecdotes about the scientists and naturalists who’ve contributed to the sum of knowledge over the centuries, which helps to break up the more sciency stuff. And he’s meticulous about differentiating things that are known from those that are theorised but not yet proven, and from his own occasional speculations. An excellent read, informative and enjoyable – highly recommended!NB This book was provided for review by the publisher, Atlantic Monthly Press.www.fictionfanblog.wordpress.com"
8,0802129161,http://goodreads.com/user/show/76152913-carina-kaltenbach,4,"Very nice book. There's been phases where I was thinking ""Does he really need to mention every single species ever lived in this epoch?"" and at times the quick change of topic from one species to another was a bit confused and sometimes disappointing. Definitely would have liked it to be more in-depth and less broad. Oh, and more pictures. Definitely more pictures. But overall, I enjoyed reading this book and I've learned a lot, so definitely recommend if you're interested in paleontology and natural history."
9,0802129161,http://goodreads.com/user/show/23982359-angelique-simonsen,4,Fascinating. Very well researched with some very current findings. Amazing amounts of changes
10,0802129161,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5855603-darrin,4,"As a broad overview of the natural history of a continent, this book is excellent. I read a lot of books similar to this or books that touch on some aspect of the geology of Europe or palaeontological discoveries in Europe but I have learned only bits and pieces along the way.My favorite parts are the early beginnings of Europe as an archipelago of islands that were off and on connected with each other or off and on connected with various bits of other land masses that later became continents. Did you know there were small-sized, island-living versions of many common dinosaurs? I did not know this and these discoveries were made many years ago.I also liked Flannery's discussion of current efforts to re-wild parts of Europe and bring back some of the larger land mammals that are either threatened or are extinct on the continent. Again, much of this I was unaware of and I found it an interesting discussion of what is currently taking place.My only quibble is that there are times that I feel some of Flannery's fluffing it up a little bit by being too one-sided in his opinions about various theories. I can't cite specific examples because I returned the book to the library and did not note the pages or the specific references...Regardless of that, it is still a well-written book and I recommend to anyone who has an interest in natural history and the sciences."
11,0802129161,http://goodreads.com/user/show/25633686-martin-blake,5,"I think this is the first time I've ever given a book 5 stars, but this one is worth it. It crams 100 million years of evolution and geological change into a few hundred pages, but still makes you feel that it's been quite a journey. I didn't realise that Europe was a fragmented collection of islands and archipelagos until a few tens of millions of years ago, that sea levels dropped so far at times that a land bridge formed between Europe and North America, and as for the Messinian salinity crisis ... Nor did I know that hyenas were common in Europe until a few thousand years ago, or that the golden jackal is currently sweeping across the continent. At the end there's a brief but thought-provoking discussion of rewilding to bring it up to the present day.My only criticism is that a bibiography would have been handy, but there are some challenging messages in here. I couldn't put it down."
12,0802129161,http://goodreads.com/user/show/10995997-imogen,4,"Very interesting trip through history, from almost the year dot. Written in an engaging and informal style, it is very readable. Flannery covers so much material that it is impossible to believe it is without errors, and when covering topics that fall within my expertise I did find some minor problems. Read it with a grain of salt, but enjoy heading into this time machine."
13,0802129161,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2467488-chris-aylott,4,"Flannery occasionally gets side-tracked by the topic of ""Those Wacky Paleontologists and the Wacky Things They Do"", but this is a comprehensive and highly readable survey of 100 million years of Europe's natural history. It's a full meal of geology, paleontology, and ecology, with some late-dinner anthropology on the side. Flannery succeeds -- in a way I haven't seen since Carl Sagan was writing -- in drawing out the sheer scale of 100 million years of history. Europe was literally a different world then; you could steal the map and the descriptions of creatures and drop it into a science fiction or fantasy story, and it would sound just like a carefully constructed alien world or fantasy kingdom. (I may do just this someday in an RPG campaign.) Flannery lovingly digs into this world, showing how the interactions of climate, plate tectonics, and life changed the landscape and the creatures living in it. He also shows how the role humans have played on this vast stage is both significant, and very recent. This book is a mind-expander, and you will not look at the map of Europe in the same way when you're done."
14,0802129161,http://goodreads.com/user/show/58702014-j-lee-hazlett,4,"As a lover of all things geoscientific, this was a riveting read for me. It is very easy to grow used to the landscape and not think about how it has changed (or been changed) over time and how those changes have affected the things that live in it today. 'Europe' puts that into perspective, and leaves the reader with a new level to their envisioning of the continent. This book is to be commended for its carefully curated fact-sharing, which allows it to tell a long and wide-ranging tale in just over 300 pages. Less commendable are the rather numerous instances of odd sentence structure and sudden tonal shifts. I frequently found myself tripping over an over-long or poorly constructed statement just as I was relaxing into a steady and enjoyable reading pace. This jarring experience happened often enough over the course of the book that it truly affected the overall readability and warranted the loss of a full star from my rating."
15,0802129161,http://goodreads.com/user/show/24420-richard-subber,3,"Probably this is more than you ever wanted to know about the natural history of Europe.If you’re a big fan of the midwife toad, Europe: A Natural History is for you.In fact, if you’ve always been intrigued by the story of the European aurochs (prehistoric Eurasian ox), Flannery is a must-read.I am not demeaning the book. It is easy enough to read, although densely packed with facts about species, ecosystems, tectonic plates, taxonomy, prehistoric climates, and such.The tale of the history of humans in Europe is in the book, with probably a reasonable (limited) emphasis that fairly illuminates Flannery’s balanced effort to describe the environmental, flora, flora, and hominid factors that have interacted in the history of the continent.It has dinosaurs, too.Read more of my book reviews and poems here:www.richardsubber.com"

On the negative side, it reads much like an interminable list of species with unrecognizable names. On the positive side, it contains a number of fun descriptions of the more bizarre scientists who have contributed to the study of European naturalism."
17,0802129161,http://goodreads.com/user/show/47016126-elle-maruska,4,"This was a fascinating, accessible, and quick read on the natural history of Europe. The writing is inviting and even humorous at times and the subject is handled with just enough detail. The discussion of re-wilding Europe, what constitutes a native species, and how hybridization fits in to the natural history of the continent were all super interesting and thought-provoking"
18,0802129161,http://goodreads.com/user/show/9479196-sarah---all-the-book-blog-names-are-taken,3,Loved most of the book except the last few chapters that deal with the modern world because I suffer from the disorder that makes me find our current state of affairs dreadfully boring when thinking about how the world looked millions of years ago with dinosaurs stomping about.Review to come.
19,0802129161,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1159787-valerie,5,What an amazing overview of the shifting nature of Europe! I loved the discussion of hybridization and its place in evolution and learning about Nopcsa and discussions of migration events. Will certainly reread this.

21,0802129161,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7345643-mel-raschke,4,Interesting. Thought provoking.
22,0802129161,http://goodreads.com/user/show/13849691-james-whitmore,4,"Europe is a broad and compelling account of the continent's natural history. It starts 100 million years ago, which Flannery argues is the first time Europe's flora and fauna took on a distinct identity. At this time the region was an archipelago, and home to some extraordinary island dinosaurs. Flannery continues chronologically through the dinosaur extinction, as Europe slowly accumulated its familiar animals and plants. Things get very disrupted from 2.6 million years ago with the ice ages, and then with the arrival of various species of humans from around 2 million years ago. As a result, Europe's wildlife was decimated, and is a shadow of what it was. Remarkably though Europe has begun to 'rewild', most amazingly with the return of predators like bears and wolves. Along the way there are heaps of interesting tidbits - that eucalypts were found in Europe 49 million years ago; that the Arctic was once so covered in an aquatic fern it nearly halved the carbon dioxide in the atmosphere; and that Mediterranean evaporated 6 million years ago, increasing sea levels and the freshness of the oceans. There are a number of intriguing threads to Flannery's story. The first is seeing Europe as a crossroads between Asia, North America, and Africa, rather than a centre. He also shows how many of Europe's contemporary fauna (including people) are derived from hybrids. He convincingly argues - indeed that it is morally correct to do so - for further 'rewilding' Europe with lions, elephants, and rhinos and other species who were driven extinct recently. It becomes clear that Europe's environment today cannot be separated from people, and that the fate of both are completely intertwined. While Flannery does discuss the expansion of Europe to other continents, I would have been interested to read more about this as a driver for the recovery of Europe's environment - Europe has outsourced many of its environmental problems, along with its manufacturing, to Africa, Asia and South America. Environmental destruction there is therefore also part of Europe's story. Overall Flannery is an engaging and lively writer, filling his story with digressions and the characters who played a part in unearthing Europe's extraordinary history, although some people with a more general interest might find there are too many individual species discussed. "
23,0802129161,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7005343-guy,5,"Nature treats species like a gardener treats perennials: charming, but very replaceable. And nearly treated life on Earth the same way. We wouldn't exist, except the dinosaurs had a bad day, which he describes. Blimey, that was close. In cheery, pleasant prose, he describes mileau after mileau of wonderful & ephemeral creatures, and the world they lived in. It all blurs a little, but their transience and his delight are consistent. He steadies as he describes the appearance of the (hopefully) ultimate apex predator. Fascinating, but all about evolution. He's interested in technology, right up to the point where our weapons are good enough for a steady march of extinctions. Then he skips to the fate of species under human dominion. And it really does focus on Europe. Oh, and leavened with anecdotes about paleontologists. Now there's a weird mob! "
24,0802129161,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1647517-victor-sonkin,4,"An account of Europe's natural history throughout the — what would be the word? millennia is too short; throughout the aeons, I guess. Interesting, with many exciting side-stories, especially in the second half of the book, when it creeps closer to less impenetrable times."
25,0802129161,http://goodreads.com/user/show/36835829-kelly-martin,3,Ummm......well I read it.
26,0802129161,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1889660-barbara,5,"Tim Flannery has been an engaging and informative advocate of the application of the results of scientific research to the conservation and management of our antipodean environment.But, in ""Europe: a natural history"", he applies himself to the palaeontology, geology, evolution of life in, and the colonising of, the archipelago that became Europe. As the story begins some 100 million years ago, though I found it fascinating (particularly the geology), it was at times challenging. I became even more involved in the tale when it moved on to the more recognisable flora and fauna of the Pleistocene in Europe.Some snippets:[about human-Neanderthal hybrids] ""The flowering of artistic expression....unique in human evolutionary history....I find it astonishing that their novel creations were works of art, rather than the new weapons or the stone tools characteristic of earlier advances.""[after describing the warm embayment of the Atlantic Ocean that was the Paris Basin and its marine sediments... which formed] ""...the famous Paris stone ...whose warm creamy-grey colours give the city an unmistakeable beauty...the fossils that had been unearthed [in rocks deep below the Left Bank, by Cuvier] and at Montmartre ""where mining from gypsum to make plaster of Paris almost undermined the famous hill"". ""Today, among all of the Mediterranean's unique island mammals, there is a single survivor - the Cypriot mouse (Mus cypriacus) - a species so obscure and small that it was not even recognised as being distinct from the house mouse until 2006. Was there ever a sorrier story of human ignorance and overexploitation than this? That every island from the coast of Turkey to the pillars of Hercules has been emptied of its natural treasures, one by one, until just a single mouse was left.""""As a result of this long history of invasions [from Africa, from the East, from Western Asia, central Asia, ...steppe nomads, Arabs and Turkic peoples, going back all the way to Neanderthal times] every European living today is of widely mixed heritage, as our variable eye, skin and hair colour and form suggest."" ""...after WWII Europe's human population began to stabilise and to concentrate in the cities and coastal plains....in the more remote and hard-scrabble regions ... nature is starting to creep back. The ecology of Europe has, in just a couple of generations, shifted so dramatically as to usher in a bewolfing (and perhaps a bewitching) of the continent....The lifestyles of the Europeans are very different from those of the rest of the world's population, which is concentrated in mega-cities without access to wild areas."" "
27,0802129161,http://goodreads.com/user/show/16074792-tutankhamun18,4,"Really great book! Discusses the formation of the land mass of Europe, the species that evolved here, the species that left and spread to other areas of the globe, the species that returned to Europe or conquered it for the first time and the interactions with hominins. Written in a nice way using small chapters and four larger parts, which makes this book very digestible and quick to read. In my opinion a very good summary of ecology and evolution in Europe and in genral- covering topics from speciation to island gigantism to the Signor-Lipps effect to Haldane’s rule to rewilding. My favourite part of this book was the discussion of human origins beyond that usually written about, beyond that of the hominin. I was fascinated to learn that the apes that would give rise to hominins, the Griphopithes, arose in Europe 17 million years ago. Then later, left to Africa where they continued to evolve into Homo species that we know and only later returned to Europe once more. Additionally, learning about the competition that exists between apes and monekys and how they share an ecological niche so that apes had to evolve a larger size so as to no longer share this niche was really cool to learn. What kept me from giving this book 5 stars: many species were discussed, which made the book feel a bit like a list at times, although equally this does add to the all-encompassing nature of this book. Truly, if you read one book on human evolution/why we should value nature/how nature is not seperate from humans but interacts with them/how alien species don’t really exist as much as we think they do/rewilding, read this one! :) "
28,0802129161,http://goodreads.com/user/show/73000210-adlai,4,"I have intentionally written that this book, that purports to relate millions of years of history, is recommended for young-earth creationists. Anyone considering themselves both a critical thinker, and interested in the world as it exists today, must be curious to see how modern humans, and those of the past few centuries, have interpreted the evidence that they find at and below the surface of the earth. Although this book is written by professional scientists, it does a good job of presenting the uncovered evidence for a general audience, without too much technical jargon; and for those who are interested in the jargon, there are occasional passages of explanation.My only disappointment in this book is the extremely limited description of the extinct forms. This is likely due to the fact that, writing well into the Internet's attempt to drive printed books extinct, the author has chosen to allow curious readers to keep a search engine bookmarked, rather than leaving a spare finger hooked at the color plates; an understandable choice, since color plates are expensive to print, in comparison to the text itself, although the text frequently names extinct and critically-endangered animals with the same level of familiarity that could be given to items from popular mythology, such as the Holy Grail, the Golden Calf, and Kubrick's Monolith. Regrettably, not every reader has visited safaris containing animals more diverse than the proverbial ""wolf, goat, and chicken"", and perhaps the author should consider including a glossary of extinct and endangered beasts, in lieu of the missing plates."
29,0802129161,http://goodreads.com/user/show/91881072-paul-norwood,3,"Overall fine with decent writing. After reading ""the Eternal Frontier,"" his similar book about the paleoecology of North America, I had a good idea what I was in for and was hoping for pretty solid updates and improvements, especially considering the number of years between the two publication dates. They are essentially the same, with the exceptions of the inclusion of the dinosaurs (author's choice), and the greater diversity and span of human occupation (plain fact).The book could really use more illustrations - especially of the recent mammals that dominate the narrative. I know this is kind of traditional, but a set of successive maps with plates of representative taxa would have spared him lots of explaining and helped me along a lot. However, good illustration costs (and is worth) money to make and print. The few illustrations in the book were scattered and of little use or quality.The author's advocacy of rewilding wore me out toward the end, and after the first few chapters the focus shifted almost entirely to vertebrates, focusing heavily on large land mammals, so really I would say the focus of the book is on the background and history of European land mammals, with the intent to convince people to support rewilding.Was there space in the book for ferns, whales, codfish, insects and fungi? Probably not, and in some cases certainly not as fossils. The book, though, did not feel cohesive enough to justify their exclusion."

His varied background as a palaeontologist, mammalogist and environmental scientist stands him in good stead here.The book starts with the clunky device of a time machine to take the reader back to the pre-history of Europe in a geological sense, discussing how the continent gradually formed from the original Pangea and became what we know today. Flannery takes us to sites where the evidence and impact of the changes can be seen.The book then roughly works through each successive geological era to describe what happened to Europe itself and to its fauna and flora. Perhaps the most surprising thing revealed here is that humans originated in Europe, died out there and then returned from Africa much later. Similarly, there is a long list of megafauna that we traditionally think of as African that once thrived in Europe.Overall, considering the vastness of the topic, this is a credible and always interesting overview of the development of Europe and its inhabitants from pre-history through to modern times."
31,0802129161,http://goodreads.com/user/show/73506628-emily,3,"This is certainly an interesting book. I have never seen anything about the natural history of a specific continent, and it is very nice to read about how natural progression occurred throughout age. It is a very educational book, and I was introduced to several concepts that are new to me. Specifically, I find the discussion on hybridization high intriguing, as well as the impact of human action on the behaviour/life style of wild species (eg. European brown bears are adopting a more herbivorous diet due to past conflicts with humans). Many thought-provoking ethical questions were raised and discussed. To mention a few examples, how should we determine which species are fit for re-introduction? Should we take an active role in managing the gene mixing of domestic and wild species? Species re-introduction can displace or wipe out some current species, how can we determine what is acceptable in this situation?I don’t agree with all of the author’s sentiments and opinion, but this is an educational read. Some chapters introduce a huge blast of scientific species names, and they can cause a bit of information overload. My recommendation is to take it slow, and don’t try to rush it through."
32,0802129161,http://goodreads.com/user/show/63421053-nico-van-straalen,3,"Tim Flannery writes the story of European nature and geology, from 100 million years ago up to the present day, using an extraordinary lively style, interspersed with tales about queer European scientists, discoverers and adventurers. Don't be afraid though of chalicotheres, sivatheres, nimvarids and choristerans, because the book is littered with them and their likes, extinct or alive. What I don't like is that Flannery goes along with the story that a bipedal ape, a hominin, migrated from Africa and walked upright in Europe 5.7 million years ago. Anybody who has read the original 2017 publication on the Trachilos footprints can see that this is just highly contentious, to put it mildly. Flannery also mixes up hominins, hominids and hominoids and his view of human evolution originating in Europe is clearly biased. But the book has lots of other informative stories, some sweeping, some extremely detailed, but all told with great flavour. The book ends with a plea for rewilding Europe (taking the Dutch Oostvaardersplassen as an example!), using careful introductions, breeding programs and maybe genetic engineering, a project in which the author will be very well at home."

I wish history writers would take lessons from scientist on making their topics more accessible.I was worried at first that Flannery was going to take a Europecentric voice on the world that would try to extinguish the impact of other continents but that wasn't the angle. Instead, he looked at the evolutionary history of animals that are/were once on what is now Europe but have closer relations to animals extant on Sumatra or Brazil or China, etc. It's largely a treatise on the importance of genetic diversity while being a strong natural history text.His periodic suggestions that elephants or rhinos or hippos should be reintroduced to Europe because they were there as recently as the last ice age were a little odd given the massive changes to the land wrought by humans and urban society but was born out by the efforts and ideas to Rewild Europe by either allowing or actively reintroducing other native species there. Considering the proliferation of deer in the US because all natural predators have been eliminated, allowing some of those predators back isn't a bad idea."
34,0802129161,http://goodreads.com/user/show/98973047-clara,3,"Overall, this is an interesting and entertaining book which teaches a lot about Europe's history from being a tropical archipelago crowded by dwarf dinosaurs until becoming a densely inhabited and strongly urbanized continent. Flannery introduces the reader to countless strange creatures and beautiful, outer-wordly landscapes of past time using his fun time machine. He also talks about hte scientists who contributed to our current understanding of Europe's natural history. Additionally, he is very good at clearly explaining all kinds of difficult concepts and intricate feedback loops between the weather, the sea-level, the continental drift and the composition of Europe's fauna and flora in different geological periods.Yet I can't help but agree with many other readers that many stretches of this book feel like endless lists of extinct creatures which names you almost immediately forget. This I have to say made the book a little bit tedious and monotonous at times. Secondly, I didn't appreciate Flannery's tendency to portray every scientist in the field as mad, eccentric or suicidal with this gossipy/mocking tone which I found completely out of place. Despite these points of criticism I believe it's worth giving this book a read, since you do really learn a lot. And I have to say some of the descriptions of past European landscapes are quite beautiful."
35,0802129161,http://goodreads.com/user/show/31005950-gibson,3,"An interesting approach to the palaeontology of what is now Europe. Too often our reading is interrupted by flippant footnotes of no consequence and far too often Flannery falls into the easy trap in this area of study of forgetting the flimsy and sporadic nature of the evidence.The result is that speculation and possibility become likelihood for no other reason than the author is swayed towards that view.I am an amateur in this area, so I rely on well considered informed and balanced evidence in order to be persuaded by the author’s viewpoint. When simple facts like the height of cliffs in the Australian Blue Mountains are wrong by almost an order of magnitude, I have to be skeptic at about the author’s mastery of elsewhere. Having read criticisms on matters of fact from other reviewers, I firmly place this book into the category of interesting entertainment, but look elsewhere for the science.His speculative insights into the lives of some scientists belong in the tabloid press or those glossy magazines flanking supermarket checkouts.Quite entertaining, occasionally populist and unconvincing.It needed many more maps and diagrams."
36,0802129161,http://goodreads.com/user/show/10079154-michael,5,"Tim Flannery is one of Australia's great literary scientists - I say that meaning that he can take the complex worlds of biology, evolution, geology and put these concepts into words for the lay person. This book is a fascinating look at how Europe evolved over the past 100 million years. Plate tectonics pushed various land masses around so that Europe grew out of various smaller islands. He then goes on to illustrate how the various dinosaurs, amphibians, mammals, insect and plant life adapted to the changes brought about by this movement and that movement helped various animals move about and interact, changing the landscape and thus changing the climate. It is more complex than this, but I think this is the gist of the book. I found it fascinating. He also shows how many species of Europe thought extinct have actually evolved into other species living now in Asia and Africa, and vice versa. This was just a fab book and recommend to anyone interested in history and especially the landscape of Europe."
37,0802129161,http://goodreads.com/user/show/993782-jaclyn,2,"Although large portions of this book were well researched and composed in a compelling narrative, there was tabloid-like feel to many of the anecdotes about the paleontologists and naturalists that was unsettling to read. The jarring references to scientists' sex lives, mental illnesses, and suicides were unnecessary in a book about natural history. For example, if the author was so compelled to include the detail that archeologist Vere Gordon Childe ""seems never to have had a sexual relationship"" and that he ""flung himself"" off a cliff, it really should have been written in a footnote rather than within the few paragraphs detailing changing migration patterns in the Neolithic period. However, I truly fail to see the author's point of writting, ""we can only hope that he revelled in the acceleration in his last moments."" This cringe-worthy tone is recurring throughout the book and sullys an otherwise serviceable text on the geological formation of Europe and the animals and hominids that have lived there."
38,0802129161,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5344627-sarah,4,"Easy and entertaining read and lots of interesting stuff. I hadn't heard the name for the european bison - wisent - before but I won't forget it now. I'm still struggling to grasp the different sweeps of time, with plate tectonics, ancient animal races, ice ages and recent history. I thought for a while that more and better timelines might help but I've seen lots of timelines before and it never seems to sink in so hopefully this narrative will leave a more lasting trace. And I love the suggestion we might rewild Europe not just with bears and wolves, but with wisent, lions and forest elephant. We have beavers coming to a wildlife trust enclosure in Derbyshire this year - perhaps only the start!"

Please note: this means no maps (a couple were mentioned to come), no images, even the endnote links did not work in my galley. There were still some significant typos in the text. These things definitely affected my view of this book, but not as much as the text itself did. This book is all over the place, and this review was very difficult to write.I was expecting a natural history of Europe. Sure, that's a tall order. I was expecting something like A Natural History of California (an amazing book for those interested). Flannery's book is nothing like that. I would argue it's not natural history at all. It's...ecological history? Not exactly. It's more of paleontology up to the present time, heavy on the fauna (especially on mammals--especially homo and herbivores) and light on the flora. Only the a few chapters near the end cover the 20th/21st centuries. The 18th and 19th are nearly entirely skipped over. He even extrapolates into the future.So what is this book? Many chapters are simply lists, in descriptive paragraph form, of animals (largely mammals) alive in Europe during different epochs. It's paleontology, which is no small surprise since Flannery is a paleontologist. A paleontologist who likes animals, especially mammals, and even more so herbivores. And way too much of this book implies that Europe is somehow...exceptional? He includes Begun's recent theory that homo evolved our most human traits in Europe, not Africa (ch 17). That the Vikings and Columbus ""discovered"" (ch 38). He is interested in re-introducing long-extirpated (and even extinct) species back into Europe (ch 28, ch 44). And even though this is ""a natural history of Europe"" he still discusses North American woolly mammoths and Pacific rats, among many other non-European things and places that have little to do with his topic. Much of this book made me uncomfortable, the rest was just dull. What this book really reads like is a survey class on the paleontology of Europe. That explains the inconsistencies in writing style and topics; the controversial statements and strange facts (why is the Pacific rat so important? why do we hear about the Signor-Lipps theory so often?); the imagined genetically engineered future (which is not natural history or paleontology!); the odd attempts at humor that aren't funny but do sound like a professor talking to a large class or a speaker presenting to an interested group of laypeople. 3 classes per week, 1 semester is 15 weeks = 45 lectures. This book has 44 chapters.————Thank you to NetGalley for providing me with a copy of this book in exchange for an honest review."

Flannery introduces the reader to countless strange creatures and beautiful, outer-wordly landscapes of past time using his fun time machine. He also talks about hte scientists who contributed to our current understanding of Europe's natural history. Additionally, he is very good at clearly explaining all kinds of difficult concepts and intricate feedback loops between the weather, the sea-level, the continental drift and the composition of Europe's fauna and flora in different geological periods.Yet I can't help but agree with many other readers that many stretches of this book feel like endless lists of extinct creatures which names you almost immediately forget. This I have to say made the book a little bit tedious and monotonous at times. Secondly, I didn't appreciate Flannery's tendency to portray every scientist in the field as mad, eccentric or suicidal with this gossipy/mocking tone which I found completely out of place.

84,0802129161,http://goodreads.com/user/show/837466-dree,2,"I was so excited to read this. A natural history of Europe! Also that cover, it's gorgeous!And then I received a digital ARC. Please note: this means no maps (a couple were mentioned to come), no images, even the endnote links did not work in my galley. There were still some significant typos in the text. These things definitely affected my view of this book, but not as much as the text itself did. This book is all over the place, and this review was very difficult to write.I was expecting a natural history of Europe. Sure, that's a tall order. I was expecting something like A Natural History of California (an amazing book for those interested). Flannery's book is nothing like that. I would argue it's not natural history at all. It's...ecological history? Not exactly. It's more of paleontology up to the present time, heavy on the fauna (especially on mammals--especially homo and herbivores) and light on the flora. Only the a few chapters near the end cover the 20th/21st centuries. The 18th and 19th are nearly entirely skipped over. He even extrapolates into the future.So what is this book? Many chapters are simply lists, in descriptive paragraph form, of animals (largely mammals) alive in Europe during different epochs. It's paleontology, which is no small surprise since Flannery is a paleontologist. A paleontologist who likes animals, especially mammals, and even more so herbivores. And way too much of this book implies that Europe is somehow...exceptional? He includes Begun's recent theory that homo evolved our most human traits in Europe, not Africa (ch 17). That the Vikings and Columbus ""discovered"" (ch 38). He is interested in re-introducing long-extirpated (and even extinct) species back into Europe (ch 28, ch 44). And even though this is ""a natural history of Europe"" he still discusses North American woolly mammoths and Pacific rats, among many other non-European things and places that have little to do with his topic. Much of this book made me uncomfortable, the rest was just dull. What this book really reads like is a survey class on the paleontology of Europe. That explains the inconsistencies in writing style and topics; the controversial statements and strange facts (why is the Pacific rat so important? why do we hear about the Signor-Lipps theory so often?); the imagined genetically engineered future (which is not natural history or paleontology!); the odd attempts at humor that aren't funny but do sound like a professor talking to a large class or a speaker presenting to an interested group of laypeople. 3 classes per week, 1 semester is 15 weeks = 45 lectures. This book has 44 chapters.————Thank you to NetGalley for providing me with a copy of this book in exchange for an honest review."

90,0802129161,http://goodreads.com/user/show/14538532-greg,4,"* I would like to thank NetGalley and the publisher for the opportunity to review this book. *It's perhaps a little unexpected that an Australian scientist would tackle such a vast and complicated subject as the natural history of Europe, but Tim Flannery makes a pretty fair fist of the job. His varied background as a palaeontologist, mammalogist and environmental scientist stands him in good stead here.The book starts with the clunky device of a time machine to take the reader back to the pre-history of Europe in a geological sense, discussing how the continent gradually formed from the original Pangea and became what we know today. Flannery takes us to sites where the evidence and impact of the changes can be seen.The book then roughly works through each successive geological era to describe what happened to Europe itself and to its fauna and flora. Perhaps the most surprising thing revealed here is that humans originated in Europe, died out there and then returned from Africa much later. Similarly, there is a long list of megafauna that we traditionally think of as African that once thrived in Europe.Overall, considering the vastness of the topic, this is a credible and always interesting overview of the development of Europe and its inhabitants from pre-history through to modern times."
91,0802129161,http://goodreads.com/user/show/73506628-emily,3,"This is certainly an interesting book. I have never seen anything about the natural history of a specific continent, and it is very nice to read about how natural progression occurred throughout age. It is a very educational book, and I was introduced to several concepts that are new to me. Specifically, I find the discussion on hybridization high intriguing, as well as the impact of human action on the behaviour/life style of wild species (eg. European brown bears are adopting a more herbivorous diet due to past conflicts with humans). Many thought-provoking ethical questions were raised and discussed. To mention a few examples, how should we determine which species are fit for re-introduction? Should we take an active role in managing the gene mixing of domestic and wild species? Species re-introduction can displace or wipe out some current species, how can we determine what is acceptable in this situation?I don’t agree with all of the author’s sentiments and opinion, but this is an educational read. Some chapters introduce a huge blast of scientific species names, and they can cause a bit of information overload. My recommendation is to take it slow, and don’t try to rush it through."
92,0802129161,http://goodreads.com/user/show/63421053-nico-van-straalen,3,"Tim Flannery writes the story of European nature and geology, from 100 million years ago up to the present day, using an extraordinary lively style, interspersed with tales about queer European scientists, discoverers and adventurers. Don't be afraid though of chalicotheres, sivatheres, nimvarids and choristerans, because the book is littered with them and their likes, extinct or alive. What I don't like is that Flannery goes along with the story that a bipedal ape, a hominin, migrated from Africa and walked upright in Europe 5.7 million years ago. Anybody who has read the original 2017 publication on the Trachilos footprints can see that this is just highly contentious, to put it mildly. Flannery also mixes up hominins, hominids and hominoids and his view of human evolution originating in Europe is clearly biased. But the book has lots of other informative stories, some sweeping, some extremely detailed, but all told with great flavour. The book ends with a plea for rewilding Europe (taking the Dutch Oostvaardersplassen as an example!), using careful introductions, breeding programs and maybe genetic engineering, a project in which the author will be very well at home."
93,0802129161,http://goodreads.com/user/show/299912-rachel-rogers,5,"Fascinating. Eminently readable (except the last few chapters, which dragged on a bit). I wish history writers would take lessons from scientist on making their topics more accessible.I was worried at first that Flannery was going to take a Europecentric voice on the world that would try to extinguish the impact of other continents but that wasn't the angle. Instead, he looked at the evolutionary history of animals that are/were once on what is now Europe but have closer relations to animals extant on Sumatra or Brazil or China, etc. It's largely a treatise on the importance of genetic diversity while being a strong natural history text.His periodic suggestions that elephants or rhinos or hippos should be reintroduced to Europe because they were there as recently as the last ice age were a little odd given the massive changes to the land wrought by humans and urban society but was born out by the efforts and ideas to Rewild Europe by either allowing or actively reintroducing other native species there. Considering the proliferation of deer in the US because all natural predators have been eliminated, allowing some of those predators back isn't a bad idea."

Please note: this means no maps (a couple were mentioned to come), no images, even the endnote links did not work in my galley. There were still some significant typos in the text. These things definitely affected my view of this book, but not as much as the text itself did. This book is all over the place, and this review was very difficult to write.I was expecting a natural history of Europe. Sure, that's a tall order. I was expecting something like A Natural History of California (an amazing book for those interested). Flannery's book is nothing like that. I would argue it's not natural history at all. It's...ecological history? Not exactly. It's more of paleontology up to the present time, heavy on the fauna (especially on mammals--especially homo and herbivores) and light on the flora. Only the a few chapters near the end cover the 20th/21st centuries. The 18th and 19th are nearly entirely skipped over. He even extrapolates into the future.So what is this book? Many chapters are simply lists, in descriptive paragraph form, of animals (largely mammals) alive in Europe during different epochs. It's paleontology, which is no small surprise since Flannery is a paleontologist. A paleontologist who likes animals, especially mammals, and even more so herbivores. And way too much of this book implies that Europe is somehow...exceptional? He includes Begun's recent theory that homo evolved our most human traits in Europe, not Africa (ch 17). That the Vikings and Columbus ""discovered"" (ch 38). He is interested in re-introducing long-extirpated (and even extinct) species back into Europe (ch 28, ch 44). And even though this is ""a natural history of Europe"" he still discusses North American woolly mammoths and Pacific rats, among many other non-European things and places that have little to do with his topic. Much of this book made me uncomfortable, the rest was just dull. What this book really reads like is a survey class on the paleontology of Europe. That explains the inconsistencies in writing style and topics; the controversial statements and strange facts (why is the Pacific rat so important? why do we hear about the Signor-Lipps theory so often?); the imagined genetically engineered future (which is not natural history or paleontology!); the odd attempts at humor that aren't funny but do sound like a professor talking to a large class or a speaker presenting to an interested group of laypeople. 3 classes per week, 1 semester is 15 weeks = 45 lectures.

120,0802129161,http://goodreads.com/user/show/14538532-greg,4,"* I would like to thank NetGalley and the publisher for the opportunity to review this book. *It's perhaps a little unexpected that an Australian scientist would tackle such a vast and complicated subject as the natural history of Europe, but Tim Flannery makes a pretty fair fist of the job. His varied background as a palaeontologist, mammalogist and environmental scientist stands him in good stead here.The book starts with the clunky device of a time machine to take the reader back to the pre-history of Europe in a geological sense, discussing how the continent gradually formed from the original Pangea and became what we know today. Flannery takes us to sites where the evidence and impact of the changes can be seen.The book then roughly works through each successive geological era to describe what happened to Europe itself and to its fauna and flora. Perhaps the most surprising thing revealed here is that humans originated in Europe, died out there and then returned from Africa much later. Similarly, there is a long list of megafauna that we traditionally think of as African that once thrived in Europe.Overall, considering the vastness of the topic, this is a credible and always interesting overview of the development of Europe and its inhabitants from pre-history through to modern times."
121,0802129161,http://goodreads.com/user/show/73506628-emily,3,"This is certainly an interesting book. I have never seen anything about the natural history of a specific continent, and it is very nice to read about how natural progression occurred throughout age. It is a very educational book, and I was introduced to several concepts that are new to me. Specifically, I find the discussion on hybridization high intriguing, as well as the impact of human action on the behaviour/life style of wild species (eg. European brown bears are adopting a more herbivorous diet due to past conflicts with humans). Many thought-provoking ethical questions were raised and discussed. To mention a few examples, how should we determine which species are fit for re-introduction? Should we take an active role in managing the gene mixing of domestic and wild species? Species re-introduction can displace or wipe out some current species, how can we determine what is acceptable in this situation?I don’t agree with all of the author’s sentiments and opinion, but this is an educational read. Some chapters introduce a huge blast of scientific species names, and they can cause a bit of information overload. My recommendation is to take it slow, and don’t try to rush it through."
122,0802129161,http://goodreads.com/user/show/63421053-nico-van-straalen,3,"Tim Flannery writes the story of European nature and geology, from 100 million years ago up to the present day, using an extraordinary lively style, interspersed with tales about queer European scientists, discoverers and adventurers. Don't be afraid though of chalicotheres, sivatheres, nimvarids and choristerans, because the book is littered with them and their likes, extinct or alive. What I don't like is that Flannery goes along with the story that a bipedal ape, a hominin, migrated from Africa and walked upright in Europe 5.7 million years ago. Anybody who has read the original 2017 publication on the Trachilos footprints can see that this is just highly contentious, to put it mildly. Flannery also mixes up hominins, hominids and hominoids and his view of human evolution originating in Europe is clearly biased. But the book has lots of other informative stories, some sweeping, some extremely detailed, but all told with great flavour. The book ends with a plea for rewilding Europe (taking the Dutch Oostvaardersplassen as an example!), using careful introductions, breeding programs and maybe genetic engineering, a project in which the author will be very well at home."
123,0802129161,http://goodreads.com/user/show/299912-rachel-rogers,5,"Fascinating. Eminently readable (except the last few chapters, which dragged on a bit). I wish history writers would take lessons from scientist on making their topics more accessible.I was worried at first that Flannery was going to take a Europecentric voice on the world that would try to extinguish the impact of other continents but that wasn't the angle. Instead, he looked at the evolutionary history of animals that are/were once on what is now Europe but have closer relations to animals extant on Sumatra or Brazil or China, etc. It's largely a treatise on the importance of genetic diversity while being a strong natural history text.His periodic suggestions that elephants or rhinos or hippos should be reintroduced to Europe because they were there as recently as the last ice age were a little odd given the massive changes to the land wrought by humans and urban society but was born out by the efforts and ideas to Rewild Europe by either allowing or actively reintroducing other native species there. Considering the proliferation of deer in the US because all natural predators have been eliminated, allowing some of those predators back isn't a bad idea."
124,0802129161,http://goodreads.com/user/show/98973047-clara,3,"Overall, this is an interesting and entertaining book which teaches a lot about Europe's history from being a tropical archipelago crowded by dwarf dinosaurs until becoming a densely inhabited and strongly urbanized continent. Flannery introduces the reader to countless strange creatures and beautiful, outer-wordly landscapes of past time using his fun time machine. He also talks about hte scientists who contributed to our current understanding of Europe's natural history. Additionally, he is very good at clearly explaining all kinds of difficult concepts and intricate feedback loops between the weather, the sea-level, the continental drift and the composition of Europe's fauna and flora in different geological periods.Yet I can't help but agree with many other readers that many stretches of this book feel like endless lists of extinct creatures which names you almost immediately forget. This I have to say made the book a little bit tedious and monotonous at times. Secondly, I didn't appreciate Flannery's tendency to portray every scientist in the field as mad, eccentric or suicidal with this gossipy/mocking tone which I found completely out of place. Despite these points of criticism I believe it's worth giving this book a read, since you do really learn a lot. And I have to say some of the descriptions of past European landscapes are quite beautiful."
125,0802129161,http://goodreads.com/user/show/31005950-gibson,3,"An interesting approach to the palaeontology of what is now Europe. Too often our reading is interrupted by flippant footnotes of no consequence and far too often Flannery falls into the easy trap in this area of study of forgetting the flimsy and sporadic nature of the evidence.The result is that speculation and possibility become likelihood for no other reason than the author is swayed towards that view.I am an amateur in this area, so I rely on well considered informed and balanced evidence in order to be persuaded by the author’s viewpoint. When simple facts like the height of cliffs in the Australian Blue Mountains are wrong by almost an order of magnitude, I have to be skeptic at about the author’s mastery of elsewhere. Having read criticisms on matters of fact from other reviewers, I firmly place this book into the category of interesting entertainment, but look elsewhere for the science.His speculative insights into the lives of some scientists belong in the tabloid press or those glossy magazines flanking supermarket checkouts.Quite entertaining, occasionally populist and unconvincing.It needed many more maps and diagrams."
126,0802129161,http://goodreads.com/user/show/10079154-michael,5,"Tim Flannery is one of Australia's great literary scientists - I say that meaning that he can take the complex worlds of biology, evolution, geology and put these concepts into words for the lay person. This book is a fascinating look at how Europe evolved over the past 100 million years. Plate tectonics pushed various land masses around so that Europe grew out of various smaller islands. He then goes on to illustrate how the various dinosaurs, amphibians, mammals, insect and plant life adapted to the changes brought about by this movement and that movement helped various animals move about and interact, changing the landscape and thus changing the climate. It is more complex than this, but I think this is the gist of the book. I found it fascinating. He also shows how many species of Europe thought extinct have actually evolved into other species living now in Asia and Africa, and vice versa. This was just a fab book and recommend to anyone interested in history and especially the landscape of Europe."
127,0802129161,http://goodreads.com/user/show/993782-jaclyn,2,"Although large portions of this book were well researched and composed in a compelling narrative, there was tabloid-like feel to many of the anecdotes about the paleontologists and naturalists that was unsettling to read. The jarring references to scientists' sex lives, mental illnesses, and suicides were unnecessary in a book about natural history. For example, if the author was so compelled to include the detail that archeologist Vere Gordon Childe ""seems never to have had a sexual relationship"" and that he ""flung himself"" off a cliff, it really should have been written in a footnote rather than within the few paragraphs detailing changing migration patterns in the Neolithic period. However, I truly fail to see the author's point of writting, ""we can only hope that he revelled in the acceleration in his last moments."" This cringe-worthy tone is recurring throughout the book and sullys an otherwise serviceable text on the geological formation of Europe and the animals and hominids that have lived there."
128,0802129161,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5344627-sarah,4,"Easy and entertaining read and lots of interesting stuff. I hadn't heard the name for the european bison - wisent - before but I won't forget it now. I'm still struggling to grasp the different sweeps of time, with plate tectonics, ancient animal races, ice ages and recent history. I thought for a while that more and better timelines might help but I've seen lots of timelines before and it never seems to sink in so hopefully this narrative will leave a more lasting trace. And I love the suggestion we might rewild Europe not just with bears and wolves, but with wisent, lions and forest elephant. We have beavers coming to a wildlife trust enclosure in Derbyshire this year - perhaps only the start!"
129,0802129161,http://goodreads.com/user/show/12000072-steve,5,"Science writing done wellI enjoyed this book. Tim Flannery is a great writer with a good sense of humor. He writes with a conversational tone, explains all the science clearly, and at times offers entertaining personal opinions. While mostly about the biology of Europe over time, the book also discusses the relevant geography, for examples the islands that came together over time to create modern Europe. I recommend this book for anyone interested in science.Disclosure: I received a complimentary copy of this book via Netgalley for review purposes."

The story moves rapidly and easily, touching on creature after creature, landscape, climate, geography and the homo species, leaving no doubt about the author's very learned views. A delightful read -and listen as I listened to audiobooks while following along in the Kindle version, helping to see the reader's elegant pronunciation of the many scientific and foreign language references."

It ended up being very interesting. Imagine the elephants and rhinos (some wooly) strange dinosaurs, and Homo Sapiens/Neanderthal hybrids (and those of us with European blood have an estimated 2-4% DNA remaining) etc etc and the old old old Europe looked nothing like the forests of the Aryan imagination. A very interesting book."

He then goes on to illustrate how the various dinosaurs, amphibians, mammals, insect and plant life adapted to the changes brought about by this movement and that movement helped various animals move about and interact, changing the landscape and thus changing the climate. It is more complex than this, but I think this is the gist of the book. I found it fascinating.

The jarring references to scientists' sex lives, mental illnesses, and suicides were unnecessary in a book about natural history. For example, if the author was so compelled to include the detail that archeologist Vere Gordon Childe ""seems never to have had a sexual relationship"" and that he ""flung himself"" off a cliff, it really should have been written in a footnote rather than within the few paragraphs detailing changing migration patterns in the Neolithic period. However, I truly fail to see the author's point of writting, ""we can only hope that he revelled in the acceleration in his last moments.""

174,0802129161,http://goodreads.com/user/show/837466-dree,2,"I was so excited to read this. A natural history of Europe! Also that cover, it's gorgeous!And then I received a digital ARC. Please note: this means no maps (a couple were mentioned to come), no images, even the endnote links did not work in my galley. There were still some significant typos in the text. These things definitely affected my view of this book, but not as much as the text itself did. This book is all over the place, and this review was very difficult to write.I was expecting a natural history of Europe. Sure, that's a tall order. I was expecting something like A Natural History of California (an amazing book for those interested). Flannery's book is nothing like that. I would argue it's not natural history at all. It's...ecological history? Not exactly. It's more of paleontology up to the present time, heavy on the fauna (especially on mammals--especially homo and herbivores) and light on the flora. Only the a few chapters near the end cover the 20th/21st centuries. The 18th and 19th are nearly entirely skipped over. He even extrapolates into the future.So what is this book? Many chapters are simply lists, in descriptive paragraph form, of animals (largely mammals) alive in Europe during different epochs. It's paleontology, which is no small surprise since Flannery is a paleontologist. A paleontologist who likes animals, especially mammals, and even more so herbivores. And way too much of this book implies that Europe is somehow...exceptional? He includes Begun's recent theory that homo evolved our most human traits in Europe, not Africa (ch 17). That the Vikings and Columbus ""discovered"" (ch 38). He is interested in re-introducing long-extirpated (and even extinct) species back into Europe (ch 28, ch 44). And even though this is ""a natural history of Europe"" he still discusses North American woolly mammoths and Pacific rats, among many other non-European things and places that have little to do with his topic. Much of this book made me uncomfortable, the rest was just dull. What this book really reads like is a survey class on the paleontology of Europe. That explains the inconsistencies in writing style and topics; the controversial statements and strange facts (why is the Pacific rat so important? why do we hear about the Signor-Lipps theory so often?); the imagined genetically engineered future (which is not natural history or paleontology!); the odd attempts at humor that aren't funny but do sound like a professor talking to a large class or a speaker presenting to an interested group of laypeople. 3 classes per week, 1 semester is 15 weeks = 45 lectures. This book has 44 chapters.————Thank you to NetGalley for providing me with a copy of this book in exchange for an honest review."

180,0802129161,http://goodreads.com/user/show/14538532-greg,4,"* I would like to thank NetGalley and the publisher for the opportunity to review this book. *It's perhaps a little unexpected that an Australian scientist would tackle such a vast and complicated subject as the natural history of Europe, but Tim Flannery makes a pretty fair fist of the job. His varied background as a palaeontologist, mammalogist and environmental scientist stands him in good stead here.The book starts with the clunky device of a time machine to take the reader back to the pre-history of Europe in a geological sense, discussing how the continent gradually formed from the original Pangea and became what we know today. Flannery takes us to sites where the evidence and impact of the changes can be seen.The book then roughly works through each successive geological era to describe what happened to Europe itself and to its fauna and flora. Perhaps the most surprising thing revealed here is that humans originated in Europe, died out there and then returned from Africa much later. Similarly, there is a long list of megafauna that we traditionally think of as African that once thrived in Europe.Overall, considering the vastness of the topic, this is a credible and always interesting overview of the development of Europe and its inhabitants from pre-history through to modern times."
181,0802129161,http://goodreads.com/user/show/73506628-emily,3,"This is certainly an interesting book. I have never seen anything about the natural history of a specific continent, and it is very nice to read about how natural progression occurred throughout age. It is a very educational book, and I was introduced to several concepts that are new to me. Specifically, I find the discussion on hybridization high intriguing, as well as the impact of human action on the behaviour/life style of wild species (eg. European brown bears are adopting a more herbivorous diet due to past conflicts with humans). Many thought-provoking ethical questions were raised and discussed. To mention a few examples, how should we determine which species are fit for re-introduction? Should we take an active role in managing the gene mixing of domestic and wild species? Species re-introduction can displace or wipe out some current species, how can we determine what is acceptable in this situation?I don’t agree with all of the author’s sentiments and opinion, but this is an educational read. Some chapters introduce a huge blast of scientific species names, and they can cause a bit of information overload. My recommendation is to take it slow, and don’t try to rush it through."
182,0802129161,http://goodreads.com/user/show/63421053-nico-van-straalen,3,"Tim Flannery writes the story of European nature and geology, from 100 million years ago up to the present day, using an extraordinary lively style, interspersed with tales about queer European scientists, discoverers and adventurers. Don't be afraid though of chalicotheres, sivatheres, nimvarids and choristerans, because the book is littered with them and their likes, extinct or alive. What I don't like is that Flannery goes along with the story that a bipedal ape, a hominin, migrated from Africa and walked upright in Europe 5.7 million years ago. Anybody who has read the original 2017 publication on the Trachilos footprints can see that this is just highly contentious, to put it mildly. Flannery also mixes up hominins, hominids and hominoids and his view of human evolution originating in Europe is clearly biased. But the book has lots of other informative stories, some sweeping, some extremely detailed, but all told with great flavour. The book ends with a plea for rewilding Europe (taking the Dutch Oostvaardersplassen as an example!), using careful introductions, breeding programs and maybe genetic engineering, a project in which the author will be very well at home."
183,0802129161,http://goodreads.com/user/show/299912-rachel-rogers,5,"Fascinating. Eminently readable (except the last few chapters, which dragged on a bit). I wish history writers would take lessons from scientist on making their topics more accessible.I was worried at first that Flannery was going to take a Europecentric voice on the world that would try to extinguish the impact of other continents but that wasn't the angle. Instead, he looked at the evolutionary history of animals that are/were once on what is now Europe but have closer relations to animals extant on Sumatra or Brazil or China, etc. It's largely a treatise on the importance of genetic diversity while being a strong natural history text.His periodic suggestions that elephants or rhinos or hippos should be reintroduced to Europe because they were there as recently as the last ice age were a little odd given the massive changes to the land wrought by humans and urban society but was born out by the efforts and ideas to Rewild Europe by either allowing or actively reintroducing other native species there. Considering the proliferation of deer in the US because all natural predators have been eliminated, allowing some of those predators back isn't a bad idea."
184,0802129161,http://goodreads.com/user/show/98973047-clara,3,"Overall, this is an interesting and entertaining book which teaches a lot about Europe's history from being a tropical archipelago crowded by dwarf dinosaurs until becoming a densely inhabited and strongly urbanized continent. Flannery introduces the reader to countless strange creatures and beautiful, outer-wordly landscapes of past time using his fun time machine. He also talks about hte scientists who contributed to our current understanding of Europe's natural history. Additionally, he is very good at clearly explaining all kinds of difficult concepts and intricate feedback loops between the weather, the sea-level, the continental drift and the composition of Europe's fauna and flora in different geological periods.Yet I can't help but agree with many other readers that many stretches of this book feel like endless lists of extinct creatures which names you almost immediately forget. This I have to say made the book a little bit tedious and monotonous at times. Secondly, I didn't appreciate Flannery's tendency to portray every scientist in the field as mad, eccentric or suicidal with this gossipy/mocking tone which I found completely out of place. Despite these points of criticism I believe it's worth giving this book a read, since you do really learn a lot. And I have to say some of the descriptions of past European landscapes are quite beautiful."

Please note: this means no maps (a couple were mentioned to come), no images, even the endnote links did not work in my galley. There were still some significant typos in the text. These things definitely affected my view of this book, but not as much as the text itself did. This book is all over the place, and this review was very difficult to write.I was expecting a natural history of Europe. Sure, that's a tall order. I was expecting something like A Natural History of California (an amazing book for those interested). Flannery's book is nothing like that. I would argue it's not natural history at all. It's...ecological history? Not exactly. It's more of paleontology up to the present time, heavy on the fauna (especially on mammals--especially homo and herbivores) and light on the flora. Only the a few chapters near the end cover the 20th/21st centuries. The 18th and 19th are nearly entirely skipped over. He even extrapolates into the future.So what is this book? Many chapters are simply lists, in descriptive paragraph form, of animals (largely mammals) alive in Europe during different epochs. It's paleontology, which is no small surprise since Flannery is a paleontologist. A paleontologist who likes animals, especially mammals, and even more so herbivores. And way too much of this book implies that Europe is somehow...exceptional? He includes Begun's recent theory that homo evolved our most human traits in Europe, not Africa (ch 17). That the Vikings and Columbus ""discovered"" (ch 38). He is interested in re-introducing long-extirpated (and even extinct) species back into Europe (ch 28, ch 44). And even though this is ""a natural history of Europe"" he still discusses North American woolly mammoths and Pacific rats, among many other non-European things and places that have little to do with his topic. Much of this book made me uncomfortable, the rest was just dull. What this book really reads like is a survey class on the paleontology of Europe. That explains the inconsistencies in writing style and topics; the controversial statements and strange facts (why is the Pacific rat so important? why do we hear about the Signor-Lipps theory so often?); the imagined genetically engineered future (which is not natural history or paleontology!); the odd attempts at humor that aren't funny but do sound like a professor talking to a large class or a speaker presenting to an interested group of laypeople. 3 classes per week, 1 semester is 15 weeks = 45 lectures.

210,0802129161,http://goodreads.com/user/show/14538532-greg,4,"* I would like to thank NetGalley and the publisher for the opportunity to review this book. *It's perhaps a little unexpected that an Australian scientist would tackle such a vast and complicated subject as the natural history of Europe, but Tim Flannery makes a pretty fair fist of the job. His varied background as a palaeontologist, mammalogist and environmental scientist stands him in good stead here.The book starts with the clunky device of a time machine to take the reader back to the pre-history of Europe in a geological sense, discussing how the continent gradually formed from the original Pangea and became what we know today. Flannery takes us to sites where the evidence and impact of the changes can be seen.The book then roughly works through each successive geological era to describe what happened to Europe itself and to its fauna and flora. Perhaps the most surprising thing revealed here is that humans originated in Europe, died out there and then returned from Africa much later. Similarly, there is a long list of megafauna that we traditionally think of as African that once thrived in Europe.Overall, considering the vastness of the topic, this is a credible and always interesting overview of the development of Europe and its inhabitants from pre-history through to modern times."
211,0802129161,http://goodreads.com/user/show/73506628-emily,3,"This is certainly an interesting book. I have never seen anything about the natural history of a specific continent, and it is very nice to read about how natural progression occurred throughout age. It is a very educational book, and I was introduced to several concepts that are new to me. Specifically, I find the discussion on hybridization high intriguing, as well as the impact of human action on the behaviour/life style of wild species (eg. European brown bears are adopting a more herbivorous diet due to past conflicts with humans). Many thought-provoking ethical questions were raised and discussed. To mention a few examples, how should we determine which species are fit for re-introduction? Should we take an active role in managing the gene mixing of domestic and wild species? Species re-introduction can displace or wipe out some current species, how can we determine what is acceptable in this situation?I don’t agree with all of the author’s sentiments and opinion, but this is an educational read. Some chapters introduce a huge blast of scientific species names, and they can cause a bit of information overload. My recommendation is to take it slow, and don’t try to rush it through."
212,0802129161,http://goodreads.com/user/show/63421053-nico-van-straalen,3,"Tim Flannery writes the story of European nature and geology, from 100 million years ago up to the present day, using an extraordinary lively style, interspersed with tales about queer European scientists, discoverers and adventurers. Don't be afraid though of chalicotheres, sivatheres, nimvarids and choristerans, because the book is littered with them and their likes, extinct or alive. What I don't like is that Flannery goes along with the story that a bipedal ape, a hominin, migrated from Africa and walked upright in Europe 5.7 million years ago. Anybody who has read the original 2017 publication on the Trachilos footprints can see that this is just highly contentious, to put it mildly. Flannery also mixes up hominins, hominids and hominoids and his view of human evolution originating in Europe is clearly biased. But the book has lots of other informative stories, some sweeping, some extremely detailed, but all told with great flavour. The book ends with a plea for rewilding Europe (taking the Dutch Oostvaardersplassen as an example!), using careful introductions, breeding programs and maybe genetic engineering, a project in which the author will be very well at home."
213,0802129161,http://goodreads.com/user/show/299912-rachel-rogers,5,"Fascinating. Eminently readable (except the last few chapters, which dragged on a bit). I wish history writers would take lessons from scientist on making their topics more accessible.I was worried at first that Flannery was going to take a Europecentric voice on the world that would try to extinguish the impact of other continents but that wasn't the angle. Instead, he looked at the evolutionary history of animals that are/were once on what is now Europe but have closer relations to animals extant on Sumatra or Brazil or China, etc. It's largely a treatise on the importance of genetic diversity while being a strong natural history text.His periodic suggestions that elephants or rhinos or hippos should be reintroduced to Europe because they were there as recently as the last ice age were a little odd given the massive changes to the land wrought by humans and urban society but was born out by the efforts and ideas to Rewild Europe by either allowing or actively reintroducing other native species there. Considering the proliferation of deer in the US because all natural predators have been eliminated, allowing some of those predators back isn't a bad idea."
214,0802129161,http://goodreads.com/user/show/98973047-clara,3,"Overall, this is an interesting and entertaining book which teaches a lot about Europe's history from being a tropical archipelago crowded by dwarf dinosaurs until becoming a densely inhabited and strongly urbanized continent. Flannery introduces the reader to countless strange creatures and beautiful, outer-wordly landscapes of past time using his fun time machine. He also talks about hte scientists who contributed to our current understanding of Europe's natural history. Additionally, he is very good at clearly explaining all kinds of difficult concepts and intricate feedback loops between the weather, the sea-level, the continental drift and the composition of Europe's fauna and flora in different geological periods.Yet I can't help but agree with many other readers that many stretches of this book feel like endless lists of extinct creatures which names you almost immediately forget. This I have to say made the book a little bit tedious and monotonous at times. Secondly, I didn't appreciate Flannery's tendency to portray every scientist in the field as mad, eccentric or suicidal with this gossipy/mocking tone which I found completely out of place. Despite these points of criticism I believe it's worth giving this book a read, since you do really learn a lot. And I have to say some of the descriptions of past European landscapes are quite beautiful."
215,0802129161,http://goodreads.com/user/show/31005950-gibson,3,"An interesting approach to the palaeontology of what is now Europe. Too often our reading is interrupted by flippant footnotes of no consequence and far too often Flannery falls into the easy trap in this area of study of forgetting the flimsy and sporadic nature of the evidence.The result is that speculation and possibility become likelihood for no other reason than the author is swayed towards that view.I am an amateur in this area, so I rely on well considered informed and balanced evidence in order to be persuaded by the author’s viewpoint. When simple facts like the height of cliffs in the Australian Blue Mountains are wrong by almost an order of magnitude, I have to be skeptic at about the author’s mastery of elsewhere. Having read criticisms on matters of fact from other reviewers, I firmly place this book into the category of interesting entertainment, but look elsewhere for the science.His speculative insights into the lives of some scientists belong in the tabloid press or those glossy magazines flanking supermarket checkouts.Quite entertaining, occasionally populist and unconvincing.It needed many more maps and diagrams."
216,0802129161,http://goodreads.com/user/show/10079154-michael,5,"Tim Flannery is one of Australia's great literary scientists - I say that meaning that he can take the complex worlds of biology, evolution, geology and put these concepts into words for the lay person. This book is a fascinating look at how Europe evolved over the past 100 million years. Plate tectonics pushed various land masses around so that Europe grew out of various smaller islands. He then goes on to illustrate how the various dinosaurs, amphibians, mammals, insect and plant life adapted to the changes brought about by this movement and that movement helped various animals move about and interact, changing the landscape and thus changing the climate. It is more complex than this, but I think this is the gist of the book. I found it fascinating. He also shows how many species of Europe thought extinct have actually evolved into other species living now in Asia and Africa, and vice versa. This was just a fab book and recommend to anyone interested in history and especially the landscape of Europe."
217,0802129161,http://goodreads.com/user/show/993782-jaclyn,2,"Although large portions of this book were well researched and composed in a compelling narrative, there was tabloid-like feel to many of the anecdotes about the paleontologists and naturalists that was unsettling to read. The jarring references to scientists' sex lives, mental illnesses, and suicides were unnecessary in a book about natural history. For example, if the author was so compelled to include the detail that archeologist Vere Gordon Childe ""seems never to have had a sexual relationship"" and that he ""flung himself"" off a cliff, it really should have been written in a footnote rather than within the few paragraphs detailing changing migration patterns in the Neolithic period. However, I truly fail to see the author's point of writting, ""we can only hope that he revelled in the acceleration in his last moments."" This cringe-worthy tone is recurring throughout the book and sullys an otherwise serviceable text on the geological formation of Europe and the animals and hominids that have lived there."
218,0802129161,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5344627-sarah,4,"Easy and entertaining read and lots of interesting stuff. I hadn't heard the name for the european bison - wisent - before but I won't forget it now. I'm still struggling to grasp the different sweeps of time, with plate tectonics, ancient animal races, ice ages and recent history. I thought for a while that more and better timelines might help but I've seen lots of timelines before and it never seems to sink in so hopefully this narrative will leave a more lasting trace. And I love the suggestion we might rewild Europe not just with bears and wolves, but with wisent, lions and forest elephant. We have beavers coming to a wildlife trust enclosure in Derbyshire this year - perhaps only the start!"
219,0802129161,http://goodreads.com/user/show/12000072-steve,5,"Science writing done wellI enjoyed this book. Tim Flannery is a great writer with a good sense of humor. He writes with a conversational tone, explains all the science clearly, and at times offers entertaining personal opinions. While mostly about the biology of Europe over time, the book also discusses the relevant geography, for examples the islands that came together over time to create modern Europe. I recommend this book for anyone interested in science.Disclosure: I received a complimentary copy of this book via Netgalley for review purposes."
220,0802129161,http://goodreads.com/user/show/73694289-patrick-nielson,5,"Self -Descriptive TitleFlannery tells a broad tale of the natural history of Europe in a readable book full of science and imagination. The story moves rapidly and easily, touching on creature after creature, landscape, climate, geography and the homo species, leaving no doubt about the author's very learned views. A delightful read -and listen as I listened to audiobooks while following along in the Kindle version, helping to see the reader's elegant pronunciation of the many scientific and foreign language references."
221,0802129161,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2759420-jake,4,"This type of thing is not normally my cup of tea... We're talking anthropology, geology, archeology and other ologies. It ended up being very interesting. Imagine the elephants and rhinos (some wooly) strange dinosaurs, and Homo Sapiens/Neanderthal hybrids (and those of us with European blood have an estimated 2-4% DNA remaining) etc etc and the old old old Europe looked nothing like the forests of the Aryan imagination. A very interesting book."
222,0802129161,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5234931-john,5,"Paleontology is not a strong area of mine possibly because of my inability to conceptualise the vast expanses of time over which things are considered by it. But Tim Flannery, a prince among people in general, as the author and the European setting caught and kept my attention. What a great introduction to the topic. This was one of those experiences in reading that left me looking out my window at a different world than I'd known before."

Having read criticisms on matters of fact from other reviewers, I firmly place this book into the category of interesting entertainment, but look elsewhere for the science.His speculative insights into the lives of some scientists belong in the tabloid press or those glossy magazines flanking supermarket checkouts.Quite entertaining, occasionally populist and unconvincing.It needed many more maps and diagrams."

This book is a fascinating look at how Europe evolved over the past 100 million years. Plate tectonics pushed various land masses around so that Europe grew out of various smaller islands. He then goes on to illustrate how the various dinosaurs, amphibians, mammals, insect and plant life adapted to the changes brought about by this movement and that movement helped various animals move about and interact, changing the landscape and thus changing the climate. It is more complex than this, but I think this is the gist of the book. I found it fascinating. He also shows how many species of Europe thought extinct have actually evolved into other species living now in Asia and Africa, and vice versa.

The jarring references to scientists' sex lives, mental illnesses, and suicides were unnecessary in a book about natural history. For example, if the author was so compelled to include the detail that archeologist Vere Gordon Childe ""seems never to have had a sexual relationship"" and that he ""flung himself"" off a cliff, it really should have been written in a footnote rather than within the few paragraphs detailing changing migration patterns in the Neolithic period. However, I truly fail to see the author's point of writting, ""we can only hope that he revelled in the acceleration in his last moments."" This cringe-worthy tone is recurring throughout the book and sullys an otherwise serviceable text on the geological formation of Europe and the animals and hominids that have lived there."

Please note: this means no maps (a couple were mentioned to come), no images, even the endnote links did not work in my galley. There were still some significant typos in the text. These things definitely affected my view of this book, but not as much as the text itself did. This book is all over the place, and this review was very difficult to write.I was expecting a natural history of Europe. Sure, that's a tall order. I was expecting something like A Natural History of California (an amazing book for those interested). Flannery's book is nothing like that. I would argue it's not natural history at all. It's...ecological history? Not exactly. It's more of paleontology up to the present time, heavy on the fauna (especially on mammals--especially homo and herbivores) and light on the flora. Only the a few chapters near the end cover the 20th/21st centuries. The 18th and 19th are nearly entirely skipped over. He even extrapolates into the future.So what is this book? Many chapters are simply lists, in descriptive paragraph form, of animals (largely mammals) alive in Europe during different epochs. It's paleontology, which is no small surprise since Flannery is a paleontologist. A paleontologist who likes animals, especially mammals, and even more so herbivores. And way too much of this book implies that Europe is somehow...exceptional? He includes Begun's recent theory that homo evolved our most human traits in Europe, not Africa (ch 17). That the Vikings and Columbus ""discovered"" (ch 38). He is interested in re-introducing long-extirpated (and even extinct) species back into Europe (ch 28, ch 44). And even though this is ""a natural history of Europe"" he still discusses North American woolly mammoths and Pacific rats, among many other non-European things and places that have little to do with his topic. Much of this book made me uncomfortable, the rest was just dull. What this book really reads like is a survey class on the paleontology of Europe. That explains the inconsistencies in writing style and topics; the controversial statements and strange facts (why is the Pacific rat so important? why do we hear about the Signor-Lipps theory so often?); the imagined genetically engineered future (which is not natural history or paleontology!); the odd attempts at humor that aren't funny but do sound like a professor talking to a large class or a speaker presenting to an interested group of laypeople. 3 classes per week, 1 semester is 15 weeks = 45 lectures. This book has 44 chapters.————Thank you to NetGalley for providing me with a copy of this book in exchange for an honest review."

270,0802129161,http://goodreads.com/user/show/14538532-greg,4,"* I would like to thank NetGalley and the publisher for the opportunity to review this book. *It's perhaps a little unexpected that an Australian scientist would tackle such a vast and complicated subject as the natural history of Europe, but Tim Flannery makes a pretty fair fist of the job. His varied background as a palaeontologist, mammalogist and environmental scientist stands him in good stead here.The book starts with the clunky device of a time machine to take the reader back to the pre-history of Europe in a geological sense, discussing how the continent gradually formed from the original Pangea and became what we know today. Flannery takes us to sites where the evidence and impact of the changes can be seen.The book then roughly works through each successive geological era to describe what happened to Europe itself and to its fauna and flora. Perhaps the most surprising thing revealed here is that humans originated in Europe, died out there and then returned from Africa much later. Similarly, there is a long list of megafauna that we traditionally think of as African that once thrived in Europe.Overall, considering the vastness of the topic, this is a credible and always interesting overview of the development of Europe and its inhabitants from pre-history through to modern times."
271,0802129161,http://goodreads.com/user/show/73506628-emily,3,"This is certainly an interesting book. I have never seen anything about the natural history of a specific continent, and it is very nice to read about how natural progression occurred throughout age. It is a very educational book, and I was introduced to several concepts that are new to me. Specifically, I find the discussion on hybridization high intriguing, as well as the impact of human action on the behaviour/life style of wild species (eg. European brown bears are adopting a more herbivorous diet due to past conflicts with humans). Many thought-provoking ethical questions were raised and discussed. To mention a few examples, how should we determine which species are fit for re-introduction? Should we take an active role in managing the gene mixing of domestic and wild species? Species re-introduction can displace or wipe out some current species, how can we determine what is acceptable in this situation?I don’t agree with all of the author’s sentiments and opinion, but this is an educational read. Some chapters introduce a huge blast of scientific species names, and they can cause a bit of information overload. My recommendation is to take it slow, and don’t try to rush it through."
272,0802129161,http://goodreads.com/user/show/63421053-nico-van-straalen,3,"Tim Flannery writes the story of European nature and geology, from 100 million years ago up to the present day, using an extraordinary lively style, interspersed with tales about queer European scientists, discoverers and adventurers. Don't be afraid though of chalicotheres, sivatheres, nimvarids and choristerans, because the book is littered with them and their likes, extinct or alive. What I don't like is that Flannery goes along with the story that a bipedal ape, a hominin, migrated from Africa and walked upright in Europe 5.7 million years ago. Anybody who has read the original 2017 publication on the Trachilos footprints can see that this is just highly contentious, to put it mildly. Flannery also mixes up hominins, hominids and hominoids and his view of human evolution originating in Europe is clearly biased. But the book has lots of other informative stories, some sweeping, some extremely detailed, but all told with great flavour. The book ends with a plea for rewilding Europe (taking the Dutch Oostvaardersplassen as an example!), using careful introductions, breeding programs and maybe genetic engineering, a project in which the author will be very well at home."
273,0802129161,http://goodreads.com/user/show/299912-rachel-rogers,5,"Fascinating. Eminently readable (except the last few chapters, which dragged on a bit). I wish history writers would take lessons from scientist on making their topics more accessible.I was worried at first that Flannery was going to take a Europecentric voice on the world that would try to extinguish the impact of other continents but that wasn't the angle. Instead, he looked at the evolutionary history of animals that are/were once on what is now Europe but have closer relations to animals extant on Sumatra or Brazil or China, etc. It's largely a treatise on the importance of genetic diversity while being a strong natural history text.His periodic suggestions that elephants or rhinos or hippos should be reintroduced to Europe because they were there as recently as the last ice age were a little odd given the massive changes to the land wrought by humans and urban society but was born out by the efforts and ideas to Rewild Europe by either allowing or actively reintroducing other native species there. Considering the proliferation of deer in the US because all natural predators have been eliminated, allowing some of those predators back isn't a bad idea."
274,0802129161,http://goodreads.com/user/show/98973047-clara,3,"Overall, this is an interesting and entertaining book which teaches a lot about Europe's history from being a tropical archipelago crowded by dwarf dinosaurs until becoming a densely inhabited and strongly urbanized continent. Flannery introduces the reader to countless strange creatures and beautiful, outer-wordly landscapes of past time using his fun time machine. He also talks about hte scientists who contributed to our current understanding of Europe's natural history. Additionally, he is very good at clearly explaining all kinds of difficult concepts and intricate feedback loops between the weather, the sea-level, the continental drift and the composition of Europe's fauna and flora in different geological periods.Yet I can't help but agree with many other readers that many stretches of this book feel like endless lists of extinct creatures which names you almost immediately forget. This I have to say made the book a little bit tedious and monotonous at times. Secondly, I didn't appreciate Flannery's tendency to portray every scientist in the field as mad, eccentric or suicidal with this gossipy/mocking tone which I found completely out of place. Despite these points of criticism I believe it's worth giving this book a read, since you do really learn a lot. And I have to say some of the descriptions of past European landscapes are quite beautiful."

This book is all over the place, and this review was very difficult to write.I was expecting a natural history of Europe. Sure, that's a tall order. I was expecting something like A Natural History of California (an amazing book for those interested). Flannery's book is nothing like that. I would argue it's not natural history at all. It's...ecological history? Not exactly. It's more of paleontology up to the present time, heavy on the fauna (especially on mammals--especially homo and herbivores) and light on the flora. Only the a few chapters near the end cover the 20th/21st centuries. The 18th and 19th are nearly entirely skipped over. He even extrapolates into the future.So what is this book? Many chapters are simply lists, in descriptive paragraph form, of animals (largely mammals) alive in Europe during different epochs. It's paleontology, which is no small surprise since Flannery is a paleontologist. A paleontologist who likes animals, especially mammals, and even more so herbivores. And way too much of this book implies that Europe is somehow...exceptional? He includes Begun's recent theory that homo evolved our most human traits in Europe, not Africa (ch 17). That the Vikings and Columbus ""discovered"" (ch 38). He is interested in re-introducing long-extirpated (and even extinct) species back into Europe (ch 28, ch 44). And even though this is ""a natural history of Europe"" he still discusses North American woolly mammoths and Pacific rats, among many other non-European things and places that have little to do with his topic. Much of this book made me uncomfortable, the rest was just dull. What this book really reads like is a survey class on the paleontology of Europe. That explains the inconsistencies in writing style and topics; the controversial statements and strange facts (why is the Pacific rat so important? why do we hear about the Signor-Lipps theory so often?); the imagined genetically engineered future (which is not natural history or paleontology!); the odd attempts at humor that aren't funny but do sound like a professor talking to a large class or a speaker presenting to an interested group of laypeople. 3 classes per week, 1 semester is 15 weeks = 45 lectures. This book has 44 chapters.————Thank you to NetGalley for providing me with a copy of this book in exchange for an honest review."
