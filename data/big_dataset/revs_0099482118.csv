His anthropological observations of the human race are seen as too simplistic. However, I have always found his analysis to be relevant and highly enjoyable. Here, the human animal is observed in urban surroundings - according to the author, this is equivalent to the limited surroundings of a zoo. Animals exhibit many ""deviant"" behaviours under captivity: Morris illustrates, in highly entertaining fashion, how the same is applicable to the city dweller. Rather than being a concrete jungle, the city is a ""human zoo"".Extremely readable and engaging. "

The human animal acts just like the animals it claims to be ""superior to"". In SuperFreakeconomics .... the economist started using money on the monkeys .... once they learned the coins had value ..., the female monkeys, prostituted themselves, sex for money .... this is no small discovery. When I was in Saudi Arabia, two female soldiers were court martialed because they were prostituting. Their defense, initially they were giving it away .... but then all the men kept coming back for more .... so they began to charge .... the men didnt liked it so they accused the female soldiers of prostitution. The women were court martialed, a felony offense, they loose their voting privileges, their right to carry a gun, or even bullets, they cant hold certain jobs, they are disgraced in the community, they are fined, demoted, jailed and finally released with nothing. If this had been my sister, daughter, mother, or any relation to me, I would have shot the bastards. Interesting that you can sell your body and be a surrogate, but dont you dare sell your privates! ... Thats just wrong. Ah religious fanaticism. Anyway this should inspire some of you to poetry, or to stop reading some of those romance novels. When the monkeys discovered the value of a dollar, they stole the coins. "
2,0099482118,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7411839-kali,1,"Setting the standard for evolutionary psychology ""just so"" stories, Morris demonstrates that at least in this case evolutionary psychologists tell us more about their own biases than the human past. In Morris's analysis, the cause and effect of human evolution are crystal clear and all happen to mesh neatly with his own biases, including his sexism and homophobia. His ""ten commandments of dominance,"" upon which he claims human relationships are based, are often absurd, such as the commandment, "" You must suppress squabbles that break out between your subordinates."" This of course ignores the many situations in which power is maintained by dividing subordinate groups so that they can't organize against those in power. Observations are at this level of inanity throughout the book."

4,0099482118,http://goodreads.com/user/show/38396339-bastard-travel,4,"I can only assume the working title was ""Shitty Cities: Why People Are Garbage When They Don't Live In the Woods"". After a near catastrophe where I spilled a gallon of water on it and had to bake it dry in my car, effort justification forced me to power through it the rest of the way. It made a callous and unpopular suggestion vis-Ã -vis ""human nature"" that I have no choice but to love.The Human Zoo is overgrown civilization, specifically in the form of major, metropolitan cities. We evolved to be social animals in small tribes that could very rarely exceed 20 or so, and our opportunistic, scavenging nature imbued us with dexterous and exploratory minds which crave stimulation and relaxation in equal measure. Morris never flat out says things like ""civilized overstimulation is what leads to chronic anxiety and eventual stress diseases"" or ""organized church religions fulfill the need for cerebral relaxation by allowing a sense of community wherein you can turn your mind off, and reap benefits from both"", but they are strongly implied.A major theme of the book is equilibrium, and how evolution has adapted us not only as individuals but as a species to try to stay in tune with our environment, even as we deliberately change our environment. This culminates in the suggestion that as a unified, nearly hive-mind organism, we understand that we are overpopulated, and unconsciously rectify the situation.It is in this way he explains our drives to contraception and war. Both are foreign to other animals, for obvious reasons in the case of the former, but no other animal can get populous enough to need war. If they do, starvation will claim them first because their ill-equipped neural hardware guarantees shortsightedness.We are too smart and too safe to die by predation or plague. Instead, we've created a masochistic utopia where the mere act of languishing in daily comfort gives us mental illnesses we correct with psychoactives that disable the exact mental processes that made us apex animals. We starve some of our super-tribe, we murder outgroups with very little hesitation, and in an increasingly growing percentage of cases, we end our own, individual lives.I know it's Jungian and mystical to suggest there's some thrumming sociopsychological undercurrent compelling us to die so we can hit an evolutionary quo. I'm skeptical too. But I acknowledge that everything else about humans, from mating patterns to menstruation, moves cyclically, just as electrons orbit their protons and the planets revolve around the sun.I really liked the book, although it was dated and hokey in parts. Unavoidable, considering it was written 45 years ago, and a chapter or two would make tumblr burst into flames of indignation, but Morris did what he could with what he had and I can respect that and still extrapolate from the hard science provided. He took a number of potshots at Americans. I guess I can't blame him, but don't think I didn't notice, buddy. That's the thing about Americans. We never forget.The sex and super-sex area of the book was, naturally, the most interesting. It's not a topic you can top. Morris divvied human sexual motivation into ten different kinds of sex, the most socially relevant being ""Status sex""; sex as a means of social climbing, not so much ""sleeping your way to the top"" as gaining reassurance in your social success by varied sexual experiences. I just finished writing an entirely-too-long research paper about the Sociometer hypothesis of self-esteem, which mirrored this suggestion in more sterile and less intimate terms by suggesting self-esteem functions as a means of gauging how socially accepted you are, and low self-esteem serves as an early warning mechanism for community ostraciziation. In a perfect world, good self-esteem would be linked with exploratory promiscuity, but since promiscuity is frequently driven by low self-esteem in the first place (""Ima prove I'm worth something""), we can surmise this is not a perfect world. Hell, maybe that'll be my thesis.I was also partial to this little snippet: If the modern Status Sex practitioner is unable to achieve real conquests, there are still a number of alternatives available to him. A mildly insecure male can express himself by telling dirty jokes. These carry the implication that he is aggressively sexual, but an obsessive, persistent, dirty-joke-teller begins to arouse suspicion in his companions. They detect a compensation mechanism. Come on. You know that guy. We all know that guy.The imprinting and malimprinting bit was as good a guess as any, and better than most. It's a relief to find that concept in a book not entitled ""Perv"". Now I can quote it like it's real science.Overall, a really interesting and surprisingly readable book penned by a cranky zoologist about how people are shitty. I'll be picking up The Naked Ape at some point in the near future."

8,0099482118,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1052384-nicholas,2,"You're not designed for the world you live in. Cities are like zoos in that they create pathologies stemming from overcrowding and mis-stimulation. You're mind is a carefully calibrated algorithmic system and when you put it in an incorrect environment it responds incorrectly. Most current psychological pathologies arise from this fact.The mental states induced by this misalignment are most likely confusion and anxiety. Both seemingly without cause.I didn't like a lot of his conclusions. The premise was fine but much of everything after that I just couldn't accept the logic.Also there were some statements that I just don't believe. Like:In their natural environment monkey's don't masturbate or kill each other. This just sounds like nonsense. A zoo environment would certainly exacerbate such behavior but it doesn't create it.The stuff about maintaining tribal identity in a world that does not offer true tribes was interesting.I thought I would like this book a lot more than I did. Some of the words out of this guy's mouth were just ridiculous. HOLY SHIT. I just got the part about the phallic symbolism. Shit this guy is crazy. EVERYTHING IS PENISES. IT ALL SYMBOLIZES THE PATRIARCHY.On page 66 he touches on an important idea. Dominance mimicry vs status seeking. But his coverage was pure nonsense. He said that dominant individuals flood the market with cheap mass produced imitations so as to increase the value of his own symbols. This is horseshit. ""He"" doesn't care about your mimicry. The people at the top or so far beyond the people at they bottom that there is no way they could be mimicked in any threatening way. This kind of shit was sprinkled throughout the book. Couldn't stand it.The idea of cheap, mass-produced imitations of high-status goods is important though.Quotes:""The character of the human animal is such that we will always fight against the loss of our tribal identity. Some cities encourage this struggle. They foster imaginative local variation. Those that fail to do so will soon find that their, bland, inhuman scale will be disrupted and dismantled. The plain truth is that, if this is not done constructively, it will be done destructively. There is a special message in the gangland graffiti that city planners fail to see: acres of gray concrete do not a village make.""""With each new complexity, you will find yourself one step farther away form your natural tribal state, the state in which your ancestors existed for a million years.""""Revolutionary leaders would do well to anticipate this problem. It is not the chains of social identity that their followers will want to break, it is the chains of a particular social identity. As soon as these are smashed, they will need new ones and will soon become dissatisfied merely with an abstract sense of 'freedom'. Such are the demands of the isolating laws.""""Many a powerful leader has survived occasional wrong decisions, made with style and forcefulness, but few have survived hesitant indecisiveness. The golden rule of leadership here, which in a rational age is an unpleasant one to accept, is that it is the manner in which you do something that really counts, rather than what you do. It is a sad truth that a leader who does the wrong things in the right way will, up to a certain point, gain greater allegiance and enjoy more success than one who does the right things in the wrong way.""""A rational solution is to do away with the powerful leader-figure, to relegate him to the ancient, tribal past where he belonged, and to replace him with a computer fed organization of interdependent, specialized experts. Something approaching such an organization already exists, of course, and in England any civil servant will tell you without hesitation that it is the civil service that really runs the country. To emphasize his point he will inform you that when parliament is in session his work is seriously hampered; only during parliamentary recesses can serious progress be made. All this is very logical, but unfortunately it is not bio-logical, and the country he claims to be running happens to be made up of biological specimens - the super-tribesmen. True, a super-tribe needs super-control, and if it is too much for one man it might seem reasonable to solve the problem by converting a power-figure into a power-organization. This does not, however, satisfy the biological demands of the followers. They may be able to reason super-tribally, but their feelings are still tribal, and they will continue to demand a real leader in the form of an identifiable, solitary individual. It is a fundamental pattern of their species, and there is no avoiding it. Institutions and computers may be valuable servants to the masters, but they can never themselves become masters (science fiction stories notwithstanding). A diffuse organization, a faceless machine, lacks the essential properties: it cannot inspire and it cannot be deposed. The single dominant human is therefore doomed to struggle on, behaving publicly like a tribal leader, with panache and assurance, while in private he grapples laboriously with the almost impossible tasks of super-tribal control.""""The flaw i the social dropout's solution is that he does not really drop out at all: he stays put and pours scorn on the rat race that surrounds him.""""The vast majority of all sports, pastimes, hobbies and 'good works' have as their principle function not their specifically avowed aims, but the much more basic aim of follow-the-leader=and-beat-him-if-you-can. However, this is a description and not a criticism. In fact, the situation would be much more grave f this multitude of harmless sub-groups, or pseudo=tribes, did not exist. They funnel off a great deal of the frustrated ladder-climbing that might otherwise cause considerable havoc.""""Well-meaning authorities talk airily about 'hopes for a global society'. They see clearly the technical possibility of such a development, given the marvels of modern communication, but they stubbornly overlook the biological difficulties.""""Failures to date have largely been due to attempts to suppress the existing difference between the various groups, rather than to improve the nature of these differences by converting them into more rewarding and peaceful forms of competitive social interaction. Attempts to iron out the whole world into one great expanse of uniform monotony are doomed to disaster.""""If any small boy can, on his personal merits, eventually become the greatest of leaders, then for every one who succeeds there will be vast numbers of failures. These failures can no longer put the blame on the external fores of the wicked class system. They must place it firmly where it belongs, on their own personal shortcomings. It seems, therefore, that any large-scale, lively, progressive super-tribe must inevitably contain a high proportion of intensely frustrated status-seekers. The dumb contentment of a rigid, stagnant society is replaced by the feverish longings and anxieties of a mobile, developing one. How do the struggling status-seekers react to this situation? The answer is that, if they cannot get to the top, they do their best to create the illusion of being less subordinate than they really are.""""It is very bewildering for our struggling super-tribesman. He has obeyed all the rules, but something has gone wrong. The super-status demands of the human zoo are cruel indeed. Either he fails and becomes disillusioned, or he succeeds and loses control of his family. Worse still, he can work so hard that he loses control of his family and still fails.""""By all the rules, the human zoo should be a screaming mad-house by now, disintegrating into complete social confusion.""""When in a threatening mood, a superior male of this species approaches close to an inferior and obtrusively erects his penis in the inferior's face."" Awesome.""We have to face the fact that, living in a human zoo, we are inevitably going to suffer from many abnormal relationships. We are bound to be exposed in unusual ways to unusual stimuli. Our nervous systems are not equipped to deal with this an our patterns of response will sometimes misfire. Like the experimental or zoo animals, we may find ourselves fixated with strange and sometimes damaging bonds, or we may suffer from serious bond confusion. It can happen to any of us, at any time. It is merely another of the hazards of existing as an inmate of a human zoo. We are all potential victims, and the most appropriate reaction, when we come across it in someone else, is sympathy rather than cold intolerance.""""Unfortunately we tend to forget that we are animals with certain specific weaknesses and certain specific strengths. We think of ourselves as blank sheets on which anything can be written. We are not. We come into the world with a set of basic instructions and we ignore or disobey them at our peril."""
9,0099482118,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7294243-srikkanthan,4,Can't believe this was written in the late sixties. This is one wonderful book that puts forth with all honesty why the urbanized human being is so violent as well as vulnerable. This book is really thought provoking and definitely would change the world view after reading. 
10,0099482118,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1721930-jon,4,"Morris's premise is an interesting one--that animals in zoos suffer from loneliness and deprivation and act out in unwholesome ways that do not occur in nature. So, too, man is housed in a zoo. It's called a city. As such, we have murder, thievery, and so on--actions you would see nowhere in nature.Our natural environment is one of small tribes, where we hunt and gather. There are maybe fifty of us to twenty square miles. Instead, we have supertribes--cities where we don't know our neighbors and we're piled on top of each other. Yet somehow we thrive and survive. How? Because cities also foster creativity in ways that subsistence living does not. It's a constant fight between our desire for smaller tribes (hence, religion, sports clubs, civil wars) and the power that comes with larger tribes (hence, demigogs, dictatorships).Morris writes from an evolutionary anthropologists perspective, believing that man has for most of existence been akin to an ape. While I don't subscribe to this view, it sets up an intriguing line of argument. (My view is that man is created and that the banding together into cities did not occur thousands of years after man's evolution but rather within hundreds if not tens of years after man's creation. We are social creatures. We see this desire to band even in the story of the Tower of Babel, which takes place not long after man is almost completely banished from earth. So to me the city is not unnatural. Spending time in the country is likely to reveal as odd a set of behaviors and sometimes depravities as any city might. Rather, it is cultural moires, fostered best in smaller towns--tribes, I suppose, in Morris's view [so maybe he isn't far off the mark]--but also evident in some Asian cultures, in some religions, and in tightknit families, that create conformity and a relatively smaller scale of ""immoral"" behavior.)Morris's foray into specific behaviors created by city living dwells chiefly on the subject of status. In tribes, people vie for status, but in super-tribes this vying becomes something much more dangerous, pumped up on steroids, if you will, because of the size of the group. The first form that this competition takes is one based on authority and power. People look for a dominant leader--a king, a dictator. And all people want to be this leader. Morris spends much time comparing symbols of dominance among babboons to those among humans to make his point. And then he gets into the subject of its modern manifestations in the city: cliques, materialism, murder, and suicide. Because not everyone can be top dog, we split into smaller groups--hobbyists, generations, classes, workers, etc.--that we might manage to dominate: to be the big fish in the small pond. But this isn't always satisfactory either, and so we sometimes pretend to be something we aren't, which is the source of consumerism. A lower-class person mimics a high-class person by buying goods he or she can't afford or by buying cheap ripoffs that look like the higher-class goods (diamond necklaces, or fake diamond necklaces, instead of beads). As a result, folk art is pushed aside in favor of manufactured imitations. (Interesting, fifty years later, folk art and DIY culture is pushed the fore in some ways as an example of leisure and class--one has time to make a beaded necklace, instead of working!) Likewise, people commit violent acts against less powerful creatures, be they animals, children, family, or themselves. It is community standards that keep people from killing others, which then causes them to turn that violence against themselves. Suicide rates are higher in cities than in the country, and they are higher during times of peace than during times of war (when violence against others in condoned). Here, then, Morris says, is one result of our city, our human zoo: violence and consumerism to show status within the tribe.The next means by which status is shown has to do with sex. Again, Morris rehearses a set of rules: why people have sex--to procreate, to enjoy the physical simulation, to pair up, to be relieved of stress or boredom. He makes his comparisons to apes and other animals, who often show off their penises to maters and who use mating as a means to show their dominance or submission to one another. Men display their genitals as well, as we see in society through the use of various phallic symbols, often used as a means of insulting others (demonstrating dominance). Status is further demonstrated by sex through the accumulation of large numbers of partners (harems, serial monogamy) and through violent acts like rape. The need to pair up, bred into us from evolution, is slow to change, however, and interferes with promiscuity. (The arguments here seem forged around men showing dominance, as if it is men who are chiefly or solely the ones seeking status.) How sex as a status symbol is tied into the city is not entirely clear to me, other than that the number of available partners and the ease of demonstrating status is increased.In the next chapter Morris turns his attention to in-groups and out-groups and how they are established. An in-group is unified; an out-group is that which the in-group unifies against. Absence of an out-group usually means the in-group turns against itself, resulting in civil war. We establish what is out usually by easily delineated physically differences: skin color, shape of eyes, language. The possibility for war is increased via city living because people have land--rather than being nomads--to defend, and the tribes they defend are now supertribes, contributing to the size of the out-group and in-group and to the interaction these two will have (they can't just wander off, because there's insufficient extra land to allow that). (In nature, we defend self, family, and tribe. In the city, we defend possessions and supertribe as well.) Specialization means that some people are devoted to warmaking in and of itself and that leaders don't have to fight and risk their own lives to wage war, resulting, again, in even more wars. Furthermore, the seeking of status, frustrated in such supertribes, finds home is violence against out-groups, even as the desire to cooperate with those in the in-group encourages such violence and warring. Morris completes the chapter by making various dire comments on the population explosion and how that is going to exacerbate the situation (if only we could all go back to small hunter-gatherer tribes on huge ranges).Next, Morris writes about imprinting--how certain good or bad experiences can have undue effects on us and on animals. Ducklings reared with ony members of their own sex might only try to mate with other members of their own sex later in life; peacocks raised with monkeys might come to think they are monkeys; and so on. Humans, caged off from one another in a city--socially ostracized--might well forge odd behaviors too, such as sexual fetishes (caused by having focusing on some inanimate object during first sexual encounters, be it a shoe or a leather glove or underwear) and even a desire for pets (which are made to mimic babies). My issue here is that the social alienation that Morris writes of would not necessarily be solved in small hunter-gatherer groups. A city is a place of large social gathering; that some don't take advantage, that they stay cooped up with their small, immediate family to escape the evils around them, doesn't mean that being raised alone, within a small family unit, in the middle of nowhere would change experiences--they're still socially isolated. At this point, I felt as if Morris's claims were getting less and less defensable.Morris returns to form with his chapter on stimuli. Like animals in zoos, people in cities generally lack for stimuli (or are occasionally overstimulated). Whereas humans used to have to eak out an existence hunting and gathering just enough to eat, now most of their needs are supplied in a relatively short period of time. The excess time leftover leads to boredom and a need to find other means of stimulation. Ways to find such stimulation include (1) making problems to solve where there were none, (2) overreacting to mundane tasks, (3) creating new things to do, (4) making much out of less stimulating activities, and (5) magnifying selected items. For those who are overstimulated, they can blot out incoming sensations. An example of the latter might be taking certain kinds of drugs or sleeping excessively. Examples of the other strategies include crime and adultery (1); overeating and gossip (2); playing games, looking at and making artwork, listening to and making music, writing and reading books (3); masturbation (4); and new fashions that emphasize different sexual parts of the body (5). Number 2 actually seems a good result of city life to me. Morris's contention with regard to fashion, which seems something of a detour, though intriguing, is that women's fashion focuses on exaggerating a rotating selection of errogenous zones; men's fashion, by contrast, among modernists, has tended to emphasize how leisurely a person is (thus, we borrow our clothes from various sports--and as those become commonplace, we find another sport to borrow from). While Morris's arguments here seem to make somewhat more sense, he doesn't always keep his examples to the city, which belies his point. Ironically, for instance, one of the examples he gives of making much of less-than-normal stimulation is nothing a city person would have opportunity nor, in most cases, temptation or desire to participate in: bestiality. Such an example rather makes his larger point seem more tendentious, for if country living leads to such actions, then the issue is not lack of stimulus caused by the city. Rather, the issue becomes one of modern life and living, but here too the argument might not be so strong, for a lack of leisure time does not necessarily equate to a lack of depravity. Busy people tend not to do as many bad things out of boredom, but people with fewer resources still have drives to fulfill that might lead them to steal or do other things frowned upon by larger society. The issue than is not city or country, but the degree to which a society maintains social control. A close tribe or family will exert more pressure on an individual's lifestyle than will a society (or lack thereof) that allows for more individual freedom of choice. But that, of course, is the tradeoff, for both individualism and groupthink come with their own advantages and disadvantages.In Morris's final chapter, he turns to education and issues attendant with it. He notes that people tend to be most innovative out of two needs: (1) panic or scarcity; and (2) security. In the former, troubles become so overwhelming that people are motivated to find new ways to do something. In the latter, people are so provided for that they find new things to do out of a desire to fill time and to explore. It's the middle ground that tends to lack for innovation--where people are eeking out a living but are neither secure enough to explore nor so poor as to have to explore. Most of human existence fit in this middle ground, but modern man fits in the latter. That need to explore, to be curious, is taken up by childlike adults, who do odd things either because they rebel against constraints set on them as kids or because they continue in the curious lifestyle their parents afforded them as kids. Elders in supertribes tend to want to squash innovation, but instead they should encourage it. In a sense then, Morris ends his discussion on the human zoo with a call for, not a return to hunting and gathering, but for more urbanization, more change, more moves away from our evolutionary beginnings."

And I just don't enjoy it. There are hardly any citations considering this is purported to be non-fiction, and I don't think that it should be read as such. I'm also mad that I had to entirely re-read this book looking for information for my final, because there is no index or easy way to navigate it other than slogging through his philosophy. I don't know. There are so many other books out there you could read. *2.5 stars*I mean, here's the thing. This book was written in 1969. All of the sources that it cites in the back of the book are (obviously) even older. I thought that Desmond Morris's theories were really interesting, but I also thought that that was all they were - theories. I do think that there's value in reading people's points of view and doing what we can to understand the world and each other better. Morris's view that we live in an urban zoo was one that I had never heard of before, and at the most basic level I agree with some of it. The underlying sexism and homophobia throughout it, though, make it an uncomfortable read and hard to take too seriously. Which is, again, fine (mostly, although obviously this views are not great). The main issue I had is that I had to read this book as if it was a textbook, nearly fifty years after it was published. That's not really the book's fault, but it did emphasize the fact for me that this really shouldn't be information that you have test questions on. If you're interested in his perspective, sure. But I don't think it's a must-read, and you can probably find more modern and less offensive viewpoints which ring similarly. It was also slightly boring, lol, although the zoo anecdotes did spice things up every once and a while. I don't recommend? But live your life?"

Unfortunately, I could not get my hands on the former and I had to get myself acquainted with Morris by reading the latter, which I was lucky to find. Inasmuch as I can understand, the animal behavior is employed as a kind of looking glass to examine the human behaviour. In this fashion, the human society is examined and shown to be like the zoo, where animals are living in unnatural habitat. The crux of Morris argumentation lies in his premise that human species are not biologically ready to live in a giant metropolis. Despite the critics, I believe the book is readable and if is not completely sceintific, at least gives us a new lens to look differently at life matters."

Desmond Morris (Author) 272 Pages. 1969.An older book off of my âTo Read Pileâ This book operates from a hypothesis that we modern humans are essentially the same biologically and evolutionary wise as those hunter gathers making the transition to civilization (defined as agriculture) that actions and reactions to stimuli evolved for survival in small groups of hunter gatherers and we are living in conditions that our evolutionary make-up has not caught up to. To explain â¦ there is an innate difference between intelligence and education. An Amazonian tribesman is equally as intelligent as say a citizen of Manhattan, NYC but their education is predicated on survival in their environment and vice versa. Aside from their intelligence is their biological (evolutionary) make-up and instincts â¦ these are also equal and better suited to the Amazonian life than the urban jungles of NYC. There is also the notion of group cooperation vs dominance. The author contends that cooperation exist in smaller groups as the norm to moving forward but once the group size rises issues of dominance become the norm and that elements of this can be seen in large urban areas with the proliferation of small groups giving more opportunities for dominance than in a singular large entity. There is some discussion on this theme in the book regarding concepts of religious salvation â¦ the group (much the norm) vs the individual (largely Christian and Muslim in concept) â¦ it is a very interesting topic and an excellent book over all. "
25,0099482118,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5919166-lester,2,"A very interesting read. Mr Morris basis almost all of his theory (or at least did at the time - I read the original 1969 version) on his observations as a zoologist. Nevertheless, the extrapolation of his observations, including parallels to the animal world, rang true to me where most of his theories regarding our unsuitability for living in a 'super-tribe' go. Back in 1969, he was able to show that we are not suited to living in large cities, and many of our social problems stem from our original genetic destiny. What is good is that he does not judge this, he merely points out the challenges. However, I did draw the line on some of the theories, as they seemed to be more a case of choosing the facts to fit predjudices. His 'imprinting'-based explanation for homosexuality, though compelling, rang false for me. I also found that some of the text went on for too long, and partly rambled, hence the two stars. However, I cannot deny that Mr Morris caught the scent of a good idea back in the 60's, and this book does put an interesting perspective on the challenges and issues we face today."
26,0099482118,http://goodreads.com/user/show/54898322-michael,4,"I was one of those kids who frequently requested trips to the zoo. I was fascinated with the primate house and anything related. On one particular visits I heard visitors screeching and scrambling away from view of the chimpanzee exhibit. As I moved closer I discovered that the commotion was triggered by several of the chimps who where defecating in their hand and tossing the contents at the glass enclosure. According to our author, this type of behavior is the result of living in close proximity and unnaturally. Written in 1969, Zoo curator Desmond Morris details how humans placed in close proximity develop atypical and perverse behaviors. While dated, there is evidence that Morrisâs findings are still relevant 40 years later"

After reading this, I am not surprised that mental problems are so prevalent in our society. We just can't help it - it's not natural. Moreover, it makes me scared for the future where everything is even more global, there are even more people both in our physical lives and on the other side of our computer connections... Information and social life overload is crazy."

I managed to read 65% of the book and gave up. I think that it is interesting if you want to deep dive into anthropology and how it has evolved over the past 30 years.

29,0099482118,http://goodreads.com/user/show/38722193-l,1,"Interesting read, but unfortunately does not hold up well scientifically. Morris does not explain how and why humans are comparable to animals; nor does he explain to what extent they are comparable, if they are comparable. While there are many statements of facts throughout the book, Morris fails to explain why they are relevant and what scientific evidence there is to explain that relevance (correlation =/= causation).

The Human Zoo matches that book in terms of its inter-disciplinary scope and the range of ideas that are contained within it. Morris' ability to write confidently and easily across a range of genres makes him an entertaining non-fiction writer.Many of the questions posed in this book are still relevant today, but it's probably fair to say that the ideas contained within it have not aged as well. It's difficult to deal with many of Morris' conclusions in the context of current global trends. Furthermore, while the Naked Ape raised some interesting questions about human biology and the value of understanding it and not ignoring it, the analogy between life in cities and zoo animals is more difficult to establish. In places, Morris completely ignores the comparisons altogether and at other times there is a serious stretch to compare the behaviour of zoo animals and city dwelling people.

Because in spite of his sometimes infuriating comparisons, there are still a lot of brilliant insights which helps you understand the society you live in so much better. Like why some people rather be bribed with sex than money was something I did not understand until now. Or why racism is still so prevalent in spite of the progress we have made.

The zoo world, like a gigantic parent, protects its inmates- food, drink , shelter, hygiene and medical care are provided and the basic survival problems are limited to a minimum. Although the conclusions that he draws at times seem far-fetched and unsupported by the thin evidence he offers, on the whole, this book is an extremely fascinating and insightful read."

The Human Zoo matches that book in terms of its inter-disciplinary scope and the range of ideas that are contained within it. Morris' ability to write confidently and easily across a range of genres makes him an entertaining non-fiction writer.Many of the questions posed in this book are still relevant today, but it's probably fair to say that the ideas contained within it have not aged as well. It's difficult to deal with many of Morris' conclusions in the context of current global trends. Furthermore, while the Naked Ape raised some interesting questions about human biology and the value of understanding it and not ignoring it, the analogy between life in cities and zoo animals is more difficult to establish. In places, Morris completely ignores the comparisons altogether and at other times there is a serious stretch to compare the behaviour of zoo animals and city dwelling people. Still an entertaining and quick read, but the most telling insights have passed their sell-by-date."

Because in spite of his sometimes infuriating comparisons, there are still a lot of brilliant insights which helps you understand the society you live in so much better. Like why some people rather be bribed with sex than money was something I did not understand until now. Or why racism is still so prevalent in spite of the progress we have made.

Although the conclusions that he draws at times seem far-fetched and unsupported by the thin evidence he offers, on the whole, this book is an extremely fascinating and insightful read."

The Human Zoo matches that book in terms of its inter-disciplinary scope and the range of ideas that are contained within it. Morris' ability to write confidently and easily across a range of genres makes him an entertaining non-fiction writer.Many of the questions posed in this book are still relevant today, but it's probably fair to say that the ideas contained within it have not aged as well. It's difficult to deal with many of Morris' conclusions in the context of current global trends. Furthermore, while the Naked Ape raised some interesting questions about human biology and the value of understanding it and not ignoring it, the analogy between life in cities and zoo animals is more difficult to establish. In places, Morris completely ignores the comparisons altogether and at other times there is a serious stretch to compare the behaviour of zoo animals and city dwelling people. Still an entertaining and quick read, but the most telling insights have passed their sell-by-date."

Because in spite of his sometimes infuriating comparisons, there are still a lot of brilliant insights which helps you understand the society you live in so much better. Like why some people rather be bribed with sex than money was something I did not understand until now. Or why racism is still so prevalent in spite of the progress we have made.
